=Episode 20=

23
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,340
(Qing Courtyard)

24
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,300
You asked me to provide a list of

25
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,940
participants of the Battle of Jingyang

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,370
who can now command the North Army.

27
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,930
Here is the list.

28
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,300
I've had a look at it.

29
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,780
A dozen of people fit the bill.

30
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,030
Mr. Kong, who is close to Hengyang,

31
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,090
is also among them.

32
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,940
(Kong Lingfeng)

33
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,780
He previously served as a strategist

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,810
in the North Army.

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,460
He had connections
with my family and Lingyu's.

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,010
After my father disappeared,

37
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,220
he was not favored for years

38
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,100
due to the Battle of Jingyang

39
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,060
until Prince Hengyang rose in the army.

40
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,770
Only then did he regain a high position.

41
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,730
If that's the case,

42
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,930
he's lived in the military camp
for ten years,

43
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,940
rarely leaving the camp.

44
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,050
Finding saltpeter mines in Nanyue,

45
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,500
and arranging their transport

46
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,290
must involve someone else

47
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,690
working from outside with him.

48
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,810
Among Nanyue officials,

49
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,410
there must be spies from Beichu.

50
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,460
Beichu spies...

51
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,500
By the way,
we received intel about Beichu.

52
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,230
A new emperor took the throne.

53
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,690
Internal unrest may arise in Beichu.

54
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,780
A Nanyue adept supported the ascension,

55
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,490
so he gained power,

56
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,250
and now rivals the old general Zhao Jie.

57
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,620
A Nanyue adept?

58
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,460
A storm is approaching.

59
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,900
(Chen Mansion)

60
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,290
(A token.)

61
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,620
(A Nanyue adept aided the Third Prince.)
The Third Prince took the throne.

62
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,620
Though it's unexpected,

63
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,100
it's quite reasonable.

64
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,340
The Third Prince is now the new emperor.

65
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,780
He should be addressed as His Majesty.

66
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,170
It's truly surprising

67
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,340
that the least favored Third Prince

68
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,460
has ascended the throne.

69
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,130
The secret letter mentioned
it was a Nanyue man

70
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,660
who aided the Third Prince.

71
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,900
He made up for the weakness

72
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,730
of the Third Prince's maternal clan

73
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,580
and helped stabilize the court.

74
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,850
The Third Prince is calculating,

75
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,340
good at using talent.

76
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,220
He understands the art of ruling.

77
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,850
It's no surprise
he could succeed to the throne.

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,210
I don't know

79
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,650
the identity of this extraordinary Nanyue man

80
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,140
who has accomplished great deeds.

81
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,690
Since he's gained the trust of His Majesty

82
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,700
as a man from Nanyue,

83
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,820
we must not underestimate him.

84
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,970
Drink, drink up!

85
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,250
Come! Let's drink!

86
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,530
(New Emperor of Beichu)
My loyal ministers, drink!

87
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,850
Come on, more drinks!

88
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,580
- To Your Majesty!
- To Your Majesty!

89
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,020
Fill the cups.

90
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,530
Let's drink together.

91
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,610
Greetings, Your Majesty.

92
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,340
Minister Fan.

93
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,340
Not bad, huh?

94
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,940
It seems the court attire of Beichu

95
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,220
suits you better

96
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,780
than that of Nanyue.

97
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,460
Your Majesty, you've ascended the throne.

98
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,100
I wonder about the promise made to me

99
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,410
that I'd lead the efforts against Nanyue,

100
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,100
when will it be fulfilled?

101
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,290
You've got the new skin,

102
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,290
yet still keen on Nanyue's bones.

103
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,610
Mr. Fan, you truly are loyal.

104
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,020
Minister Zhao, mind your manners.

105
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,700
Minister Fan brought the art of saltpeter

106
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,180
to help me ascend the throne.

107
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,820
He's a hero of Beichu.

108
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,780
Ministers, you should treat him
with respect.

109
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,460
Let's toast to Mr. Fan.

110
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,820
Your Majesty, you're right.

111
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,340
We, as generals, always speak bluntly,

112
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,530
unlike Mr. Fan's roundabout ways.

113
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,220
Plus, it's even harder for us

114
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,780
to trust someone from Nanyue.

115
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,610
Naturally, we can't speak well of him.

116
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,490
Mr. Fan,

117
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,780
forgive me.

118
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,910
I've done everything I can

119
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,490
to assist Your Majesty

120
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,730
and Beichu.

121
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,370
To Nanyue, I'm like an enemy.

122
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,610
Your Majesty has witnessed my skills,

123
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,660
and should trust my loyalty to Beichu.

124
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,610
In that case,

125
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,050
let it be as you wish.

126
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,820
However, there's one thing unclear to me.

127
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,490
Since you have defected from Nanyue,

128
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,290
why do you still hold on so tightly

129
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,970
to connections with Nanyue?

130
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,220
Because there's someone in Nanyue
I just can't forget.

131
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,460
(Xunmei House)

132
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,530
Xuechen, what brings you here today?

133
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,020
Why hasn't he arrived?

134
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,110
Why are you acting so strangely?

135
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,970
You seem restless.

136
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,170
Cheer up.

137
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,290
Smile, give me a smile.

138
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,780
They're here.

139
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,660
Miss Zhou.

140
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,450
Thank you, Your Highness,

141
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,960
for supervising the exam that day.

142
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,970
I've fulfilled my dream.

143
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,610
No need to thank me.

144
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,290
You're exceptionally talented.

145
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,650
As a prince,

146
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,290
I must retain talents for the people.

147
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,020
You two don't seem

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,220
very familiar with each other.

149
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,450
My family property will arrive tomorrow.

150
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,580
I have to offer incense to my parents

151
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,020
to let them know.

152
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,140
I'm heading back.

153
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,420
Lingyu, you're leaving so soon?

154
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,130
This is all I can do to help.

155
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,220
Take the initiative.

156
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,100
Don't waste the good food and wine.

157
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,770
I'll escort Lingyu back first.

158
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,890
Take your time eating.

159
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,340
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

160
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,650
Xuechen.

161
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,580
Xuechen.

162
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,300
Miss Zhou, please.

163
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,770
Please, Your Highness.

164
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,250
Try this dish.

165
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,100
Your Highness, try this.

166
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,220
We've known each other long.

167
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,420
We've always treated
each other with respect,

168
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,580
but if you still call me "Your Highness",

169
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,890
isn't that a bit too formal?

170
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,740
I...

171
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,700
You can call me Aman

172
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,970
like Xuechen does.

173
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,180
Is that alright?

174
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,340
Then I toast to you, Aman.

175
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,940
Yangling.

176
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,890
About that thing before we met...

177
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,610
Do you mean... the engagement?

178
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,340
Rest assured,

179
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,100
since you've sent a letter,

180
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,490
telling my father to annul it,

181
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,130
I'll act as if it never happened.

182
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,580
Sir, you ripped the poster off.
Do you know this person?

183
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,340
Did she go that way?

184
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,580
She is in Yuezhou.

185
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,730
Sorry, sorry.

186
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,300
Thank you, sir.

187
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,940
- It's you.
- It's you.

188
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,460
Even loyal officials
face their limits someday.

189
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,250
You are all scholars
for the Imperial Examinations.

190
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,700
One day, you will achieve fame in the exams.

191
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,850
Naturally, you must then
serve the people and the nation.

192
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,940
Food is paramount to the people.

193
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,410
Only by learning the grains

194
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,730
and cherishing them,

195
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,530
can we truly serve the people,

196
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,970
and meet their expectations.

197
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,060
Your insight is quite interesting.

198
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,540
You speak the truth.

199
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,100
Chives are noble and upright,

200
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,540
and should be praised.

201
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,060
Aman,

202
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,650
how's it going?

203
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,100
Xuechen,

204
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,220
have a drink with me.

205
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,780
Today, I feel

206
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,020
a strange vibe between you two.

207
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,260
Is it about the broken engagement?

208
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,820
I proposed to her hastily back then

209
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,540
without asking for her opinion.

210
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,260
It's only fair she holds a grudge.

211
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,800
Are you really content?

212
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,020
I initially thought

213
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,900
since I already had someone I liked,

214
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,580
I should be devoted to her,

215
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,660
and not detain others.

216
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,460
But when I found out

217
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,580
the one I liked
happened to be my betrothed.

218
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,420
I did have some regrets.

219
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,420
Everyone has

220
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
personal feelings.

221
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,220
We're not a saint or a sage.

222
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,340
But you still offered
to break off the engagement

223
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,900
to give her freedom.

224
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,620
No matter what,

225
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,140
I didn't want her to be bound by this.

226
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,060
Whether she's Zibo or

227
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,060
Yangling,

228
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,060
she should be free.

229
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,500
I wonder what Miss Zhou thinks

230
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,340
about breaking off the engagement.

231
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,260
Maybe what you want to give
isn't what she wants.

232
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,020
I'm the one who fled the marriage.

233
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,180
Then why do I feel so lost?

234
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,860
(Flowers Compete in Beauty)

235
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,420
(Honorable Father Luo and Mother Li, R.I.P.)

236
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,460
Sister,

237
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,100
you made a new spirit tablet
for our parents.

238
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,180
Do you think

239
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,580
they can hear us?

240
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,980
Sincerity moves the spirits.

241
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,900
We're related through blood.

242
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,740
Father and Mother will surely hear us.

243
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,180
Father, Mother,

244
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,780
I'm your daughter, Lingyu.

245
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,660
I've won the title of Flower Goddess.

246
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,220
Tomorrow, I'll reclaim

247
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,900
the family property as you long wished.

248
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,520
I'll bring glory to our family,

249
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,860
and live up to your expectations.

250
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,700
Over the past 10 years,
I haven't slacked off.

251
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,700
Your wish will be fulfilled.

252
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,740
Revive the Luo Clan.

253
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,100
Maintain the household.

254
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,660
Spread the family motto.

255
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,380
Be strong for life.

256
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,900
Hearing you read out

257
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,220
the family motto is always inspiring.

258
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,460
The family motto

259
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,500
embodies the ancestors' earnest hopes

260
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,740
and prayers for generations of the Luos.

261
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,260
I must never forget it.

262
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,500
I swear, I will never forget.

263
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,220
Let's tidy up

264
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,980
and rest early today.

265
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,300
Tomorrow, we'll reclaim
the family property at our best form.

268
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,100
Soon, very soon.

269
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,420
It's coming.

270
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,260
The ancestral property
of the Luo Clan has arrived.

271
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,740
Miss Luo, please claim it.

272
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,780
Yes.

273
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:17,060
(Yuezhou Office)

274
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,580
Miss Luo, stop looking.

275
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,260
This is your family property.

276
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,860
Is that...

277
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,060
all?

278
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,500
You need not worry, sir.

279
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,540
I hired carriages and guards.

280
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,860
Everything can be transported home
in one trip.

281
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,700
I have verified it multiple times.

282
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,860
This is all we have.

283
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,780
Nothing else.

284
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,980
My Lady,

285
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,980
perhaps my lord and madam
left a big check.

286
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,940
I suppose they must.

287
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,140
They were truly wise.

288
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,380
Thank you, sir.

289
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,660
Miss, hold on.

290
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,720
According to the rules,

291
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,340
you must open it here for inspection.

292
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,980
If anything is missing,

293
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,100
please report it promptly

294
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,620
to prevent any further trouble.

295
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,740
Yes.

296
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,340
Come on.

297
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,220
This...

298
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,620
Anything else?

299
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,540
No more.

300
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,620
No more.

301
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,060
No more.

302
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,100
I think

303
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,540
my father and mother

304
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,340
must hide the property

305
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,220
within this scroll.

306
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,260
Let's open it.

307
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,180
Take a look.

309
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,380

- My Lady.
- Sister.

311
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,900
Compared to gold, silver, or title deeds,

312
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,420
this scroll

313
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,940
is the true spiritual treasure
of the Luo Clan.

314
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,180
The family motto of our clan...

315
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,020
"Be Strong for Life".

316

"Be strong for life".

Wonderful, truly wonderful.

319
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,820
Wonderful!

320
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,780
Amazing.

321
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,940
Absolutely fantastic!

Our ancestral property!

326
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,220
Miss Hua, don't be sad.

327
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,940
My 500,000 taels of gold...

328
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,300
This could restore our Luo Clan's honor.

329

500,000 taels of gold.

330

332
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,580
There's something on the scroll.

333
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,420
Look.

334
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,220
The scroll

335
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,380
only reveals something when wet.

336
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,580
Quick, Lingxi, let's cry more.

337
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,740
Spread the tears evenly.

This is a map of Jingyang's surroundings.

346
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,980
This is a treasure map.

347
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,380
Father didn't want our property

348
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,020
to be coveted by outsiders.

349
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,740
That's why he used such a method.

350
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,460
Wonderful!

351
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,540
I knew Father wouldn't deceive us.

352
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,900
These two red spots on the map

353
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,900
show where the family property is hidden.

354

My Lady,

355
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,820
isn't Jingyang already taken by Beichu?

356
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,700
Yes.

357
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,620
Jingyang

358
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,660
has been occupied by Beichu for ten years.

359
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,340
It's just wishful thinking.

360
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,860
(Xuewu Courtyard)

361
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,980
(Flowers Compete in Beauty)

362
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,220
Jingyang will be reclaimed one day.

363
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,860
I'll wait for it.

364
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,100
How long will that take?

365
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,460
Until my hair turns gray?

366
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,660
Even if we reclaim the family property,

367
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,140
I might not live to enjoy it.

368
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,620
Why are you sitting here alone?

369
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,420
Why are you here?

370
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,660
I was worried someone might cry in secret.

371
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,860
This is...

372
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,340
Though it can't match
500,000 taels of gold,

373
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,200
it's enough for you to spend for a while.

374
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,740
If you need money,

375
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,420
just ask Jinchuan for it.

376
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,060
What do you mean by this?

377
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,980
Is it about the money?

378
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,460
I just feel that what I've gained now

379
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,620
differs from

380
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,540
what I've long awaited.

381
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,460
As I have said,

382
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,780
in the future, I won't rely on others.

383
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,980
I will reclaim the property myself.

384
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,860
Even without ancestral property,

385
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,220
haven't I managed all these years?

386
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,380
Instead of giving me money,

387
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,900
why not lend me
some military strategy books?

388
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,020
Military strategy?

389
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,700
What is it for?

390
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,940
Starting today,

391
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,340
I will study military strategies hard,

392
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,020
and personally take back Jingyang.

393
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,300
Let the family treasure return to me soon.

394
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,660
One must always look forward.

395
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,780
I, Luo Lingyu,

396
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,940
will never halt due to temporary setbacks.

397
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,380
I won't forget what I want.

398
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,780
This is the Luo Lingyu I know.

399
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,420
By the way,
do you understand military strategy?

400
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,500
I know a bit.

401
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,020
Take a look at it for me.

402
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,900
(Yi Pass, Qianya Pass, Mount Qian'ai)

403
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,820
(Qianya Pass, Mount Qian'ai)

404
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,460
(Baiwen Pass)

405
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,220
This is not a treasure map.

406
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,440
It's of great importance.

407
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,420
Tomorrow, I'll visit Prince Hengyang.

408
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,760
Go find Miss Zhou and the others.

409
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,820
Let's meet at Xunmei House.

410
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,780
Alright.

411
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,020
I've never really understood.

412
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,380
You suspect the North Army.

413
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,900
Why still involve me in your plan?

414
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,380
Don't you suspect me too?

415
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,780
Yes. I do suspect

416
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,300
you want to gain power by colliding

417
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,460
with the Fan Family.

418
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,820
But I never think

419
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,540
you would harm Nanyue.

420
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,660
Then why are they targeting you?

421
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,540
I've been investigating my father's case.

422
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,540
Recently, there was progress.

423
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,100
They wanted to silence us.

424
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,460
Is there progress?

425
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,260
Ten years ago,

426
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,820
my father did not abandon the city.

427
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,380
Instead, he discovered two spies

428
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,540
had infiltrated in the North Army.

429
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,900
Thus, they ambushed him at Yi Pass,

430
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,900
and he lost his life.

431
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,660
This is the secret letter.

432
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,060
It is enough
to prove my father's innocence.

433
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,140
I knew it.

434
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,180
I always believed
General Lu was no traitor.

435
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,660
All these years,

436
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,140
I've been secretly investigating
in the army.

437
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,980
But every time I found a lead,

438
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,820
the trail seemed to go cold again.

439
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,980
You believe in my father.

440
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,650
Then ten years ago, why did you say

441
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,220
"He colluded with the enemy,

442
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,100
but I'm not that kind of loser"?

443
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,060
I was very young then.

444
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,300
Father repeatedly forbade the princes

445
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,620
from discussing it.

446
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,220
I racked my brains,

447
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,620
and could only think of
comforting you this way.

448
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,660
But you...

449
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,700
That's why you distanced from me.

450
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,100
It happened ten years ago.

451
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,380
Never mind.

452
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,780
But in the end,

453
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,100
we still grew distant.

454
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,740
What happened back then

455
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
was my fault.

456
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,020
I will thoroughly investigate it now

457
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,920
to clear General Lu's name.

458
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,620
Thank you.

459
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,920
But don't misunderstand my intentions.

460
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,300
I acted along with you yesterday

461
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,980
not because of you.

462
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,220
I was showing respect for Miss Luo.

463
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,020
So if you ever mistreat her,

464
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,860
I won't let you off easily.

465
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,350
Not again, we just talked about...

466
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,380
It's been ten years.

467
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,020
Can't you act mature for once?

468
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,340
Here they come.

469
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,060
Everyone's gathered.

470
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,420
This lady with Changyi

471
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,520
looks very familiar.

472
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,860
The one who deceived me

473
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,740
with Xuechen that day...

474
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,220
You're his sister!

475
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,860
Your Highnesses truly are brothers.

476
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,140
I am Zhou Yangling.

477
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,340
Now that everyone is here,

478
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,940
let's get down to business.

479
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,700
This is the map of Jingyang.

480
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,500
There's nothing unusual about it.

481
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,100
(Baiwen Pass)
The stamps

482
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,980
are what I gave my father as a child.

483
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,540
My father always kept it
as his private seal.

484
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,980
I would never mistake it.

485
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,740
This map once belonged to my father.

486
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,020
But why did this map

487
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,980
end up with Prefect Luo?

488
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,780
Perhaps General Lu

489
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,460
sensed spies within the army,

490
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,420
and entrusted the map to Prefect Luo.

491
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,220
When I got the scroll yesterday,

492
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,640
there was a piece of paper attached.

493
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,380
It was the family motto
written by my father.

494
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,260
I suppose after my father
received the scroll,

495
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,820
he was worried about Jingyang,

496
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,340
so he wrote the family motto
to divert attention.

497
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,700
Think about it.

498
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,820
The map might hide clues
about the spies.

499
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,140
Since my father already identified

500
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,100
the two spies in the North Army,

501
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,540
he would try to send out the information.

502
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,580
Only two passes

503
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,460
(Qianya Pass, Baiwen Pass)
are marked,

504
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,100
and Prefect Luo kept it
as ancestral property.

505
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,100
This implies that the stamped locations

506
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,260
indicate the spies' guarded areas.

507
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,460
(Baiwen Pass)

508
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,620
The commander back then was...

509
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,260
It's impossible.

510
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,260
It's Mr. Kong.

511
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,940
To me, Mr. Kong is my mentor

512
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,860
and my friend.

513
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,140
He has watched me grow up,

514
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,820
and saved me from danger many times.

515
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,060
If he were truly a spy from Beichu,

516
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,660
how would I still be alive standing here?

517
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,420
His Highness has a valid point.

518
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,020
But Mr. Kong's timely appearances every time

519
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,380
are indeed quite suspicious.

520
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,140
Some time ago,

521
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,780
we suspected the spy in the North Army

522
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,700
might be the one targeting Wang Chongming.

523
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,900
We've listed

524
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,100
all the suspects,

525
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,300
and compared them closely.

526
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,620
Mr. Kong is among them.

527
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,060
(Kong Lingfeng)

528
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,540
Only his defense of the city was stamped.

529
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,720
In recent years, Mr. Kong

530
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,460
has always been by your side.

531
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,980
He never accepted any promotions.

532
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,100
Other soldiers of the same period

533
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,340
might have been promoted to generals by now.

534
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,460
The secret letter mentioned "we".

535
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,420
So if one is Mr. Kong,

536
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,300
then who is the other assisting him?

537
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,380
Who could that be?

538
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,580
(Qianya Pass)
Qianya Pass.

539
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,460
The commander back then...

540
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,980
Commander Chen Hao.

541
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,260
Minister Chen.

542
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,340
In that case,

543
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,620
when Miss Chen visited Lu Yun,

544
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
her behavior was odd,

545
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,060
unlike her usual demeanor.

546
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,780
I just wanted to ask,

547
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,380
how did you get injured so badly?

548
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,300
Did you upset someone?

549
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,060
What do you mean, Miss Chen?

550
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,820
It's nothing.

551
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,380
These two have been lurking in Nanyue
for years.

552
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,180
Now they're in high positions,

553
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,180
they act with caution.

554
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,420
Catching evidence against them

555
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,920
might require some effort.

556
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,940
Mr. Kong is very meticulous,

557
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,260
making it hard to notice clues.

558
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,780
Besides, I don't want to suspect him.

559
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,500
Your Highness,
if you truly trust Mr. Kong,

560
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,700
we shouldn't stop investigating.

561
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Only then can we truly clear his name.

562
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,820
Indeed. Beichu spies
have plotted for years.

563
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,580
They aim to start a war

564
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,380
to seize territories.

565
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,940
But once the war begins,

566
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,900
the common folk bear the brunt.

567
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,660
To prevent a repeat of past tragedies,

568
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,700
to honor the fallen warriors' spirits,

569
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,820
to eliminate suffering from division,

570
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,100
to bring peace

571
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,540
and harmony.

572
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,100
(Prince Hengyang's Mansion)

573
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,380
Your Highness.

574
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,060
Mr. Kong.

575
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,580
Why are you in a bad mood today?

576
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,360
Your Highness, did you go out

577
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,620
with Miss Luo today?

578
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,510
Mr. Kong,

579
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,620
why do you ask?

580
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,620
Nothing.

581
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,120
These days,

582
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,980
I haven't heard you mention Miss Luo,

583
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,270
even when Miss Luo
went to the authorities

584
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,620
to move the family property,

585
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,820
you didn't go with her.

586
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,060
I was wondering

587
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,780
if you had a misunderstanding with her.

588
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,220
What misunderstanding
could I have with her?

589
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,580
I was just drinking
with some rowdy companions,

590
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,460
so I didn't take her along.

591
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,340
It's good

592
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,540
that nothing happened.

593
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,180
If there is any misunderstanding
between you two,

594
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,820
you need to talk it out.

595
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,820
You shouldn't let minor issues

596
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,780
affect your relationship.

597
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,820
Logically speaking,

598
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,900
you two should be in
the most affectionate period.

599
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,420
Of course.

600
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,660
Mr. Kong,

601
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,460
you've had an old illness for years.

602
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,260
It's still not healed yet.

603
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,240
I've already instructed someone

604
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,220
to prepare your medicine daily.

605
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,260
Take your medicine and rest a bit.

606
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

607
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,900
Mr. Kong.

608
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,540
Is it truly you?

609
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,980
(Lu Mansion)

610
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:55,980
(Time Slips Away)

611
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,420
Today, Prince Hengyang
invited me to his mansion.

612
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,460
Why keep visiting there?

613
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,340
Is he misusing his power?

614
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,980
It's for collaborating with His Highness

615
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,140
to investigate Mr. Kong
without alerting him.

616
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,260
You know this already.

617
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,540
Why are you getting jealous?

618
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,620
I don't care.

619
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,660
Anyway,

620
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,420
I've sent people to watch Minister Chen.

621
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,540
I'll go meet him shortly.

622
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,140
Third Young Master.

623
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,940
What a coincidence.

624
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,780
(Oh no, so many people are here.)

625
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,980
Please maintain your distance.

626
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,280
People seek higher places,

627
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,340
while water flows down.

628
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,660
Please stop entangling with me.

629
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,060
Miss Luo, you marry above your station.

630
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,240
How dare a small fop like me bother you.

631
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,260
But the higher you get,
the harder the fall.

632
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,820
Miss Luo, be careful.

633
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,180
- Did they argue?
- No idea.

634
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,900
Not sure anymore.

635
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,460
In a moment...

636
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,460
I've finally managed to

637
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,460
see you and Miss Luo connect.

638
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,900
When will you have

639
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,460
a story-like sweet ending with her?

640
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,180
Why are you more anxious than me?

641
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,900
I just see you enjoying it.

642
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,500
As long as I'm with Lingyu,

643
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,580
I'm happy no matter what we do.

644
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,780
(I'll keep you in my heart.)

645
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,820
(Stop laughing.)

646
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,900
(If you keep laughing,
someone might see.)

647
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,740
My Lady, what are you looking at?

648
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,620
Lingxi, do you remember
when I was new here,

649
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,140
and blocked Young Master Yun every day?

650
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,220
Was I really that...

651
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,340
Hasty, impatient,

652
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,380
anxious, and worried.

653
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,500
Were I being too eager?

654
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,340
Impossible.

655
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,700
(Lu Mansion)

656
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,540
(Qianya Pass)

657
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,340
(Baiwen Pass)

658
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,780
Your Highness,

659
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,940
deceptive acts

660
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,700
leave anyone at a loss,

661
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,300
especially someone as loyal as you.

662
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,260
I just hope it's not him.

663
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,540
As long as we follow the original plan,

664
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,540
and find the spy hidden in the North Army,

665
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,340
the innocent will be proven innocent.

666
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,020
I understand.

667
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,180
Lingxi, why are you here?

668
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,860
I came with my lady.

669
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,900
Miss Luo.

670
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,820
I arranged to meet His Highness here today.

671
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,660
Sorry to disturb you.

672
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,780
Not at all.

673
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,380
Your Highness,
since you invited Miss Luo,

674
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,860
why suddenly discuss military affairs?

675
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,380
Isn't this letting down Miss Luo?

676
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,700
If you are truly too idle,

677
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,620
go clean the Training Ground.

678
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,140
I'm not, really.

679
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,020
Military affairs are more important.

680
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,180
I'll go check the courtyard.

681
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,700
I haven't had the chance yet

682
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,180
to have a look at your mansion.

683
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,260
As His Highness mentioned,

684
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,780
this is where Mr. Kong resides.

685
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,860
Lingxi, keep an eye out for me.

686
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,740
My Lady, you must be exhausted.

687
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,060
You haven't rested well these days.

688
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,780
Let me give you a massage.

689
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,100
Who is this?

690
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,380
Drunk in broad daylight,
blocking the road.

691
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,780
Do you know who's in the carriage?

692
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,780
This gentleman here,

693
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,100
I drank a bit too much.

694
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,340
Apologies, I didn't notice.

695
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,420
