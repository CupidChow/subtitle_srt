1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,044
-Yes, totally!
-Here's to Jae-min and LaLa Land.

2
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,755
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

3
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,234
What are you thinking about?

4
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,988
I just miss my dad.

5
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,412
I randomly thought of him
during the competition earlier.

6
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,543
I cried on stage
at my first competition just like Jae-min.

7
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,297
I got so nervous
that I forgot all the notes.

8
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,383
Do, do, sol, sol, la, la, sol

9
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,553
I played the beginning, and that was it.

10
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,641
I was so upset that I started bawling.

11
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,685
At that moment, my dad

12
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,688
got up and started applauding.

13
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,023
He said I did great.

14
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,193
Your father was such a wonderful man.

15
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:33,903
Yes.

16
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,324
And I loved him more
than anyone in the world.

17
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,035
Jun.

18
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,832
I feel like I discovered
a whole new me after moving here.

19
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,294
I'm like…

20
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,171
a resilient weed.

21
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,549
Definitely not a flower in a greenhouse.

22
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:04,350
Maybe I am who I am
thanks to my dad's applause that day.

23
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,645
Yes, I agree.

24
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,192
But I never even got to say
"I love you" to my dad.

25
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,988
That was my last call with my dad,
on my wedding day.

26
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,573
Dad.

27
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,242
Ra-ra. I love you very much.

28
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,871
Come on, Dad. Now's not the time for that.

29
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:25,955
Just hurry up.

30
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,126
I should've said "I love you" back.

31
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,296
I regret it so much.

32
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:38,176
But you always think about him.

33
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,970
I'm sure your dad knows
how much you love him.

34
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,864
We're both off tomorrow.

35
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,158
Shall we go on a ferry ride?

36
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,286
-The ferry to Jeju Island?
-Yes.

37
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,163
I have something to say.

38
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,208
Now,

39
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,795
I want to tell you my story.

40
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:15,964
All of it.

41
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,096
Gosh, this is so annoying.
Why do they look so cute together?

42
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,057
Hey, just leave them be.

43
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,059
Did you grab me by the scruff of my neck?

44
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,646
Are you showing off how tall you are?
You look like a beanstalk!

45
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,939
Shall I do it to you?

46
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,691
-I'm short, but I can do it.
-Stop.

47
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,151
Don't stand on your toes! Oh, you didn't.

48
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,448
About Jun…
There's something odd about him.

49
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,117
What do you mean?

50
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,370
He said he has a huge secret.

51
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,290
"A huge secret"? What kind of secret?

52
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,250
I have an idea of what it could be.

53
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,043
And?

54
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,423
Nothing. Never mind.

55
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,592
Come on. Just tell me.

56
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,470
-I'm more curious now.
-Forget it. It's better not to know.

57
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,889
What is it?
What is his secret? What is it?

58
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,058
-I…
-Gosh, you scared us.

59
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,060
-I know.
-My gosh.

60
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,563
Do you want to know
who Sunwoo Jun really is?

61
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,607
-Yes.
-Who is he?

62
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,029
A ghost.

63
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,288
-Is something wrong with him?
-Is he really ill?

64
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,582
I saw him chugging down some pills.

65
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,125
Meet me here tomorrow.

66
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:37,962
Okay.

67
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,714
Jun.

68
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,968
To tell you the truth,
I've been curious about you.

69
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:49,640
EPISODE 10

70
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,268
Your makeup looks awful. Come here.

71
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,856
Oh, just a second.

72
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,150
Hello?

73
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,986
Now? Okay, I'll be right there.

74
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,529
I need to move my car.

75
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,991
Thank you. I left my phone in my car.

76
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,090
Where did she go?

77
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,260
I should move my car first.

78
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,630
JIN HA-YEONG

79
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,051
-Hello?
-Dr. Cha, where are you now?

80
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,006
"An Jung-ho, Unit 203."

81
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:56,786
STUDENT ID CARD

82
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,664
This is…

83
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,791
I can't believe this.

84
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,762
GOOD&GOOD LIFE STYLE

85
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,347
"Good&Good."

86
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,143
From this moment,
Good&Good will make your lives prosperous.

87
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,068
GOOD&GOOD LIFE STYLE

88
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:29,986
This place…

89
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,281
It's that training center.

90
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,244
No way.

91
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,998
Sorry.

92
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:42,999
What the hell?

93
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,538
You're…

94
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,210
This is… Why are you doing this to me?

95
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,880
-What is this place?
-What do you think?

96
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,966
It's a very safe place.

97
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,971
Is anybody out there? Help.

98
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,474
Help! Anyone out there?

99
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,435
-Help!
-No, don't tire yourself out like this.

100
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,229
There's no one else here anyway.

101
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,786
What do you want from me?

102
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,832
Your attention

103
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,335
and love.

104
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,048
We are

105
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,217
meant to be together.

106
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,636
Don't you remember?

107
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,263
When we first met,

108
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,099
you said it was okay

109
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,643
and smiled at me.

110
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,231
When did I do that?

111
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,733
I don't remember.

112
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,777
What are you talking about?

113
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,238
You moved to Eunpo to see me.

114
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,330
And you dare to date someone else?

115
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,587
You wronged me,

116
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,257
so you should be punished.

117
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,764
Ra-ra!

118
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,516
Gu Ra-ra!

119
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,352
Damn it.

120
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,071
Ra-ra!

121
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,666
Ra-ra!

122
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,004
Ra-ra.

123
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,923
I told you to stay still.

124
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,144
Why won't you listen to me?

125
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,529
What are you doing, you bastard?

126
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,644
I thought you'd all gone home.

127
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,521
We heard about Ra-ra and ran here.

128
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,399
-You haven't found her?
-No.

129
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,862
Do you know
if Ra-ra has another male student

130
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,238
besides me and Jun?

131
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,949
Jae-min said it was a man.
Can you think of anyone?

132
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,621
Maybe it's Jung-ho?
An Jung-ho. Why do you ask?

133
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,292
He's the one who hurt Jae-min's arm.

134
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,294
Gosh, what?

135
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,005
Why do you think he did that?

136
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,175
Oh, I heard Ra-ra didn't accept
a flower basket he got for her,

137
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,304
and he threw it out right away.

138
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,265
Seung-gi's mom said
there was something very off about him.

139
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,976
So is he trying to get back at Ra-ra?

140
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,317
The dashcam footage.

141
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:07,156
My car was parked on the opposite side,
so there might be some footage.

142
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,577
Let's see. Please show us something.

143
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,413
Hey, stop! Ra-ra is right here.

144
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,958
What? What's that man doing?

145
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,586
-Wait, look! He kidnapped her!
-What? Kidnapped?

146
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,212
-Call the police now.
-Okay.

147
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,133
By the way, where is Jun right now?

148
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,859
-Mr. Kim.
-Hey, Jun.

149
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,569
Are you on your way here?

150
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,989
Don't be surprised.

151
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,660
It looks like An Jung-ho kidnapped Ra-ra.

152
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,162
I know.

153
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,206
Jun.

154
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,709
What's wrong?

155
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,670
What's the matter?

156
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,215
Mr. Kim.

157
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,300
Where are you? I'll come now.

158
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,094
I'll be right there,

159
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,596
so just tell me. Come on!

160
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,975
I think that man's dead.

161
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,143
What?

162
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,575
Jun.

163
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,704
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

164
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,706
We'll see you at the police station.

165
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,249
Guys, wrap it up carefully!

166
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,333
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

167
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,142
Are you all right?

168
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,811
Did you know about his situation too?

169
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:02,730
Yes.

170
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,441
Why on earth is this happening?

171
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,736
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION

172
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,542
Jun's not going to jail, is he?

173
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,753
Shut up. Are you crazy?

174
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,422
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

175
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,761
Your name.

176
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,390
Resident registration number.

177
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,728
Detective Min!

178
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,733
-Yes, sir.
-Go run his fingerprints.

179
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,735
Okay. Come with me.

180
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,158
Hey. Mister.

181
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,869
Let's go.

182
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,475
Gosh, I'm sure
I've seen his face somewhere.

183
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,684
Okay.

184
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,854
Sir! He's a runaway student.

185
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,689
-Right, that boy…
-What?

MARINE PARK UNIDENTIFIED BODY CASE

187
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,243
Sunwoo Jun, age 19.

188
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,327
CHO YUN-SIL

189
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,246
Where is my son?

190
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,998
Why is it
that you still haven't found him?

191
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,000
We found him!

192
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,545
-We found that woman's son!
-What?

193
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,464
The woman who gives us money
every time she comes here!

194
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,049
-The lady from Seoul?
-Yes!

195
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,801
-My gosh!
-We found him!

196

EUNPO YUNSEUL HOSPITAL

197
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,231
She'll be okay, right?

198
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,819
Yes. She only got a few abrasions.
She'll be okay.

199
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:19,324
But could you look after her
until she's stable?

200
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,368
Yes, of course.

201
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,495
By the way, what about that bastard?

202
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,455
His injury isn't as serious as I thought.

203
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,375
The surgery went well,
and he'll wake up soon.

204
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,211
Thank goodness.

205
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,088
Ra-ra is one thing,

206
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,425
but I was so worried about Jun
that I couldn't sleep.

207
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:40,637
I already let the police know,
so don't worry too much.

208
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,019
How's Ra-ra? Is she okay?

209
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,980
Yes, she's fine.

210
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,233
And I heard
that guy's injury wasn't life-threatening,

211
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,611
so you'll probably be released soon.

212
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:02,117
Jun, why don't you call your family?

213
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,705
I was up all night debating
whether or not I should call your mother.

214
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,123
No, don't.

215
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,170
Please give me a little more time.

00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,039
-Hello?
-Hello.

218
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,709
We met a little while ago.
This is Kim Man-bok.

219
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,795
Couldn't you have…

220
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,968
Couldn't you have called any sooner?

221
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,096
My gosh, I'm sorry.

222
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,432
We'll talk later.

223
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,692
Mr. Kim, who is that woman?

224
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,901
She's Jun's mother.

225
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,111
-What?
-What?

226
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,529
-Hey.
-Let's go.

227
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,573
Hello, ma'am.

228
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,952
My son, Jun… Where is he?

229
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,204
Please calm down and come with me.

230
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,212
Gosh, this is crazy.
Finding her runaway son like this.

231
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,840
Wait, officer. Did you say "runaway"?

232
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,926
-Are you here for your friend?
-No, he's older than us.

233
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,096
What? Hold on a second.

234
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,349
Sunwoo Jun.

235
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,852
Born in 2002, age 19.

236
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,687
What? Wait.

237
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,107
What do you mean Jun is 19?
You must've misread it.

238
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,025
Look.

239
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,988
Then…

240
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:07,326
He's a high school senior, just like us?

241
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,744
You didn't know?

242
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,748
-I can't believe this.
-Hey, are you okay?

243
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,082
Hey, what's wrong?

244
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,964
Mr. Kim, did you know about this?

245
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,341
Jun…

246
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,217
I mean, that punk is our age.

247
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,635
Yes.

248
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,805
Unbelievable.

249
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,058
Mr. Kim, you're awfully discreet.

250
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,310
I can't believe you two fooled all of us.

251
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,688
There's another person
that knows who Jun really is.

252
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,898
-What? Who?
-Who?

253
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,738
Sorry, Ms. Jin.

254
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,407
Ms. Jin.

255
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,118
My gosh.

256
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,081
Hello?

257
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,042
Gosh,

258
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,879
I was wide awake
up until five minutes ago,

259
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,090
but I guess I dozed off.

260
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,010
Chu Min-su just woke up.

261
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:08,970
Really?

262
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,039
Who are you?

263
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,500
I saved your life.

264
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:41,962
Why am I here?

265
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,964
Gosh, my head hurts.

266
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,550
I have to call her.

267
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,803
My phone. Give me my phone back.

268
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:54,141
Look, shouldn't you thank me first?

269
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,561
This is like saving a drowning man
and being asked to go find his bag!

270
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,187
Oh, my head.

271
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:03,608
Cut the nonsense.
Just give me my phone back!

272
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,694
Sorry, but who do you have to call?

273
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,863
Well…

274
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,122
What are you doing here?

275
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,586
You won't even look at me?

276
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,676
Does this situation make sense to you?

277
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:34,598
You're a high school senior!

278
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,144
It's okay.

279
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,229
Okay.

280
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,192
Let's get this sorted out quickly
and go back to Seoul.

281
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,903
-I don't want to.
-What?

282
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,740
-What do you mean?
-I don't want to go back home.

283
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,575
If I must be punished, I'll accept it.

284
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,744
I'll live my own life.

285
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,247
What can you even do here?
You're still a minor!

286
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,544
Thankfully,

287
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,466
your dad doesn't know anything.
He doesn't know you ran away.

288
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,760
If you come back now,

289
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,013
everything can go back to normal
as if nothing ever happened.

290
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,265
-So please--
-How could you do that?

291
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,852
Running away from home was

292
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,647
the loudest I could speak out against Dad.

293
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,608
So how… How could you hide it from him?

294
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,655
How dare you raise your voice here?

295
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:36,493
Mom, you can keep on worrying
about what others think.

296
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,162
I'll figure out what to do with my life.

297
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,458
Jun.

298
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,419
Jun.

299
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,089
Jin Ha-yeong. Hey.

300
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,425
-Gosh, where is her room?
-Wait.

301
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,721
Why wait?
Ra-ra needs to know as soon as possible.

302
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,849
Even if it makes her faint,
she needs to know about this.

303
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,519
Hey, seriously. Think about it.

304
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,438
Would you feel good to hear
a precious someone's secret

305
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,523
from someone else?

306
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,443
If you have a secret,
I'd want to hear it from you.

307
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,071
I wouldn't want to hear about it
from someone else.

308
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,534
So you're saying I'm precious to you?

309
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,830
Well, that wasn't my point.

310
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,375
Anyway,
we should give Jun a beating or two.

311
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,919
Why did he lie to you
that he was older than you?

312
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,256
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

313
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,100
My gosh.

314
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:44,728
Wait!

315
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,856
I guess you moved
into this place recently.

316
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,819
My mother owns Jin Beauty Salon
right next to your place.

317
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,113
I see.

318
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,950
Oh, and my name is Jin Ha-yeong.

319
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,745
Wait!

320
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,538
You're probably older than me,

321
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,583
but can I call you by name? Please?

322
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,721
I just assumed that he was older than me.

323
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,389
Why did I do that?

324
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,104
My gosh.

325
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:32,776
I'm telling you.
He's seriously so hot. Like crazy hot.

326
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,444
Gosh, you're at it again.

327
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,404
He's so freaking handsome.

328
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,491
I've said this numerous times.

329
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,993
You have such low standards.

330
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,203
Like, so low.

331
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,538
Hey, I've said this numerous times.

332
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,917
I have such high standards.
As high as satellites

333
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,627
in the sky! Like, so high.

334
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,212
Gosh, I can't even see them.

335
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,172
Do you understand or not?

336
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,383
-Do you agree or not?
-Okay, I heard you.

337
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,807
Hello?

338
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,519
Anybody here?

339
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,855
He's not here.

340
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,401
Where did he go?

341
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,492
-Who are you?
-Don't hurt me. I'm not a bad guy.

342
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,620
I'm an innocent high schooler.
Can you please let me go this once?

343
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,207
Thank you.

344
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,709
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,585
The door was open.

346
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,923
I'm Seung-gi, Ha-yeong's friend.
Ha-yeong from Jin Beauty Salon.

347
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,968
She said someone moved here,
so I was just curious.

348
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,220
Hey.

349
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,432
You're older, but can I call you by name?

350
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,399
He's handsome indeed.

351
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,861
I think I also assumed
that he was older than me.

352
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,529
Gosh, why did I think that?

353
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,449
What? Gosh, this is so annoying!

354
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,219
SUNWOO JUN

355
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,929
Goodness.

356
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,604
RA-RA

357
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,563
"Ra-ra"?

358
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,076
What's that?

359
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,705
Move.

360
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,167
BUT I DON'T WANT TO

361
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,213
How dare you.
Look at that little dog ignoring me.

362
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,882
That little…

363
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,134
It doesn't even act like a dog.

364
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,724
Oh, those flowers. Imagine if I took them.

365
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,309
-My gosh.
-What is this sound?

366
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,770
Why did you even want them?
You're so slow-witted.

367
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,980
If I do that again,
just punch me in the mouth.

368
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,941
Gosh, if only I was there.

369
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,401
So you'll actually punch me?

370
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,945
-Gosh.
-What is this?

371
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,325
The other day,
someone got hit in the head with a brick.

372
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,911
And yesterday,
Ra-ra's stalker tried to kidnap her.

373
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,621
At least the stalker was caught.

374
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,666
That handsome guy was a stalker.

375
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,292
It's so scary.

376
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,088
-You're here!
-Hi!

377
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,422
What's that?

378
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,593
I caught my husband
hiding these for himself.

379
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,388
-So I stole them again.
-My gosh.

380
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,267
-Drink up, ladies.
-Thank you!

381
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,190
It's good.

382
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,151
I'll break the walls down at this rate.

383
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,028
-Like Ra-ra?
-What?

384
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,406
"Ladies, can I have some kimchi pancakes?"

385
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:10,201
No, you cannot.
I bit my tongue when I saw her--

386
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,412
-Gosh!
-My gosh!

387
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,872
Who are you?

388
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,212
Well, I'm…

389
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,006
Oh, I know!

390
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:27,135
You must be the regular customer
from Seoul. The one who sponsors pianists!

391
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,555
My gosh, hello. I'm sorry, Suk-gyeong…

392
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,181
I mean, Ms. Jin isn't here today.

393
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,768
You came all the way here.
Please join us for a cup of coffee.

394
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,729
-Yes, please join us.
-Come on in.

395
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,397
-Watch your step.
-Come on down!

396
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,316
-Come down.
-Oh, sure.

397
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,318
-Be careful.
-Yes.

398
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,737
-My gosh.
-Welcome.

399
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,488
Have a seat.

400
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,075
-Here's your coffee.
-Thank you.

401
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,702
-Coffee.
-Enjoy.

402
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,287
Thank you.

403
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,122
-Anyways…
-Yes?

404
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,541
Isn't Jun so romantic?

405
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,584
Tell me about it.

406
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,961
-He was like a superhero from a movie.
-I know!

407
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,589
-Despite the danger, just to save Ra-ra…
-Yes!

408
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,424
He risked his life for her!

409
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,385
But he almost went to jail
because of that.

410
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,930
If that bastard had died,

411
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,474
Jun's life would've been over.

412
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:18,019
If Seung-gi tried to do that,
I'd have broken his leg to stop him.

413
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,854
I completely agree.

414
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,275
Pardon?

415
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,195
Oh, I just meant

416
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,823
that I agree with what you're saying.

417
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,200
I see.

418
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:36,412
I went to the place next to this salon.
You know, LaLa Land.

419
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,456
-Is it an academy of some sort?
-Yes.

420
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,459
I saw a room that probably belongs
to someone named Ra-ra.

421
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:45,755
Did those two live there together?

422
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,632
Gosh, no.

423
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:51,386
Ra-ra is renting a room
at Ms. Jin's place.

424
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,221
She runs the piano academy there.

425
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,265
Jun used to live there alone,

426
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,227
but my gosh. Ra-ra had nowhere to go,

427
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,105
so he lent her money
and opened the academy for her.

428
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,357
-He even took care of her dog.
-Right.

429
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,984
He was so good to her.

430
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,946
-He picked up multiple part-time jobs.
-My gosh.

431
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,448
And he worked himself to the bone

432
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,826
just so he could lend her money.

433
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,830
He's so romantic!

434
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,291
That crazy punk.

435
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,712
-Ma'am.
-I can't believe this. That punk…

436
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,548
Ma'am, are you not feeling well?

437
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,468
No, I'm okay.

438
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,971
-Gosh, my head. I'm fine.
-All right.

439
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,434
But strictly speaking,
Ra-ra is a divorcée.

440
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,105
She's such a lucky girl. I'm so jealous.

441
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,648
-Me too.
-Hold on.

442
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,818
What…

443
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,487
do you mean?

444
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,989
You're from Seoul,

445
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,283
so you must have no idea
what we're talking about.

446
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,701
Of course, she doesn't know.

447
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,328
-She's been married before.
-That's right.

448
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,252
That crazy punk.

449
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:11,674
Lunatic!

450
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,888
My gosh!

451
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,600
Jun's mom looked so scary.

452
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,519
What if she pulls Ra-ra's hair out?

453
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,022
Don't you know how Ra-ra is?

454
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,777
With Ra-ra's nonsensical babble,
that lady will be lost for words.

455
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,696
I totally agree.

456
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,114
-Do you?
-Yes.

457
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,367
Gosh.

458
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,132
Hello.

459
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,220
Are you Jun's friends?

460
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,181
No, we're just some kids that he knows.

461
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,265
What are you saying?

462
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,393
Yes, we are his friends.

463
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,856
Can you move aside?

464
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,651
Sure. Hey.

465
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,163
Would you like one? I highly recommend it.

466
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,874
It is that corn dog girl.

467
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:32,046
She's Im Ja-gyeong's daughter-in-law
whose wedding got called off.

468
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,424
How dare you

469
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,927
seduce my son?

470
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,389
Excuse me,

471
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,975
but the doctor said she needed to rest.

472
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,935
Could you please leave now?

473
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,448
Can you call me right away
when she wakes up?

474
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,083
Please.

475
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,418
Sure.

476
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,265
"The CEO of Sunwoo Foundation"?

477
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,642
Isn't it related to Sunwoo Hospital?

478
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,269
SUNWOO FOUNDATION

479
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,230
It has the same logo.

480
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,107
What?

481
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,198
Zero, one, zero.

482
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,617
"Zero, one, zero."

483
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,498
I can't remember.

484
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,836
First, call Manager No.

485
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,131
Okay, give me the number.

486
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,592
Zero, one, zero.

487
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,802
"Zero, one, zero."

488
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:06,015
Zero, one, zero.

489
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,231
Doctor, do you think he's suffering
from memory loss?

490
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,942
Suk-gyeong, tell me Ha-yeong's number.

491
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,526
Gosh.

492
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,612
Zero, one, zero, three…

493
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,282
No. Four, three, eight?

494
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,450
No. Nine?

495
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,494
Oh my. What's wrong with me?

496
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,747
-You must have memory loss too then.
-What?

497
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,000
I guess you're both suffering
from digital dementia.

498
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,086
Many people nowadays suffer from that.

499
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,588
Mr. Chu?

500
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,343
Do you remember
the name of someone you want to call?

501
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,763
Think.

502
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,975
-Cho Yun-sil.
-Okay.

503
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:52,019
The CEO of Sunwoo Foundation.
She's the madam of Sunwoo Hospital.

504
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,563
"The madam of Sunwoo Hospital"?

505
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,858
"The madam of Sunwoo Hospital"? That's me.

506
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,489
It can't be. Director Chu?

507
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,661
What?

508
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,121
You…

509
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,205
Ma'am.

510
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,874
Are you a gigolo?

511
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,209
What are you saying?

512
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,920
You. Why are you in this state?

513
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,922
Why are you injured like that?

514
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,008
Is this why you ignored my calls?

515
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,884
You're the one who ignored mine.

516
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,430
Feigning ignorance like this
after betraying me is just wrong.

517
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,307
What kind of bullshit…

518
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,642
What do you mean?

519
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,977
"Betraying"?

520
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,396
They were having an affair.

521
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,190
-Please.
-I can hear you.

522
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,358
"An affair"?

523
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,404
To tell you the truth,
a crazy bastard hit my head with a brick.

524
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,364
Then he stole my phone and wallet.

525
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,325
That's strange.

526
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,495
When I called, someone picked up my call.

527
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:52,830
Hold on.

528
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,918
Yes. It's going through.

529
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,963
This is creepy.

530
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,674
What is all this?

531
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,973
MONEY ENVELOPE

532
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,313
-Hello?
-Who is this?

533
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,148
And who are you?

534
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,486
You're that bastard
who hit a man's head with a brick

535
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,780
and stole his phone, right?

536
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,200
This voice sounds really familiar.

537
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,661
This is Detective Kang Min-guk
from Eunpo Police.

538
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,540
Wait a minute. Detective Kang?

539
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,544
Oh my. This is Sunwoo Jun's mother.

540
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,380
How did you call this number?

541
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,216
Do you know the owner of this phone?

542
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,719
Of course, I do.

543
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,555
Ma'am, may I have that?

544
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,683
Hello? Hello, Detective Kang.

545
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,685
This is Cha Eun-seok from Eunpo Hospital.

546
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,562
Doctor, how are you with her?

547
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,688
Where are you?

548
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,025
We're searching An Jung-ho's house.

549
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,278
Does that mean
that phone was at his place?

550
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,490
That phone belongs to Chu Min-su,
a patient here.

551
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:14,161
That means Ah Jung-ho was the one
who attacked him.

552
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,038
This guy's really something.

553
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,833
Could you send
Sunwoo Jun's mother to the station?

554
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,376
Sure.

555
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,671
-Look into this.
-Yes, sir.

556
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,756
-Jot this down.
-Yes, sir.

557
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,511
There's another phone?

558
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,431
This feels ominous.

559
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,724
Sir, we found blood in the bathroom.

560
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,643
-Go check it out.
-Go.

561
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,860
So Ra-ra's stalker attacked Mr. Chu?

562
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,113
Yes. He's one terrifying guy.

563
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:52,950
Come to think of it,
you cut off the hair of someone like that.

564
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,327
Look at how brave you were.

565
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:56,912
Hold on.

566
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,875
Then could he have been the one
who glued our doorknob?

567
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,669
No way. You're right.

568
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:07,006
And you guys have been so close
with such a man.

569
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,884
I'm usually excellent at reading people,

570
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,218
so how did I not notice that?

571
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,054
Mom. Don't be ridiculous.

572
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,182
You didn't even know
Jun was in high school.

573
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,517
Well… That's because…

574
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:22,438
By the way, why did you stay quiet
when you had known everything?

575
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,859
Well… He asked me

576
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,652
to give him a bit of time.

577
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,156
Still, you should've told me.

578
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,450
Had I known
he was the son of Sunwoo Hospital,

579
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:38,162
I would've helped Ha-yeong
get close to him as much as possible.

580
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,955
It's such a shame.

581
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,999
Mom, forget it.

582
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,503
I'm more impressed by Mr. Kim.

583
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,880
He got Jun his phone,

584
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,757
lent him money, and kept his secret.

585
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,051
You're right. They're like best friends

586
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,928
despite having a huge age gap.

587
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,640
Is Ra-ra still unconscious?

588
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,683
What happened yesterday
was shocking enough.

589
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,811
I'm afraid she'll be even more shocked
once she wakes up.

590
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,816
But she hasn't woken up yet.

591
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,944
Let's worry about that once she does.

592
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,159
Ra-ra!

593
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,995
Ra-ra!

594
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,044
Jun.

595
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,221
Jun.

596
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,270
Jun.

597
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,694
Jun.

598
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,037
Jun.

599
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,455
Jun.

600
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,458
You're that piano girl.

601
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,294
I will be sure to call you.

602
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,462
I will come find you.

603
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,048
I will come find you no matter what.

604
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,341
Sir.

605
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,261
I should've found you sooner.

606
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,181
Have you been that desperate
to learn the piano?

607
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,933
By the way, are you hurt?

608
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,937
I should've gone to smash that piano.

609
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,773
Yes. I finally get it now.

610
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,985
That woman came here to see you.

611
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,196
You met Sunwoo Jun's mom, didn't you?

612
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,657
How do you know Jun?

613
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,367
How do I know?

614
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,870
I came all the way here to find him.

615
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,122
But instead, I got my head cracked open!

616
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,295
How dare that high school senior
run away instead of studying?

617
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,838
"A high school senior"?

618
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,384
"Run away"?

619
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,555
Didn't you know?
He's the runaway son of Sunwoo Hospital.

620
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,232
The phone is turned off.
You'll be directed to voicemail.

621
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,026
Taxi!

622
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,196
The phone is turned off.

623
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,076
-Eunpo Police Station, please. Hurry.
-Okay.

624
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,538
The victim regained consciousness.

625
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,332
Meanwhile, in addition to stalking,

626
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,335
we've found traces
and evidence of other crimes.

627
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,212
"Other crimes"?

628
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,716
We'll have to investigate further,
but there could be more crimes.

629
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,427
Anyway,
we've finished questioning your son,

630
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,887
so he may go home.

631
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,724
Thank you.

632
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,228
Let's go.

633
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:52,940
Come.

634
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,789
Goodness, it must've been tough
in there, Jun.

635
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,167
This may seem tacky,
but have some of this for luck.

636
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,585
It's tofu.

637
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,754
Thank you.

638
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,258
Why would you? You're innocent.

639
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,014
I hope I'll never have to call you again.

640
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,350
What do you mean?

641
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,019
Let's go home.

642
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,522
You need to go back to your place

643
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,399
and resume your studies once again.

644
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,567
There's not much time.

645
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,027
I said I'm not going back.
I'm going to see Ra-ra.

646
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,946
How dare he? Grab him.

647
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,699
Let go of me. Let go!

648
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,950
Jun.

649
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,245
I'll explain everything to her.

650
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,498
So don't worry, and take care of yourself.

651
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,375
Let's go.

652
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,310
She's nowhere in the hospital.

653
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,104
Did you check the bathrooms?

654
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,522
Yes, but she's not there.

655
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,401
She's still unwell.
Where did she go dressed like that?

656
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,153
-Wait.
-What?

657
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:27,701
EUNPO POLICE STATION

658
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,290
Yes, Dr. Cha.

659
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,709
Ra-ra, where are you?

660
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:40,422
I'm sorry. I felt suffocated in there,
so I stepped out for a while.

661
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,383
I see. Is something wrong?

662
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,469
No.

663
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,847
I'm feeling better, so don't worry.

664
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,974
Also, could you fill out

665
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,352
the hospital discharge form for me?

666
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,939
Sure. Get some fresh air.

667
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,742
Excuse me.

668
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,246
I'm looking for Sunwoo Jun.
What do I need to do?

669
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,956
I heard he was being held here.

670
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,041
Oh, that boy?

671
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,335
He just left.

672
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,420
Pardon?

673
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,173
I think his mom was taking him
back to Seoul.

674
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,886
I want to tell you my story.

675
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,346
All of it.

676
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,935
Were you going to tell me about this?

677
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,397
Why have you lied to me all this time?

678
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,650
Why?

679
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,577
-I need to go to the restroom.
-Hold it in.

680
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,704
It's urgent.

681
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,541
If you can't trust me, come with me.

682
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,173
Don't you dare do anything funny.

683
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,820
-Jun! Go catch him!
-Yes, ma'am!

684
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,071
That punk!

685
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,531
Damn it!

686
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,077
My goodness!

687
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,259
Gosh!

688
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,386
He's not here.

689
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,349
Go to the hospital right now
and get eyes on that girl, Ra-ra. Hurry!

690
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,644
He has no money or a phone,

691
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,480
so he'll probably go
to that old man, Man-bok.

692
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,814
Send someone there too.

693
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,149
-Yes, ma'am.
-Go.

694
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,029
That brat just won't listen.

695
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,489
Goodness.

696
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:16,703
Ra-ra.

697
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,457
Dr. Cha.

698
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,710
How about some ice cream?
It's been a while.

699
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,047
Let's chat as we eat.

700
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,843
Here you go.

701
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,178
Thank you.

702
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,564
It's going to take a while to finish it.

703
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,735
You probably have a lot on your mind.

704
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,281
I'll stay by your side in the meantime.

705
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,867
It's better to have company.

706
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:00,747
Thank you.

707
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,180
To be frank,

708
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,142
I'm so shocked

709
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,478
that I don't know

710
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,897
if I should get mad at him

711
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:30,777
or sympathize and comfort him.

712
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,614
I just don't know.

713
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,663
Everything's a mess.

714
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,630
Ra-ra.

715
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,050
You see,

716
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:58,013
everyone has things they couldn't say
because the timing wasn't right.

717
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,808
They just bottle them up.

718
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,313
I'm sure he had his reasons,

719
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,774
so don't feel too hurt.

720
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,114
Okay.

721
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,620
I should get going first.

722
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,956
Okay. I'll finish eating mine here.

723
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,834
-Thank you.
-No problem.

724
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,993
-It's me.
-Seung-gi, please.

725
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,497
Your mom's men are everywhere
trying to catch you.

726
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,458
Right, you're not even older than me.

727
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,794
You fraud.
I know you're my age. How dare you?

728
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:14,005
I never said I was older than you.
You just assumed that.

729
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,550
This feels so unfair and frustrating.

730
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,260
It's all because you look old.

731
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,220
Why are you blaming my face for this?

732
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,305
You didn't even ask,
so blame your stupidity.

733
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,850
-You little--
-We can talk about this later.

734
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,893
What about Ra-ra? How is she doing?

735
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,604
Actually, she disappeared.

736
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,275
-What?
-She felt suffocated in the hospital.

737
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,652
So she went out for some fresh air.

738
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,072
Right.
She still doesn't know about any of this.

739
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,367
That you're 19 years old

740
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,787
or that you're the son of Sunwoo Hospital.

741
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,208
We didn't tell her

742
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,545
because it'd be best
for her to hear it from you.

743
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,132
Ha-yeong and I stuck by her side
and made sure she knew nothing.

744
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,178
I said you're stupid, but I take it back.

745
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,222
You're more considerate than I thought.

746
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,224
Now you're complimenting me?

747
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,727
Anyway, what's your plan?

748
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,520
Tonight,

749
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,190
I'm getting on that ship.

750
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,983
Are you crazy?

751
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,360
I don't know anymore.

752
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,321
Call her.

753
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,116
She must be waiting for your call.

754
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,749
Everything's such a mess.

755
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,752
Thanks.

756
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,639
SEUNG-GI

757
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,477
Hello?

758
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,317
Seung-gi, is something wrong?

759
00:53:59,027 --> 00:53:59,903
It's me.

760
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,534
I miss you, Ra-ra.

761
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,209
I want to see you.

762
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,802
Do you still have the ticket?

763
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,096
Let's meet at the dock.

764
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,022
Ra-ra, are you listening?

765
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,320
Okay, I'll see you there.

766
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,641
Ra-ra!

767
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,160
Did you wait long?

768
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,335
Yes, for a very long time.

769
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,256
Let's go home, okay?

770
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,342
Wait!

771
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,848
Mom, give me 30 minutes. No.

772
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,975
Just ten minutes.

773
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,145
I have something to tell her.

774
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,459
How did you know?

775
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,761
You…

776
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,933
Get them in the car.

777
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:20,603
In the end,

778
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,648
I had to say goodbye to you

779
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,234
without hearing any explanation.

780
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,578
SEUNG-GI

781
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,537
EPILOGUE

782
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:40,957
Hello?

783
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,001
It's me.

784
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,339
I miss you, Ra-ra.

785
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,222
I want to see you.

786
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,603
Do you still have the ticket?

787
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,022
Let's meet at the dock.

788
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,704
Okay, I'll see you there.

789
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,687
Ms. Gu Ra-ra?

790
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:47,982
Yes.

791
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,320
I'll make this brief.

792
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,656
Where did you agree

793
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,867
to meet Jun?

794
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,818
Ra-ra seems a bit strange these days.

795
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:35,113
Jun was dragged away because of her.
She must feel terrible.

796
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:38,032
How could you fall
for such a pathetic girl?

797
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,325
I liked her first.

798
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,578
If I think about it,
I knew so little about him.

799
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,788
You may not have known his background,

800
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,707
but you know very well about him.

801
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,459
That he may act tough,
but he has a soft heart.

802
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,795
That he may seem cold,
but he's warmhearted.

803
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:54,215
You already knew
who he truly is all along.

804
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,967
"Sunwoo Foundation"? Is she Jun's mom?

805
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,011
What should we do? She's crying.

806
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,304
This won't do.

807
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,180
I'm going to Jun's to cause a scene.

808
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,682
Should we bring him back too?

809
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,434
-Is that the police?
-Hide!

810
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:05,852
Hurry up.

811
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:06,811
What's going on?

812
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,731
-Is that Jun?
-No way.

813
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:14,736
