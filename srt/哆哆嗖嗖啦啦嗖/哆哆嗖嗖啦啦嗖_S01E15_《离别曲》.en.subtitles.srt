EPISODE 15

2
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,254
Hey, you're really heartless.

3
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,215
You saw her face and were still able
to totally ignore her.

4
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,760
-I'm impressed.
-Enough about that.

5
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,888
Thanks for taking

6
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,266
those pictures with me a while back.

7
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,810
Then,

8
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,396
how about you become my boyfriend
for real?

9
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,857
Hey, I was just joking.

10
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,152
You take everything so seriously.

11
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,905
That's your charm, I guess.

12
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,701
Study hard.
I really hope you win the Fields Medal.

13
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,162
Neither Ji-hun nor I ever will.

14
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,915
I guess Ji-hun has no choice,

15
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,292
but why can't you?

16
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,338
You should head in.

17
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,299
DEPARTURES

18
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,604
Ms. Gong!

19
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,529
-Ms. Gong!
-Ra-ra!

20
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,534
My gosh. Did you miss me that much?

21
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,580
Are you crying?

22
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,126
Ra-ra, did something happen?

23
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,253
No.

24
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:12,382
I'm crying because
I'm so happy to see you.

25
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,639
I'm happy to see you too, Ra-ra.
How long has it been?

26
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,767
I missed you a lot too.

27
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,935
Ra-ra, my sweetie.

28
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,065
I really want to introduce you
to my piano teacher.

29
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,276
She'd be very happy to meet you.

30
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,736
You know, you're totally her type.

31
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,199
I've heard so much
about your old piano teacher

32
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,784
that I want to meet her too.

33
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,416
It would've been nice to meet her.

34
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,750
It's alright.

35
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,512
EPISODE 15
"FAREWELL"

36
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,643
It looks like a flower shop

37
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,273
with a wedding planner's office
and an unusual-looking fridge.

38
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,858
Ra-ra.

39
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,902
Is this where you live?

40
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,654
No, I live somewhere else.

41
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,281
That's just where I relax.

42
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,534
I can't believe you opened
this piano academy on your own.

43
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,414
-I had a lot of help.
-From who?

44
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,422
You've really gone
through all those things?

45
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,095
I'm so sorry about your father.

46
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,848
It breaks my heart to hear
about your loss.

47
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,353
I couldn't even attend his funeral
and say my final goodbye.

48
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:52,941
So?

49
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,861
Is Mr. Twinkle still in the hospital?

50
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:57,987
Yes.

51
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,490
I really want to know

52
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,410
how that man and Chairman Gu
knew each other.

53
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,746
He'll regain consciousness soon.

54
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,915
Yes, of course.

55
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,003
Anyway, the name of this academy
suits you perfectly.

56
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,340
I thought you were still
just a young girl.

57
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,511
I'm so proud of you for starting
this academy in this faraway town.

58
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,555
I can do so many things.

59
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,686
By the way, you said a guy named Jun

60
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,563
helped you start this. Where is he now?

61
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,108
I'd like to meet him.

62
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,325
We broke up.

63
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,746
He said he didn't like me anymore
and left.

64
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,425
Ra-ra.

65
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,138
You still remember
what I used to say to you

66
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,682
all the time, right?

67
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,271
Ra-ra.

68
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,733
Play the piano.

69
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,360
When you're sad, when you're happy,

70
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,612
and even when you're depressed
because life is miserable,

71
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,822
just play the piano.

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,575
It'll cheer you up.

73
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,829
That's what music and the piano can do.

74
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,291
Of course, I remember.

75
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,072
You've had a hard time while I was gone.

76
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,300
My gosh! Welcome, ma'am.

77
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,093
-Watch your step.
-My gosh.

78
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,056
Nice to meet you.

79
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,351
Ms. Gong, this is Ms. Jin Suk-gyeong,
the owner of Jin Beauty Salon.

80
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,020
She's also my landlady.

81
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,857
I told Ra-ra to bring you here, Ms. Gong.

82
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,277
I wanted to give you
the Welcome-to-Eunpo hairstyle for free.

83
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,738
"Welcome-to-Eunpo hairstyle"?

84
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,781
Ta-da.

85
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,421
Ms. Gong, I also got this hairdo
when I first moved here.

86
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,470
-It looks amazing.
-My gosh.

87
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,518
They're such fun, great people.

88
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,896
-Right?
-I'm jealous.

89
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,149
You used to follow me around everywhere,
but look at you.

90
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,236
Ms. Gong.

91
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,698
There's something I've always been
curious about. Can I ask you about it?

92
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,200
What is it?

93
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,417
All the other students you were teaching
were incredibly talented.

94
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,796
I must've been far below your standards.

95
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,840
Why did you keep me as your student?

96
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,427
Was it really just because
of my dad's financial support?

97
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,644
Ra-ra.

98
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,357
The way you played the piano

99
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,988
was filled with joy.

100
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,159
Keep it light.

101
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,037
There were times when it was awful.

102
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:44,542
But even so,
it was always filled with true joy.

103
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,713
I rarely smiled back then.

104
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,172
What's so funny?

105
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,174
My husband's business had gone under,

106
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,762
so I was really struggling
both financially and mentally.

107
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,390
Butâ€¦

108
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,018
These bananas look like poop.

109
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,147
Poop.

110
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:12,445
Goodness.
I get to laugh thanks to you, I guess.

111
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,657
I was depressed,
but you made me smile and laugh.

112
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,954
The way you play the piano
has that kind of power.

113
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,709
So Ra-ra,

114
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,671
don't ever give up the piano.

115
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,468
That's who you are.

116
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,679
Okay?

117
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,476
Okay, Ms. Gong.

118
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:56,405
You know that I'm going out
with the TWD ladies tomorrow, right?

119
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,991
Yes, of course.

120
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,409
I have to leave very early,

121
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,412
so don't forget to make breakfast
for Ms. Gong.

122
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,707
The soup and the side dishes
are in the fridge,

123
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,335
and just press the button
to start the rice cooker. Got it?

124
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,922
I don't need such detailed instructions.
I'm not a baby.

125
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,424
You are still a baby.

126
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,762
No matter how old you are,
you'll always be my baby!

127
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,680
Mom, I can't breathe!

128
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,183
My baby, you're so adorable.

129
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,601
Ra-ra.

130
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:31,357
How about you apply to the grad school
where I teach?

131
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,776
Grad school?

132
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:38,030
Yes. You can learn more
and work as my teaching assistant.

133
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,115
What do you think?

134
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,121
I'll think about it, Ms. Gong.

135
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,374
All right.

136
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,710
Take some time to think about it
and make your decision.

137
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,767
Miju Apartment, Unit 408.

138
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,812
Can I come over and see your place?

139
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,981
Why don't we have more drinks
at your place?

140
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,650
What are you talking about? No way.

141
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,612
What is he trying to hide?

142
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,492
Does he really live with a woman?

143
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,661
I shall find out.

144
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,298
Gosh.

145
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,054
My goodness.

146
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,140
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

147
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,313
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

148
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,440
Do you know this woman?

149
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,776
He knows me very well.

150
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,238
What was that about?

151
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,411
Your place looks nice.

152
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,550
Who on earth is this man?

153
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,386
I'm Dr. Cha's tenant.

154
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,682
-Sorry?
-Cooking is my hobby.

155
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,895
You must be Dr. Cha's ex-wife.

156
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:34,939
Yes.

157
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,025
Because of the work I do,

158
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,695
I can tell these things
the moment I meet someone.

159
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,955
-Oh, thank you.
-You can contact me anytime.

160
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,417
Liar. You saw her
at the hospital the other day.

161
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,379
Seriously, you're so good
at selling yourself.

162
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,261
Hey, what's up? What brings you here?

163
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,428
What?

164
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,808
I came to give you this.

165
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,811
You could've just sent it via courier.

166
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,482
I'm also here to show you my face.

167
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,360
Still beautiful, right?

168
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,034
PRIVATE INVESTIGATION AGENCY
CHU

169
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,000
You came this far to drop this off.

170
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,210
-Thanks.
-Really?

171
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,379
Then treat me to a meal.

172
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,174
I want to, but I have other plans today.

173
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,885
With who?

174
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,138
Grad school?

175
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,267
Yes, Ms. Gong suggested it.

176
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,897
I quit piano
right after my graduation recital,

177
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,232
so I never even considered
going to grad school.

178
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:06,155
But I've grown to love the piano again,
so I'm torn.

179
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,453
What do you think I should do?

180
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,288
I'll be sad if you leave,

181
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,874
but you should follow your heart.

182
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,670
You bought the LaLa Land building
and even waived the rent for me.

183
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,381
You've been really considerate of me,
so I'm sorry.

184
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,343
You don't need to be sorry.

185
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,803
Thank you, Dr. Cha.

186
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,142
To be honest,

187
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,394
LaLa Land is filled with memories of Jun.

188
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,896
I'm not sure

189
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,482
I can bear to stay here alone.

190
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,868
Ra-ra.

191
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,665
I've thought a lot about whether
I should tell you this or not.

192
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,834
but I think you should know.

193
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,796
The person who bought this building

194
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,715
was Jun.

195
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,097
I heard that you also inquired
about the LaLa Land building.

196
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,849
The realtor told me.

197
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,728
I can't even bear

198
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,314
to look at that building,

199
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,735
but my son's been pestering me about it,
so I can't ignore it. Soâ€¦

200
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,033
I'd like you to buy

201
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,244
that building.

202
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,665
That building means so much to me, Mom.

203
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,502
I would like that place
to stay there forever.

204
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,920
Are you serious?

205
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,340
I'll do everything you tell me to do.

206
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,263
Go to medical school.

207
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,187
Okay.

208
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,442
Jun even changed his career choice
to protect this place,

209
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,445
so I really can't believe

210
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,780
what he did to you.

211
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,326
Perhaps there's

212
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,663
some reason we don't know about.

213
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,875
Then what about all the photos
that Director Chu took?

214
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,835
What?

215
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,338
Gu Ra-ra broke up with
Sunwoo Foundation director's son?

216
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,507
Yes, they did.

217
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,594
As a third party, we shouldn't speculate--

218
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,887
Hold on.

219
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,808
Does it mean things might work out
between Eun-seok and that woman?

220
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,018
Yes, that's right.

221
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,103
Gosh, I can't let that happen.

222
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,731
Director Chu?

223
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,608
Yes, my dear client.

224
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,281
Can you keep an eye on Eun-seok
and keep me posted?

225
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,699
Yes, sure thing.

226
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,035
The retainer fee is--

227
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,162
Director Chu!

228
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,291
-What's up?
-I want to ask you something.

229
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,213
Hey, why don't we step out?
I'll treat you to a meal.

230
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,632
She looks prettier in person. Damn it!

231
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,801
My dear client!

232
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,768
Please tell me the truth.

233
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,358
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

234
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,777
You want me to take staged photos?

235
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,655
Yes, make it look like
I'm dating that girl.

236
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,115
You crazyâ€¦

237
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,033
You're such a jerk.

238
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:42,246
Ra-ra is devastated right now
because of you.

239
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,415
I need a reason to break up with her.

240
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,750
You little punk.

241
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,337
I thought you were a hopeless romantic,
but you can be so cruel.

242
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,840
I did it because he told me to.

243
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,553
But why did he do that?

244
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,764
Don't ask me why.

245
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:04,476
Just do the job well.
I can pay you as much as you want.

246
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,395
My goodness.

247
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,898
This isn't about money.
My honor is on the line.

248
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,861
Hey, are you going through something?

249
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,116
No.

250
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,330
Why? Just whyâ€¦

251
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,249
Jun,

252
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,251
are you all packed now?

253
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,464
Yes.

254
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,133
Are you really going to be okay?

255
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,184
Don't follow me.

256
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,894
Then let me give you a ride.

257
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,279
Hey, Jun. We're here.

258
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,367
Hey, Sunwoo Jun.

259
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,122
We're here.

260
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,628
Jun, what's wrong?

261
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,963
Sunwoo Jun!

262
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,134
Jun is going to be okay, right?

263
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,844
Yes, of course.

264
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,639
This must've been scary for you.

265
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,391
Yes, a little.

266
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,977
Well, the doctor's done some tests,

267
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,562
so we'll just wait for the results now.

268
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,357
He's been pushing himself
to study really hard.

269
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,654
Ga-yeong.

270
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,198
Thanks so much for today.

271
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,908
RA-RA

272
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,666
RA-RA

273
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,758
Honey.

274
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,094
Junâ€¦

275
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,180
What will happen to him now?

276
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,058
He needs to be treated right away.

277
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,520
It's acute,
so he should've been treated sooner.

278
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,357
This is all my fault.

279
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,611
Had I not been so hard on him,

280
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,281
he could've received treatment sooner.

281
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,202
This is all my fault.

282
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,790
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE
SUNWOO MYEONG

283
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:20,505
You can save Jun, right?

284
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,133
Of course.

285
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,720
I've saved so many lives in my career.

286
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,556
I must save our one and only son.

287
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,270
Leukemia isn't incurable.

288
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,192
Jun.

289
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,865
Junâ€¦

290
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,664
Junâ€¦

291
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,589
Let's get you checked in right away

292
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,008
and begin the anticancer therapy.

293
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,012
Dad, am Iâ€¦

294
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,264
Am I going to die?

295
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,974
No, of course not!

296
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,230
-That's right.
-You can get better.

297
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,733
I promise you

298
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,654
that you will be cured.

299
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:31,326
Don't worry, Jun. Don't worry.

300
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,203
RA-RA

301
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,348
Let's break up.

302
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,601
I just don't like you anymore.

303
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,897
Jun, is that true?

304
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,276
Then look me in the eye and say it again.

305
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,074
I don't like you anymore.

306
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,997
I wish you all the best.

307
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,125
Forget a jerk like me.

308
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,423
I'm so sorry

309
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,717
for hurting you.

310
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,763
I don't want her to see me ill.

311
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,268
And this way,
she will be able to forget me faster.

312
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,854
All right.

313
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,440
Everything will be fine.

314
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,654
You can see Ra-ra after you fully recover.

315
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,364
So for nowâ€¦

316
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,450
Let's focus on your health.

317
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,287
Okay.

318
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:29,754
Jun.

319
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,007
You know,

320
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,927
you meanâ€¦

321
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,183
the whole world to me.

322
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,815
I will

323
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,027
never give up on you.

324
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,405
This look on his faceâ€¦

325
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,118
It looks familiar.

326
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,879
That jacket.

327
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,476
SPRING 2019

328
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,314
WATERMELON JUICE

329
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,362
There's only one left.
He's not going to order it, is he?

330
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,156
-I'll get watermelon juice.
-No!

331
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,472
I startled you, didn't I?

332
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,226
Sorry. I wanted the juice so much
that I yelled without realizing it.

333
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,520
Oh, you go ahead.

334
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,188
No, it's okay.

335
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,941
-I don't have to order it.
-Really?

336
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,323
Then I'll take the last one.

337
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,247
A watermelon juice, please.

338
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,045
Where did my purse go?

339
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,591
Where are you, my dear purse?

340
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,305
I'm sorry. This has never
happened to me before.

341
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,436
Where is it?

342
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,355
Gosh.

343
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,608
I'll pay for hers as well.

344
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,319
I'll get an iced Americano.

345
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,125
I promise I'll pay you back.

346
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:55,960
Sure.

347
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,837
You know,

348
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,008
I hate being indebted to others.

349
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,761
It's really okay.

350
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,305
No. If you give me your number--

351
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,807
Sorry, just a second.

352
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,559
-Wait. Can Iâ€¦
-Hello?

353
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,695
Oh, right.

354
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,782
Where did my purse go?

355
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,035
Did I drop it on my way here?
Is it in the lecture hall?

356
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,788
What do I do first
when I've lost my purse?

357
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,124
I should go talk to Secretary Moon.

358
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,174
Why isn't he coming back?

359
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,110
Thank you for the juice.

360
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,113
I want to pay you back,
so please call me. From Ra-ra.

361
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,203
That guy was Jun.

362
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,002
So he's known me since then.

363
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,463
Why didn't he tell me?

364
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,215
What?

365
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,762
That's when everything came back to me.
On the day of my graduation recital,

366
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,056
you're the one who took the photo, right?

367
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,434
That's all?

368
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,980
Hey! Where are you going?

369
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,942
She's so fast.

370
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,409
I don't even have his new number.
What do I do?

371
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,786
Where should I go to find him?

372
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,666
Right, the academy.

373
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,507
Hello? Is Sunwoo Jun--

374
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,509
He quit.

375
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,094
Why?

376
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,555
I heard he was moving abroad for school,

377
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,307
but I don't know the details.

378
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,808
Moving abroad for school?

379
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,653
Right. I should go to his place.

380
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,954
Who is it?

381
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,708
Hello, I'm here to see Jun.

382
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,252
Jun? He's not here.

383
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,671
He won't be coming home for a while.

384
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:27,630
Pardon?

385
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,481
Did he leave already?

386
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,526
Jun.

387
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,696
Junâ€¦

388
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,940
"Do you want to come here
if you're lonely?"

389
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,319
Who is this? I don't know this handle.

390
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:36,324
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

391
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,576
To tell you the truth, it was me.

392
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,081
Hey, I'm Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

393
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,086
It was true.

394
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,547
Dodosolsollalasol

395
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,217
was Jun.

396
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,445
Jun.

397
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,782
I'm at the cafe where we first met.

398
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,576
I miss you a lot,

399
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,538
but I guess I can't see you anymore.

400
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,754
Dear Mr. Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

401
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:36,300
Thank you for making all my rough days

402
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,219
shine brightly.

403
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,389
I know you fell out of love and left me.

404
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,642
But I still like you.

405
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,688
I still want you.

406
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,036
Could you stop the car right now?

407
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,872
Why? What's wrong?

408
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,502
I need to stop by somewhere.

409
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,131
Jun.

410
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,444
I WANT TO PAY YOU BACK, SO PLEASE CALL ME
FROM RA-RA

411
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,423
Jun.

412
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,637
Jun.

413
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,142
Look at you getting ready to cry again.

414
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,104
Jeez.

415
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,945
Why did you come here
when you've dumped me?

416
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,489
You said you still liked Mr. Twinkle.

417
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,450
You said you still wanted him.

418
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,037
Jeez.

419
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,539
Jun.

420
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:17,003
Why didn't you tell me
that this was where we had first met?

421
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,047
It's a long story.

422
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,674
Where do I begin?

423
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,929
To be honest,
I was hoping to see you again,

424
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,724
so I came here often.

425
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,185
-Why?
-Because you owed me 5,800 won.

426
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,188
You said you'd pay me back.

427
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,524
You said you hated being indebted
to others,

428
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,985
so I was determined to get that money
from you.

429
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,821
I didn't want you to hate me.

430
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,662
I had feelings for you
since our first encounter.

431
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,804
That was why.

432
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,683
So why did I pretend
like I didn't know you

433
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,518
when we met at your recital?

434
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,358
I was so happy

435
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,610
that I had finally found you.

436
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,909
But my happiness didn't last long.

437
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,536
-My fan?
-Yes. You were great today.

438
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,499
I couldn't tell Ji-hun
that I had liked you first.

439
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,043
I'll always root for you. Thank you.

440
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,669
So I decided to keep it secret.

441
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,256
It was a crush anyway.

442
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,550
I see.

443
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,887
So that's why you stared at me like that.

444
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,476
Isn't she gorgeous? Look.

445
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,144
Right.

446
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,940
When I met you by coincidence
at your wedding,

447
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,234
I was so happy and nervous.

448
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,611
But I thought I would never see you again.

449
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,572
But after I heard that your wedding
had fallen through

450
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,367
and that your dad had passed away,

451
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,411
I kept thinking about you more.

452
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,787
Why?

453
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:20,000
I was worried if it was because
I had spilled blood on your dress.

454
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,502
I felt bad.

455
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:27,341
That's when I decided to disguise myself
as dodosolsollalasol

456
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,260
and reach out to you.

457
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,054
"Do you want to come here
if you're lonely?"

458
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,764
I was worried about you.

459
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,060
They commented again.

460
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,146
"Are you eating well?

461
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,730
Are you sleeping well?

462
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,149
Are you healthy?"

463
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,776
Why are they nagging me so much?

464
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,322
But never in my wildest dreams
did I expect to see you in Eunpo.

465
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,742
Where is this? I'll go see you right now.

466
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,579
And I definitely didn't expect to get

467
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,249
into that accident on my way to see you.

468
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,547
On top of that, I had no idea

469
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,591
I'd have to lend you money

470
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,051
when you were completely broke.

471
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,679
I promise you I'll compensate you,
so put it on my tab.

472
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,306
Until I get back on my feet,

473
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,267
could you keep lending me money?

474
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,228
I felt bad that you got hurt
on your way to meet me,

475
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,522
so I was going to wait
until you recovered.

476
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,900
I shouldn't have come here.

477
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,486
I can't believe I caused an accident
and hurt my hand.

478
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,865
And while I was lending you money,
you started to grow on me.

479
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,744
Working to make money
so that I could lend it to you

480
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,621
wasn't difficult at all.

481
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,748
Rather, I was happy to do it.

482
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,167
I'll pay you back quickly and move out.

483
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,586
When you said you'd pay me back,

484
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,756
I actually felt sad.

485
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,051
All those messages you sent me
on social mediaâ€¦

486
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,428
Thanks to you,
I've made some great friends

487
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,931
and am enjoying my life in this new place.

488
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,767
My heart flutters as I wonder about you.

489
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,144
I'll see you soon,
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

490
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,897
I also felt the same way.

491
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,193
Because thanks to you,
I was living a happy life.

492
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,240
Don't look at me that way.
You're breaking my heart.

493
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,913
But Jun, wasn't it Mr. Kim
that sent the piano?

494
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,164
Oh, that?

495
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,292
He already knew everything about me.

496
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,503
When he was sending you the piano,

497
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,965
he wrote dodosolsollalasol as the sender.

498
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:31,882
Just a second, please.

499
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,386
Where was that piano delivered from?

500
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,346
After checking with Mr. Kim,

501
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,974
I messaged you right away.

502
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:41,934
What?

503
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,354
"I sent a small gift.

504
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,565
I hope it cheers you up."

505
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,777
Who on earth are you?

506
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,780
I see. Then--

507
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:58,158
Why didn't I show up the next month
when we had agreed to meet?

508
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:03,831
That day, Mr. Chu visited
Mr. Kim's greenhouse.

509
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,460
So I had to hurry over there.

510
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,838
What is it, Mr. Kim?

511
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,134
Actually,

512
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,388
Mr. Kim had agreed
to go to see you with me.

513
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,267
But neither of us made it in the end.

514
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,102
You had your reasons.

515
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:28,689
But thanks to your great inference skills,
you had barked up the wrong tree.

516
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,191
I think I know who it is.

517
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,652
Who is it?

518
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,697
Dr. Cha.

519
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,034
But I clearly told you the truth
back then.

520
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,745
Hey, I'm Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

521
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,580
That's cute. Whatever.

522
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,541
You just didn't believe me.

523
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,253
I'm sorry.
I thought you were just joking around.

524
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,718
I hoped you would never find out.

525
00:43:58,844 --> 00:43:59,845
In the end,

526
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,348
you remembered.

527
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:03,766
Why?

528
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,477
Why didn't you want me to find out?

529
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,437
I justâ€¦

530
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,315
I just wanted you to forget about me.

531
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,276
I broke up with youâ€¦

532
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,576
because I had decided to go to the US

533
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:23,952
to study.

534
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,248
I may not be returning for a long time.

535
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,211
Or I might just settle down there.

536
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,005
That's why.

537
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,510
That's why I thought it'd be right
to break up with you.

538
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,099
Finding out that I was Mr. Twinkleâ€¦

539
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,686
would only pain you more.

540
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,066
How could I ever forget you?

541
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,029
Remember what you told me?

542
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,324
The time we spent together

543
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,451
defined me.

544
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,328
So

545
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,123
I could never
just throw those memories away.

546
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,589
But it's sad to think
that you'll be so far away.

547
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,601
Mom.

548
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,229
Please give me two days.

549
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,356
What's this about?

550
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,775
I met Ra-ra.

551
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,486
I want to visit LaLa Land.

552
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,658
Okay.

553
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,411
You may go.

554
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:05,721
So?

555
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,057
What do you want to do here
before you leave?

556
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,562
Nothing special.

557
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,481
Something we used to do.

558
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,649
You're so boring.

559
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:28,660
JIN BEAUTY SALON
LALA PIANO LAND

560
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,830
Go. Twinkle, twinkle, little star

561
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,041
How I wonder what you are

562
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,210
Snow-white Ra-ra and Jun!

563
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,962
Twinkling Ra-ra and Jun!

564
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,048
Welcome.

565
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,136
Jun, you could be an actor.

566
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,348
I know. How could you fool us as well?

567
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:52,100
You're so heartless.
Like leaving us wasn't enough,

568
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,685
you had to be a jerk?

569
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,687
After all the time we spent togetherâ€¦

570
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,857
I know. We were pretty much family.

571
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,569
Don't be so mean to my Jun.

572
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,695
"My Jun"?

573
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,365
He's my man.

574
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,449
He's mine.

575
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,953
You should keep such thoughts to yourself.

576
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,080
No. Then you can't hear it.

577
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,332
I'll say it out loud.

578
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,084
Let me go. Why are you so strong?

579
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,877
I'm going to say it out loud.

580
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,046
Delivery.

581
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,257
-Hi, Dr. Cha.
-Gosh.

582
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,052
Now that Dr. Cha has arrived,
I think we're all here.

583
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,554
Let's have some fun.

584
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,305
Sounds good!

585
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,600
-Let's have some fun!
-Sounds good!

586
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,020
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

587
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,981
-Be healthy.
-Be healthy.

588
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,236
Isn't it good?

589
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,737
Eat up, Seung-gi.

590
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:50,951
You can have it.

591
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,607
I'll never forget this place.

592
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:26,320
It gave me too many gifts.

593
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,739
The people I met hereâ€¦

594
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,242
and Ra-ra.

595
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,873
Please take care of her.

596
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,044
Why are you asking me to do that
out of the blue?

597
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,129
Because I won't be here for her.

598
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,049
Oh, right.

599
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,218
She requires a great amount of care,

600
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,428
so I'm worried.

601
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,763
Don't be.

602
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,765
You take care of yourself.

603
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,779
The woman you met at the airport

604
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,405
is Ms. Gong Mi-suk, right?

605
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:11,823
Did you see her?

606
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,118
Actually,

607
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,537
I wanted to give her a warm greeting.

608
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,165
Really?

609
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,000
You can do that next time.

610
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,336
Right.

611
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,434
You once said

612
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,689
that Ms. Gong used to slap your hands
for not practicing

613
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,441
and that there was also a better way.

614
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,611
Ms. Gong whipped me on the back
of my hands for things like this.

615
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,822
Don't tell me you'll do that to me.

616
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,825
No, there's a better way.

617
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,743
I'll tell you later.

618
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,994
What was the better way?

619
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,663
Oh, that?

620
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,499
Level one, a slap on the back of the hand.
Level two,

621
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,129
a piece of chocolate.

622
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,466
Level two worked like magic on me.

623
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,301
Was there level three?

624
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,762
Yes, it wasâ€¦

625
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,072
"If you endure the tough times,
you will reap the fruits of your labor,"

626
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,658
she'd whisper in my ear while hugging me.

627
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,213
I like level three the most.

628
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:56,511
All right. From now on, I'll use
this level three punishment on you.

629
00:50:58,930 --> 00:50:59,765
Okay.

630
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:15,781
Can't you scratch better?

631
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,575
Good.

632
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,702
I told you to tell me your wish,

633
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:23,747
but you're just trying to take revenge
by making me do whatever you want.

634
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,081
Yes.

635
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,259
What?

636
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,514
You have big eyes, a sharp nose,

637
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,183
and bright lips.

638
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,518
Did you just realize that?

639
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,646
You look different from down here.

640
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,649
You look extremely ugly.

641
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,317
What?

642
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,571
-Hey.
-Be quiet, sir.

643
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,990
Remove this. I want to see your face.

644
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,408
-Really? Okay.
-Yes.

645
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,285
There you go.

646
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,870
-Harder.
-Like this?

647
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,163
That's it.

648
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,563
Are you leaving?

649
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,483
No, I'm going to sleep here with you.

650
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:34,901
With me?

651
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,027
Yes.

652
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,365
I'm just kidding.

653
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,044
A gift.

654
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,509
Give me your hand.

655
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,054
Come on.

656
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,752
Choose which ring to wear carefully.

657
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,588
But I didn't prepare anything.

658
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,090
You gave me that.

659
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,509
That's too small of a gift.

660
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,554
Thenâ€¦

661
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,098
play the piano for me.

662
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,225
The song you'd play

663
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,478
whenever I came back from work.

664
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,710
LALA PIANO LAND

665
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:44,489
You just wait. I'm going to make you
bawl your eyes out someday.

666
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,409
Ra-ra.

667
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,536
you were

668
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,122
right.

669
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,166
This music is sad.

670
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,880
It's one of Chopin's "Etudes."

671
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,966
It's also called "Farewell."

672
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,218
I see.

673
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:32,722
It shows his emotions of nostalgia
for his homeland, which is Poland.

674
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,016
He must've lived elsewhere.

675
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,559
Yes.

676
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,354
And he was never able to return.

677
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,900
Only his heart was buried back in Poland.

678
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,778
What a poor guy.

679
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:02,752
Whenever you feel lonely, bored,
or miss me, call me, okay?

680
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,005
No. I'm going to be quite busy.

681
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:11,219
Seung-gi said he'd make
a video streaming account for LaLa Land.

682
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,596
Fine, I'll take a look sometimes.

683
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,056
Okay.

684
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,892
Then I'll be going now.

685
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,853
Okay.

686
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,107
Jun.

687
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,025
-Yes?
-What about the money?

688
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,403
What about the money
I've borrowed from you?

689
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,612
Right.

690
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,448
That.

691
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,952
You're right. That's a problem.

692
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,956
Why don't you keep it for now?

693
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,250
I'll receive it all at once.

694
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:43,710
Really?

695
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,550
You should really go now.

696
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,303
Yes. Bye.

697
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,554
Bye.

698
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,847
Bye.

699
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,318
Take care.

700
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:05,667
Ra-ra, I'm sure we will meet again.

701
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:18,429
EPILOGUE

702
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:21,975
I really

703
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,144
cherish this hat.

704
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,109
You can have it.

705
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,074
Are you really giving it to me?

706
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:43,705
Hey, what's gotten into you?
You're making my heart flutter.

707
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,456
Just because of this?

708
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,423
Thanks.

709
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,641
Are you that sad to leave?

710
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,191
I'm scared.

711
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:20,033
Studying is your hobby,
so what's there to be scared of?

712
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,577
You're also really good at English.

713
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,792
Take courage, my friend.

714
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,795
Okay.

715
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,285
Ra-ra, how are you?

716
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,371
Other than missing Jun terribly,

717
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:07,830
I'm doing fine.

718
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,457
-Why?
-I was checking on you.

719
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,460
Jun told me to take good care of you.

720
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,630
-I want to propose to Jun.
-Propose?

721
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,507
I've always received things from him.

722
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,717
How about having a Christmas party?

723
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,553
We can also hold a LaLa Land Concert.

724
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:26,683
My dear dodosolsollalasol,
I'm waiting for you.

725
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,686
Jun won't be returning here ever again.

726
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,814
Jun couldn't come here.

727
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,732
He didn't make it back.

728
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:39,529
Ra-ra, you should just cry
when you're sad.

729
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,657
Cry and let it all out today
so that you can start over tomorrow.

730
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:45,743
I'm sending you the stars.

731
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:49,372
I hope the stars shine down brightly
on your future.

732
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:53,584
