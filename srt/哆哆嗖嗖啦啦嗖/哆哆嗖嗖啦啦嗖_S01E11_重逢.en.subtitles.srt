EPISODE 11

2
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,432
What is going on?

3
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,977
Is she seeing some other guy?

4
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,229
SEUNG-GI

5
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,609
Hello?

6
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:09,652
It's me.

7
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,073
I miss you, Ra-ra.

8
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,327
I want to see you.

9
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,580
Do you still have the ticket?

10
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,749
Let's meet at the dock.

11
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,720
Ra-ra, are you listening?

12
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,890
Okay, I'll see you there.

13
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,745
Ms. Gu Ra-ra?

14
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,331
Yes.

15
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,627
I'll make this brief.

16
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,004
Where did you agree

17
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,007
to meet Jun?

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,479
Ra-ra!

19
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,499
-Did you wait long?
-Yes, for a very long time.

20
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,130
-Let's go home, okay?
-Wait!

21
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,718
Mom, give me 30 minutes.
No. Just 10 minutes.

22
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,346
I have something to tell her.

23
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,440
How did you know?

24
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,151
Get them in the car.

25
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,802
In the end, I had to say goodbye to you

26
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,848
without a chance to tell you anything.

27
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:48,519
EPISODE 11
REUNION

28
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:53,024
A MONTH LATER

29
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,529
Getting his hair done again?

30
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,865
Will the down perm even work for him?

31
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,245
-How many times has he been here?
-Every day.

32
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,287
-Right?
-Goodness.

33
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,915
-Jeez.
-Look at you, Min-su.

34
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,126
You've been coming here every single day.

35
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,629
-My gosh.
-That hurt!

36
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,422
I'll lose all my hair from the perm.

37
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,259
You got the hot perm two weeks ago.

38
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,886
Last week, you dyed your hair
and got a digital perm.

39
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,097
And you get a blowout every two days.

40
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,225
Your hair is barely hanging on
because it's so damaged.

41
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,935
Gosh, your hair is a mess!

42
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,604
Your hair is falling out.
It's all breaking off.

43
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,525
That is why I asked
for a nourishing hair treatment!

44
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,319
My gosh, what are you two doing right now?

45
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:42,156
Are you just bickering with each other?
Or is this a lovers' quarrel?

46
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,617
-There's something going on.
-Something's going on!

47
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,160
Shut it!

48
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,580
Stop talking nonsense and go home already.

49
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,125
Nice one.

50
00:04:54,794 --> 00:05:00,091
By the way, Min-su, are you planning
to stay in Eunpo for good?

51
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,802
Did I not tell you
that I'm originally from here?

52
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,345
-What?
-Really?

53
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,556
No, you never told us.

54
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,517
I have a lot of friends here,

55
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,602
so I'm thinking
of starting a business here.

56
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,357
I see. Starting a business,
or a relationship?

57
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,112
Gosh, seriously.

58
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,072
The suspect who abandoned a man's body

59
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,743
found in Eunpo Marine Park in July
has been caught.

60
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,537
-Quiet down for a second.
-While investigating An Jung-ho,

61
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,039
a suspect in the case,

62
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,249
the police have found bloodstains
in his bathroom.

63
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,459
DNA test results revealed…

64
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,085
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

65
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,380
Does that mean
An Jung-ho, the guy who stalked Ra-ra,

66
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,216
killed the man found in Eunpo Marine Park?

67
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,848
Hang on a second.
Didn't they say that the man had drowned?

68
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,767
Yes, I think you're right.

69
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,103
You have such a sharp memory.

70
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,105
Too bad Seung-gi doesn't take after you.

71
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,192
You're complimenting me
just so you can brag about Ye-seo's IQ.

72
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,610
-Her IQ is 145.
-Jeez.

73
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,362
Here you go again,
talking about whose kid is better.

74
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,115
I feel so left out
because I don't have a kid.

75
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,285
If he drowned, was he pushed into the sea?

76
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,497
He killed him in his bathroom
and dumped the body in the sea.

77
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,999
Detective Kang told me.

78
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,586
Shall I fill you in on the story?

79
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,796
-Yes!
-Tell us.

80
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,633
Here, tell us.

81
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:29,305
The guy who died was a thief.

82
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,308
I heard he slashed countless bags
near the terminal.

83
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,436
So, was he like a pickpocket?

84
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,146
-Bingo.
-Well done.

85
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,526
But one day, he stole An Jung-ho's watch
by ill luck.

86
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,782
-Gosh.
-Then what happened?

87
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,408
An Jung-ho lost it

88
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,285
-because he stole his watch.
-Right.

89
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,704
So he took him to his bathroom and…

90
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,999
-Why? What did he do?
-He tortured him with water.

91
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,084
Then in the end…

92
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,797
-My gosh!
-That is horrible.

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,091
Anyway, he's ruthless.

94
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,718
No wonder he got me,
who used to be in the special forces.

95
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,637
What? You were in the special forces?

96
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,847
Yes, you know.

97
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,435
What was that? Look at him boasting.

98
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,436
-Enough.
-What?

99
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,439
At this rate, Suk-gyeong will throw
a knee strike at you.

100
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,275
Gosh, seriously. Get a taste of this!

101
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,945
The special forces and a knee strike.
You're a match made in heaven.

102
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,698
Right, Ra-ra.

103
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,783
How's Ra-ra doing?

104
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,285
-Right.
-Is she all right?

105
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,675
She's up there again.

106
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,053
Is she looking at the ocean or the sky?

107
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,847
She's looking at Santa Lucia.

108
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,725
The ferry? Why?

109
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,186
She promised Jun
she'd get on the ferry with him

110
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,771
-but went there with his mom.
-What?

111
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,858
Finding out who Jun really is
must've been a big shock to her.

112
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,404
Jun was dragged away because of her.
She must feel terrible.

113
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,698
Right, I get it.

114
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,284
Ra-ra seems a bit strange these days.

115
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,889
I'm always hungry these days.

116
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,062
-How many dumplings do you want?
-Two!

117
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,980
-I want ten.
-Ten?

118
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,857
Your stomach might burst.

119
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,359
That's okay.

120
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,903
Are you really okay
with your stomach bursting?

121
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,239
I want lots! Ten dumplings, please.

122
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,157
She's been eating so much.

123
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,534
Also,

124
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,040
she keeps dancing
even though she's a bad dancer.

125
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,302
Dumdi Dumdi

126
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,221
Dumdi Dum

127
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,892
Dumdi Dumdi

128
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,812
And she even plays cards
with my mom these days.

129
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,690
You earn 20 points
if you have 4 of these cards.

130
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,527
And 30 points for the red and blue cards.
I've told you many times.

131
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,153
You're so bad with numbers.

132
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,196
Let's do it again.

133
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,366
You know how she is.

134
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,535
I know she's always been quirky.

135
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,830
But this time,
it feels a little different.

136
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,834
How should I put this?
She keeps trying new things.

137
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,544
She's trying to distract herself.

138
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,296
What?

139
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,424
It's because she has a lot on her mind.

140
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,760
By the way, you haven't heard
from Jun either?

141
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,763
No, I haven't heard anything from him
since that day.

142
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,474
Gosh, that coldhearted jerk.

143
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,060
So he's forgotten everything
and is starting over?

144
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,199
-You should eat something.
-I don't want to.

145
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,546
Will you starve yourself to death?
You'll become malnourished.

146
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,299
-I don't care.
-How can you say that?

147
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,679
You need to be physically healthy
to be able to study.

148
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,391
If you want to take the GED test
next spring and the exam in the fall,

149
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,519
you don't have time to waste.
You heard what your tutor said!

150
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,650
Just give me back my phone.

151
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,862
Jun, please…

152
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:59,158
I wonder how Jun managed
to completely fool all of us.

153
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,743
I know, right?

154
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,995
Who knew he was the same age as Seung-gi?

155
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,497
-Exactly.
-Totally.

156
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,667
Who knew his dad was the director
of Sunwoo Hospital? What a shocker.

157
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,043
-Yes.
-Gosh.

158
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,504
Are you all blind or what?

159
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,673
-How dare you!
-What did you say?

160
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,424
Are you insulting us?

161
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,094
He did well in school,
and his family is rich.

162
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,304
Why did he run away from home?

163
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,140
I don't know the details,

164
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,769
but his mother
is ridiculously overbearing.

165
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,356
She used to call me all the time
and yell at me.

166
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,485
You know how some people
just make you feel smothered.

167
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,861
She's like that.

168
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,240
I had no idea.
I told her everything about Ra-ra.

169
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,825
Gosh, me and my mouth.

170
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,410
We didn't know she was Jun's mom.

171
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:46,163
Anyway, I have to say, Jun is very gutsy.

172
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,917
Technically, he's still in high school.
I can't believe he fell

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,377
for a divorcée

174
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,587
whose family has gone bankrupt.

175
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,174
Those things don't matter
when you love someone.

176
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,761
And they didn't know they'd end up
catching feelings for each other.

177
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,140
-You're right.
-That is true.

178
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,936
-I'm back.
-I'm here to hang out.

179
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,354
You're here to hang out, son?

180
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,106
-Mom?
-You brat.

181
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,401
You're here to hang out
when the CSAT is around the corner?

182
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,528
-Go home.
-I don't care whether

183
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,448
you're going to study or not,
but put the damn phone down.

184
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,575
-Just disconnect the Wi-Fi.
-Yes!

185
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,493
-No, you can't do that.
-Ma'am.

186
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,079
-What?
-You know how we need oxygen to breathe?

187
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,622
So what?

188
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,374
Wi-Fi is like oxygen to us.

189
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,751
That punk needs a beating.

190
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,545
-Seung-gi!
-Gosh. Hey, come here!

191
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,380
-No!
-You brat! Stop right there. Stop!

192
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,174
Jeez! Goodness gracious.

193
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,555
Here you go.

194
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,813
This isn't about you.
I just don't trust Jun, that's all.

195
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,149
I'll return it to you when you're done.

196
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,693
I understand.

197
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:09,246
I'm sure you'll cover everything he needs
for his college admission.

198
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,540
By any chance, do you know

199
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,543
someone named Bang Jeong-nam?

200
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,379
Yes, I know Jeong-nam very well.

201
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,340
He was my first student.

202
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,717
He got into the med school
at Hanguk University.

203
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,261
His mom and I are quite close.
Why do you ask?

204
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,181
Then let me ask you a favor.

205
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,517
Please make sure

206
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,813
you don't tell her anything about Jun.

207
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,526
You've known me long enough.

208
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,987
Don't you worry about that.

209
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,532
Right, of course.

210
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,745
Jun was always a studious student,
and he's smart on top of that.

211
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:53,249
So academically,
I'm not worried so much about him.

212
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,043
But the thing is, his mind is elsewhere.

213
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,296
We're not making any progress.

214
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,924
He had a girlfriend, didn't he?

215
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,513
Oh, it was nothing serious.
You don't need to worry about that.

216
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:11,308
I'll get it all sorted out.

217
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,688
Okay.

218
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,692
Darn it.

219
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,765
How long will you keep this up?

220
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,350
I'll be back very soon.

221
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,145
I didn't get to tell Ra-ra anything.
She must be devastated.

222
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,647
Ra-ra?

223
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,319
How about you worry about your mom
who keeps watch all night for your sake?

224
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,864
How could you fall
for such a pathetic girl?

225
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,910
Ra-ra or whatever her name is.
Do you know that she was

226
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,203
engaged to Dr. Bang
at your dad's hospital?

227
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,415
Why is that important?
I don't care about stuff like that.

228
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,876
What do you mean you don't care?
It's embarrassing!

229
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,673
That shameless woman
needs to know her place.

230
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,052
-I liked her first.
-You brat!

231
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,307
If your dad finds out, you're finished.

232
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,225
He might teach her a serious lesson.

233
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,855
Tell him to do whatever he wants.

234
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,440
I'm going to protect her.

235
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,035
You moron.

236
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,896
That was great, Mr. Kim!

237
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,108
Because you changed the sheet music
so it's easy for me to read.

238
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,318
Right? I'm very good at stuff like this.

239
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,864
This would have made my wife very happy.

240
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,867
Why did she have to die so soon
and leave me behind like this?

241
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,120
It's the first anniversary
of her death soon.

242
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,748
Mr. Kim.

243
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:25,044
Then why don't you have your own recital
and play "The Maiden's Prayer" that day?

244
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,671
A recital? I'm not good enough for that.

245
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,549
-Gosh, don't even.
-Come on. What are you talking about?

246
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,301
You're very good, so don't worry.

247
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,677
Just practice the piece

248
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,846
and think that you're playing it
for your wife.

249
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,268
Then,

250
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,731
-shall I give it a shot?
-Yes, please!

251
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,779
Then what do I need to prepare?
Invitations and…

252
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,907
We'll need some snacks too.

253
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,202
You haven't heard from Jun, right?

254
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,704
He must be dealing with some stuff.

255
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,332
You know Jun well enough.

256
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,668
Mr. Kim.

257
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,297
I didn't even know his real age.

258
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,758
I had no idea that he was a runaway kid

259
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,511
and that his dad is the director
of Sunwoo Foundation.

260
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,722
If I think about it,
I knew so little about him.

261
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,935
You may not have known his background,

262
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,479
but you know very well about him.

263
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,524
That he may act tough,
but he has a soft heart.

264
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,452
And that he can smile
although he always pretends to be angry.

265
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,703
-Don't eat it.
-I will.

266
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,083
That he may seem cold,
but he's warmhearted.

267
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,459
That feels so nice.

268
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,845
You already knew
who he truly is all along.

269
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,600
You're right, Mr. Kim.

270
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,728
You once asked me

271
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,857
why I'd waited five years
before I got married.

272
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,276
Why? You should've gotten married sooner.

273
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,236
I had no money.

274
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,822
I got married after barely managing
to get a small room.

275
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,118
To tell you the truth,
there was another reason.

276
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:25,038
Sun-ja and I broke up once
before we got married.

277
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,790
Really? Why?

278
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,002
Back then, there were no cell phones.

279
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,129
I had no way of contacting her,

280
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,674
so I thought I'd never see her again.

281
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,719
But we met again.

282
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:45,142
If you're meant to be, destiny will find
its way to bring you back together.

283
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,519
SEOUL, 1960

284
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,327
I love this song so much. Do you like it?

285
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,705
Yes, I do. It sounds dreamy.

286
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,085
I absolutely love the sound of the piano.

287
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,589
And she looks so lovely
when she plays the piano.

288
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,051
Whenever she's playing the piano,

289
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,013
I pick up a cleaning cloth
and go to her room on purpose.

290
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,477
I listen to it in secret
while cleaning her room.

291
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,608
Oh, no. I'm late.

292
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,527
She asked me to pick up some hotteok.
It'll get cold.

293
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,030
Just wait until this song's over.

294
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,117
Shall I?

295
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,046
Sun-ja.

296
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,080
My gosh, I love your story.

297
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,792
You two were head over heels
for each other, so why did you break up?

298
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,594
This is my first blind date,
so I came with no expectations.

299
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,806
I had no idea
it'd be with such a beautiful lady.

300
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,060
-Well…
-If you're done with your tea,

301
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,313
how about we go over to Deoksugung?

302
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,194
I'm really sorry.

303
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,907
I'm already seeing someone.

304
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,329
I just couldn't say no
when my employer asked me to do this.

305
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,873
I'm really sorry.

306
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,936
Man-bok!

307
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,403
I'm sorry.

308
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,156
I really went there to tell him I'm taken.

309
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,370
Please don't get the wrong idea.

310
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,417
Are you not going to talk to me?

311
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:03,757
Sun-ja.

312
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,261
Yes, Man-bok.

313
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,180
Let's…

314
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,434
end this.

315
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,440
That was so cruel.

316
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,026
I'm sure she went there
to tell him that she was taken.

317
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,987
I can't believe you broke up so easily.

318
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,824
That man

319
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,952
was wearing a nice pair of shoes
and a fancy suit.

320
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,662
And he seemed like a nice guy.

321
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,624
So I thought she'd be better off
with a man like him

322
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:41,211
instead of suffering for marrying
someone like me who had nothing.

323
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,173
At the time, I thought
that was the best I could do for her.

324
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:49,386
So I went ahead and moved
my shoe repair shop without telling her.

325
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,085
Let's…

326
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,296
end this.

327
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,551
I was young and didn't know any better,
so I ended up hurting her a lot.

328
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,313
Hey!

329
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,815
Who said you could touch my piano?

330
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,862
But I didn't touch it.

331
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,156
I just wiped it with a cleaning cloth.

332
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,741
I really didn't touch it.

333
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,161
Are you telling the truth?

334
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,371
Yes.

335
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,209
Then about two months later,

336
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,505
I went over to that house
because I missed Sun-ja so much.

337
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,805
May I help you?

338
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,101
Hello, I'm Kim Man-bok.

339
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,231
I'm here to see Sun-ja, your housekeeper.

340
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,151
Sun-ja? Why do you need to see her?

341
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,405
Are you her boyfriend?

342
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:37,452
Yes, I'm someone who wants to marry her.

343
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,873
She's probably asleep now.

344
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,541
She goes to bed very early.

345
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,834
Then…

346
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,421
Could you please make sure she gets this?

347
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,063
You're back.

348
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,900
You got a letter.

349
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,071
Here.

350
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,367
Thank you.

351
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,912
Who is this from?

352
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,792
Oh, right. I forgot you're illiterate.

353
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,880
Her family was poor, so she had
to look after her siblings

354
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,883
before moving to Seoul
to work as a live-in maid when she was 15.

355
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,137
That's why she never learned to read,

356
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,222
but I didn't know that back then.

357
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,850
It's from Kim Man-bok.

358
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,270
Man-bok?

359
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,274
Are you sure it's from Kim Man-bok?

360
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,068
-Shall I read it to you?
-Yes, please.

361
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,951
"I broke up with you
because I have nothing,

362
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,830
but I've realized
that I can't live without you.

363
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,875
I'm sorry I made you wait for so long.

364
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,168
Sim Sun-ja.

365
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:12,088
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you."

366
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,427
Are you going to marry this Man-bok guy?

367
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,933
Wait until I get married.
Can't you get married after that?

368
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,687
Who's going to cook, clean, and do laundry
if you're gone?

369
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,106
Who will run my errands?

370
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,733
That's…

371
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:36,196
"If your answer is yes,
meet me this Saturday at five…"

372
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,947
Come to Geumseong Coffee Shop.

373
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:44,204
"Come to Jungang Coffee Shop."

374
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,540
Jungang Coffee Shop.

375
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,460
Good?

376
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,802
Man-bok.

377
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,889
Man-bok.

378
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,566
GEUMSEONG COFFEE SHOP

379
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,240
We have to close soon.

380
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,659
Are you ordering coffee or what?

381
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,454
Gosh, you've been here for hours.

382
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,603
So I couldn't meet Sun-ja that day.

383
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,104
Oh, no.

384
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:37,108
I took that as a no,

385
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,444
so I moved as far as I could

386
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:43,406
so that I could forget her.
That's why I ended up here in Eunpo.

387
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,368
Wait, then when and how
did you two meet again?

388
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,380
Si-a.

389
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,384
So you really opened a piano academy.

390
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,643
It's scary to come here alone.

391
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,145
You saved my life,
so you can do this much for me.

392
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:18,525
You don't look like such a sissy.
You said you were in the special forces!

393
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,070
We're here now,
so let's go see the doctor.

394
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,074
Anything on my face?

395
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,661
It's this way.

396
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,291
My gosh, it's been such a long time!

397
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,543
Do I know you?

398
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,255
Oh! Jin Beauty Salon, right?

399
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,424
That's right. I'm Jin Suk-gyeong,
the owner of Jin Beauty Salon.

400
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,011
I guess you came to Eunpo to get your hair
done. What are you doing here?

401
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,723
-I'm here to meet someone.
-Who?

402
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,101
My ex-husband. Have a good day.

403
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,189
Ex-husband? Then she must be a divorcée.

404
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,733
Go see your doctor.
I've got something to do.

405
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,072
Oh, it's this way.

406
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,997
Where's she going?

407
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,419
I'm working.

408
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,088
You keep ignoring my calls and texts,
so I had no choice.

409
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,090
This is the only way to see you.

410
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,926
Why on earth do you have to see me?

411
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,263
I'm really curious about something.

412
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,144
PIANO GU RA-RA

413
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,938
Why are you taking piano lessons from her?

414
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,524
You know
she almost married Jeong-nam, right?

415
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,609
What about it?

416
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,903
I know she almost married him,

417
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,031
but she was also my patient
at this very hospital.

418
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,366
Was she injured or something?

419
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,744
And you were her doctor?

420
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,121
Her doctor?

421
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,043
A bit more, please.

422
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,210
Is this it?

423
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,223
Actually, maybe she cured me.
Not the other way around.

424
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,395
I'd say my piano teacher,
Gu Ra-ra, is my doctor.

425
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,230
She made me smile again.

426
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,316
Are you saying

427
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,361
to my face that you like her?

428
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,696
No, I just had a revelation.

429
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,406
I can't believe this.

430
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,079
Gosh.

431
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,206
Damn it.

432
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,959
I'm here to meet someone. My ex-husband.

433
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:46,005
So Dr. Cha is her ex-husband?

434
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,426
What's wrong?

435
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,348
I can't believe I did Dr. Cha's
ex-wife's hair with these hands.

436
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:01,062
Don't tell me
you had a crush on that doctor.

437
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,231
What?

438
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,358
My gosh, what are you doing?

439
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,819
Go away!

440
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,407
So that softie is her type?

441
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,249
I'm so happy to see you again, Si-a.

442
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,127
It feels nice to see you again.

443
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,296
How did you know I was here?

444
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,799
A close friend and sponsor of mine
told me.

445
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,260
She came to get her hair done
at that salon and saw you.

446
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,720
Who could it be?

447
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,515
You all know my customer
who comes here from Seoul for a blowout.

448
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,226
-I remember.
-She said you looked familiar.

449
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,353
Oh, her?

450
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,773
But how does she know me?

451
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,277
I guess from the graduation recital.

452
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,237
Think of what you did that day.

453
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:07,170
After your father passed away,
it must've been tough for you.

454
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,674
To be honest, I've been feeling guilty
for ignoring your pain.

455
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,762
It's a bit late, but I'm sorry.

456
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,183
Don't be.
You were going through a lot as well.

457
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,811
You had something important going on,
and your mom was ill.

458
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,356
You're right. She's still suffering.

459
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,152
To be frank,

460
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,280
my younger brother was in an accident.

461
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,744
And he died.

462
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,373
Si-a.

463
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,502
It's still tough, but I'm trying to
remember only the good memories.

464
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,922
Unlike me,
Ji-hun had a cheerful personality.

465
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,592
I seemed more like a son,
and he, a daughter.

466
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,804
That's probably why
it's harder for my mom.

467
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,889
It must've been really tough.

468
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,766
I'm truly sorry.

469
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,852
Despite being your friend, I had no idea.

470
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,688
Let's stop feeling sorry
toward each other.

471
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,441
There was nothing we could do.

472
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,777
Okay.

473
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,864
Actually,

474
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,743
I came here to show you this.

475
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,958
I never saw that photo because
my mom always held onto Ji-hun's phone.

476
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,293
It turned out,
my brother was your number one fan.

477
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,046
My number one fan?

478
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,382
I'm your number one fan.

479
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,008
My fan?

480
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,428
I remember him.

481
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,140
That kid was your brother?

482
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,310
I thought those flowers were for me,
but they were for you.

483
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,437
What a jerk.

484
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,865
What is it?

485
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,995
Si-a.

486
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,497
Do you know him?

487
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,959
Jun? He was Ji-hun's best friend.

488
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,044
They were roommates at the dorm.

489
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,589
They couldn't live without each other.

490
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,884
Right. He also came
to our graduation recital.

491
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,816
That wasn't the first time we had met.

492
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,903
Why go through my stuff?

493
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,530
Did you play the accompaniment too?

494
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,950
Remember the dear friend of mine
I told you about the other day?

495
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,077
The one who did the accompaniment.

496
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,079
He died.

497
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,834
You knew me from the beginning.

498
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,964
So why didn't you say anything, Jun?

499
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,932
-It's still too hot.
-It's just perfect for me.

500
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,184
Hello, sir.

501
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,770
Do you have any for my family?

502
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,106
Let's see…

503
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,025
There's one for your neighbor.

504
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,277
-I'll give it to her.
-Okay.

505
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,904
Sunwoo Foundation?

506
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,865
-Is she Jun's mom?
-Darn it.

507
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,450
Why is it so thick?

508
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,288
-Do you think there's money inside?
-Money?

509
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,665
FROM SUNWOO FOUNDATION
TO GU RA-RA

510
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,084
SUNWOO FOUNDATION

511
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,044
What should we do? She's crying.

512
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,548
Gosh, did that woman send her
a threatening letter or something?

513
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,051
Or maybe she's disappointed
in the amount of money.

514
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,969
Ouch, that hurts.

515
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,180
What do you take her for?

516
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,226
This won't do.

517
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,646
-Let's go.
-To where?

518
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,231
-To Seoul.
-Are you serious?

519
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:23,069
I'm going to Jun's to cause a scene.

520
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,030
You grab that jerk who's been ignoring

521
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,699
our calls and messages by the collar.

522
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,701
I'm going to meet his mom

523
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,412
and tell her to leave poor Ra-ra alone

524
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,456
and that she knew nothing about this.

525
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,791
What about our academy?

526
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,334
We'll have to play hooky.

527
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,835
Today is Mr. Kim's performance.

528
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,046
We'll come back before then.

529
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,382
-Should we bring Jun back too?
-Should we?

530
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,054
What are you guys up to
when you should be studying?

531
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,974
Is it your hobby to suspect
your one and only daughter?

532
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,227
Is it my hobby? You little…

533
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,895
-You brat.
-Let's go! Goodbye, ma'am.

534
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,855
I'm going to hit you instead.

535
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,857
How dare you?

536
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,402
Is it my hobby?

537
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,655
Mimi, since I've bawled my eyes out,

538
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,115
should I get back on my feet?

539
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,492
YES!

540
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,287
SUNWOO JUN

541
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,339
Mimi.

542
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,428
Why do you think Jun lied to me?

543
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,013
Should I get mad when I see him?

544
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:34,974
Just punch him?

545
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,517
YOU SHOULDN'T USE VIOLENCE

546
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,477
A hundred punches? Okay.

547
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,813
I'll do as you say.

548
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,314
I NEVER SAID THAT

549
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,484
Are you in?

550
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,278
Dr. Cha.

551
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,780
I couldn't come empty-handed.

552
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,867
Thank you.

553
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,827
They're called mini delphiniums.

554
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,079
Look up their meaning later.

555
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,040
Okay. By the way, what brings you here
so early in the morning?

556
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,793
Ha-yeong asked me to help you.

557
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,379
She said she and Seung-gi
will be running late.

558
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,798
They must be busy studying.

559
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,258
Perhaps.

560
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:35,034
I guess the buildings here
are slightly taller than ours.

561
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,578
Hey, don't you worry.

562
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,332
I've already mastered
the subway and bus lines in Seoul.

563
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,835
Look. We'll take the Gyeongui-Jungang
Line, go to Wangsimni Station,

564
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,587
then switch to the Bundang Line,

565
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,756
get off at the Gangnam-gu
Office Station, and

566
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,258
-go to Exit Three. After five-stops--
-Here!

567
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,260
Hey, wait up!

568
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,683
RESERVED

569
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,560
You can call cabs using an app.

570
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,149
You're a genius. Wait for me.

571
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,822
Are you sure this is it?

572
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,492
60 CHEONGMUN 3-RO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL

573
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,205
You better not underestimate her.
Be careful.

574
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,875
You better keep this secret from my mom.

575
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,837
What a meticulous, little girl. Keeping
secrets is my occupational disease.

576
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,340
He's richer than I thought.

577
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,301
-Hey, ring the doorbell.
-Me?

578
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,221
-Then should I?
-No. I should do it.

579
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,143
-Who is it?
-Hello.

580
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,981
You see, I'm… Well…

581
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,150
We're Jun's friends.

582
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,485
I see.

583
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,445
Who is it?

584
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,824
They're your son's friends from Eunpo.

585
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,866
Eunpo?

586
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,787
Go outside and tell them Jun's not here.

587
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,456
-And tell them never to come back here.
-Yes, ma'am.

588
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,043
I'm already having a headache as is.

589
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,337
Why did those rascals come here?

590
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,756
This is so annoying.

591
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,135
She needs to show herself
for me to confront her.

592
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,053
Darn it.

593
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,180
Should I climb over?

594
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,975
Seriously? Can you do it?

595
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,020
Come on. I'm known
as the flying squirrel of Eunpo.

596
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,064
This is when my height comes in handy.

597
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,401
Hey.

598
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,448
-Is that the police?
-Hey, run!

599
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,577
Oh, gosh!

600
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,164
911 EMERGENCY

601
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,085
-What's going on?
-What is this?

602
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,253
Did someone pass out?

603
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,465
Hurry up.

604
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,508
Is that Jun?

605
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,927
Sunwoo Hospital's emergency center. Go.

606
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,643
We should also go there.

607
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,061
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

608
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,946
KIM MAN-BOK'S RECITAL
"THE MAIDEN'S PRAYER"

609
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,413
All right.

610
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,750
-Thank you.
-No problem.

611
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,133
-Dr. Cha!
-Oh, dear!

612
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,135
Look at that.

613
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,679
You little wench. Where are you?

614
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,182
You skipped the academy.
Where are you? Why aren't you here?

615
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,393
I'm sorry. I have my reasons.

616
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,645
Mr. Kim's recital will start soon.

617
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,565
Congratulate him for me.

618
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,401
I'll be home by tonight.

619
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,069
What is going on?

620
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,738
Mom, I'm busy right now. Bye.

621
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,326
She's a senior but doesn't study.

622
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,912
She's always up to something. Darn it.

623
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,124
Oh, my.

624
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,463
Goodness, Mr. Kim.
I almost didn't recognize you.

625
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,090
Can you blow-dry my hair?

626
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,093
Of course. Sit down. Here.

627
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,726
You still look young and handsome enough
to get married again.

628
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,770
Don't be ridiculous.

629
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,857
I'm going to marry Sun-ja all over again.

630
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,110
You're going to startle her
and wake her up from her grave.

631
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,279
She's going to say, "No, thanks."

632
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:43,073
-Am I really that bad?
-That's why…

633
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,951
Right at this moment

634
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,995
I'm here for you.

635
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,331
All right. How much taller
do you want to be?

636
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,792
Three centimeters? Five centimeters?

637
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,129
Ten centimeters, please.

638
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,715
Let's do this.

639
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,844
All right. Here we go.

640
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,556
KIM MAN-BOK'S RECITAL
"THE MAIDEN'S PRAYER"

641
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:10,976
Thank you for waiting.

642
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,062
Thank you so much for making time
to come here tonight.

643
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:21,612
Okay, then. Let's meet Mr. Kim Man-bok,
the star of today. Mr. Kim Man Bok!

644
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,661
You look amazing!

645
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,093
GEUMSEONG COFFEE SHOP

646
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,357
Mr. Kim, how did you meet your wife again?

647
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,571
It was thanks to this piece.

648
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,281
YEAR 1962

649
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,841
JEIL MUSIC SHOP

650
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,183
She forgot my face and my name,

651
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,645
and this music was the last memory
she had.

652
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,938
But I wasn't sad at all.

653
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,652
Because I was part of the music.

654
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,451
Honey.

655
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,120
Thank you.

656
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,625
I will go

657
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,919
in peace now.

658
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,565
"Pleasure of Love" is the piece
I'll be playing.

659
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,748
SUNWOO FOUNDATION

660
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,720
"PLEASURE OF LOVE"

661
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,730
RA-RA, HOW ARE YOU?

662
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,152
YOU MUST'VE BEEN SURPRISED
I'M TRULY SORRY

663
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,745
RA-RA, I MISS YOU

664
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,551
"PLEASURE OF LOVE"

665
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,553
It's nothing much,

666
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,722
but Sunwoo Foundation would like to send
some letters of gratitude.

667
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,479
Of course, we're always thankful.

668
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:34,818
Okay. Stay healthy. Thank you.

669
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,366
SUNWOO FOUNDATION

670
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,958
Ma'am, could you go
to the post office for me?

671
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:53,253
These letters need to arrive by tomorrow,
so please hurry!

672
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,187
Jun.

673
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,482
The feelings I had were indescribable.

674
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,817
Jun.

675
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,696
But she understood.

676
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,460
They're your son's friends from Eunpo.

677
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:40,253
Eunpo?

678
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,548
Go outside and tell them Jun's not here.

679
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,426
-And tell them never to come back here.
-Yes, ma'am.

680
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,324
Ma'am!

681
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,867
What's wrong with him?

682
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,119
Hurry up.

683
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,624
911 EMERGENCY

684
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,836
-We should also go there. Let's go.
-Let's go.

685
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:37,602
Hey, what if your mom beats me to death?

686
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,107
Thanks.

687
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:46,361
Hey, I'm really terrified.

688
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,156
Be brave, my friend.

689
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,287
Hey. Good luck anyway.

690
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:32,198
My head feels like it's about to explode
because I can only think of you.

691
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,491
Ra-ra.

692
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,285
I won't do anything you don't like.

693
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:39,497
But say that you will keep the promise
you made me that day.

694
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,708
But it's different at Jun's age.

695
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:47,881
He loved me sincerely
and filled my heart with joy.

696
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:54,179
Please help Jun get his life back
and return to where he belongs.

697

There are times when you must
give up the things you cherish.

00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,685
I'm heartbroken

00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,606

I might really never get to see him again.

If I made you cry, I'm sorry.
