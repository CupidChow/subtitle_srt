EPISODE 14

2
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,595
-May I see this one, please?
-Sure.

3
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,444
Sunwoo Jun.

4
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,790
Jung Ga-yeong?

5
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:25,919
Found you.

6
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,719
Didn't you miss me?

7
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,976
Not really.

8
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,439
You're still so cold.

9
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,369
Fine, drink it.

10
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,832
Ji-hun, can I have that?

11
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,835
What? Okay. Sure.

12
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,294
Thanks.

13
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,006
Do you think…

14
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,676
she likes me?

15
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,011
Gosh, it must feel great to be popular.

16
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,347
I'm too popular for my own good.

17
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,559
You can let go now.

18
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,605
Are you okay?

19
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,527
Oh, my.

20
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,656
Ji-hun, let's go to the library.

21
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,657
Hey, Jung Ga-yeong.

22
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,827
Shouldn't you
apologize to me properly first?

23
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,496
You two should stop
being joined at the hip.

24
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,248
That's exactly why you got hit.

25
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,126
Should all of us go to the library?
Let's do that.

26
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,295
I don't want to.

27
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,589
Hey.

28
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,717
Did you chose your career path?

29
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,260
It's medicine, right?

30
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,097
No, I'm going to major in mathematics.

31
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,558
I want to go to MIT or Stanford.

32
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,518
Your parents are okay with it?

33
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,812
My mom's always on my side anyway.

34
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,858
Should I tag along?

35
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:18,364
Then shall we set our sights
on winning the Fields Medal together?

36
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,408
Shall we?

37
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,701
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

38
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,871
The Fields Medal is mine.

39
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,791
You know I won a gold medal
at the Math Olympiad, right?

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,503
So I'm afraid I'll have to join you.

41
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,050
Ga-yeong, be honest.
You like me, don't you?

42
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,968
Think whatever you like.

43
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,941
Rumor had it that you quit school
and went abroad to study.

44
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,068
But I didn't see you there.

45
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,863
I got into Stanford.

46
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,532
The college you and Ji-hun
wanted to go to.

47
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,412
I see.

48
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,538
Congratulations.

49
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,750
I thought you'd keep the promise
you made with him.

50
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,127
Then where were you?

51
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,837
Why do you want to know that?

52
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,674
Were you going to elope
with some lame woman?

53
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,843
I saw a video online

54
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,929
of you crashing a wedding.

55
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,433
Did you run away from home
because of Ji-hun?

56
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:31,646
Why were you looking for me?
To pester and take revenge on me?

57
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,357
Revenge?

58
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,779
It was because I like you.

59
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,244
But…

60
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,998
you had a crush on Ji-hun.

61
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,376
You've always been slow on the uptake.

62
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,922
You're the one I had a crush on.

63
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:07,515
So why don't you be kind to me
from now on?

64
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,860
EPISODE 14
"A FURTIVE TEAR"

65
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,705
A SPECIAL PROMISE

66
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,548
Here's your juice!

67
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,300
Gosh, you startled me.

68
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:47,180
Ra-ra, make a sound when you walk.
I have a weak heart.

69
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,765
-You like Ha-yeong, right?
-No.

70
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,641
Don't lie.

71
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,019
Drink this.

72
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,691
But how did you know?

73
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,570
Seung-gi, if someone as dull as me
noticed that,

74
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,281
it's safe to say everyone here knows
as well.

75
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,454
-I'm so jealous.
-Of what?

76
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,289
Of the time you've spent together.

77
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:18,044
Ms. Gong Mi-suk,
my longtime mentor, told me once

78
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,338
that time is the most powerful thing.

79
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,091
She said my playing would sound better
with time.

80
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,343
I see.

81
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:30,306
But you know what?
Ha-yeong is so busy falling for other guys

82
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,183
that there's no space for me.

83
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,768
Do you really believe that?

84
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,312
Yes, it's obvious.

85
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,357
Oh, right. When will you see Jun?

86
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,609
I heard you'll be visiting him instead.

87
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,904
So that he can spend more time studying.

88
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,325
We agreed to meet on the day
he finishes his mock exam.

89
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,537
You better keep that promise.

90
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,331
If he doesn't see you,
he'll come here right away.

91
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,250
I know.

92
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,545
Brother Tes

93
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,046
Brother Tes

94
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,133
Why is the world like this?

95
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:09,387
Why is it full of hardships?

96
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,014
Brother Tes

97
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,474
Welcome.

98
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,102
Oh, my. I did your hair
earlier today, right?

99
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,396
How did the blind date go?

100
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,480
Forget it.

101
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,984
It's all your fault that it fell through,
so give me a refund.

102
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,987
Pardon?

103
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,157
It turned out that the guy likes
long, natural hair.

104
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,326
But you suggested this perm,
and everything fell through.

105
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,123
Come on. You can get your hair done again.

106
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,667
And half of the world population is men.

107
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,377
Do you want to get it done again?

108
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,588
Just give me a refund, already.

109
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,424
I want to charge you for the time wasted

110
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,302
and the emotional damage
that I've suffered.

111
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,804
But forget about that
and just give me a refund.

112
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,348
Ma'am, it's not like your hair got ruined

113
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,559
or the perm didn't turn out well.

114
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,062
Gosh, you're so noisy.

115
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,397
Hey, old lady.

116
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,318
"Old lady"? Are you talking to me?

117
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,113
Then who else here is an old lady?

118
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,116
-Hey, I'm still single.
-I don't care.

119
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,368
Why is it my mom's fault
that your date failed?

120
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,080
From the way I see it,
even if you had long, natural hair,

121
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,624
he would've still rejected you.

122
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,502
-Stop it.
-Are you done talking?

123
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,753
No, not yet.

124
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,089
You must think you can do this
just because you paid some money.

125
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,258
But she's not your emotional trash can!

126
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,218
What?

127
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,428
Gosh, stop it, you brat!

128
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,141
Ma'am, I'll give you
a better hairdo, okay?

129
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,353
I'm sorry. I truly am.

130
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,021
-Sit down.
-Mom!

131
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,481
Come on!

132
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,525
Will you give me a refund or not?

133
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,112
Please sit down for now. I'm sorry.

134
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,867
Here you go. Happy?

135
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,038
You should've done this sooner.
God, this is irritating.

136
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,623
Wait. Ma'am.

137
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,668
Mom. Don't you ever come back,
you obnoxious woman!

138
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,379
I can't believe her.

139
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,173
Why did you give her a refund?

140
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,926
I'm so annoyed. Where's your self-respect?

141
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,178
Why did you fawn over someone like her?

142
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,597
You should've omitted
the cost of the perming agent.

143
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,517
Why did you refund it in full?
Gosh, what a waste!

144
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,854
Do you love money that much?

145
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,399
What's so terrible
about making a bit less money?

146
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,860
Why did you give her money
when you're not making any?

147
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,905
-Here.
-Forget it.

148
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,659
Goodness.

149
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,202
Take it.

150
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,122
No. I don't need that money.

151
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,499
I don't want the money you earn
being pathetic!

152
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,464
Jin Ha-yeong.

153
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,634
Nothing's pathetic when it comes to money.

154
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,931
This is how I made money to raise you.

155
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,977
If I didn't swallow my pride
and acted however I liked,

156
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,479
we would've been homeless.

157
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,858
Did I ask you to live like that?

158
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,568
Did I ask you to do that?

159
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,948
Ha-yeong!

160
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,624
Ha-yeong.

161
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,795
Is something wrong?

162
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,643
Welcome.

163
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,771
Oh, my. My regular customer's come.

164
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,981
Gosh, is something in my eye?

165
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:56,280
Sorry, but could you wait for a minute?

166
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,367
Let me grab something to eat
before my afternoon shift.

167
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,078
I have no time to eat

168
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,873
if I keep receiving customers.

169
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,542
Sit here.

170
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,048
Don't mind me, and take your time.

171
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,591
Thank you.

172
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:25,059
Usually, I never eat
in front of my customers.

173
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,021
But I need some energy today. I'm sorry.

174
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,535
Goodness. What are you doing?

175
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,496
Sit over there and wait.

176
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,377
I want to use my pass. That's why.

177
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,631
I want to eat with you,
but there's nothing to eat.

178
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,359
I carry them with me all the time
in case I need to use one.

179
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,944
Goodness.

180
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,572
It looks so scrumptious.

181
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,825
I didn't know you could cook.

182
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,454
Didn't I tell you? I'm good with knives.

183
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,333
I'm good with scissors.

184
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,504
Knives, saws, and scissors.

185
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,131
We can be the Three Musketeers.

186
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,800
-Saws?
-Dr. Cha.

187
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,552
He's good with saws.

188
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,223
How does it feel to live with him?

189
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,852
He seems picky, right?

190
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,856
But he's simpler than I thought.

191
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,441
He has a weakness for food.

192
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,235
He's a little greedy for food.

193
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,659
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

194
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,996
All right.

195
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,833
What?

196
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,510
Darn it.

197
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,483
Has he been starving or something?

198
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,248
He never forgets his medication.

199
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,377
Medication? What kind?

200
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,853
Where did I put it?

201
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,565
Did I drop it in Yeong-ju's car?

202
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,706
Eun-seok.

203
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,544
What a surprise. You never call me.

204
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,922
What?

205
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,717
Your pill case?

206
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,427
Okay.

207
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,014
What the hell?

208
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,560
Where could it be?

209
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,024
What kind of pill is it anyway?

210
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,444
He only called me
because he lost his pill case?

211
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,238
Gosh. Where in the world is it?

212
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,370
This must be it.

213
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,873
It's pretty.

214
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,711
What?

215
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,717
Is he sick?

216
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,558
Component analysis?

217
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,603
I do have a friend in the laboratory.

218
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,979
What are they?

219
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,733
They're Eun-seok's.
They look pretty important.

220
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,151
Eun-seok's?

221
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,862
Bring them here. Okay.

222
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,951
I want to quit working here.

223
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,036
By any chance,

224
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,164
are you terminally ill?

225
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,082
Yes.

226
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,086
Was he

227
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,588
telling the truth?

228
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,113
I miss her voice.

229
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,955
From now on, I'll call and visit you.

230
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,209
Don't get distracted
until you reach your goal.

231
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,961
Okay?

232
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,676
Fine. I promised her.

233
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,822
I've been looking for you all day.

234
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,159
Did you cry?

235
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,453
No.

236
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,708
Take this.

237
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,918
What is it?

238
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,881
You want to drink here?

239
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,466
They're for your mom.

240
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,676
She enjoys drinking alone
while watching TV.

241
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,765
You're more worried about her than me?

242
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,435
Because you must've given her
a hard time again.

243
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,395
It's obvious.

244
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,450
It's not here.

245
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,956
Is that you, Ra-ra?

246
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,125
No, it's Ha-yeong.

247
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,004
How did you know without even looking?

248
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,049
I can recognize my daughter's footsteps
right away.

249
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,094
Did you visit Mr. Kim?

250
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,804
How is he doing?

251
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,682
The doctor said that nothing's changed,

252
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,353
but I want to believe
that he's gradually getting better.

253
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,523
You're right. He'll wake up soon.

254
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,611
By the way, are you moving?

255
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,947
There's so much stuff.

256
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,282
I was looking for something.

257
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,869
I remember putting it somewhere safe.

258
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,704
Did I lose it when I moved here?

259
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,331
What are you looking for?

260
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,250
Well…

261
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,671
It's a prenatal music CD
I used to listen to when I was pregnant.

262
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,132
Prenatal music?

263
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,678
I suddenly felt nostalgic,
so I wanted to listen to it.

264
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,850
Goodness, is this Ha-yeong
when she was young?

265
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,103
She's so pretty.

266
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,148
You're right. She was so pretty

267
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,610
that our elderly neighbors said
she should compete for Miss Korea.

268
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:19,366
Really? My dad told me that he heard
the same thing all the time.

269
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,494
Look at you bragging.

270
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,292
I first found out
that I was pregnant with her

271
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,129
on my 20th birthday.

272
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,133
I was a 20-year-old girl with no parents.

273
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,427
I was so terrified.

274
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,639
I was walking down the street,

275
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:47,644
and a record shop was playing
Christmas carols since it was December.

276
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,606
Snow was piled up on the streets.

277
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:55,903
Everyone except me seemed to be so happy.

278
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,490
I was cold and frightened.

279
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,286
I went into the record shop.

280
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,708
I put on whatever headphones
were available and just sobbed.

281
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,753
I didn't care if anyone heard or not.

282
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,133
I only heard beautiful music.

283
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,722
You did well.

284
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,142
I sobbed for a while

285
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,561
and then I found courage.

286
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,523
That's when I decided to become a mom.

287
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,818
I had been alone my entire life.

288
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,529
To think that I'd be having my own family

289
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,034
motivated me to strive for a better life.

290
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,497
But where was your husband?

291
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,252
He ran away.

292
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,713
Just like mine.

293
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,638
I was barely making enough money
to have a meal at that time.

294
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,556
But on that day,

295
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,938
I bought a prenatal music CD
that cost more than 10,000 won.

296
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,776
And I listened to that CD
over and over again.

297
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,990
I wanted my baby to be smart.

298
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,160
I wanted her to be clever.

299
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,414
Gosh, I'm such a mess.

300
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,751
But that wench refuses to study
or listen to me.

301
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,129
Gosh, she makes me so upset.

302
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,050
I'm upset, so I'm going to make
some braised spicy chicken.

303
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,552
What?

304
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,722
I'm going to make it so spicy!

305
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:52,936
I'm going to spank her
once she comes home.

306
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,857
But that's Ha-yeong's favorite dish.

307
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,072
So that's what
a mom and daughter are like.

308
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:08,827
Is it in here?

309
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,884
PRENATAL MUSIC

310
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,801
Found it.

311
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,186
I'll clean up later. Later.

312
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,653
Seung-gi, is Ha-yeong with you?

313
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,406
Yes. She's here.

314
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,866
Hey.

315
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,411
-She wants to talk to you.
-Darn it.

316
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,540
What?

317
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,460
I think your mom's making
braised spicy chicken.

318
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,505
The house smells so good.

319
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,216
Gosh, this is so annoying.

320
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,801
I'm hanging up.

321
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,845
-Here.
-What is it?

322
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,516
I'm going home.

323
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,727
You said you weren't going a minute ago.

324
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,896
Hearts are bound to change.

325
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,648
Bye.

326
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,132
Why a potato when she gave you some meat?

327
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,510
She loves the potatoes the most.

328
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,429
All right. Let's eat.

329
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,392
Wait.

330
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,903
PRENATAL MUSIC

331
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,537
Let's invite Mozart
to today's dinner table.

332
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,209
It suits this meal.

333
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,839
It's so perfect.

334
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,805
Whatever.

335
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,349
Here. Have a drumstick.

336
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,196
All right. What kind of style do you want?

337
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,824
Should I go for a smokey look
and shock Jun?

338
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,368
No, let's go with a colorful look.

339
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,038
-Okay, Ms. Jin.
-Okay.

340
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,558
How did the mock exam go? Hop in.

341
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,185
I have other plans.

342
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,070
Don't follow me.

343
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,072
Then let me give you a ride.

344
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,584
Are you meeting that woman?

345
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,004
-Yes.
-How about we go somewhere else together?

346
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,424
What's with you?

347
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,051
I'm just kidding.

348
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,764
You look tired. Want some coffee?

349
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,850
I made this drip coffee myself.

350
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,438
Thanks.

351
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,357
You can take a nap on the way.

352
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,068
I'm fine. Just focus on driving.

353
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,904
I'll go now.

354
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,257
Am I too early?

355
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,014
I'll just wait.

356
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:42,851
How pretty.

357
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,653
The coffee worked like magic.

358
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,793
It's so pretty.

359
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:26,311
Gosh. At this rate,
she'll soon have no space to sleep.

360
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,690
Fine. She found the CD
which was like Mom's treasure,

361
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,609
so I'll do something nice for her.

362
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,530
Oh, boy. What is all this?

363
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,824
Goodness.

364
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,544
"Wish Box"?

365
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,129
What is this?

366
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:58,176
HA-YEONG AND SEUNG-GI'S WISH BOX

367
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,594
Seung-gi!

368
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,304
-Lee Seung-gi!
-Yes?

369
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,889
What? Where are you?

370
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,015
I'm here.

371
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,059
Hey, come here.

372
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,060
Come, quick!

373
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,105
Hey, do you remember this?

374
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,316
Look, your name is written on it.

375
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,444
I think I put something in here
back in elementary school.

376
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,446
Elementary school?

377
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,242
Hey, you threatened me to do it.

378
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,576
I did?

379
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,706
Lee Seung-gi, write one. Hurry!

380
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,125
10 YEARS AGO

381
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,169
Can't you just put in your wish
without mine?

382
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,338
No, that's no fun.

383
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,842
Then when are we going to open
the time capsule?

384
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,344
I told you. When we grow up.

385
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,472
The one whose wish comes true

386
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,391
will get a gift. Okay?

387
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,936
So I'll get a gift if my wish comes true?

388
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,063
That's right.

389
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,874
Hey, you're right.
We wrote letters and put them in this box.

390
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,671
HA-YEONG AND SEUNG-GI'S WISH BOX

391
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,339
What did I write that day?

392
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,761
Hey, do you have the key for this?

393
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,262
What?

394
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,765
Darn it. Where did I put it?

395
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,559
Let's just do this.

396
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,689
It worked!

397
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,738
What did I write…

398
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,282
MY WISH IS TO MARRY GU SEONG-JUN

399
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,119
"My wish is to marry Gu Seong-jun"?

400
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,914
Who is Gu Seong-jun?

401
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:54,709
The boy who transferred to our school
from Seoul in the summer of third grade.

402
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,045
The lanky kid with pale skin.

403
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,213
He was lanky?

404
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:03,218
I don't remember.
I've had so many crushes over the years.

405
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,511
I can't remember them all.

406
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,348
That's something to be proud of, for sure.

407
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,265
But how is it

408
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,685
that you remember my crushes
way better than I do?

409
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,691
Anyway, my wish hasn't come true.
Let's check yours.

410
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,818
-Shall we?
-Yes.

411
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,702
What is it? Why won't you show me?

412
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,749
Hey, where are you going?

413
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,127
What's with him? What did he write?

414
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,382
PLEASE MAKE JIN HA-YEONG FALL FOR ME

415
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,562
I wonder if something happened.

416
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,565
Did he bomb the exam?

417
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,027
He hasn't even read my messages yet.

418
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,091
Is he not home?

419
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,394
My gosh, Ga-yeong.

420
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,354
Thanks so much for today.

421
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,606
No problem at all.

422
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,567
I was just happy to be with Jun.

423
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,652
I see. All right.

424
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,529
Get home safely, okay?

425
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,698
-Take care.
-Bye.

426
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,421
What?

427
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,924
It's that woman.

428
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,393
I guess you're the type to follow a guy
all the way to his doorstep.

429
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,649
Everything's okay with Jun, right?

430
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,652
Why do you ask? Do you want
something bad to happen to him?

431
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,906
If he's okay, it's all good.

432
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,786
Hey.

433
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,207
Break up with Jun already.

434
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,379
No, I won't.

435
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,433
Gosh, I guess she'll be home late.

436
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,062
I wanted to be complimented.
Why isn't she home yet?

437
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,190
SEUNG-GI

438
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,526
Hey, what's up?

439
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,111
Give me a haircut now.

440
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,321
Now?

441
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,533
Have you lost your mind?
Who gets a haircut this late?

442
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,368
I'll wait for you at Jin Beauty Salon.

443
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,370
What? Hello?

444
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,038
Hey, Seung-gi!

445
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,707
Lee Seung-gi!

446
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,459
Gosh, seriously.

447
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,504
I can't believe he hung up on me.
How rude.

448
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,172
You're so dead.

449
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,386
What's going on?

450
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,513
He said he'd wait here. Where did he go?

451
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,126
Ha-yeong!

452
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,805
Hey, I told you to stop recording.
Goodness.

453
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,350
Hey, stop it!

454
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,146
Ha-yeong.

455
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,408
I like you.

456
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,166
When you're smiling,

457
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,923
when you're sleeping,

458
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,885
and even when you're singing.

459
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,103
I like everything about you.

460
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,273
Jin Ha-yeong!

461
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,401
Are you a pervert?
Why are you recording this?

462
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,904
Why not? Whenever you cry,
I think it looks hilarious.

463
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,825
Don't get dumped by other guys and cry.

464
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,909
You have me,

465
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,788
who's been by your side
for a very long time.

466
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,000
Ha-yeong.

467
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,088
Today is our first day as a couple, okay?

468
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,773
If your answer is yes,

469
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,567
blow out this candle.

470
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,610
BLOW OUT THE CANDLE
AND WE'RE A COUPLE

471
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:20,928
That's your gift.

472
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,763
Gift?

473
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,976
Yes, we said the one whose wish came true
would get a gift.

474
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,939
Please make Jin Ha-yeong fall for me.

475
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,153
"Please make Jin Ha-yeong fall for me"?

476
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,690
Ra-ra.

477
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,533
-Ra-ra.
-Gosh.

478
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,410
Ha-yeong.

479
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,580
What were you thinking about?
You didn't even hear me.

480
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,999
I'm just a little tired.

481
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,588
Ra-ra, doesn't the room look clean today?

482
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,134
Oh, maybe.

483
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,724
You should go to bed.

484
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,726
-Okay.
-Good night.

485
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,996
Is the cleaning going well?

486
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,082
Of course.
No one will know that we were here.

487
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,459
Seung-gi.

488
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,586
Yes?

489
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,924
Ra-ra is acting strange. Maybe
something happened between her and Jun.

490
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,761
From the way she's acting,
it looks like the situation is very bad.

491
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,388
Really?

492
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,931
Yes.

493
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,350
Can you call Jun and find out
what's going on?

494
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,853
Yes, ma'am. You got it.

495
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,986
Those pills that he takes.
Did you find out what they are?

496
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,614
A while back,

497
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,450
I actually asked him

498
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,203
if he was terminally ill.

499
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,751
It sounded like a joke

500
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,462
when he said he was.

501
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,213
What? "Terminally ill"?

502
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,633
Eun-seok is terminally ill?

503
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:09,096
I did wonder if there was some truth
to his joke.

504
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,933
So I thought this might be

505
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,977
an analgesic of some sort, but…

506
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,937
But what? What is it?

507
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,522
Just tell me!

508
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,235
These are just vitamins.

509
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:24,820
What?

510
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,741
He takes such good care of his health.

511
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,577
Thank goodness.

512
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,917
Give me that! I'll give it back to him.

513
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,668
Gosh, you!

514
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,214
-Oh, that guy.
-What?

515
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,758
The guy at the wedding.

516
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,848
What's he doing here?

517
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,226
I swear, I've seen him somewhere.

518
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,352
What?

519
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:04,568
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

520
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,788
Why did he go into the director's office?

521
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,998
He didn't even knock.

522
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,459
He and the director must be close.

523
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,836
Oh, wait.

524
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,421
What?

525
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:24,880
Hang on a second.

526
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,091
Hey, where are you going?

527
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,054
Yes, that's right!

528
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,890
He's the director's son.

529
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,600
I see. What?

530
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,271
What? My gosh.

531
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:45,734
So your ex-wife is dating

532
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,320
the director's son?

533
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,865
Gosh, I can't believe this.

534
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,993
What do I do now?

535
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:58,831
What should I do about this situation?

536
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,211
Call your mom.

537
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,173
-Go on.
-Oh, right.

538
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,008
Yes.

539
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,973
Is everything okay with Ra-ra?

540
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,644
She used to run out of the room
the second she smelled food,

541
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,980
but she hasn't even taken a single step.

542
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,444
Doesn't she usually eat more
when she's going through something?

543
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,778
That's right.

544
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,740
She says she wouldn't even care
if she died from overeating.

545
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,327
Yesterday, I asked her to play cards
with me because she seemed down.

546
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,995
But she said no.

547
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,666
This looks serious.

548
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,170
Girlfriend?

549
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,506
Are you saying Jun is seeing someone else?

550
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,717
That day,

551
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,637
Jun didn't show up.

552
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,223
I waited until it got dark.

553
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,477
That's why you asked me his address.

554
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,772
I went to his house to see if he was okay.

555
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:09,193
And you met his girlfriend there?
Is that it?

556
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,197
Damn it! Jun is such a jerk!

557
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,701
Hey, don't jump to conclusions.
We don't know the full story yet.

558
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,246
Maybe he had his reasons.

559
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,541
-Right?
-Yes.

560
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,709
But he's been ignoring
your calls and texts.

561
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:26,919
Yes.

562
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,506
Maybe you've been
too strict with him lately?

563
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,765
Step out with me for a minute.

564
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,350
To where?

565
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,734
I don't work for free.

566
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,655
How much would you like?

567
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,866
Hey, let's just go.

568
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,247
It'd be better to just do it ourselves.
Go bring your camera.

569
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,083
You're stealing my business.

570
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,587
You just started your business.
Why change the category already?

571
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,007
That's not what I'd call it.
We are expanding our business.

572
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:18,721
I'm an expert when it comes to Jun.
I'm the one who found him in Eunpo.

573
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:22,516
But the cops were the ones who contacted
his mom which was your client.

574
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:29,189
I heard some jerks beat you up
and even took your wallet and phone.

575
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,360
Oh, right. Remember that information
about Secretary Moon?

576
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,321
Even that was wrong.

577
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,908
He does look pretty clumsy,
but don't state the facts so bluntly.

578
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,910
"The facts"?

579
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,329
You little prick.

580
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,164
What facts? What?

581
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,292
Seung-gi, I guess

582
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,420
he doesn't know what a fact means.

583
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,256
Let's go.

584
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,258
Hey.

585
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,219
I won't charge you for this case.

586
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,473
I shall put my honor on the line

587
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,684
and show you how it's done.

588
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:08,854
Will you? Sure.

589
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,076
Jin Ha-yeong, that girl,
is really something.

590
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,536
Did she raise your blood pressure again?

591
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,789
Hey!

592
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,796
Anyway, from Gu Ra-ra
to that mother-daughter pair,

593
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,382
you have to watch out
for all the women in that house.

594
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,551
Hey! They're coming out.

595
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,470
Make sure their faces show.

596
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,771
So he actually did get a girlfriend.

597
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,064
Let's go.

598
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,451
What's wrong?

599
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,745
Hide!

600
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,915
Hey, did he see us?

601
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,375
I don't think so.

602
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,876
Isn't he coming this way?

603
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,461
No, he isn't.

604
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,546
Really?

605
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,676
Damn it.

606
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,892
Did my mom hire you again?

607
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,270
No.

608
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,575
Is it not good?

609
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,493
It's not that.

610
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,874
I brought you here because
Ha-yeong told me you haven't been eating.

611
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,001
Should I have taken you elsewhere?

612
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,795
You liked the pasta here last time.

613
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,591
Right, I did.

614
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,222
Are you worried about something?

615
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,517
You can tell me, you know.

616
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,228
I'm a little older than you,

617
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,023
so I'm sure I can give you some advice.

618
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,362
Jun would never do that.

619
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,865
That I can guarantee.

620
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,825
There must've been a misunderstanding.

621
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,161
Why don't you meet him
and hear what he has to say?

622
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,581
That would be better, right?

623
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,082
Yes, of course.

624
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,668
You're worrying about something
you're not sure of.

625
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,253
It doesn't suit you.

626
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,009
No way.

627
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,677
That makes no sense.

628
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,429
You don't believe me?

629
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,891
Hold on. Ra-ra might walk in on us.

630
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,571
What is this?

631
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,619
Are you saying this woman
is really Jun's new girlfriend?

632
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,996
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

633
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,584
What the hell. This is so annoying!

634
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,046
Why are you getting worked up?
Ra-ra's the one who should be angry.

635
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,549
Seung-gi, look carefully.

636
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:28,220
She's uglier than me.
That's why I'm annoyed!

637
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,556
-Who is this woman?
-She's prettier than you.

638
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,723
In what way?

639
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,768
She's not prettier than Ha-yeong.

640
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,103
Ha-yeong is so pretty.

641
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,773
Anyway,

642
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:43,652
they went to the same high school, and she
currently attends Stanford University.

643
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,030
She's visiting Korea for a short while
due to a visa issue.

644
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,740
I guess she's very smart.

645
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:52,869
You should tell Ra-ra first
so she won't agonize over it all alone.

646
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,998
No, I'm going to meet up with Jun first.

647
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,249
Why would you do that?

648
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,625
What do you think?

649
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,754
I'll grab him by the collar
and ask him why he had a change of heart!

650
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,047
Gosh, what a jerk.

651
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,758
You kids are still so naive, aren't you?

652
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,093
A love that lasts forever?

653
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,262
That doesn't exist.

654
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:13,849
That's what I learned after seeing all
sorts of crazy stuff in this line of work.

655
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,104
-Hey.
-Hide it!

656
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,022
Hurry, quick.

657
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,650
Is that all true?

658
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,419
JUN

659
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,546
Oh, Jun's calling.

660
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,506
Hey.

661
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,553
JUN

662
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:57,934
Ra-ra.

663
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,936
You should answer it.

664
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:06,318
JUN

665
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,409
JUN

666
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,955
I'm sorry for not calling you back sooner.

667
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,209
It's okay.

668
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,008
I don't have much time,
so I'll keep this short.

669
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,721
I figured

670
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,724
we should end things in person.

671
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,103
End things?

672
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,020
Yes.

673
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,899
Let's break up.

674
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:54,009
Why? Because of that girl?

675
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,220
I just…

676
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,389
don't like you anymore.

677
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,855
Jun, is that true?

678
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,527
Then look me in the eye and say it again.

679
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,412
I don't like you anymore.

680
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,462
I wish you all the best.

681
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,674
Forget a jerk like me.

682
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,391
My, what a lovely song.

683
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,310
What was this song called again?

684
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,980
"A Furtive Tear."

685
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:35,402
Gosh, I've cried a ton of furtive tears.

686
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,195
Is that so?

687
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,030
Goodness.

688
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:49,207
PRENATAL MUSIC

689
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,403
It's raining quite hard.

690
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,655
Is it going to rain all day?

691
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,823
I know, right?

692
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:24,826
-Hey.
-Yes?

693
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,579
How did Mi-ran's IVF treatment go?

694
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,832
She said she was going to try it
one last time.

695
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,919
I'm sure it'll go well this time!

696
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:37,923
I feel bad for her. She's wasting
all her precious time in her 30s

697
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,382
trying to get pregnant.

698
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,344
What can she do?
Her mother-in-law keeps pressuring her.

699
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,804
Mi-ran really wants a kid, too.

700
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,556
She just doesn't show it.

701
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,850
-Really?
-Yes.

702
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:52,562
She always looks like she's sick of
hearing about the trouble our kids cause,

703
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,022
so I didn't know.

704
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,358
She's most envious of you

705
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,610
because you're Ha-yeong's mom.

706
00:53:58,693 --> 00:53:59,819
-That's right.
-Really?

707
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,446
-Yes!
-My gosh.

708
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,366
Why would anyone want a kid like Ha-yeong?

709
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,118
Suk-gyeong.
Ha-yeong may be all grumpy at home,

710
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,995
but when she's out… Goodness.

711
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,957
She'd risk her life and fight
if it's for you.

712
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,086
She's much more reliable than a husband.

713
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:19,506
-Sure thing.
-Gosh, it's cold.

714
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,174
My gosh, it's so cold.

715
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:24,552
Ladies, I'm here.

716
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,263
-Hi.
-Hi, Mi-ran. Come on in.

717
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,016
Ta-da! Let's make some kimchi pancakes.

718
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,977
The rain is making me crave some.

719
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,228
-Sounds good.
-Good call.

720
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,772
-Don't carry around such heavy things.
-It's okay.

721
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,565
All right. Shall we get ready, then?

722
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:38,566
-Yes!
-Sounds good!

723
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,152
-This looks delicious.
-It's so good.

724
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,445
It's seasoned perfectly.

725
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:45,949
Hey, how's Ra-ra?

726
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,326
Is she still downcast?

727
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,913
-Yes.
-What can you do?

728
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,463
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

729
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:04,050
It's the same thing, just in different
order! You understood me. Whatever.

730
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,301
-What?
-Jeez.

731
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,556
But I never imagined they'd break up.

732
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,183
Jun liked Ra-ra so much, you know.

733
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:16,062
Gosh. When it comes to relationships,
outsiders never know what really goes on.

734
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,439
Oh, dear.

735
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,445
I haven't paid you back yet.

736
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,030
I'm sure you already know,

737
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,240
but I hate being indebted to others.

738
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,785
So you better not go anywhere
until I pay you back.

739
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,392
Jun.

740
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,605
This place is still filled
with your presence.

741
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,818
Will I be able to protect LaLa Land
on my own?

742
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,369
INCOMING INTERNATIONAL CALL

743
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,996
Who is this?

744
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,582
INCOMING INTERNATIONAL CALL

745
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,794
Hello?

746
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:03,711
Ra-ra.

747
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,508
Ms. Gong?

748
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,218
How have you been, Ra-ra?

749
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,679
Ms. Gong.

750
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,640
What's wrong?

751
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,560
Hearing your voice

752
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,563
is making me miss you more.

753
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,733
Ra-ra, I'm moving back to Korea.

754
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,987
Really? When are you arriving?

755
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,156
Next Saturday.

756
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,908
I'll pick you up at the airport.

757
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,454
Don't bother. It's not like
I'm making a grand comeback.

758
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,541
What time are you arriving? Which airline?

759
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,085
Gosh, don't make
such a big deal out of it.

760
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,172
Then I'll e-mail you my itinerary.

761
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,424
Okay, Ms. Gong. I'll see you soon.

762
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,861
FROM JOYFUL WEDDING:
RA-RA & JUN'S WEDDING

763

FROM JOYFUL WEDDING:
RA-RA & JUN'S WEDDING

764
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,534
Ra-ra!

765
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,078
I sent you an e-mail.

766
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,371
Check it later, okay?

768
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,086
Congratulations. You're Joyful Wedding's
first wedding crasher.

769
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,339
Wishing the two of you many blessings.

770
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,884
You have to hire us
to plan your real wedding, okay?

771
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,523
INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL

772
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,355
-Jun!
-Hey.

773
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,149
It's that way…

774
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,560
Jun.

775
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:09,147
Jun…

776
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:22,493
EPILOGUE

777
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:29,102
I find it hard to believe
you opened a piano academy yourself.

778
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,937
I had a lot of help.

779
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,690
You've had a hard time while I was gone.

780
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:39,153
LaLa Land is filled with memories of Jun.
I'm not sure I can bear to stay here.

781
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:42,573
I wasn't sure if I should tell you this.

782
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,785
The person who bought this building
was Jun.

783
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:48,913
There must be some reason
we don't know about.

784
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:54,085
I hoped you would never find out.
In the end, you rememebered.

785
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:57,213
The time we spent together defined me.

786
01:01:57,296 --> 01:02:00,466
So I could never
just throw those memories away.

787
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:05,596
I'll never forget this place.
It gave me too many gifts.

788
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,683
The people I met and Ra-ra.

789
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:12,186
Please take care of her.
