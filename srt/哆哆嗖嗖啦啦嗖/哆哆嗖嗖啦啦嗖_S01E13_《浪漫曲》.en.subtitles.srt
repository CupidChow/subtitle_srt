EPISODE 13

2
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,064
I wish I could turn back time.

3
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,485
You two, what's going on?

4
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,195
6 MONTHS AGO

5
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,448
Why are you both on your knees?
You're making me anxious!

6
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,534
Is this what I think it is?

7
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,869
What do you think it is?

8
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,287
You two might become in-laws.

9
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,372
-Come here.
-You're so dead.

10
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,707
No violence, please!

11
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,501
-No, that's not it.
-No, that's not it.

12
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,836
BUSINESS PLAN

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,088
So you guys want to start
a business together?

14
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,383
Yes. Under the name of Joyful Wedding,
we want to start a company

15
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,052
specializing in small weddings.

16
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,261
A wedding planning company?

17
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,889
First, let me explain the company name.

18
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,390
"Joyful."

19
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,267
It means a wedding filled with joy.

20
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,855
Right. We will provide consulting services
to couples who want a small wedding

21
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,024
based on their ideas and directions.

22
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:52,195
We'll help them plan their wedding
including the dress, hair, and makeup.

23
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,489
And to set ourselves apart
from other companies,

24
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,866
we plan to provide vlog services
on the wedding day.

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,702
It's okay to get a divorce.

26
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,246
That's a great idea!

27
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,331
But don't you need skills to do that?

28
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,499
Thankfully,

29
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:08,503
we already have all the skill sets
and potential we need for this business.

30
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:13,049
First, Seung-gi has had his own
video sharing channel for years,

31
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,845
so he's an expert when it comes to
photography, video making, and editing.

32
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,806
As for Ha-yeong,
she got her sharp eye and skillful hands

33
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,724
from Ms. Jin Suk-gyeong, her mother,

34
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,269
so she's an excellent hairstylist
and makeup artist.

35
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,771
Well, that is true.

36
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:32,277
Please believe in our talents,
business acumen, and all other skill sets.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,195
We're confident we'll be a success!

38
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,613
Your parents must be proud.

39
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,285
But the thing is, guys…

40
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,079
Do you have money for this?

41
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,915
Yes, of course!

42
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,877
The money for our college tuition fees.

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,170
-What?
-What?

44
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,839
You punk. Have you lost your mind?

45
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,799
You'll give up on college and do what?

46
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,886
Gosh, calm down. They're giving up
because they can't get in.

47
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,637
-I hate you even more!
-You and that mouth.

48
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,014
-Come here!
-Mom, no!

49
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,058
-Ms. Jin, no! Just hit me instead.
-Gosh, you brat. Come here!

50
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,196
Yes! We managed to persuade them!

51
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,741
Let's do our best
so we won't have any regrets.

52
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,286
-Of course! I'm excited to work with you.
-Likewise.

53
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,165
Gosh.

54
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,377
You did the right thing.
They're very determined to do this.

55
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,422
Yes, you know that parents
can't win against their children.

56
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:38,301
You can say that so easily
because Ye-seo got into med school.

57
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,802
That's true.

58
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,430
A college degree is a must nowadays.

59
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,140
How will they manage without it?

60
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,351
A college degree isn't everything,

61
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,270
but how are those kids
going to run a business?

62
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,482
But they even came up with this plan.

63
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,652
I read it over, and it looks like
they put a lot of thought into it.

64
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,404
Yes, Seung-gi looked like
a different person today.

65
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,407
He kind of looked smart today,
for a change.

66
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,533
"For a change"?

67
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,453
I've told you that he's smart
because he takes after me.

68
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,914
Even if they decide to retake CSAT…

69
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:11,793
You know their scores. That might
actually be worse for their future.

70
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,922
Yes! That's exactly
what I'm talking about. Their dark future.

71
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,674
Look. They even spelled this wrong.

72
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,385
-Gosh, enough!
-They actually spelled it wrong!

73
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,762
-Enough, okay?
-They didn't spell anything wrong.

74
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,014
JIN BEAUTY SALON
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

75
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,351
JOYFUL WEDDING

76
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,770
JIN HA-YEONG, LEE SEUNG-GI

77
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,438
CONSULTATION

78
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,736
Ha-yeong.

79
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,906
-I picked up our business cards.
-What? Really?

80
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,033
Those are yours. These are mine.

81
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,664
Here, you're the first to get mine.

82
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,459
-I'm honored, Ms. CEO.
-The honor is mine.

83
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,004
I should give you one too.
Please help us out.

84
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,547
Sure, Mr. Managing Director.

85
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,465
JOYFUL WEDDING

86
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,427
Ra-ra, thanks so much
for letting us use this space.

87
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,014
You should thank Mr. Kim, not me.

88
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:10,018
Even if he refuses to accept rent from us,
we'll give him something every month.

89
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,897
My gosh. Ha-yeong and Seung-gi,
you guys are all grown up now.

90
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,319
-Hey, we were already all grown up.
-That's right.

91
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,822
Well, I think we're ready to get rolling.

92
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,491
Should we start advertising
our services now?

93
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,452
Advertising? How are you going to do it?

94
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,287
Is there a couple getting married?

95
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,789
It'd be great to pick a couple

96
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,375
and show the entire process through vlogs.

97
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,961
Oh, vlogs?

98
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,882
If we don't know of any couples…

99
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,802
we'll just make one.

100
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,105
Guys, what's going on here?
You're scaring me.

101
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,442
Dr. Cha.

102
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,361
Hey, don't call me like that.
That's even creepier.

103
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,405
Dr. Cha.

104
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,657
Seung-gi, even you are being like this?

105
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,493
Help us out just this once.

106
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,537
Help us. Please help us!

107
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,457
Gosh, just tell me already.

108
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,502
How can I help you guys?

109
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,546
Do you need my medical knowledge
for your wedding business?

110
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,718
Can you get married again?

111
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,346
What?

112
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,267
All right. Smile, please. Show your teeth.

113
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,730
Your eyes have to smile too, Dr. Cha.

114
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,524
Be natural. More natural.

115
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,402
Smile with your eyes. Look at you, Ra-ra.

116
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,156
Okay, good. Now, can you strike a pose?

117
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,288
Try to look like a married couple.

118
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,541
-How? Like this?
-As if you're in love.

119
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,547
Okay.

120
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,965
Okay, stop.

121
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,925
You're too far apart,

122
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,718
-so get closer.
-Like this?

123
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,804
-Let's do this.
-Great. Nice.

124
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,226
I'll just keep taking them.

125
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,979
For God's sake.

126
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,897
Are you trying to ruin our business?

127
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,025
Ra-ra, can't you try to look more natural?

128
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,361
But I'm trying my best right now.

129
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,113
I'm about to get a cramp in my lips.

130
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,616
Dr. Cha, try not to look so uncomfortable
in front of the camera.

131
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,285
Have you never taken photos?

132
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,745
Sorry. I'm doing my best, though.

133
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,664
You two aren't actually a couple,

134
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:40,042
but I thought you liked each other
as people.

135
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,755
Watch and learn, okay? Hey.

136
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,092
-Do this.
-Like this?

137
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,470
Something like this.

138
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,806
A pose like this would be good too.

139
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,979
-Try this too.
-Yes.

140
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,483
You two look so cute together.

141
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,235
Yes, you guys should do this.
I'll take photos.

142
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,737
-Gosh, no.
-No.

143
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,698
Forget it. Let's just try again.

144
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,160
Smile at each other.

145
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,300
Recall the moment you felt most grateful
to each other.

146
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,001
While planning my wedding,
I stumbled upon this on social media.

147
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,212
It's a wedding invitation.

148
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,715
Wait, this is Eun-seok.

149
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,968
He's getting remarried
without even telling us?

150
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,303
Check out the next photo.

151
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,348
The bride looks just like your ex-wife.

152
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,849
No way.

153
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,351
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE WEDDING!

154
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,771
Gu Ra-ra?

155
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,649
Why is Eun-seok marrying Ra-ra?

156
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,152
They're getting married?

157
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,615
Who are you?

158
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,536
She's getting married?

159
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,997
I can't believe this.

160
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,850
Look here, ladies.
Give me a beautiful pose.

161
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,851
-Beautiful?
-Okay.

162
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,935
What should I do?

163
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,647
-Okay. This time, something funny.
-Funny?

164
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,482
-A funny pose.
-What about this?

165
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,860
-Let's hang off her arm.
-Yes!

166
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,988
Now, say a few nice words.

167
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,782
For the bride and groom? Mr. Cha,

168
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,493
it's okay to get a divorce.

169
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,913
Hey! Why bring up divorce
on the day of their wedding?

170
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,916
Are you trying to ruin my son's business?

171
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:27,918
Goodness.

172
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,879
Don't fight like this.

173
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,964
We wish you happiness!

174
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,132
Be happy!

175
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,052
Jae-min, make a heart.

176
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,511
Like this.

177
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,847
We wish you happiness!

178
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,730
Microphone check. One, two, three.

179
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,775
The ceremony will begin now.

180
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,610
All guests,

181
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,863
I would like to ask
that you please be seated.

182
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,138
You look stunning!

183
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,890
EVERYONE LOOKS SO NICE

184
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,266
Dashing!

185
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,394
DIVORCE IS OKAY? HAHA
THEY LOOK GOOD TOGETHER

186
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,646
CHURCH WEDDINGS ARE PRETTY
WHERE IS THIS?

187
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,378
OH, WHERE'S THE RING FROM?

188
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,426
YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM OUR PORTFOLIO

189
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,346
Now, the bride and groom
will walk down the aisle together.

190
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,599
Bride and groom, you may go.

191
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,397
Be happy!

192
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,417
What's he doing here?

193
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,211
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
IS THAT HER BOYFRIEND?

194
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,762
Wait! No, wait!

195
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,890
-My gosh.
-What is happening?

196
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,475
-Hey!
-Hey!

197
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,645
THE BRIDE RAN AWAY!
I FEEL SO BAD FOR THE GROOM

198
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,939
IS THIS A HIDDEN CAMERA PRANK?
THE GROOM IS SMILING

199
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,987
Darn it. It looks like they're the ones
that got married.

200
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,906
Be happy together!

201
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,576
Mr. Kim, how could you say that now?

202
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,703
Our kids are screwed.
They're so screwed now.

203
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,748
Oh, no! What's Seung-gi going to do now?
Gosh!

204
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,666
The bride. We must catch her. Get her.

205
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,753
Just let them be.
This is already an epic fail anyway.

206
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,672
Every wedding Ra-ra is at
turns into total chaos.

207
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,510
Seung-gi, turn off the live stream.

208
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,012
Right, the live broadcast. Damn it.

209
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,183
That was Joyful Wedding's first wedding.

210
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,560
We have to end this
due to an unexpected situation.

211
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,062
See you again soon!

212
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,147
THIS LIVE STREAM HAS ENDED.

213
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,282
-Jun, why are you being like this?
-Just run. Come on.

214
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,208
Gu Ra-ra's life is so eventful.

215
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,252
That looks like a scene from a movie.

216
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,671
A movie with a happy ending or a sad one?

217
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,965
They ran off like that.
It's got to be a sad one.

218
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,760
Come on. Let's go find Eun-seok.

219
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,064
Hey, Jun. What's Juju doing here?

220
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,776
-Get in first.
-Did you get a license?

221
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,037
Gosh, I'm too embarrassed
to even face them.

222
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,208
Wear a mask if you're that embarrassed.

223
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,339
Every time I get married,
you show up and ruin everything.

224
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,718
You got your nosebleed on my dress.

225
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,970
And today, you showed up and kidnapped me.

226
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,555
I'm really sorry.

227
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,934
Anyway, Ha-yeong and Seung-gi
will kill you.

228
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,854
They worked so hard on this project.

229
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,940
If the business goes bust,
they might demand compensation from you.

230
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,984
Sure. I'll pay for the damage.

231
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,528
Nice, I see that
you've gotten quite gutsy.

232
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,657
I should check the comments.

233
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,287
Look, they're calling you
a wedding crasher.

234
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,456
What?

235
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,249
WHO WAS THAT GUY?
HE'S A TOTAL WEDDING CRASHER!

236
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,464
This already happened,
so just think that we got married.

237
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,343
No, I don't want to.

238
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,847
-Why not?
-I don't want to get married on a whim.

239
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,891
You always do things on a whim.

240
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,226
No, I don't like that.

241
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,062
Jeez.

242
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,429
This is "Romance" by Gabriel Fauré.

243
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,683
It captures the feeling I get
when I think about you.

244
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,309
Really?

245
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,981
It sounds too warm for someone
who says no all the time.

246
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,984
Think about it, Jun.

247
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:29,738
Whenever you say no, there is warm yes
in there somewhere.

248
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,838
Good night, Jun!

249
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,715
No.

250
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,261
Thank you.

251
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,433
Thank you for coming to me.

252
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,191
I was so happy in that moment

253
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:12,281
that I thought it'd be nice for our story
to end here with a happy ending.

254
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,292
EPISODE 13

255
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,597
-Look at the ocean!
-Ra-ra.

256
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,725
No, don't!

257
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,229
Gosh, stop it!

258
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,075
My gosh!

259
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,164
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

260
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,916
Don't I look taller?

261
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,544
Maybe?

262
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,388
Cheers!

263
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,352
Why aren't you drinking?

264
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,229
My mom told me not to drink.

265
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,648
I'm on a diet until my next blind date.

266
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,901
You're still going on blind dates?

267
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,737
Obviously.

268
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,909
Hey, Eun-seok. Why didn't you tell me
about Ra-ra moving here?

269
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,789
-Because I couldn't stand you.
-What?

270
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,332
I couldn't stand the fact

271
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,419
that you were doing just fine
after ditching her. Happy now?

272
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,006
No ulterior motive?

273
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,676
Maybe I had one?

274
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,845
Honestly, I don't know anymore.

275
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,557
Anyway, the conclusion is

276
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,727
things worked out
between her and that guy.

277
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,356
This is so gratifying.

278
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,985
I'm stoked. Cheers.

279
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,198
You said you brought your car.
You should drink this.

280
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:01,992
Hold on.

281
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,453
You're worried about me?

282
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,787
Yes.

283
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,790
My gosh.

284
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,710
I came all the way here.

285
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,587
Can I come over and see your place?

286
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,340
Oh, why don't we have more drinks
at your place?

287
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,050
What?

288
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,845
What are you talking about? No way.

289
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,222
Okay.

290
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,432
Why do you look so alarmed?

291
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,696
Maybe he lives with a woman.

292
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,823
Why do you care? You two are divorced.

293
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,452
Let's go home. I have surgery tomorrow.

294
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,830
Am I your driver?
I have to drive even on our way back?

295
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,541
Whatever. You drive. I'm too tired.

296
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,337
I can't. My mom told me not to
because this is a bad year for me.

297
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,675
You should've come here with your mom
instead of me.

298
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,010
Because she's away right now.

299
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,516
Stop staring at me.

300
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,643
Come on. Let's go.

301
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,145
No! I'm not driving.

302
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,648
I refuse to go back like this!

303
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:18,068
Gosh, seriously. Yeong-ju, please.

304
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,613
Were you always this selfish?

305
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,368
Can you please just drive?
I have to be very careful this year.

306
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,995
I can't believe this.

307
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,595
YOU'RE LATE.
MAKE SURE YOU HEAT UP THE SOUP

308
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,680
Dr. Cha.

309
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,433
I knew

310
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,854
that you were Dodosolsollalasol.

311
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,943
My curiosity has finally been satisfied.

312
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,030
I always wondered how you knew
about the Mozart piece

313
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,865
only my dad and I knew about.

314
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,624
Well…

315
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,878
It's not me.

316
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,631
What?

317
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:27,387
I'm not the Dodosolsollalasol
you're looking for.

318
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,351
I guess I gave you the wrong idea.

319
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,770
I'm really sorry.

320
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,023
It's really not you?

321
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,069
Then who is it?

322
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,654
Who is this person?

323
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,200
You're not the one
who sent the piano to LaLa Land?

324
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,163
Are you sure the sender's name

325
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,958
was Dodosolsollalasol?

326
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,168
Then who sent this?

327
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,671
Why's this name so hard?

328
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,008
"Dodosolsollalasol"?

329
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,094
Yes.

330
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,138
Jun asked the delivery guy, and he said

331
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,183
they delivered it
from a secondhand piano shop downtown.

332
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,559
I see.

333
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,188
Then why don't we try to find this person?

334
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,989
When was it changed?

335
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,161
Excuse me.

336
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,542
Are you the owner of this place?

337
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,168
Yes, I am.

338
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,254
Do you happen to know

339
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,965
where the piano shop that was here
has moved to?

340
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,301
Oh, they went out of business.

341
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,429
The owner closed the shop
and left this area a while ago.

342
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,514
I see.

343
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:57,352
Then do you have
the shop owner's contact information?

344
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,813
-Right.
-No, I don't.

345
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,401
-Okay, thank you.
-Have a good day.

346
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,694
You too.

347
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,448
-What do we do now?
-Ra-ra.

348
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,161
I know an expert in tracking down people.
Why don't we ask him?

349
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,289
You know him as well.

350
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,507
I don't work for free.

351
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,760
How much? How much would you like?

352
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,640
I don't need money.
I want to rent a room from you.

353
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,059
What do you mean?

354
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,313
Rent me a room at your place.

355
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,272
What?

356
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,942
He lives upstairs from Suk-gyeong, right?

357
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,278
Yes.

358
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,742
You see, I'm not good at living
with other people.

359
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,660
You said you're divorced.

360
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,206
That means you used to live
with your ex-wife. Don't be so fussy.

361
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,876
What do you say? Yes or no?

362
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:17,182
Well, fine. Let's give it a try
just for a month, then.

363
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,392
Deal!

364
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,989
Nice.

365
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,710
Your place is very dark.
You should change all the lights.

366
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,422
I think you should take off
your sunglasses first.

367
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,761
Oops. What's with me today?

368
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,599
I'll use this room. I need a big bed.

369
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,476
Sure, that's fine by me.

370
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,939
We'll have Korean food for breakfast.

371
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,322
I even have to make breakfast for him?

372
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,901
Take a seat.

373
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,571
Oh, sure.

374
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,012
Let's eat.

375
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,433
Didn't I tell you?

376
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,852
I'm good with knives.

377
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,814
I see. I can cut pretty well with a saw.

378
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,859
-You're an orthopedic surgeon.
-Yes.

379
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,737
A knife and a saw. What a pair.

380
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,323
We should start a business together.

381
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,658
Okay, sure.

382
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,495
Thanks. This looks great.

383
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,540
Gosh, I haven't had a home-cooked meal
in so long.

384
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,131
-It's pretty good.
-Oh, thank you.

385
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,517
YOU'RE LATE.
MAKE SURE YOU HEAT UP THE SOUP

386
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,833
I'm letting him stay with me for months
for this food alone.

387
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,968
This looks delicious, as usual.

388
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:05,368
JIN BEAUTY SALON
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

389
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,832
It's getting late. Go home.

390
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,709
I'll come in for a minute.

391
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,043
No, you need to go home.

392
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,171
I'll just see Mimi and leave.

393
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,299
Hey.

394
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,219
Was he always that stubborn?

395
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,930
Mimi.

396
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,019
How have you been?

397
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,900
My room is gone.

398
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,902
YES, I'M SORRY THAT HAPPENED

399
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,320
That makes me a little sad.

400
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,656
Didn't you miss me?
Ra-ra wasn't mean to you, right?

401
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,824
YES

402
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,576
Do you want something to drink?

403
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,495
Yes, I'll have fresh juice.

404
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,415
Look at you making me work
since you haven't been here in a while.

405
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,833
Fresh tomato juice, please.

406
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,293
Yes, sir.

407
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,805
It's a teacup set my parents used to use.

408
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,350
I want to use it
with my future husband, too.

409
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,102
Jun! Your juice is ready.

410
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,521
Okay!

411
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,690
By the way, what happened with Juju?

412
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,902
-I bought her back.
-How?

413
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,655
Jun.

414
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,993
She paid back the money
she had borrowed from you.

415
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:34,499
Now that she's paid you back,
end things with her once and for all.

416
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,389
USED CAR SALES AGREEMENT

417
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,433
You wanted to tell me
who you sold it to, didn't you?

418
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,814
I was wondering where that receipt went.

419
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:02,026
I had to rush there as soon as
I sold Juju, so I was out of it.

420
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,571
You're always so clumsy.

421
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,825
I'll put up with you
even if you're mean to me.

422
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,536
Thanks so much for getting Juju back.

423
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,039
I'll leave Juju here. You can keep her.

424
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,876
-She was yours to begin with.
-Still--

425
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,920
Also, don't pay me back
without my permission.

426
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,006
What do you mean?

427
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,843
I should pay you back.
Why do I need your permission?

428
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,265
Because my dream is
to become a loan shark.

429
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,438
So just stay indebted to me.

430
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,024
That's such a weird reason.

431
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,861
You won't even let me call you
or visit you.

432
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,529
I need you to stay indebted to me.

433
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,490
Without that, I'll be too anxious.

434
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,288
I hope winter comes soon.

435
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,208
Then the CSAT would be over,
so we can officially date.

436
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,794
I'll be waiting, Mr. Creditor.

437
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,255
All right, Ms. Debtor.

438
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,723
Finally! I found him.

439
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,644
The owner of that piano shop.

440
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,773
-Really?
-I heard he's in Paju now.

441
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:25,401
I'll call you as soon as I find out
who ordered that piano.

442
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,611
Okay.

443
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,780
Hold on a second.

444
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,326
Have a good day.

445
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,086
Why do I feel like he's my wife?

446
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,922
Is it because I'm too sensitive?

447
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,092
I got rid of all the ledgers
as well as the computer.

448
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,428
Why would I keep them
when I closed the shop for good?

449
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,805
Goodness.

450
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,057
Is there anything you remember?

451
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,852
The piano was delivered to LaLa Land
right next to Jin Beauty Salon.

452
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,396
"LaLa Land"?

453
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,315
LaLa Land…

454
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,154
Oh! Where Happy Flower Shop used to be?

455
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,073
Do you remember the order?

456
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,746
Well…

457
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,588
Man-bok bought that piano.

458
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,674
What?

459
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:37,056
Ra-ra, Mr. Kim was the one who sent
that piano to you.

460
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,143
He said it was a gift
and paid for it in cash.

461
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,771
Mr. Kim, Mr. Kim.

462
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,627
Mr. Kim!

463
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,840
Mr. Kim!

464
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,217
Mr. Kim!

465
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,386
Did he go somewhere?

466
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,188
Mr. Kim!

467
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,318
Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim!

468
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,038
What is going on?

469
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,414
Is he all right?

470
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,584
He was taking medication
for his high blood pressure,

471
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:51,047
and he had an angina attack.
I heard he had collapsed before as well.

472
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,090
You're right.

473
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,801
Thanks to Jun,
he was able to survive last time.

474
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:59,347
Mr. Kim would always say
that it was all thanks to him

475
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,516
that he could live to this day.

476
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,811
Did you give his son a call?

477
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,145
He's on his way.

478
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,772
Okay.

479
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,279
Mr. Kim was Mr. Twinkle?

480
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,406
Yes.

481
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,417
No one has ever cried
after hearing me play.

482
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,338
You don't need to pay me.

483
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,132
This is my gift to you.

484
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,675
Thank you.

485
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,679
He said it was a gift
and paid for it in cash.

486
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,223
Mr. Kim.

487
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,934
You've given me

488
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,230
such a big gift
in return for my small one.

489
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,652
I can't believe this.

490
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:58,281
Then how long has Mr. Kim known Ra-ra?

491
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,032
Well…

492
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,452
He collapsed before we could ask him,

493
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,705
so we don't know that.

494
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,417
Goodness.

495
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,923
I haven't had the chance to thank you.

496
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,304
I have so many questions.

497
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:25,016
So you need to wake up.

498
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,354
Mr. Kim.

499
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:33,983
Father!

500
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,903
Goodness, Father!

501
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,655
Thank you so much

502
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,575
for calling us and keeping him company.

503
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,077
That's not a problem. I'm glad I'm here.

504
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:46,913
Oh, no…

505
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,001
Father.

506
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:56,088
How could you be lying here?

507
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,926
I can't believe this.

508
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,013
Gosh.

509
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,790
You never call me this late.

510
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:34,293
You called because you missed me,
didn't you?

511
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,754
That's right.

512
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:40,216
I was taking a walk and missed you a lot.

513
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,094
It's dangerous to be outside alone
at this hour.

514
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,892
Jun.

515
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,146
I was in a dilemma about
whether to tell you this or not.

516
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,190
Is something wrong?

517
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,777
Mr. Kim collapsed.

518
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,904
What?

519
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,115
Thankfully, he's in the clear.

520
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,075
But he's still unconscious.

521
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,998
You're getting ready to come here
right now, aren't you?

522
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,463
He's stable now, so don't worry.

523
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,799
You don't need to come.

524
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,926
His son is here too.

525
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,433
I'll let you know as soon as he wakes up.

526
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,518
Okay.

527
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:37,481
Also, I think Dodosolsollalasol,
the person I've been looking for,

528
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,319
is Mr. Kim.

529
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,032
I found out that he was the one

530
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,200
who sent me that piano.

531
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,202
Really?

532
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,538
Yes.

533
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,042
I hope he'll wake up soon.

534
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,420
I have so many questions.

535
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,342
I also want to know how he knew my dad.

536
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,802
I made a wish

537
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,764
upon a star in the sky just now.

538
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:14,685
"Please help him wake up safe and sound."

539
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,521
I'll pray too.

540
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,649
Okay.

541
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,131
This house has the best location in town.

542
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,801
You can see the sea,
and the road is right there.

543
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,886
It's the perfect place.

544
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,306
That's why it's so expensive
even without the building price.

545
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,557
I see.

546
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,017
Let's go inside.

547
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,147
I'm truly sorry about this.

548
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,274
My business is about to go under,

549
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,652
so I might even lose my house soon.

550
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,280
I was going to ask my father
for help anyway.

551
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,658
But then, to make things worse,
he fell ill.

552
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,285
Someone's interested in buying
this building?

553
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:17,957
Of course. Many have been eyeing
this place for a long time.

554
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,291
It's the perfect location.

555
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,587
Once you build a new building here,
you'll be hitting the jackpot.

556
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:28,801
I'm thinking of selling his greenhouse
as well and taking him with me to Seoul.

557
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,261
You're going to sell that too?

558
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,513
But he's going to be sad.

559
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,014
I don't know what to say.

560
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,475
I'm such a terrible son.

561
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,403
It's all too sudden.

562
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,071
I know.

563
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,158
This was a prominent building
in this neighborhood.

564
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,160
-What's that called?
-What?

565
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,078
A landmark.

566
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,538
A landmark.

567
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,541
Does this mean we have to move?

568
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:06,547
We can't tell him not to sell this place
when he's struggling financially.

569
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,091
Could there be anyone who'd be willing

570
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,343
to buy this place
without reconstructing it?

571
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,596
Do you guys perhaps…

572
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,725
have any money saved up?

573
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,854
None of us have any money.

574
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,565
What's worse, this place is so expensive.

575
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,526
It's going to be hard
unless we win the lottery.

576
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,325
Ra-ra.

577
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,370
Ra-ra, you know that drama about revenge.

578
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,123
-You know…
-What?

579
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,375
The secretary. The Great Traitor.

580
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,669
-That…
-That morning drama from last year?

581
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,046
Yes.

582
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,506
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

583
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,508
Are you in touch with that secretary Moon?

584
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,970
No. I think he changed his number.
Someone else picked up.

585
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,683
See? Didn't I tell you back then
that something was fishy?

586
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,019
In The Great Traitor,

587
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,940
the secretary pockets all the money
and starts his own company.

588
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,359
-He'd never do that.
-What?

589
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,278
One will do anything to survive.
Just find him.

590
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,364
Yes.

591
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,410
But how will she find him
when he's even changed his number?

592
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,871
There's that man
who's excellent at finding people.

593
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,249
We all know who he is.

594
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,837
-Right?
-Right?

595
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,340
Goodness.

596
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,055
I can't work for free.

597
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,271
How much? How much do you need?

598
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,356
I don't need money.

599
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,943
Give me three passes.

600
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,405
What kind of passes?

601
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,323
That allow me to eat with you.

602
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,535
What?

603
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,995
Forget it if you don't want to.

604
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,316
What is this?

605
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,067
Bring a spoon

606
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,403
every time you want to eat here.

607
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,904
Three times.

608
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,782
Gosh, you're so unapproachable.

609
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,827
You've really put up some high walls.

610
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,164
So? Will you take it or leave it?

611
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:47,791
Deal.

612
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,210
Deal.

613
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,801
Mr. Chu, I really didn't think you'd ask
for something so small.

614
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,097
It's not unlimited. Only three meals.

615
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,772
I've located Secretary Moon.

616
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,942
He's in Seoul.

617
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,861
Really?

618
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,280
This is his number.

619
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,952
Gosh, you really are a pro.

620
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,788
How are you so quick?

621
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,457
I just ordered a few men.
It's a piece of cake.

622
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,877
You look quite handsome today.

623
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,545
He does.

624
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,422
-Hold on.
-What?

625
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,300
Isn't this Rose Cosmetic?

626
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:42,554
Look at him. He looks like a chairman.

627
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,474
This is definitely fishy.

628
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,018
I'm afraid we're right.

629
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,229
That can't be.

630
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,647
Go see him first.

631
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,982
Who knows? Maybe he could help you.

632
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,527
-Yes. Go.
-You have to go.

633
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,070
Go with her.

634
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,322
If she has trouble speaking, help her out.

635
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,449
Can you do it?

636
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,867
Don't you worry.

637
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,736
Stop doing this to me.

638
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,156
I'm not your doll.

639
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,828
Stay by my side even just as a doll.

640
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,294
Do you know what I did to have you?

641
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,590
You can never leave me.

642
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,341
Never.

643
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,221
Who is she?

644
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,558
I've never seen her before.

645
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,187
CONSULTATION

646
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,986
We just opened this office.

647
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,406
If we were to move, we'd have to pay rent

648
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,116
and make new business cards.

649
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,660
Gosh, what should we do?

650
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,164
Seung-gi.

651
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,877
Please call me if anything happens.

652
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,505
Ra-ra will scold me.

653
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,673
It'll be a secret.

654
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,592
We're friends. It's okay.

655
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,766
JUN

656
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,560
JUN

657
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,605
"Look how beautiful it is."

658
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:02,861
Hey, Seung-gi.

659
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:03,946
Jun.

660
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,115
Do you have any money?

661
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,827
What's this about?
Is your business not doing well?

662
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,498
Don't ask any questions. Can you lend me
some money if you have any?

663
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,796
There is a tin can
in the top compartment of the fridge.

664
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,508
Why did you hide your money in the fridge?

665
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,936
Gosh, this won't be enough.

666
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,313
How much do you need?

667
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,482
Enough to buy a building.

668
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,443
Mr. Kim's son is going
to sell the building.

669
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,989
What? He's going to sell LaLa Land?

670
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:51,034
Yes. Apparently, someone wants to tear
down everything and put up a new building.

671
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,248
Okay. Good work.

672
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,542
-Good work.
-Good work.

673
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,460
-Good job.
-Good job.

674
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,462
-Thank you.
-Great work.

675
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,716
-Thank you.
-Great work.

676
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,093
-Thank you.
-Great job.

677
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,886
-Well done.
-Thank you.

678
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,305
I'll see you next time.

679
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,140
Great job.

680
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,474
Goodbye.

681
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,018
Great job.

682
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,061
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

683
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,187
Ra-ra.

684
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:21,982
What brings you here?

685
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,400
Mr. Moon.

686
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,451
You look amazing.

687
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,127
Goodness. Here you go.

688
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,969
I was going to call you once I settled in,

689
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,014
but you found me first.

690
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:58,143
Last year, I accidentally dropped
my phone in the sea

691
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,228
while filming on a yacht.

692
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,982
That's when I got a new phone
and changed my number as well.

693
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,692
I see.

694
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,782
Have you been well?

695
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,786
Yes. I've been living
a happy, cheerful life.

696
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,748
What have you been doing?
I was really surprised.

697
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,712
I guess you didn't know
that my lifelong dream was

698
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,090
to become an actor, did you?

699
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,966
Really?

700
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,427
Look at this face.

701
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,640
I've always been complimented for my looks
ever since I was young.

702
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,851
On top of that, I have a knack for acting.

703
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:43,980
I realized that I had been wasting
my talents.

704
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,524
I see.

705
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,113
By the way, who is she?

706
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:54,491
Oh, I live with Ra-ra.

707
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,827
It's safe to say

708
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,246
that I've taken over your previous job.

709
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,457
As you well know,
she requires a lot of attention.

710
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,834
You're right.

711
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,961
Hey, that's not true.

712
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,007
So what's the title
of the drama you're filming?

713
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,135
My mom is a total drama fanatic.

714
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:16,722
It's called
What's Wrong with the Chairman?

715
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,141
It's a web series that's airing
on Silver Channel.

716
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:23,019
I obviously look like a chairman. Right?

717
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,355
I can pull off romance dramas too.

718
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,984
It's a blue ocean for me.

719
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,611
I'm so happy for you.

720
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,447
Thank you.

721
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,992
Please take out the money.

722
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:42,789
Take this.

723
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,668
Gosh. Mr. Moon, don't do this.

724
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,795
You treated us to food and drinks.

725
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,255
It's okay.

726
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,759
I haven't seen you in a while.
I should give you some allowance.

727
00:50:56,553 --> 00:51:00,265
I'm not making much yet,
so I can't give you much.

728
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,310
Mr. Moon.

729
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,605
Goodness, look at this crybaby.

730
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,190
She's going to cry again.

731
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,743
Don't shed tears in hiding.
I always told you

732
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,662
to laugh and cry…

733
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,373
Confidently.

734
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,167
Confidently.

735
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:38,386
Gosh. I'm telling you,
those TWD ladies are the problem.

736
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,180
The Great Traitor?

737
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,182
He's like an angel.

738
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,142
Looking back,

739
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,354
Mr. Moon was like a mom to me.

740
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,524
Ra-ra, that suits him.

741
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,818
Once I make a lot of money,

742
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,320
I'm going to repay him for his kindness.

743
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:58,323
You better. I'll be watching you.

744
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,407
Okay.

745
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,267
This won't do.

746
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,147
Mom.

747
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,232
Yes?

748
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,986
I have something to say.

749
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,741
What is it? Is it urgent?

750
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:43,869
Yes.

751
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,746
Sit down.

752
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,043
Well…

753
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,422
I'd like to go to Eunpo.

754
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:01,636
Why?

755
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,606
Many people are worried about you.

756
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,735
So please wake up soon.

757
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,343
I can't look after him here,

758
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,970
so please check in on Mr. Kim often.

759
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,306
I was going to do that anyway.

760
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,017
Are your studies going well?

761
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,269
Of course.

762
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:55,023
Just like you, studying is a piece of cake
for me as well.

763
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,693
Gosh, you're much younger than me,
yet you never back down.

764
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,362
I surrender.

765
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,115
I have a question.

766
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:08,912
Where did you get the courage to barge
into someone else's wedding

767
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,789
and steal the bride?

768
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:15,126
That's not hard at all.
I just had to think of one thing.

769
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,671
Ra-ra.

770
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,548
Gosh. Fine, I give up.

771
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,303
Jun.

772
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,390
Before I moved here,

773
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,976
my heart felt so dry

774
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,853
that it felt like I had no emotions left.

775
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,647
But I was wrong.

776
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,109
After getting to know Ra-ra and you…

777
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:42,362
And after befriending those around me,

778
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,824
my heart became fresh and alive
once again.

779
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,662
Just like your lettuce at LaLa Land.

780
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,707
Were you jealous of them?

781
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,500
Yes.

782
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,712
You should grow some as well.
You like flowers.

783
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,089
Okay, I'll do that.

784
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,720
Please don't tell Ra-ra that I came here.

785
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,265
We agreed not to meet
until I finished my exam.

786
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,017
All right.

787
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,865
SEARCH: JOYFUL WEDDING

788
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,325
A HAPPY WEDDING VLOG

789
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,326
Hey.

790
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,871
No way.

791
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,875
Did we really get these many views?

792
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,503
We got so many subscribers and likes
as well.

793
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,213
One minute.

794
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,174
Someone emailed us about their wedding.

795
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,925
What? They emailed us?

796
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,387
Seung-gi! We'll be making money now!

797
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,431
-I can't believe it!
-Gosh!

798
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,515
Yes!

799
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,699
Hey.

800
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,372
Let's tell Ra-ra this instant.

801
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,083
-Okay.
-Let's go.

802
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,087
-Ra-ra.
-Ra-ra!

803
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,299
We may be able to buy this place
once we make some money.

804
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:28,218
What? Don't exaggerate.

805
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,511
Did something happen?

806
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,347
Ra-ra, thanks to Jun crashing the wedding,

807
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,766
so many people have watched our video.

808
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,935
We've really promoted Joyful Wedding!

809
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,604
Seriously? It wasn't a flop?

810
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:43,274
Come on. Anyway, it wasn't because of us.
That incident was just so hilarious.

811
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,901
That's why the video went viral.

812
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,070
That's great. I'm so happy for you.

813
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,073
-Ra-ra, it's going to work out!
-It's great!

814
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,866
Great job!

815
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,036
Guys!

816
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,291
I think we can stay here, after all!

817
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,920
Dr. Cha decided to buy this building.

818
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,630
-He did?
-Yes.

819
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,133
Do you mean our upstairs neighbor,
Dr. Cha Eun-seok?

820
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,136
Yes. He said he was dirt poor
when he had gotten divorced.

821
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,388
But he was meant to be rich, after all.

822
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,682
Did he take out a loan?

823
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:19,310
Ra-ra, either way,
he'll become the owner of this building.

824
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,188
And we'll have a landlord
who'll extend our contracts.

825
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,900
I'm feeling great today.
Let's have a barbecue party tonight.

826
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,653
Let's invite all our neighbors.
Every single one of them.

827
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,072
-Ha-yeong.
-Mom.

828
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:34,492
I'm on cloud nine.
I thought we'd be kicked out.

829
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,870
Where should we have the party? At home?

830
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,080
-Will we have pork or beef?
-Can I call my mom?

831
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,124
-Just have pork!
-Call her.

832
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:45,670
Jun, I'm so glad
that I can keep LaLa Land.

833
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,883
It's such a happy day.
I wish you were here with me.

834
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,176
Gosh, Mom!

835
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,440
May I see this one, please?

836
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,524
Sure.

837
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,414
Sunwoo Jun.

838
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,096
Jung Ga-yeong?

839
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,226
Found you.

840
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,026
Didn't you miss me?

841
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:02,497
EPILOGUE

842
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,414
What?

843
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,584
Where did it go?

844
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,920
The teacup couldn't have just run away.

845
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,339
Did Ha-yeong use it?

846
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,384
Mimi, have you seen my teacup?

847
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:17,095
I KNOW WHO STOLE IT

848
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:01,973
-Where were you?
-Why were you looking for me?

849
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,057
Are you meeting that woman?

850
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,934
How about we go somewhere else together?

851
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,729
Ga-yeong. Thanks so much for today.

852
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,231
I was just happy to be with Jun.

853
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:14,193
I guess you're the type to follow a guy
all the way to his doorstep.

854
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,112
Break up with Jun.

855
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,572
Girlfriend?

856
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,449
Are you saying Jun is seeing someone else?

857
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,535
You kids are still so naive, aren't you?

858
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,580
A love that lasts forever?
That doesn't exist.

859
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,707
Let's break up.

860
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,710
I just… don't like you anymore.

861
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:34,213
Jun, is that true?

862
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,007
I don't like you anymore.

863
