1
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,869
So this is where Ra-ra lives.

2
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,371
What's going on?

3
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,665
Did you follow me?

4
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,921
I know that you stop by the shop
sometimes and watch me.

5
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,719
Are you delusional?

6
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,388
I have to pass by that sandwich shop

7
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,808
because it's on my way to work.

8
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,772
There isn't anyone after you, is there?

9
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,108
Or maybe you're on the run
for reasons you can't share?

10
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,110
Is that it?

11
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,989
Do you have trust issues?

12
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,951
Don't try and make me seem suspicious.

13
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,911
Just tell me why you're here.

14
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,041
I'm on my way home.

15
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,045
I live in this building.

16
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,273
Have we met before?

17
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,817
Or maybe you're on the run
for reasons you can't share?

18
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,362
He gets on my nerves.

19
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,704
I'm doing it because I want to.

20
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,958
- What's your relationship to the patient?
- Accident victim.

21
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,294
I said I'm fine. Leave me alone, will you?

22
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,714
He always seems so on edge.

23
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,928
He's such a weirdo.

24
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,278
Since today is my first day at work…

25
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,773
Pardon?
You no longer need a new instructor?

26
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,525
But I got my cast removed,

27
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,153
and my hand has fully healed.

28
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,239
There were some cancellations,

29
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,659
so I don't need a new instructor anymore.

30
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,246
Still, could you please let me work here?

31
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,624
If I can't start working right away,

32
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll be in big trouble.

33
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,586
I've already told everyone
that I got a job,

34
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,129
and I even borrowed money.

35
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,008
I got a job as a piano instructor.

36
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,301
I heard you got a job.

37
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,012
I'll treat you next time,
so don't worry and go buy some.

38
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,847
Well, that's your problem.

39
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,809
I'll be in trouble
if I hire a new instructor now.

40
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,442
SOMANG PIANO ACADEMY

41
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,408
Yes.

42
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,244
I'll get back on the job hunt tomorrow.

43
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,873
But I'm still sad things
turned out like this.

44
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,834
This is so embarrassing.

45
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,461
And now I have to go see Jun.

46
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,548
This is so upsetting.

47
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,889
JIN BEAUTY SALON

48
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,102
What do I do?

49
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,110
Why isn't she here yet?

50
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,286
Oh my gosh!

51
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,039
-Hey, Jun.
-Where are you?

52
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,875
I'm on my way, of course.

53
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,926
-Did something happen?
-What? No. Well…

54
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,222
I had to go back home
because my shoes were so uncomfortable.

55
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,724
I see.

56
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,893
Do you like to play hide-and-seek?

57
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,019
What?

58
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,020
Hide-and-seek?

59
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,065
No, I hate hiding.

60
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,649
Then what are you doing?

61
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,985
Gosh! My goodness.

62
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,070
Hey, you scared me!

63
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,114
Did you do something bad?

64
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:10,828
What's going on?

65
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,958
Well, the thing is…

66
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,089
I didn't get the job at the academy.

67
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,888
I'm going to find another job soon,
so don't look down on me. Okay?

68
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,516
Hey, wait!

69
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,309
How is she so unpredictable?

70
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,436
I didn't even get to tell her.

71
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,657
RA-RA

72
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,579
What is all this?

73
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,915
Jun.

74
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,793
Is this my room?

75
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,461
Did you make this room for me?

76
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,005
You can come and hang out
with Mimi whenever you want.

77
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,103
It's so pretty.

78
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,818
Thanks, Jun. Thank you so much!

79
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,953
Hey, Mimi!

80
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,166
Jun has some serious skills, doesn't he?

81
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,627
I thought he was just a handsome guy.
But he's generous,

82
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,588
and he can even build a house. Look!

83
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,424
Can you not say stuff like that out loud?

84
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,054
I fixed this up because I needed it,
not to get a compliment.

85
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,307
I did this for myself, not for you.

86
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,018
Okay, I won't get the wrong idea.
So stop there.

87
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,729
Hello?

88
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,194
Jun.

89
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,155
Don't tell me that you bought this for me.

90
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,866
No, I didn't.

91
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,702
-Really?
-Really.

92
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,289
Then who sent this?

93
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,668
Could you tell us who sent this?

94
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,087
Let's see.

95
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,715
Why's this name so hard?

96
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,843
"Dodosolsollalasol"?

97
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,848
-Take care.
-Have a good day.

98
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,272
Except for that message

99
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,566
about meeting in a month,

100
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,693
they haven't said anything
since I came here.

101
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,364
How'd they know I was here?

102
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,325
Wait here.

103
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,703
Just a second, please.

104
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,082
Where was that piano delivered from?

105
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,306
DODOSOLSOLLALASOL LEFT A COMMENT

106
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,561
"I sent a small gift.
I hope it cheers you up."

107
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,565
Who on earth are you?

108
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,942
THANK ME IN 2 WEEKS

109
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,866
Thank you. I'll put it to good use,
my twinkle, twinkle, little star.

110
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,244
I'll give you a piggyback when I see you.

111
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,038
I'll circle the globe three times
with you on my back.

112
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,416
No! Make that ten times!

113
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,211
Thank you.

114
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,646
How odd.

115
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,107
A complete stranger bought you a piano?

116
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,984
Exactly. But what I want to know

117
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,611
is who this Domisolsol is.

118
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,822
It's Dodosolsollalasol.
I've told you many times.

119
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,449
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

120
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,950
Do, do, sol, sol, la, la, sol

121
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,620
Well, whatever.

122
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,789
You have to take me with you
when you meet.

123
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,707
Take me, too.

124
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,543
-I'm so curious.
-I'm so curious.

125
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,795
That hurt.

126
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,422
Okay, I will.

127
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,592
Anyhow, I heard you might start
a piano academy

128
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,261
at Jun's place. Is that true?

129
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,891
Why don't you start a piano academy here?

130
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,352
My gosh, you're a genius.

131
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,480
I'll pay half the rent.

132
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,606
You're broke right now.

133
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,691
I'll earn money if I open an academy.

134
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,942
I don't pay rent.

135
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,486
-Really?
-Yes.

136
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,987
Do you want to do it?

137
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,657
Yes. Hold on.

138
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,325
What should we name it?

139
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,493
Love Piano?

140
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,286
No. Star Piano?

141
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,121
No, I don't like that. Mozart…

142
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,707
No. Muse?

143
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,833
Muse…

144
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,168
LaLa Land.

145
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,045
What do you think?

146
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,054
EPISODE 4

147
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,639
-"LaLa Land"?
-"LaLa Land"?

148
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,307
LaLa Piano Land.

149
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,268
But you're going to open an academy
with one piano?

150
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,270
Right?
I'm a little worried about that too.

151
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,773
I'm wondering if I should buy a few more--

152
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,984
Why worry about that now?
Wait until you have a lot of students!

153
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,904
Live within your means,
not in a fantasy world.

154
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,114
Did you hear?

155
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,324
I never said I'd buy more.
I was just thinking.

156
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,161
A piano is expensive,
but thinking doesn't cost money.

157
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,623
That's right. You need
to do some thinking, Ra-ra.

158
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,959
It doesn't cost money,
so please do it often.

159
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,878
And the sign? Shall I introduce someone?

160
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,631
Jun is making it.
He's even going to draw a piano on it.

161
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,175
What? Jun's making a sign
for your academy?

162
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,137
Yes. I wonder what he used to do.

163
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,431
He's good at everything.

164
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,183
He's my future husband,
so mind your own business.

165
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,436
What are you talking about?

166
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,479
He looks offended
every time he hears that!

167
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,398
I'm your mom, and even I can't stand you!

168
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,900
You're his future mother-in-law.
What's with you?

169
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,318
"Mother-in-law"? No, I'm not.

170
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,696
-Men and women must--
-I don't hear you.

171
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,031
-You shouldn't even hold hands with a guy.
-No!

172
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,951
-You're still a kid. At this rate…
-I'm marrying Jun.

173
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
Hello, Dr. Cha. What's going on?

174
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,790
When can I

175
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,834
take you out for dinner?

176
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,254
It slipped my mind.

177
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,299
I'm sorry. I'm quite busy this week.

178
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,343
You're always so busy.

179
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,972
How about this?

180
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,933
I'm opening a piano academy.

181
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,477
Come to the grand opening.

182
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,103
A piano academy?

183
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,939
I somehow got a piano,
so I thought I should just do it.

184
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,149
I see.

185
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,452
We're not open.

186
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,496
We're closed today…

187
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,069
Can I just get a trim?

188
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,278
It won't take long.

189
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,283
Of course. My gosh. Sure thing.

190
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,661
-Have a seat here.
-Thank you.

191
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,352
Sorry about that.

192
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,364
Do you suffer from hand tremors?

193
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,116
Gosh, of course not.

194
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,244
You shouldn't be a hairstylist
if you suffer from hand tremors.

195
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,205
Otherwise, I'd cut customers' ears
and poke their eyes.

196
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,376
Don't you worry. You may not believe me,

197
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,670
but I used to work
in Cheongdam-dong, Seoul.

198
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,046
Oh, okay.

199
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,817
What do you think? Do you like it?

200
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,445
Yes, I love it.

201
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:08,157
Then let's move on to the next step!
Let me blow-dry your hair.

202
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,079
I guess you're meeting someone
in this area.

203
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,375
Then I should make sure you look fabulous.

204
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,711
Blow-drying is my specialty.

205
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,047
All right.

206
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,726
What do you say?
Shall I make you look about 5cm taller?

207
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,854
No, this is good enough.

208
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,360
-I'll make you look fabulous.
-No, it's…

209
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,447
My gosh, your hair is very easy to style.

210
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,038
I won't charge you for the blow-dry.

211
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,997
Thank you.

212
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,000
-My, you look ten years younger.
-Oh, don't…

213
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,671
-Come on. Don't be so shy.
-Yes, I'm shy.

214
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,797
-All right.
-Hello.

215
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,841
Hi, guys.

216
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,843
Don't call me Mom.

217
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,763
Mister, what are you doing here?

218
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,016
What? You two know each other?

219
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,894
He's the man who was peeping
into the salon at night.

220
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,895
-What?
-No, no.

221
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,982
Don't tell me you're interested in me.

222
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,234
No, I'm not! Okay?

223
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,071
Mom, hurry--

224
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,073
-Don't call me Mom!
-Mother, please.

225
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,950
I told you to just call me your sister!

226
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,660
Hurry, everyone!

227
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,537
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

228
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,254
LALA PIANO LAND

229
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,808
FROM JIN SUK-GYEONG
GET RICH

230
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,978
This is delicious.

231
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,022
I didn't buy them, but enjoy.

232
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,569
I have to say, you have a good eye.

233
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,280
This space looks
much livelier than before.

234
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,032
This is all Jun.

235
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,492
-What?
-Delivery for you.

236
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,869
It's the rice cake.

237
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,495
-Ha-yeong.
-Thank you, Ms. Jin.

238
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,414
I got it to wish you good luck

239
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,458
so that you can pay me back quickly.

240
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,919
And from now on,
just call me by my first name.

241
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,087
What?

242
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,464
I'm 15 years older than you,

243
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,551
but we look less than five years apart.

244
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,635
Yes, I agree.

245
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,554
-Right?
-Yes!

246
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,646
This looks very nice.

247
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,193
Thank you for letting Ra-ra
open her academy here.

248
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,280
I don't understand why you're thanking me.

249
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,408
Well, I've just been
a little worried about her.

250
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,662
I was also at her wedding.

251
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,376
When you saw she was hurt,
you couldn't just walk away.

252
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,963
I believe it's because
you were sympathetic.

253
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,840
Am I wrong?

254
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,301
Have some rice cake!

255
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,012
Let's eat some rice cake.

256
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,229
It's not sympathy.

257
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,066
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

258
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,192
Thank you.

259
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,529
So you really are a pianist.

260
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,822
Please spread the word.

261
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,073
Can I get one more?

262
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,491
-For the store owner.
-Sure.

263
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,202
Right, their son is in elementary school.

264
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,328
-That's right.
-I also

265
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,579
offer lessons for adults.

266
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,665
You can sign up yourself.

267
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,292
Well, my fingers hurt a lot.

268
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,379
The kids and all the cooking
keep us busy enough.

269
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,676
I'd play cards
if I had time to play the piano.

270
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,345
Ha-yeong, Seung-gi. This is very good.

271
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,263
Thank you.

272
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,723
You can take piano lessons
as a hobby, you know.

273
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,267
We're high school seniors.

274
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,144
That's right. We have to go to study.

275
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,104
Suk-gyeong! Have some rice cake.

276
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,605
Why don't you learn piano?

277
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,776
If I had time for that,
I'd rather work on another customer.

278
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,069
I'm a busy person.

279
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,780
JIN BEAUTY SALON

280
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,374
I wanted to hang out more.

281
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,877
-I really don't want to go to the academy.
-Same here.

282
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:34,298
Hey, Ye-seo at least gets good grades.
Why do I even bother with academy?

283
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,425
Don't be distracted. Just study hard.

284
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,760
Or your tuition fees will
go down the drain!

285
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,597
I seriously think my tuition fees are
going down the drain.

286
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,973
So do I.

287
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,268
I envy Ra-ra.

288
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,271
She studied piano for 20 years
and can earn a living from that.

289
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,650
Imagine you rode a bike for 20 years
while everyone else was studying.

290
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,527
I bet you could ride on a rope.

291
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,864
Hey, I'd even do a full spin in the air.

292
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,911
That's why I keep uploading videos.
I work on my channel four hours a day.

293
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,329
Seung-gi.

294
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,166
If your mom finds out,
she'll get so angry, she'll pass out.

295
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,629
Hey! I can become successful
through my channel.

296
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,756
Sure, good luck.

297
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,678
"May the piano sound from LaLa Land
fill the entire world."

298
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,642
A pretty plant
from such a wonderful person.

299
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,770
And Dr. Cha is an amazing writer
on top of that.

300
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,979
Get out of that chair.

301
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,565
And you need to clean.

302
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,777
From the dishes to the mopping,
there's so much to do.

303
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,613
I've never cleaned
such a huge space before.

304
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,573
Among all the things that need cleaning,

305
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,825
I was thinking
about what I could do, though.

306
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,744
Suk-gyeong said I should think more.

307
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,870
So? What will you do?

308
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,721
I shall play the piano

309
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,182
to lift your spirits as you work.

310
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,350
What?

311
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,227
Hey, am I your servant or what?

312
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,478
"I Want You."

313
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,613
That's the title of this piece.

314
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,951
I heard it at the concert
in the lobby when I was in the hospital.

315
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,369
Isn't it so lovely?

316
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,747
Yes.

317
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:55,147
I heard Erik Satie composed this song
because he was so in love with someone.

318
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,273
What do you think?

319
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,983
It's uplifting.

320
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,069
He was madly in love with that woman
until the day he died.

321
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,863
What about the woman?

322
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,741
She was very popular.
I think she got married a few times.

323
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,337
That's sad.

324
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,161
Hey! Seriously.

325
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,560
You're…

326
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,145
Dr. Cha!

327
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,940
Did you follow me?

328
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,650
No, I didn't.

329
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,610
I was just on my way home.

330
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,445
Liar.

331
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,118
Do I look like someone
who would follow people?

332
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,161
Yes.

333
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,082
-Did you come all the way here to see me?
-Did you follow me?

334
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,208
Why do you ask?

335
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,501
It's nothing.

336
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,920
I've just been getting that
a lot recently.

337
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,798
You live in Unit 408?

338
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,592
My gosh.

339
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,677
I live in Unit 308.

340
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,387
-I know.
-What?

341
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,056
You should've told me then.

342
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,767
I saw those movers
on a ladder truck a month ago.

343
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,811
That must've been for your move.

344
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,606
Gosh, I can't believe this.

345
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,066
Dr. Cha! Wait, Dr. Cha.

346
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,986
If you ever need to get your hair done
early in the morning…

347
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,539
If you're going to use those,
should we keep those in the kitchen?

348
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,583
No, I'll just keep them here.

349
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,961
It's a teacup set my parents used to use.

350
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,633
I want to use it
with my future husband, too.

351
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,177
Although my first attempt failed.

352
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,558
By the way, what do your parents do?

353
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,230
I don't have a family.

354
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,904
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked that.

355
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,326
Jun.

356
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,288
Just think of me like family.

357
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,252
How does it feel?
It gives you strength, doesn't it?

358
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,717
Even thinking about it
gives me a headache.

359
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,513
I hate it when others try
to meddle in my life.

360
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,182
Drop this family topic.
Just run this academy well

361
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,600
and pay me back.

362
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,185
Okay, I will.

363
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,731
Gosh, how am I going to get students?

364
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,361
Exactly…

365
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,364
I'm sure there's a way.

366
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,909
I'm tired now,
so I'll worry about it tomorrow.

367
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,119
Jeez.

368
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,904
That rice cake. Do you have any left?

369
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,324
It's long gone. Why do you ask?

370
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,162
You ladies know I'd wake up
right away if someone whispered

371
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,039
in my ear, "rice cake." Right?

372
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:08,918
We've concluded you're possessed
by a spirit obsessed with rice cake.

373
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,671
-Maybe I am.
-You love all kinds of rice cake.

374
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,340
See? You ladies know.

375
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,467
I can't believe that jerk doesn't.

376
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,386
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

377
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,097
Goodness, I guess your husband ate it all.

378
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,726
When I was washing the dishes
after making some snacks for Seung-gi,

379
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,397
he basically licked the plate clean
without leaving a single crumb.

380
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,609
How is he getting even greedier
as he gets older?

381
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:36,863
-Get a divorce!
-Get a divorce!

382
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,657
-Okay, just get a divorce.
-I should.

383
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:43,912
"I divorced my husband
because of rice cake."

384
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,415
What a detailed
and unusual reason for divorce!

385
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,000
-Right?
-Very detailed, indeed.

386
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,878
-Suk-gyeong!
-What?

387
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,255
Who was that guy in a suit
at the grand opening?

388
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,424
Yes, I was so curious ,too.
Who is that man?

389
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,761
Ra-ra had hurt her hand, you know.

390
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,763
He's her doctor.

391
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:07,227
But is it normal for a doctor
to come to his patient's grand opening?

392
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,979
I think Ra-ra invited him.

393
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,899
Anyhow, that man is actually…

394
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,485
-He lives right upstairs from me.
-Really?

395
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,028
Seriously?

396
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,156
I think he lives alone.

397
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,492
Gosh, I can see how excited you are.

398
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,661
I guess he gives you butterflies.

399
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,872
Well, he said
he'll come to my salon often.

400
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,500
I think he's interested in me.

401
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,835
Not Ra-ra?

402
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,921
Why the long face?

403
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,381
You have a teenage daughter.

404
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,757
-Hey!
-Ouch, Suk-gyeong!

405
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,592
Don't forget. I've never been married.

406
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,845
-Yes, ma'am.
-Lucky you.

407
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,764
-You don't need to get a divorce.
-Oh, boy.

408
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,059
What's going on with LaLa Land?
Does she have some students now?

409
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,937
She's been working hard
to advertise the academy.

410
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,606
Ra-ra is kind of immature and quirky,

411
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,234
but she's always doing something.

412
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,242
Let's have another good day!

413
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,662
-Hello.
-Hello.

414
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:12,959
Dr. Cha!

415
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:18,006
My gosh, why are you carrying
so much stuff?

416
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,758
-No, it's okay--
-Let me.

417
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,635
I told you, you need to be careful
with your hands.

418
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,180
Well, I couldn't help it
because of my situation.

419
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,017
I guess, in life, you can't avoid
everything that might be bad for you.

420
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,895
What brings you by?

421
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,440
Were you waiting for me here?

422
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:40,236
Oh, didn't Ms. Jin tell you?
I live in the unit above yours.

423
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,073
Of course, she told me.
She went on about it.

424
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,825
Don't you have to go to work?

425
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,285
It's my day off.

426
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,955
I said I'd take you out for dinner,
so I was waiting for you.

427
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,957
-Really?
-Yes.

428
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,418
I'm so sorry. I'm busy at the moment.

429
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,878
I have a lot to do.

430
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,049
Oh, I see.

431
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,342
Then…

432
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,594
Why don't I tag along?

433
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,097
Show this to your parents, okay?

434
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,557
-Okay.
-You have to!

435
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,768
Hi. Here, you can take one, too.

436
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,646
Do you take piano lessons?

437
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,314
Yes, at Somang Piano Academy.

438
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,107
I go to Classical.

439
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,360
Oh… Is that so?

440
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,778
Okay, have fun.

441
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,446
Why are you taking it back?

442
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,074
You don't need it,
so you'll probably just throw it away.

443
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,827
I'll be heartbroken
if I see it tossed on the ground.

444
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,704
We won't. We'll give it to our friends.

445
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,039
Thanks.

446
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,332
Thanks, girls!

447
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,753
All the kids are already taking
piano lessons.

448
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,552
You want another one?

449
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,012
You don't have a ruler?

450
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,849
Do you need many rulers?

451
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,857
Here.

452
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,234
Are you taking piano lessons?

453
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,236
-No.
-No?

454
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,281
Then make sure
you show this to your mom and dad.

455
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,448
Okay?

456
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,909
Yes?

457
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,998
Hey! You won't even say bye?

458
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,458
Don't forget
to show it to your parents, okay?

459
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,919
-Taekwon.
-Taekwon!

460
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,130
-Hop in.
-Hello.

461
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,798
-Did you have a fun class?
-Yes!

462
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,676
Hello.

463
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,052
Can I help you?

464
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,263
You have so many students.

465
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,853
You're advertising your academy?

466
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,399
These days, everything is taught
in one building.

467
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,693
Piano after taekwondo,

468
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,153
then English

469
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,405
and art, for example.

470
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,575
For moms, a shuttle bus like this
is a must.

471
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,120
EUNPO TAEKWONDO

472
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,581
So I need to buy a yellow van, too?

473
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,625
Who will drive it though?

474
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,209
And who will manage it?

475
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,753
Gosh, wake up.

476
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,588
Ra-ra!

477
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,800
-Hot day, isn't it? Here, drink this.
-Yes.

478
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,719
-Oh.
-I got this.

479
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,016
It does make me uncomfortable.

480
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,018
Pardon me?

481
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,812
I don't feel comfortable

482
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,148
since you keep staring.

483
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,028
I've done this a lot myself.

484
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,072
-What?
-Shall we get going?

485
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,198
I'm hungry.

486
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,285
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

487
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,245
Dig in.

488
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,831
This looks great. Thank you.

489
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,935
Gosh, eat slowly.

490
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,939
I've always been a foodie,
but I never used to eat a lot.

491
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,109
But for some reason, I'm hungry
all the time now that I'm broke.

492
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,443
Oh, I see.

493
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:11,406
When I see food, my instincts tell me
that I must eat as much as I can.

494
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:15,368
And at times, I feel as though
there's another me inside my stomach.

495
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,870
Right, I totally get it.

496
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,549
It's Jun. Hey, Jun.

497
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,384
Yes, I'm with Dr. Cha.

498
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,597
Oh, he wanted to buy me lunch.

499
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,850
What? Why?

500
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,396
Okay, enjoy your lunch.

501
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,488
What? Why did he hang up like that?

502
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,868
It looks like you and Jun are very close.

503
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,705
Well, I've borrowed
a lot of money from him,

504
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,291
and he helped me open my piano academy.

505
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,460
I owe him a lot.

506
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,587
I can help you out, too.

507
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,256
-Pardon?
-I can also lend you money.

508
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,176
I can even pay off what you owe him.

509
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,053
But why would you do that?

510
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,679
Just because…

511
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,639
Because I trust you.

512
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:23,352
I firmly trust that you will pay me back
in full, with interest and all.

513
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,567
My gosh. Well, I am very trustworthy.

514
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,530
But I'm just going to keep borrowing
from Jun.

515
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,034
Why?

516
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,746
How should I put this?

517
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,247
I'll give you an example.

518
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,417
Let's say I'm playing the piano
while he's cleaning.

519
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,921
I think I'd enjoy playing the piano.

520
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,891
But if you were cleaning,
I'd be uncomfortable.

521
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,519
I'd feel like I should clean, too.

522
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,354
You know what I mean?

523
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,314
I see.

524
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,568
So in conclusion,
you feel comfortable around him

525
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,737
but not around me.

526
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,614
Is that it?

527
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,368
Well, Ra-ra.

528
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,163
How well do you think you know him?

529
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,626
AMBULANCE

530
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,226
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

531
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,352
Oh, no.

532
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,937
Gosh, I wonder how he died.

533
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,438
Forensics think

534
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,441
he died over a month ago.

535
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,277
It'll take a while to lift his prints.

536
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,029
But we found an ID card in his wallet.

537
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,824
It isn't very clear though
because it's been in the water.

538
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,745
His name ends with "Jun"?

539
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,332
Yes. His resident registration number
is still readable, so we looked it up.

540
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,127
He was reported missing six months ago.

541
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,047
Contact whoever made the report
and ID the victim.

542
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,048
Yes, sir.

543
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,092
Detective Cho!

544
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,476
Hello?

545
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,896
Yes.

546
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,565
Where?

547
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,359
This is Detective Kang
from Eunpo Police Station.

548
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,903
Police?

549
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,364
What is this about?

550
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,490
Well…

551
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,785
We believe that your son
has been found dead.

552
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,538
Could you come to our station immediately?

553
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,547
Jun doesn't like to talk about himself.

554
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,467
He said he has no family.

555
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,554
To tell you the truth,
he seems to have a lot of secrets.

556
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,307
But I try not to pry.

557
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,100
Why not?

558
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,020
Because he looks hurt and sad.

559
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,814
So I told him that he can just tell me

560
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:18,110
when he wants to tell me.

561
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,862
Seung-gi told me

562
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,324
that Jun really hates being photographed.

563
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,451
-How does he know?
-When they were playing

564
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,621
basketball together a while ago,
he thought Jun looked very cool.

565
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,999
So he started recording a video of Jun
for his channel.

566
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,751
And?

567
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,879
Wow, he looks so cool.

568
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,344
What are you doing?

569
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,058
Don't take photos or videos
without asking.

570
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:52,019
"Don't take photos or videos
without asking!"

571
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,399
He got all angry
and deleted all the videos of himself.

572
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,027
Gosh, you guys also tell me
to delete your photos

573
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,322
because you think
you look too fat or ugly in them.

574
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,158
He's a spring chicken in his 20s,

575
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:10,037
but we're all getting chubby
and wrinkly because we're getting old.

576
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,417
Anyway, is he trying to lie low
for some reason?

577
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,128
Could he be a fugitive on the run?

578
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,879
-Oops.
-Don't be ridiculous.

579
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,257
Do you actually think
Jun looks like a fugitive?

580
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,592
-Never judge a book by its cover.
-Enough.

581
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,887
Suk-gyeong, tell us more
about the person Ra-ra is looking for.

582
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,016
The name was Doremifa
or something like that.

583
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,728
I heard that person
sent the piano to LaLa Land.

584
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,895
-Yes.
-Seriously?

585
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,065
I'm supposed to meet them
in two weeks anyway,

586
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:42,361
so I'm going to be patient even though
I'm really curious to know who it is.

587
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:48,075
You came all the way here to meet
them but ended up settling down.

588
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,870
You found a place to stay
and even opened your own academy.

589
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,663
You're right.

590
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:59,086
Has it ever occurred to you that
the person nicknamed Dodosolsollalasol

591
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,715
could be someone you've already met?

592
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,427
I guess not.

593
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,482
I'm looking to buy a gift for someone.

594
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,566
I see.

595
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,069
How old is this person?

596
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,237
Mid-20s?

597
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,352
I gift-wrapped it for you.

598
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,353
Oh.

599
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,480
I hope they like it.

600
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,023
Thank you.

601
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:31,720
Thank you for the lunch and tea
and also for your precious time.

602
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,347
Get some rest.

603
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,224
Let's do this again.

604
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,684
Pardon?

605
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,478
I'll buy you dinner.
Until you feel comfortable around me.

606
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,230
Well…

607
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,524
-I'll think--
-Good night.

608
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,659
What?

609
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,079
What is this?

610
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,920
TO RA-RA

611
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,681
Hey, this is the third time.

612
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,644
He knows how to touch a girl's heart.

613
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,368
Jun, you really are the best.

614
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,788
She's so random.

615
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,628
Did you have fun today?

616
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,636
Are you asleep?

617
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,933
Did you get any students?

618
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,354
Everything's okay, right?

619
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,314
I guess your big sister

620
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,111
conked out again
because she was stressed out.

621
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,599
What is wrong with me?

622
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,199
Ha-yeong,
I think you're really good at this.

623
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,743
You'll beat your mom soon.

624
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,828
Ra-ra, this isn't my only talent.

625
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,955
I'm also very good at makeup.

626
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,915
I know.

627
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,045
Open.

628
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:57,885
Ha-yeong.

629
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,512
Are you Ra-ra's stylist or something?

630
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,014
This is my hobby, okay?

631
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,682
Just come and eat your breakfast!

632
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,869
This is so good.

633
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,038
It's way better than the sandwich

634
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,917
from the place by Apgujeong Station where
you have to wait ten minutes in line.

635
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,293
Really?

636
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,795
That place is so famous.

637
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:19,425
Business is so good that the owner
always takes one full season off.

638
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,759
Every summer.

639
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,387
During summer, he travels the world.

640
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,472
Gosh, talk about work-life balance.

641
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,599
What's that sandwich like?
I want to try it.

642
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,435
I'm telling you. This is much better.

643
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,105
Then shall I make a few more
and pack them for you?

644
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,398
I'd love that!

645
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,901
Okay, I'll make them quickly.
You have something there.

646
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:44,074
Mom, since you're making more anyway,
make one for my Jun, too.

647
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,868
If only you cared about me that much.

648
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,121
Ra-ra, how are things with you?

649
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,415
Are you still working hard
to get students?

650
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,167
Yes, of course!

651
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,839
LALA PIANO LAND

652
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,388
THE 15TH EUNPO SHARING EVENT

653
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,349
TOWN BULLETIN BOARD

654
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,669
Hi, Mimi!

655
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,838
I'm parched.

656
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,600
This is so refreshing.
Mimi, you must've waited for me all day.

657
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,686
Oh, boy.

658
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,147
Nothing's easy in life.

659
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,815
Right, Mimi?

660
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,194
What?

661
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,865
You're back already?
Don't you have a night shift today?

662
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,076
I changed my schedule a little.

663
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,994
-Why?
-To learn piano.

664
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:13,664
Here's

665
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,374
my lesson fee.

666
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,174
I'll be your very first student.

667
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,137
Jun.

668
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,309
Thanks, Jun. Seriously, thanks so much!

669
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,856
Mimi!

670
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,817
Isn't Jun so awesome?

671
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,694
I thought he was just a handsome guy.

672
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,238
But he's generous,
and he can even fix up a house.

673
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,448
And look, he wants to be my first student.

674
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,826
Hey, can you not say stuff like that
out loud?

675
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,452
Isn't he the best?

676
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,037
Gosh, seriously.

677
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,000
What?

678
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,002
Dr. Cha!

679
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:01,753
Well…

680
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,840
I'd like to learn piano.

681
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,759
Can I sign up now?

682
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:10,554
Of course! Sure thing.

683
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,140
Welcome.

684
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,562
So you learned up to Czerny 30
when you were little?

685
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,398
And you, Dr. Cha?

686
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,193
I guess you've never learned it.

687
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,030
Well… No.

688
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,907
Then do you know where Do is?

689
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,784
Not really.

690
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:38,790
Do you see this white key in front of
the two black keys? This is Do, Middle C.

691
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,627
Easy, right?

692
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,922
Then do you want to give it a shot?
Do, re, mi.

693
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,302
Do, re, mi.

694
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,815
His posture is relaxed,
and so are his shoulders.

695
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,735
Look at him using gravity.

696
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:10,697
And that neat sound.
He knows how to properly play the piano.

697
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,824
Why did you lie?

698
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,742
Sorry?

699
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,453
You can play the piano very well.

700
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,497
You're like a pro.

701
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,417
I didn't think you were so sensitive.

702
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,671
I'm surprised
you have such sharp eyes and ears.

703
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,655
"I Want You."

704
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,867
Erik Satie wrote this song to confess
his love to a woman named Suzanne Valadon.

705
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,495
To say, "You're mine,
so please love me back."

706
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,213
"I Want You."

707
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:38,452
I'll take Ra-ra home on the days
that I have lessons with her

708
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,120
since we live in the same building.

709
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,997
Sure.

710
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:43,915
Let's go.

711
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:44,916
Okay.

712
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,961
-Sweet dreams, Jun.
-Bye.

713
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,428
LALA PIANO LAND

714
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,517
Jeez, why are there so many?

715
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,728
Jun, can you order some more avocados?

716
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,316
Jun.

717
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,527
Is everything okay with you?

718
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,279
You've been so quiet and down.

719
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,365
You seem listless,
like when I first met you.

720
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,217
JIN BEAUTY SALON
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

721
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,343
-Hey!
-Hi.

722
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,388
Why are you here?
You don't have any lessons today.

723
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:06,725
Ms. Jin made gimbap,
so I stole some for you.

724
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,354
Just kidding.
She told me to drop it off for you.

725
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,439
Come have a seat.

726
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,484
Gosh.

727
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,946
Thanks.

728
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:20,906
Wait.

729
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,658
Sunwoo Jun, before you eat…

730
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,830
I see that you didn't practice at all.

731
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,626
Well, that's… I was going to do it today--

732
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,879
Ms. Gong whipped me on the back
of my hands for things like this.

733
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,089
Don't tell me you'll do that to me.

734
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,967
No, there's a better way.

735
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,262
I'll tell you later.

736
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,514
Jeez, I'm so curious now.

737
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,183
Eat up.

738
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,436
I'm going to watch you eat gimbap.

739
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,275
Stop. You're making me sick.

740
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,909
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

741
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,162
Oh?

742
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,039
It's raining.

743
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,214
FLOWERS

744
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,592
I should get going.
Do you have an umbrella?

745
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,052
Hold on.

746
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,150
I'll walk you home.

747
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,570
Are we sharing the umbrella?

748
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,405
Yes.

749
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,577
This umbrella is quite small.
We'll get soaked.

750
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:34,164
I hate getting rained on.
Hold it well, okay?

751
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,707
You're so demanding.

752
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:38,960
What?

753
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,046
It's Dr. Cha.

754
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,757
-Are you still at LaLa Land?
-Yes.

755
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,592
I'll pick you up on my way home.

756
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,801
Since it's raining.

757
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:47,761
Really?

758
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,971
I'll call you when I'm there.

759
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:50,889
Okay!

760
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:56,728
You don't need to walk me home.
Dr. Cha will pick me up on his way home.

761
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,689
-Oh, I see.
-It's nice to befriend a neighbor.

762
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,566
I can get a ride on a day like this.

763
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:04,110
I bet it would've been a hassle
for you anyway.

764
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,488
Yes, of course.

765
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,660
When will he get here?

766
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,957
I guess he's running a little late.
Right, Mimi?

767
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,979
Oh, he must be here.

768
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,315
Sweet dreams, Mimi.

769
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,861
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

770
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,496
Bye.

771
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:02,836
Bye.

772
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,387
Jun.

773
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,601
What's wrong, Jun?

774
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,604
Jun.

775
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:24,858
Are you all right?

776
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,216
Don't go.

777
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,308
Don't leave.

778
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,757
I should get going.
Do you have an umbrella?

779
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:32,550
Hold on.

780
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,144
Can you not say "bye" when you leave?

781
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,730
It's sad to lose something you cherish.

782
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,149
Jun, you can tell me.

783
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,402
You can share your sorrow with me.

784
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,488
Why can't you find my son?

785
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,782
Why is it
that you still haven't found him?

786
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:38,866
What's up?

787
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,203
I came because I was worried.
For a few reasons.

788
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,414
Are you sure it was him?

789
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,041
Jun, you should just cry when you're sad.

790
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,877
Cry all you want and start over.

791
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:53,506
Cry and let it all out today
so that you can start over tomorrow.

792
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,926
-What are those flowers for?
-I don't know. Someone left them.

793
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,637
Maybe it's from
your twinkle, twinkle, little star.

794
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:03,975
