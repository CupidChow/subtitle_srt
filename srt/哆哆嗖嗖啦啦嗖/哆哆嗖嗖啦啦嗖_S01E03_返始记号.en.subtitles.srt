JIN BEAUTY SALON

2
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,315
Don't get the wrong idea. It's not--

3
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,443
Go put on some clothes!

4
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,994
What are you guys doing?

5
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,454
-I was sleep--
-I showered…

6
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,371
-What?
-What?

7
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,456
To sleep together?

8
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,209
-Run.
-Jun!

9
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,214
Where are you going? Jun!

10
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,970
What brings you here this late?

11
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,057
Did you come all the way here to see me?

12
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,894
No, I was just…

13
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,439
I was just suspicious of him.

14
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,733
Look who's talking.

15
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,152
You're the most suspicious one
out of all of us!

16
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,405
Yes, you. Why were you peeking
into our salon?

17
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,825
No, it's not what you think!

18
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,120
I'm really

19
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,455
not that kind of person.

20
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,208
What's he saying?

21
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,378
I'll explain.

22
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,047
I came here
because I was worried about Ra-ra.

23
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,466
Why would you worry about her?

24
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,176
That's…

25
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,888
Because she's my patient, you know.

26
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,435
All right, enough.

27
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,437
Let me introduce everyone.

28
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,691
This is Jun. He lives here.

29
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,860
She's staying here for now.

30
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,987
And you're her doctor?

31
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,865
And you?

32
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,199
Me?

33
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,910
I'm Jun's future wife.

34
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,245
Hey!

35
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,581
You were worried about your boyfriend?

36
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,541
-I'm not her boyfriend.
-Don't worry.

37
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,043
I was only going to stay here
for the night anyway.

38
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,337
Ra-ra, do you have a place to stay?

39
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,721
I'll look for it tomorrow.

40
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,681
Stay here until you find a place to stay.

41
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,393
No! Just stay at my place.

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,190
Gosh, I have a feeling she'll run away.

43
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,734
Ma'am, You're okay, right?

44
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,694
We'll administer anesthesia.

45
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,905
Wait.

46
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,864
What's wrong?

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,116
Can I use the bathroom?

48
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,952
Just put her to sleep.
Why let her go to the bathroom?

49
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,666
-My gosh! She's gone!
-See? What did I say?

50
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,376
She ran away!

51
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,837
My goodness.

52
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,467
Daughter, I need one more beer.

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,345
We'll administer anesthesia soon.

54
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,513
Ha-yeong.

55
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,145
Ha-yeong.

56
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,818
Where did she go?

57
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,197
Give me that. I'll do it.

58
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,324
It's okay. It's mine, so I'll carry it.

59
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,077
Let me. It's heavy.

60
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,621
Hand it over.

61
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,208
I'll walk you over.

62
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,627
I absolutely cannot let you
carry her stuff.

63
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,587
Out of the way.

64
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,429
Wait.

65
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,848
Can I have a quick word?

66
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,145
I guess you like Jun.

67
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,024
I like him so much.

68
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,901
So you better not be interested in him.

69
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,072
I have too much on my plate
for something like that.

70
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,117
Is that so?
Then pay him back as quickly as you can.

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,743
Get out of the picture already.

72
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,578
I heard you, so stop being mean.

73
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,247
Gosh.

74
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,708
Well…

75
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,627
Sorry about the misunderstanding.

76
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,463
I apologize.

77
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,591
I was wondering, though.

78
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,052
Have you lived here a long time?

79
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,432
Just over a month, I think?

80
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,976
It used to be Mr. Kim's flower shop,

81
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,811
but it was left vacant.

82
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,355
What's Jun's relationship to him?

83
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,942
I heard Jun saved his life
when he got into an accident

84
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,402
and was on the brink of death.

85
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,448
Jun carried him to the hospital
and even took care of his hospital bill.

86
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,326
I guess he's always been compassionate.

87
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,328
What? "Passion"?

88
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,539
No, compassion.
You don't know what it means?

89
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,666
I don't know.

90
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,920
Anyway, the important thing here is
that you're just like that 80-year-old man

91
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,547
to Jun.

92
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:44,385
Jun likes to help those in need.
It's like his hobby.

93
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,139
What?

94
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,601
Did you think Jun helped you
because he was interested in you?

95
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,019
No. It's not that, but…

96
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,354
-We met before and--
-What?

97
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,066
You two knew each other?

98
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,984
I met her at her wedding.

99
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,236
I was delivering her bouquet.

100
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,781
I see.

101
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,158
That's why.

102
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,285
That's why he had to help her.

103
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,245
He knew about Ra-ra's situation.

104
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,371
What do you mean?

105
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,248
It's nothing.

106
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,002
Make sure Ra-ra doesn't skip
her appointments at the hospital.

107
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,924
No! No way.

108
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,926
Are you kidding me?

109
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,594
Why would you sneak out and bring

110
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,180
this homeless girl here?
What is wrong with you?

111
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,933
"Homeless"?

112
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,268
This isn't what you said. I'm off.

113
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,394
No, Ra-ra! Hold on.

114
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,940
Mom, please. She'll pay 20,000 won a day.

115
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,777
Just let her stay in that empty room
and you'll earn 600,000 won a month.

116
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,821
It's such a sweet deal for us, Mom.

117
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,494
Young lady, can you afford the rent?

118
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,251
Well, not right now.

119
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,753
But once this is healed, I'll earn money.

120
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,714
How will you earn money?

121
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,691
I had a long day,
so I'll think about it tomorrow.

122
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,864
So you want to stay here and live off us?

123
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,367
Then you're a parasite, not a lodger.

124
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,162
A parasite!

125
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,540
HAPPINESS GROWS WHEN SHARED

126
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,585
What? A parasite?

127
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,962
Did you just call me a parasite?

128
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,630
Yes! A parasite.

129
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,965
Excuse me!

130
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,053
I've never even had a parasite
in my stomach in my entire life.

131
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,054
Also,

132
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,140
parasites…

133
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,480
look really weird!

134
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,193
Ra-ra!

135
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,404
You had it out for her earlier.
What's with you now?

136
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,949
That was before I found out
that she was going to stay with Jun!

137
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,827
You can't think straight
because you're head over heels.

138
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,497
-Don't hit me!
-Get back here!

139
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,166
Gosh, who does she take after?

140
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,375
JIN BEAUTY SALON

141
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,419
Jun! Didn't Ra-ra come here?

142
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,547
Shouldn't she be at your place now?

143
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,800
If she didn't come here…

144
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,345
Did she just leave, then?

145
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,473
Did something happen?

146
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,682
Sorry?

147
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:42,188
Well, my mom called her a parasite.

148
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,024
Then she said parasites look weird
and stormed out.

149
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,484
What is wrong with her?

150
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,166
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after…

151
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,960
Darn it. Where is she?

152
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,649
My phone even died.

153
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,153
I have no idea where I am right now,

154
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,281
and my phone is dead.

155
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,659
Nothing's going my way.

156
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,796
Dad.

157
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,677
Dad…

158
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,019
Jun!

159
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,737
-What are you doing here?
-Jun.

160
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,158
Thank you.

161
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,452
Seriously.
Thank you so much for finding me.

162
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,605
What's wrong with me?

163
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,282
You were going to flee
without paying me back?

164
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,867
No, of course not.

165
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,078
I can't run away from you.

166
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,705
Why not?

167
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,666
Because at the moment,

168
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,004
you are the only one who'd lend me money.

169
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,215
And I'll have to

170
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,884
keep on borrowing money from you.

171
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,886
Jeez.

172
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,433
I was trying to find your place
but got lost because it's so dark.

173
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,685
Why is your phone off?

174
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,437
Why would I turn it off?

175
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,981
It turned itself off
because it ran out of battery.

176
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,108
And? It's cold and dangerous out here.

177
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,027
Were you going to sit around all night
on your suitcase?

178
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,991
I thought I should be able
to find your place once the sun comes up.

179
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,909
Gosh, you fool.

180
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,288
-Move.
-What?

181
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,430
A piggyback, please?

182
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,556
Hell no!

183
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,297
Make sure you go pick up
my suitcase later.

184
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,132
Okay.

185
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,639
-Shall we just go to my place?
-No.

186
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,641
Just tell Ms. Jin you can vouch for me.

187
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,602
-But you'd be uncomfortable there.
-If you had two rooms,

188
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,187
I'd stay with you.

189
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,980
-What?
-If I stay with you,

190
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,774
you'll have no place to sleep.

191
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,276
I can figure out that much.

192
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,241
I said we could sleep next to each other.

193
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,076
-What? Hey!
-Hey.

194
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,329
Jeez, it was just a joke.

195
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,928
I'll vouch for her.

196
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,681
If Ra-ra can't pay her rent,

197
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,517
I'll lend her money.

198
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,022
Are you saying you'll be her guarantor?

199
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,941
Why would you do that?

200
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,362
She already owes me money.

201
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,155
I'll just add it to that.

202
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,032
I hate this!

203
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,826
Are you her bank or what?

204
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,327
-Then lend me money--
-Hey!

205
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,705
Why are you getting jealous?

206
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,708
Go to your room. Go on.

207
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,459
Go!

208
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,046
So? Do you have a lot of stuff?

209
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,383
This is the room.

210
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,772
Could you all leave?

211
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,734
I had such a stressful day,
so I want to be alone.

212
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,235
The thing is…

213
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,323
I'm an artist,
so I can be quite sensitive.

214
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,660
-All right.
-What kind of art?

215
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,870
Come on. Let's go.

216
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,469
13,530 LIKES

217
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,762
9,347 LIKES

218
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,805
So she actually used to be rich.

219
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,310
These designer boutiques
and upscale restaurants…

220
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,103
12,920 LIKES

221
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,397
This is like on another level.

222
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,440
What?

223
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,358
Mom.

224
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,777
Isn't this a grand piano?

225
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,111
Is she really a pianist?

226
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,113
It could be all a lie.

227
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,950
I heard there are a lot of scammers
on social media.

228
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,577
I saw on a TV show
that you can post these things

229
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,746
and make money through brand sponsorship.

230
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,874
Let's be honest. Her hand…
She can't even use that hand now.

231
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,085
Maybe she's just a jobless punk.

232
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,671
But still…

233
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,839
I don't have any money at the moment.

234
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,509
She's so confident when borrowing money.

235
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,096
That's why I find this believable.

236
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,305
Hey!

237
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,516
All con artists are like that.

238
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,936
They have no shame.
They can be so brazen-faced.

239
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,062
Right?

240
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,563
What do you think?

241
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,316
You must know her better than we do.

242
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,235
I'm not sure.

243
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,529
For a con artist, she is…

244
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,116
too simple-minded.

245
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,868
I see. She's simple-minded.

246
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:42,459
Mom, she must be really dumb
for Jun to say something like this.

247
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,879
Are you really giggling right now?

248
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,842
But why is she so quiet now?

249
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,594
Based on what I saw,
I'm surprised she's this quiet.

250
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,687
What if she wanted
to hurt herself or something

251
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,856
-and actually did it?
-What?

252
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,193
Are we going to have to carry
her corpse out of the room?

253
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,862
-No!
-Gosh, no!

254
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,159
What's going on?

255
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,120
Nothing, sorry. Go back to sleep.

256
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,830
Just go back to sleep.

257
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,665
Okay.

258
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,760
-Young lady.
-Yes?

259
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,179
Excuse me, but how can you sleep
right now?

260
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,638
Yes.

261
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,350
I'm so stressed out.

262
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,522
I have to pay Jun back
and also pay my rent,

263
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,735
but I don't know
how I'm going to earn money.

264
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,749
Good night.

265
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,833
Let's go.

266
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,215
I can't believe this.

267
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:15,636
How can she sleep so soundly
when she's stressed out?

268
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,806
She's my cup of tea.

269
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,308
When will she get her act together
and make money?

270
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,185
Let's go.

271
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,814
Gosh.

272
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,414
EPISODE 3

273
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,549
Back then, I was most terrified of Bach.

274
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,678
Bach, who is known as the father of music,
was so strict, unlike my dad.

275
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,972
Today, we'll play Bach.

276
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,599
Just hearing his name terrified me.

277
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,728
The simple melody that sounds as though
your hands are having a conversation.

278
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,021
It bored me to death.

279
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,692
Don't be hasty!
Pay attention to every finger. Be precise.

280
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,281
In hindsight, the kind of music that
grows on you when you're fully devoted,

281
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,907
that was Bach.

282
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,967
Ra-ra.

283
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,429
It's hard, isn't it?

284
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,098
But you have to overcome this.

285
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,351
Enduring these difficult moments

286
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,438
will be a huge gift to you later on.

287
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,023
Don't ever forget that.

288
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,649
Okay.

289
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,505
Right, that's it.

290
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,593
I think I'd be a great piano teacher.

291
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,607
Wake up. Come and have breakfast.

292
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,370
You'd better hurry.

293
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,830
Come now,
or there won't be any food for you.

294
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,085
What? Food? Food!

295
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,228
Ouch.

296
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,069
She's such a handful.

297
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,737
Hey, go brush her hair.

298
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,367
Be gentle, please.

299
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,499
No, the other way.

300
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,001
No, like this.

301
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,136
You're really good.

302
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,887
This is nothing.

303
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,181
No, you're very good at this.

304
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,433
You have the talent.

305
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,560
EXCELLENT JOB!

306
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,688
Do you want a hairpin?

307
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,689
Sure!

308
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,528
-Here?
-No, move it up a little.

309
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,238
-How about this?
-No, up.

310
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,948
-Here?
-No, to the left.

311
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,199
Just another centimeter.

312
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,200
-Here?
-Yes.

313
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,371
You have such a good eye.

314
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,834
-Shall I do this again tomorrow?
-I'd be grateful!

315
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,630
Come and eat.

316
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,308
Do you eat with your eyes?

317
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,768
Why aren't you eating?

318
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,813
This is different
from the breakfast I'm used to.

319
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,399
Is that so?

320
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,319
Tell us what kinds of fancy things
you used to eat.

321
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,112
Like what? Give us an example.

322
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,076
Freshly squeezed kale apple juice.

323
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,828
Gluten-free quinoa bread
with avocado spread.

324
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,206
Yogurt with blueberry granola
and coconut chunks.

325
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,542
Salad with chicory, radicchio,
romaine lettuce, and lemon vinaigrette

326
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,337
topped with black olives and brie.
Those were my staples.

327
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,132
No English, okay?

328
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,133
Was that a rap?

329
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,427
Don't eat, then.

330
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,644
This rice you cooked tastes so good.

331
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,021
This sheen, chewiness, and texture.

332
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,314
It's better than the rice

333
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,942
cooked by Ms. Kim
who worked for my family for 20 years.

334
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,569
-Really?
-Yes.

335
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,074
She had cooking certificates
for four different cuisines

336
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,034
including Chinese, Korean, and Western.

337
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,994
But your rice tastes so much better.

338
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,749
EXCELLENT JOB!

339
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,669
Then shall I cook more rice?

340
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,297
Would you really? I'd be so grateful then.

341
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,883
I get hungry more often
now that I'm broke.

342
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,513
Here, have some meat.

343
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,016
Don't hog all the side dishes, okay?

344
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,608
Ra-ra.

345
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,069
Mom has to work.
Can't you cook rice yourself?

346
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:09,573
I can, of course.
Without this, I can do everything.

347
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,700
So cut me some slack
just until this heals.

348
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,122
SOMANG PIANO ACADEMY

349
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,915
PART-TIME INSTRUCTORS NEEDED

350
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,383
So you studied piano at Seohan University?

351
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,468
-Yes.
-Have you taught piano before?

352
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,262
No.

353
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,181
Hey, turn on the metronome.

354
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,348
You're off beat.

355
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,604
You seem very passionate.

356
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,192
It's a small academy,
so I can't pay you a lot.

357
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,653
Pardon me? Does it mean I got the job?

358
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,780
Yes.

359
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,324
But your hand…

360
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,744
I'll get this removed soon,
so don't worry.

361
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,705
Then let's wait until
your hand is fully recovered.

362
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,625
I'll see you when you can
play the piano properly again.

363
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,045
Thank you. Thank you so much.

364
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,382
SOMANG PIANO ACADEMY

365
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,813
Why isn't he picking up?

366
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,232
I want to brag about it.

367
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,360
Please leave a message after the tone.

368
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,071
Ms. Jin!

369
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,157
I got a job as a piano instructor.

370
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,119
-Really?
-I was so stressed out

371
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,872
because you kept grilling me
about how I'd make money.

372
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,916
Now, I can finally breathe.

373
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,381
Hey! That's not yours!

374
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,259
That's mine. If you want it, pay for it.

375
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,177
Suk-gyeong.

376
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,847
Who is that young lady?

377
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:06,731
So in summary,

378
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,068
Rara Cosmetics was your father's company.

379
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,320
But he passed away
on the day of your wedding,

380
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,614
and you lost everything. Is that it?

381
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,907
Yes.

382
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,119
Mr. Moon sorted out the inheritance issue
and gave you money,

383
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,704
but you got conned.

384
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,247
-Yes.
-Oh, my goodness.

385
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,917
Things like that actually happen?
It sounds like a movie.

386
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,712
Hang on. This sounds

387
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,339
a lot like the TV show, The Great Traitor.

388
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,134
The story's really similar.
Don't you think so?

389
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,052
-Yes, you're right!
-My gosh!

390
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,472
The secretary
betrays the main character, too.

391
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,477
Ra-ra, where's Secretary Moon?
Can you reach him?

392
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,444
Gosh, no way!

393
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,155
He's not a bad person.

394
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,073
He gave me all the money he had saved up

395
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,492
and moved back home.

396
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,344
Sir, we should head back now.

397
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,513
We'll leave in ten minutes.

398
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,806
Yes, sir.

399
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,875
You just never know.
You should check just in case.

400
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,460
There's that famous saying.

401
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:54,047
You can't sound water,
but you can sound the human mind.

402
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,757
Exactly.

403
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,552
No, it isn't. It's, "you can sound water,
but not the human mind."

404
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,557
I heard Ye-seo gets such good grades.

405
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,103
How come her mom makes a mistake
every time she says something?

406
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,562
What about Seung-gi?

407
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,818
Does he get such bad grades
because of his smart-ass mom?

408
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,654
It's always him or Ha-yeong
that comes last in the class.

409
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,573
No, he's the third one from the bottom.

410
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,450
From the bottom? What a genius!

411
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,660
Enough!

412
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,162
Why bring up my daughter's grades?

413
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,126
Then what about your family?

414
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,586
No other family members?

415
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,549
I have a little sister,
but she's in the hospital at the moment.

416
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,427
Why? Is she ill?

417
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,514
Ra-ra, you had a younger sister?

418
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:48,309
Yes, her name is Mimi.
She'll be discharged soon.

419
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,146
Ra-ra and Mimi?

420
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,565
Your father gave you girls
such great names.

421
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,941
Right?

422
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,613
You know, if she comes and stays with you,
your rent will go up.

423
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,365
I should get going.

424
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,742
Hey.

425
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,957
So, Jun from next door brought her here?

426
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,460
What was it called?

427
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,254
Right, I heard they have
a creditor-debtor relationship.

428
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,466
Is he a loan shark?

429
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,261
Hey, there's something
I've always wanted to know.

430
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:26,306
What was Jun doing before?

431
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,019
I don't know. He doesn't talk much
and he never talks about himself.

432
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,607
You know, I thought he was mute
when I first met him.

433
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,361
-My gosh!
-Now, I'm even more curious.

434
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,744
What? What did you just say?

435
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,288
I don't think he's in Seoul.

436
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,539
What?

437
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,334
Then where is he?

438
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:58,296
His phone was last pinged
at the Seoul Express Bus Terminal,

439
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,758
so my guess is that
he went to another city via bus.

440
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:06,137
Damn it! Stop guessing. Just find him!

441
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:10,225
The director will return soon.
How many times do I have to tell you?

442
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,601
We're doing our very best--

443
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,148
If you don't find anything within a week,

444
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,401
I'll fire you
and hire a different company.

445
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,529
You got that?

446
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,906
Damn it!

447
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,332
She cuts me off every single time.

448
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,751
I'm beginning to understand exactly

449
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,003
why he ran away.

450
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,384
Where in the world is that bastard?

451
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,857
SUNWOO JUN

452
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,326
What is this?

453
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,453
Are these numbers
or some kind of secret code?

454
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,628
An old photo of him?

455
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,922
How cute.

456
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,427
Why go through my stuff?

457
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,470
I'm sorry.

458
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,223
I noticed the photo
while flipping the pages.

459
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,362
Sorry, I yelled at you.

460
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,990
It's okay.

461
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,001
I heard you got a job.

462
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,213
Yes! Isn't it such great news?
You must be stoked.

463
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,716
Of course, you can finally pay me back.

464
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,510
I think God gave it to me as a gift

465
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,679
because I felt so bad
about owing you money.

466
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,641
But you don't look sorry at all.

467
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,601
Jun, is there anything I can drink?

468
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,688
Fill up the fridge, please.

469
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,691
You know that my favorite is
freshly squeezed fruit juice, right?

470
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,027
Stay here if you want.

471
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,196
Where are you going?

472
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,531
To make money.
I'm your guarantee, after all.

473
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,492
I have somewhere to go, too!

474
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,249
How's your mom's health?

475
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,710
-Is she still on meds?
-Yes.

476
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,712
It was a big shock, you know.

477
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,839
She'll need a lot of time.

478
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,008
Right.

479
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,135
That was crazy.

480
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,764
Your makeup has changed
since your divorce.

481
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,850
You can tell? Haven't I gotten prettier?

482
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:02,021
I look radiant now that
I don't have to see that jerk anymore.

483
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,275
But why did he suddenly want a divorce?

484
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,528
Are you sure he left empty-handed?

485
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,780
It's not like he's leaving
the secular world

486
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,282
or dealing with some teen angst.

487
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,951
He's just losing his mind.

488
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,870
Maybe he had an affair.

489
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,163
Hey!

490
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,290
I have good instincts.

491
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,042
I'm sure it wasn't about a woman.

492
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,713
I wouldn't have let him go easily
had that been the case.

493
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,756
That's true.

494
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,051
He talked about burnout…
Something like that.

495
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,512
He gave excuses that made no sense.

496
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,348
Whatever. I don't care.

497
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,935
If he even gave up
all the assets and money…

498
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,023
What if he's terminally ill?
That can't be, right?

499
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,251
Ready for your next patient?

500
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,423
Why do you take so many pills every day?

501
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,469
They're just vitamins.

502
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,852
Hello, try this.

503
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,896
Hello, this is hydrating cream.

504
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,272
Would you like one?

505
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,070
-I want one, too.
-Sure.

506
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,620
Hey, this is the third time.

507
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,125
Give me one more.
I've almost used up my face cream.

508
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,586
You said you had somewhere to go.
This was it?

509
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,341
Go home and lie down.
If you keep this up, I…

510
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,718
You'll get tired.

511
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,262
My mind keeps running when I'm home alone.

512
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,430
It's even more tiring.

513
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,767
I'll be nearby. Don't mind me,
and focus on your work. Okay?

514
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,541
-Jun!
-Ha-yeong!

515
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,545
What?

516
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,132
-What are you doing here?
-Do you know her?

517
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,967
Are you Ha-yeong's friend?

518
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,718
-Are you here for dinner?
-Yes.

519
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,220
What are you doing here?

520
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,098
I was just hanging out
while looking at Jun.

521
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,224
Don't tell me…

522
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,434
Were you with Jun all day?

523
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,145
No, I've been following him around.

524
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,938
Gosh, I really can't stand you!

525
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,108
Starting tomorrow, I'm cutting school
and following Jun all day.

526
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,276
Are you crazy?

527
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:54,986
Don't get so worked up.

528
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,613
Don't worry. I got a job.

529
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,032
Soon, I won't even have time
to follow him around.

530
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,742
-For real?
-Yes, for real!

531
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,995
I'm starving. Let's order some food.

532
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,997
Fine. Add a lot of ham to mine.

533
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,249
I want chicken with avocado.

534
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,544
Is this my treat?

535
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,380
I guess she hasn't told you yet.
I don't have any money.

536
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:17,258
I'll treat you next time,
so don't worry and go buy some.

537
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,811
She doesn't look like someone
who'd take money from you.

538
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,406
What was his major back in college?

539
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,201
I'm not sure. He never told me,

540
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,702
but I think it was language.

541
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,787
I saw him taking orders before,

542
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,956
and he was fluent in English.

543
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,666
Hey, he can even speak Chinese.

544
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,794
He can speak other languages?

545
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,380
I bet it was mathematics.

546
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,300
I found his math notes
in his drawer today.

547
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,971
He's super athletic, too. We played
basketball together and he was amazing.

548
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,058
I bet 500 won that he majored
in social PE.

549
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:14,273
Jun, are they in your fan club
or something?

550
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,320
I see those two often so I recognize them.

551
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,489
But that girl in a cast is a new face.

552
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,575
Anyway, your time's up.

553
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,536
Take them with you and leave.

554
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,454
Okay.

555
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,210
Isn't it about time you stopped coming?

556
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,337
Gosh, I wish.

557
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,339
But I can't because of her.

558
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,341
Jun, I have a question--

559
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,676
What was your major?

560
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,555
I'm a middle school graduate.

561
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,730
Darn it.

562
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,983
My mom's going to be against
me marrying him.

563
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,068
He won't need to fulfill
his military duties.

564
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,027
Move.

565
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,029
Wait up.

566
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,950
Maybe his family couldn't afford
his tuition.

567
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,662
Hey, wait up.

568
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,373
How are you so fluent in English?
Teach me.

569
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,166
-Hey.
-Yes?

570
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,418
What's your name?

571
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,169
Ra-ra. Gu Ra-ra.

572
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,464
It sounds similar to the word "lying."

573
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,010
And your grades are the third
from the bottom.

574
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,929
Darn it. Did Ha-yeong tell you already?

575
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,223
No, I heard at the hair salon.

576
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,352
Why did my mom talk about me
and not about herself?

577
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,439
Still, isn't coming third from the last
better than second?

578
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,190
That's true, but…

579
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,776
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

580
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,445
What's your relationship with him?

581
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,696
You're so noisy.

582
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,740
-Well…
-I'm getting a call.

583
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,991
I owe him money.

584
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:47,992
-Hello?
-What?

585
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,413
Mimi can be discharged now.

586
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,664
Really?

587
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,042
So Mimi…

588
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,462
So this dog is that sister
you were talking about?

589
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,629
Yes.

590
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,758
No. Never. She can't stay here.

591
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,010
See? I'm allergic to dogs.

592
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,805
Come on. You can just wear a mask.

593
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,640
She's so adorable.

594
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,642
You wench. Who's more important?

595
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,686
Your own mom or that dog you just met?

596
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:17,897
I can't

597
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,609
live without Mimi.

598
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,453
I'll take care of her for now.

599
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,416
You should rest.

600
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,251
It's getting late. Go to bed.

601
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,339
Mimi.

602
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,424
Mimi.

603
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,261
This is so annoying.

604
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,597
Why do you have to be allergic to dogs?

605
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,016
What? What a wretched daughter.
You need a beating.

606
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,977
-Come here! Come here!
-Darn it.

607
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,105
I'll take good care of her,
so don't worry.

608
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,649
Let me just walk you guys home.

609
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,235
Mimi, I'm here.

610
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,820
I'll walk you home.

611
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,154
Gosh.

612
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:16,872
Mimi, isn't the night air so nice?

613
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,290
Right?

614
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:19,875
Right?

615
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:27,633
Mimi, I'll come pick you up
first thing in the morning, okay?

616
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,724
This won't do.

617
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,811
I'll walk you back home.

618
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,069
You shouldn't go outside alone
late at night.

619
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,821
Okay.

620
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,746
Go inside.

621
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,041
Okay. Good night.

622
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,471
-Mimi!
-What is it this time?

623
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,889
I missed her.

624
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,976
Mimi, I'll walk you back home.

625
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,353
-Okay?
-No, this will never end.

626
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,357
It would've been great
if you had two rooms.

627
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,694
Right, Mimi?

628
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,796
If you had two rooms, I'd stay with you.

629
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,549
It would've been great
if you had two rooms.

630
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,891
I've failed today as well.

631
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,985
ALARMS
PATIENT GU RA-RA'S CAST REMOVAL

632
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,076
Please remove it right now.

633
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,372
Gosh, you're quite the impatient type.
You even forgot to say hi.

634
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,546
What's wrong? Is it because
I haven't moved them in a while?

635
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,047
Let me see.

636
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,678
It could be because you haven't
moved them for some time.

637
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,931
Doctor, my fingers are fine, right?

638
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,601
They'll heal completely, right?

639
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,854
You'll need to receive physical therapy
until they're fully healed.

640
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,981
You shouldn't overwork them either.

641
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,191
Of course.

642
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,318
Thank you.

643
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,447
Excuse me.

644
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,370
To congratulate you getting your cast off,
I'd like to take you to dinner.

645
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,747
When are you free?

646
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,499
You want to have dinner with me? Why?

647
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,086
If you feel uncomfortable, never mind.

648
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,964
No, it's not uncomfortable at all.
It's just that

649
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,966
I can't today.

650
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,804
Jun! I removed my cast!

651
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:11,815
Oh, my. Mimi.
She usually doesn't do such a thing.

652
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,859
Is it because she's
in an unfamiliar place?

653
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,656
Mimi, do you want a scolding?
You shouldn't have done this.

654
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:28,457
Wow, I didn't know such a place existed.

655
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,502
It smells so nice in here.

656
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,878
It's the detergent.

657
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,214
You thought I didn't know that?

658
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,598
Metronome, 60 BPM, Adagio.

659
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,103
The sound of the machine
reminds me of a metronome.

660
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,605
It's similar to the adagio tempo.

661
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,191
I see.

662
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:41,613
Back then, I think I just played the piano
because it was there.

663
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,241
Both my dad and my teacher

664
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,202
told me to play so I did.
I didn't really think about it.

665
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,663
Isn't it funny?

666
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,459
I lost my piano

667
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,503
and even injured my fingers,
so I can't play anymore.

668
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,755
But now, I really miss it.

669
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,011
When did you first play the piano?

670
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,012
When I was four?

671
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,932
For 20 years, the piano was a part of you.

672
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,185
It's not something you can forget.

673
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,562
Those are memories
that can't just be thrown away.

674
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,898
Because they define you.

675
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,047
Do we need to put the laundry
in the dryer now?

676
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,509
We should hurry.
Ha-yeong and her mom must be waiting.

677
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,471
You shouldn't move the laundry yet.

678
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,491
Darn it.

679
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,826
-Oh, my.
-You did that on purpose, didn't you?

680
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,788
Sorry, this is my first time doing this.
Are you okay?

681
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,331
Everything's a first for you.

682
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,959
Stop flipping the meat. It'll get dry.

683
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,044
Give it to me. I'll do it.

684
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,130
What is this? Are you helping her?

685
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,550
I'm just good at this
since I've part-timed a lot.

686
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,802
What? Give them to me. I'll do it. Hurry.

687
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,054
Be quiet. Stop arguing
and just grill the meat.

688
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,393
Ra-ra. Now that your cast is off,

689
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,478
-prove yourself.
-Prove what?

690
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,313
That you're a pianist.

691
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,481
Sure.

692
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,609
Applaud.

693
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,203
-You want me to play here?
-Yes.

694
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,206
Well, I've never played it like this.

695
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,207
Go on.

696
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,854
I was duped. She deceived me.

697
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:23,442
That fraudster completely fooled me.
My goodness.

698
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,280
-Mom!
-Gosh, that's hot!

699
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,449
-Are you okay?
-She startled me.

700
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,701
Are you retaliating by playing the piano?

701
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,166
Music is love, not retaliation.

702
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,584
Hey!

703
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,006
It hurts. It feels uncomfortable.

704
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,020
She said she had other plans today.

705
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,607
Gosh, she shouldn't overwork her fingers.

706
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,486
That's enough.

707
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,196
Don't rush yourself.

708
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:11,573
Okay.

709
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:37,933
Jun.

710
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,687
RA-RA: JUN.

711
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,314
Don't get curious if you don't see me
for a few days.

712
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,149
What is she up to this time?

713
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,198
I was never curious to begin with,
so don't worry.

714
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,787
I hope you have nightmares.

715
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,540
No thanks.

716
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,544
Hey, I said no.

717
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:10,966
Is she sulking?

718
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,139
I guess your sister fell asleep
due to too much stress.

719
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,206
"Da Capo. Repeat from the beginning."

720
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,628
I was reminded of when I used to play
Bach as a child.

721
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,673
No matter how frustrated or bored
I was, I didn't rush myself.

722
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,593
I was willing to learn step by step.

723
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,813
Miss.

724
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,857
You're not overworking yourself, are you?

725
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,900
Of course not.

726
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,736
I'm taking it slowly.

727
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,535
I have 890,000 won.

728
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,703
I need much more.

729
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,792
It's dangerous to play outside
every night.

730
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,771
-Hello?
-Jun, bad news.

731
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,606
The goods will be delivered right now.

732
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,359
I'm sorry, but can you organize
the inventory

733
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,528
and set aside the new products
before leaving?

734
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:24,826
He's not a serial killer
like on the news, is he?

735
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,582
Miss!

736
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,250
Hold on!

737
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,728
"The Maiden's Prayer."

738
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,189
I'm sorry,

739
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,982
but could you play this piece?

740
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,109
Right.

741
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,987
I'll pay you.

742
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,369
I guess I'm being too rude.

743
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,662
Wait a minute!

744
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:13,208
I'm not someone
who plays the piano for money.

745
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:18,046
But if you really want me to,
I can take it.

746
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,884
Sir, you're not a bad person, are you?

747
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:23,927
No, I'm not.

748
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,137
You should stay there.

749
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,264
Please stay where you are.

750
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,153
Sir.

751
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:11,743
Did you just cry after hearing me play?

752
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,161
Goodness.

753
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,833
No one has ever cried
after hearing me play.

754
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:23,546
Thank you, sir. I really mean it.

755
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:28,218
Strangely enough,
your crying gives me energy.

756
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,385
I must be going insane.

757
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:33,014
You don't need to pay me.

758
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,933
This is my gift to you.

759
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,810
Thank you.

760
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:40,021
No, this was my pleasure. Goodbye.

761
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,610
Goodbye.

762
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,513
This is nice.

763
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,025
I told you those were mine.

764
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,027
I'll buy you ten boxes later.

765
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,863
You can put it on my tab.

766
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,658
Your tab is getting full,
but you're all talk.

767
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,452
I'll organize them neatly.

768
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,834
Ra-ra, where do you go
so late at night these days?

769
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,044
Don't tell me you're meeting Jun.

770
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,796
Of course not. I'm just…

771
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,592
The persistency of playing the piano
despite the struggles

772
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,471
put me back on my feet.

773
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,015
I'm participating in a religious activity.

774
00:57:57,098 --> 00:58:00,351
Hey, don't tell me
you've joined some cult.

775
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,020
I didn't.

776
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,315
Through my prayers,
I've restored my confidence,

777
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,150
so don't you worry.

778
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,611
Good night. You, too.

779
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,364
You should shower before going to bed.

780
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,116
I'm too tired to shower today.

781
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,327
That's dirty.

782
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,913
I'm too tired today,
so I'll start studying tomorrow.

783
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,957
Hey! You're a senior in high school!

784
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,378
Come on. Shower before going to bed.

785
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,143
-Jun!
-Where are you? Are you home?

786
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,479
It's late. Of course, I'm home.

787
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,942
What about you?

788
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,193
I just got off work.

789
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,820
-What are you doing?
-Thinking about you.

790
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:56,658
Can you-- Can you not do that?

791
00:58:56,741 --> 00:59:00,119
Why not? I have something to boast about.

792
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,041
What is it?

793
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,459
Tonight…

794
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,962
an old man cried
after he heard me play the piano.

795
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,756
You know "The Maiden's Prayer," right?

796
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,300
You know, the school bell music.

797
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,595
It's such a common song
but he was so touched

798
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,764
that he started crying.

799
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:20,765
Really?

800
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,850
I don't believe you.

801
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,937
Gosh, you've never cried
after hearing someone play, have you?

802
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,908
No. Of course not.

803
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,286
That's why you can't understand.

804
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,414
I feel so proud.

805
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,876
Do you think, perhaps,
this was a hidden talent of mine?

806
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,836
That's ridiculous.

807
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:53,673
You just wait. I'm going to make you
bawl your eyes out someday.

808
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,009
I'll look forward to it.

809
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:00,221
Can you come over tomorrow?
I have something to show you.

810
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,974
-What is it?
-Find out for yourself.

811
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,475
You're making me curious.

812
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,437
It's getting late. Go to bed.

813
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,273
I'll watch the stars first.
Go home safely and good night.

814
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,608
Okay.

815
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,433
For 20 years, the piano was a part of you.

816
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,101
It's not something you can forget.

817
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,772
Those are memories
that can't just be thrown away.

818
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,190
Because they define you.

819
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:58,613
Like he said, a part of me
was in those memories.

820
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,373
Jun, did you make this room for me?

821
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,084
Thanks, Jun. Thank you so much!

822
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,711
-"LaLa Land"?
-"LaLa Land"?

823
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:37,837
LaLa Piano Land.

824
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,256
But you're going to open an academy
with one piano?

825
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:43,009
Here's my lesson fee.
I'll be your very first student.

826
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:46,929
How well do you think you know him?

827
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:50,224
Has it ever occurred to you that
the person nicknamed Dodosolsollalasol

828
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,227
could be someone you've already met?

829
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:59,108
