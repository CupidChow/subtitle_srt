LALA PIANO LAND

00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,806
Jun.

00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,394
Jun.

00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,295
EPISODE 12
"WEDDING MARCH"

5
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,894
Why are you crying?
You shouldn't be crying right now.

6
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,312
I'm just so happy to see you.

7
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,024
I'm happy, but I can't help but cry.

8
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,527
You still have the oddest reasons.

9
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,289
This is Seung-gi's hoodie.
God, I can't believe you.

10
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,045
Jeez.

11
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,727
Have you been well?

12
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,021
Well…

13
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,357
I ate a lot.

14
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,442
What?

15
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,611
Am I the only one who starved?

16
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,905
This is unfair.

17
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,450
What? That's what Seung-gi always says.

18
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,704
So you ate a lot. What else?

19
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,457
I got my hair done and danced a lot.

20
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,918
I also played cards with Ms. Jin.

21
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,379
I kept myself busy

22
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,089
so I wouldn't think about you.

23
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,677
I stayed cooped up in my room
and thought about you all day.

24
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,388
This is annoying.

25
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,683
That's what Ha-yeong always says.

26
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,148
Anyway, you said you were locked up.
How did you come here?

27
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,525
What if your parents find out?

28
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,152
I'll

29
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,821
think about that tomorrow.

30
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,574
That's what I always say.

31
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,745
You suddenly developed
multiple personalities.

32
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,121
Isn't this a serious matter?

33
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,754
Thank you

34
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,049
for saving me that day.

35
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,426
I was truly terrified.

36
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,887
I finally got to tell you this.

37
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,016
I'm sorry for lying to you all this time.

38
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,228
But I didn't mean to deceive you. I swear.

39
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,647
I said I was the same age as you

40
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,317
on the day of your wedding because…

41
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,155
You were pretty.

42
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,658
What?

43
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,952
That's such a strange reason.

44
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,832
I didn't think I'd meet you again.

45
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,711
I didn't want to seem like a kid
just for that moment.

46
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:22,965
And why did you

47
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,384
run away from home?

48
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,265
I hated everything.

49
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,768
Maybe this prick got Ji-hun killed
to be number one.

50
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,813
2021 CSAT MOCK EXAM RESULT

51
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,980
Mom,

52
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,442
Dad, my house, studying, everything.

53
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,444
I hated them all.

54
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,118
Finally, you're back
to your I-hate-everything self.

55
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,330
Was there

56
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,207
anything you liked?

57
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,131
Ji-hun.

58
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,218
They were roommates at the dorm.

59
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,637
They couldn't live without each other.

60
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,139
He died.

61
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,807
Do you remember when I asked you

62
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,436
not to say goodbye?

63
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,354
Of course.

64
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,441
That's the last thing Ji-hun said to me.

65
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,569
Hey, you're not even going to say goodbye?

66
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,404
Bye.

67
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,035
If only I hadn't

68
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,163
called out to him…

69
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,251
Had he not come over to my house,
he'd still be…

70
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,218
No one could have predicted the accident.

71
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,057
It's not your fault.

72
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,527
It's not your fault, you fool.

73
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,744
Thanks.

74
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,671
On your wedding day,

75
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,216
I said no when you said bye to me

76
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,759
because

77
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,054
I was reminded of that accident.

78
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,766
When you were unconscious
form the accident.

79
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,853
Do you know how scared I was
that you might be dead?

80
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,234
That was also the last thing
you said to me.

81
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,777
Bye.

82
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,365
Listen.

83
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,952
You're the one who saved me
from that accident.

84
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,454
Also, you've taken good care of me
all this time.

85
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,707
And thanks to you,
I'm doing great now. Right?

86
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,963
It won't be easy,

87
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,592
but remind yourself of that
and try to overcome your pain.

88
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,643
Anyway, what should I do
about your treating me like a friend

89
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,271
despite our five-year age gap?

90
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,106
That's such a useless worry.

91
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,858
Think about it.

92
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,570
When I turn 40, you'll be 45.

93
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,406
We'll both be middle-aged.

94
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,324
The five-year gap is nothing.

95
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,994
When I turn 70, you'll be 75.

96
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,164
To a couple who's aging together,
a five-year gap is really nothing.

97
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,251
What? I have to live with you
until I get all wrinkly?

98
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,003
-Yes.
-No, thanks.

99
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,588
I'll take care of you,

100
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,173
so don't you worry, all right?

101
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,555
This must be how you felt back then.

102
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,474
What do you mean?

103
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,978
I mean, Seung-gi's clothes suit you.

104
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,024
By the way, where is he?
I haven't seen him all day.

105
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,737
Why is she still here?

106
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,209
How are the test results?

107
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,004
He hasn't been eating much
for the past month,

108
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,964
so he must be malnourished.

109
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,674
Pardon? Malnourished?

110
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,971
-Well, he's very well-nourished.
-Pardon?

111
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,848
You seem very worried,

112
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,933
so we're going to set him up with an IV.

113
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,396
Sir, please give me your arm.

114
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,275
Sir?

115
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,152
This is crazy.

116
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,881
Hold on.

117
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,009
My son's arm

118
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,969
looks too thick.

119
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,137
Darn it.

120
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,308
What's wrong with him?

121
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,185
Jun, what's wrong? Oh, no.

122
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,103
Is he convulsing?

123
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,563
-Jun.
-Are you in pain?

124
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,107
-Jun.
-Remove the blanket.

125
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,483
-Okay.
-Jun.

126
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,443
Jun, what's wrong?

127
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,404
Why are you suddenly convulsing?

128
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,532
Goodness!

129
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,744
My goodness! Why…

130
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,039
Why are you here?

131
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,541
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,876
-You're sorry?
-You see…

133
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,044
Answer me!

134
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,389
Why on earth did this brat
turn off his phone?

135
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,517
Dr. Cha, where did Ha-yeong say
she was going?

136
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,395
Well…. She said she was busy today

137
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,064
and asked me to prepare
for the recital instead.

138
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,483
Since the exams
are just around the corner,

139
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,528
I just thought she was busy studying.

140
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,072
Come on, Dr. Cha.

141
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,575
Those two aren't the type to study.

142
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,412
You shouldn't expect them
to enjoy studying just because you did.

143
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,581
Hey! My daughter studies as well.

144
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,083
My son does, too.

145
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,710
I had no idea. I never saw it.

146
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,296
-You little…
-Come on, guys.

147
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,214
Don't get all edgy for no reason.

148
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,674
So they're being a bit late.

149
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,469
What's there to worry about
when they're together?

150
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,721
-That's why I'm more worried!
-That's why!

151
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,930
Oh, no.

152
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,642
-What's wrong?
-I imagined it.

153
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,643
-What?
-What?

154
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,854
What if you two become in-laws?

155
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,898
-Darn it!
-How could you say that?

156
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,941
Goodness, you're impossible.

157
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,696
Well…

158
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,409
Jun said he needed some clothes,
so I lent him mine.

159
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,995
He asked me to lie in bed
instead of him for a bit,

160
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,788
so I did.

161
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,959
And where is he right now?

162
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,214
Don't tell me he went to Eunpo.

163
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,049
Ma'am.

164
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,636
Why are you taking it out on him?

165
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,180
This all happened
because you had locked Jun up.

166
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,894
I've been curious about who you are.

167
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,896
What's your name?

168
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,148
It's Jin Ha-yeong.

169
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,318
I'm Jin Ha-yeong, and he's Lee Seung-gi.

170
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,782
Well, aren't you just great
at answering questions?

171
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,993
All right, Ha-yeong.

172
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,662
Let me ask you a question.

173
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,624
Jun went to see that girl, Ra-ra,

174
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,417
am I right?

175
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,798
-Yes.
-I can't believe you!

176
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,508
Gosh.

177
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,055
I don't recognize this number.

178
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,059
-Hello?
-It's me.

179
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,728
Jun, where are you right now?

180
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:19,358
I'm sorry. I'm on my way back.
I called to tell you not to worry.

181
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,738
You're really coming back, right?

182
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,782
Yes, I am.

183
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,081
I'll send Mr. Kim there to pick you up.

184
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,332
I also have…

185
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,128
a few things I need to send.

186
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,588
Okay.

187
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,259
Get ready to go home.

188
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,385
Okay.

189
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,225
Right. Ma'am.

190
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,769
Here.

191
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,356
You gave this to me last time,

192
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,192
and I felt uneasy holding onto it.

193
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,237
I'm on Jun's side no matter what.

194
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,409
The car's in the parking lot, right?
All right, then.

195
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,996
-Thank you for the ride.
-Thank you.

196
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,289
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

197
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,707
Hey, you were impressive.

198
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,958
Did you just realize it?

199
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,210
-Don't be so cocky.
-Ouch, that hurts.

200
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,635
-Do you need a suitcase?
-No, I didn't pack much.

201
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,554
You're not running away again, are you?

202
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,181
No.

203
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,393
Don't skip your meals
or make your mom worry.

204
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,312
I was the nagger.

205
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,939
Since when did you become one?

206
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,691
I'm only acting this way
since you've disappeared once.

207
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,486
I have you now. I can't do that anymore.

208
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,549
Where did it go?

209
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,426
Looking for this?

210
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,930
Yes.

211
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,478
Don't you have something else to tell me?

212
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,318
My wedding wasn't our first encounter,
was it?

213
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,197
Si-a visited a few days ago.

214
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,157
Ji-hun's sister.

215
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,745
That's when everything came back to me.

216
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,917
On the day of my graduation recital,
you're the one who took the photo, right?

217
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,170
That's all?

218
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,593
Why did you feign ignorance?

219
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,347
I didn't. I just couldn't tell you.

220
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,974
You said you remember everything.

221
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,560
You don't remember
I was wearing a school uniform?

222
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,729
Hey, your sister's over there.

223
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,188
This isn't for her.

224
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,566
-What?
-There she is.

225
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,076
I told you
there was someone I liked, right?

226
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,370
Come say hi to my future wife.

227
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,002
Hello. I'm your number one fan.

228
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,795
-My fan?
-Yes. You were great today.

229
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,213
Oh.

230
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,550
-I wanted to tell you Ji-hun liked you.
-Thanks.

231
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,471
How does it feel
to be my friend's first love?

232
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,097
You're making me embarrassed.

233
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,016
So why did you get married so early?

234
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,517
Quit talking about my wedding.

235
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,186
I'm sorry. I'm just jealous.

236
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,441
By the way, Jun.
Why did you look at me that way

237
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,276
that day?

238
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,988
How did I look at you?

239
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,241
I'll always root for you. Thank you.

240
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,036
I remember the way you looked at me.

241
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,205
It was a bit strange.

242
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,962
You gave a strange answer.

243
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,051
Thanks, but that's a shame.
Today was my last day playing.

244
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,928
What? Why?

245
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,471
Because I've graduated.

246
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,681
Who quits piano
just because they graduated?

247
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,475
You'd been playing it for 20 years.

248
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,893
Was that so strange?

249
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,604
No. After living time with you,

250
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,481
I realize now you're much stranger.

251
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,857
What?

252
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,154
But what's truly strange

253
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,199
is that you're all that I can think about.

254
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,620
My head feels like it's about to explode
because I can only think of you.

255
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,269
Jun, don't you think you should grow more?

256
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,062
I just realized you're pretty short.

257
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,570
I'm 187cm, yet you want me to grow more?

258
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,949
I do think you're tall enough,

259
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,619
but I still think you should grow more.

260
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,627
I should drink a lot of milk then.

261
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,507
Your car must be here. You should go.

262
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,426
Wake up and get out already.

263
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,353
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

264
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,189
I won't do anything you don't like.

265
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,940
But…

266
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,775
I won't let go of you

267
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,028
no matter what.

268
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,615
I hope you do the same.

269
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,452
Say that you will keep the promise
you made me that day.

270
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,122
Come on.

271
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,752
I will.

272
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,592
I practiced and practiced

273
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,303
what to say to him as my last goodbye.

274
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,430
But I could never say it out loud.

275
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:28,685
Mr. Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,
what should I do?

276
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,688
Gosh, I forgot to switch clothes.

277
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,899
Ra-ra, did Jun leave
any of his clothes behind?

278
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,735
His clothes? He packed all of them.

279
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,737
Gosh, that jerk.

280
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,739
Just go home in that.

281
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,492
-Should I lend you mine?
-What?

282
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,664
-Yours would be too small for me.
-Then do you want Mimi's?

283
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,293
Hey, I think she's out of sorts again.

284
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,295
Ra-ra.

285
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,298
Get it togther and let's go home.

286
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,509
Let's go.

287
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:07,224
LALA PIANO LAND

288
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,533
You should eat.

289
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,619
I'll come down to eat from now on.

290
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,997
You don't need to bring it upstairs.

291
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,504
NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTIONS

292
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,132
Mom.

293
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,009
From now on,

294
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,261
I'll study hard

295
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,432
and won't make you worry, so…

296
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,310
may I have my phone back?

297
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,743
-You did well, ma'am.
-Sure.

298
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,078
Kids these days need their phones.

299
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,122
They're quite different from us,

300
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,915
so you must respect their culture.

301
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,003
Okay. There's just one thing
I'm worried about.

302
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,006
The carrot and the stick
come hand in hand.

303
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,884
Jun is doing very well.

304
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,844
I guess it's because he's very smart.

305
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,014
He's already caught up
on everything he's missed.

306
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,807
However,

307
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,686
he wishes to major in mathematics,
not medicine.

308
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,023
What? Mathematics?

309
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,775
Don't worry.

310
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,737
What's important is that
he's begun studying once again.

311
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,949
We can persuade him
to choose medicine down the line.

312
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,701
All right, then.

313
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,913
I'm counting on you.

314
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,208
First,

315
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,504
for the upcoming exam, we should focus
more on English and non-literary writing.

316
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,715
What about the lettuce?
Are you watering them well?

317
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,094
Of course. I'm watering them as we speak.

318
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,096
Are you cleaning regularly?

319
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,098
Of course. Mimi, here.

320
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,725
And are you watching Mimi's weight?

321
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,519
Stop nagging, will you?

322
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,396
RA-RA

323
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,830
Gosh.

324
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,223
Dr. Cha is getting better and better.
Soon, he might surpass me.

325
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,976
Don't meet him too often.

326
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,478
There you go again,
feeling jealous over nothing.

327
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,771
Mimi has something to say.

328
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,606
Here.

329
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,568
What did she say?

330
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,194
"Snap out of it, will you?"

331
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,656
That's some lousy interpretation.

332
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,702
Jun, are you eating well these days?

333
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,579
Of course.

334
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,873
Did you do well on the mock exam?

335
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,040
Of course.

336
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,458
Good.

337
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,837
You didn't forget about our dinner, right?

338
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,966
We're going to have dinner
with your dad and Ms. Kim this evening.

339
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,718
-I didn't forget.
-Good.

340
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,147
Goodness, that brat.

341
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,399
Is this how you do it?

342
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,490
MR. KIM

343
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,310
My gosh, is this from your performance?

344
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,105
Yes. Lee from the realtor's office
recorded it and sent it to me.

345
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,191
Thank goodness you taught us
how to use this.

346
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,528
Mr. Kim, you played the piece really well.

347
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,364
Come on, you're flattering me.

348
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,827
Your health is good?

349
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,913
Yes, of course.

350
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:43,041
Did Ha-yeong and Seung-gi
do well on their CSAT?

351
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,460
No. They were both upset
about bombing the exam,

352
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,587
but they quickly got over it
and are doing great.

353
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,881
They're fun, you know.

354
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,843
They're actually trying to teach Ra-ra
how to ride a bike.

355
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,764
-How come you never learned to ride it?
-I have a driver's license though.

356
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,808
Oh, that's it. You're doing great.

357
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,602
-Really? Am I doing a good job?
-No, you suck.

358
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,522
My dad didn't let me do this
because he was afraid I'd get hurt.

359
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,440
I was his precious daughter, you know.

360
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,858
I'm a precious daughter, too.

361
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:12,028
All right.
Seung-gi, you're holding it tight, right?

362
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,738
Of course.

363
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,699
Hey.

364
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,825
Look at that.

365
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,496
-Shit.
-Oh, no. Ra-ra!

366
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,706
Hey.

367
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,293
Seung-gi?

368
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,588
-Hello?
-Jun, we've got a problem.

369
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,382
What?

370
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,392
GU RA-RA
EUN DAN-O

371
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,689
Ra-ra.

372
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,941
Ra-ra.

373
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,695
Who are you?

374
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,031
Oh, I'm sorry.

375
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,494
Please only say hopeful, positive things.

376
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,121
Even if my condition is hopeless,

377
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,124
tell me I can fully recover
with the right treatment. Please.

378
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,336
Tell me that I can fully recover
with the right treatment.

379
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,714
This reminds me of the old days.

380
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,967
I was going to say that anyway.

381
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,637
I'm a little concerned that you hurt
the part you had injured in the past.

382
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,681
Just don't use that hand
for the time being.

383
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,516
I hope it heals quickly.

384
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,103
I teach at LaLa Land, you know.

385
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,356
I have to teach the lessons
and pay my rent.

386
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,775
My livelihood depends on this hand.

387
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,151
My gosh.

388
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,445
You've changed so much, Ra-ra.

389
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,782
Have I?

390
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,746
Hey, Jun. What are you doing here?

391
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,665
Obviously I came because I was worried.

392
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,340
Is your hand okay?

393
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,010
-Yes, it's nothing serious, but--
-Why did you

394
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,429
have to learn how to ride a bike
and get hurt?

395
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,015
It's not like I got hurt on purpose.
Why are you angry?

396
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,352
Because I'm upset.
Who's going to look after you now?

397
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,895
This hand is totally fine.

398
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,814
Gosh, why are you even worried?

399
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,567
Anyway, don't you have to go
to the academy today?

400
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,821
You didn't forget about our dinner, right?

401
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,203
MOTHER

402
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,343
Well…

403
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,013
Why don't we have dinner together
some other time?

404
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,891
What? She came all the way here.

405
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,059
No, it's okay.

406
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:53,314
Please don't worry. In fact,
someone requested a consultation just now,

407
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,567
so I wanted to ask
if we could reschedule this.

408
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,277
Thank you for bringing it up first.

409
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,697
I'll get going, then.

410
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,283
-Gosh, I'm really sorry.
-Don't be.

411
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,327
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

412
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,871
-Please call me.
-Will do.

413
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,797
Don't tell me this punk
went to see that woman.

414
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,759
Who?

415
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,762
Dr. Bang Jeong-nam's ex-wife.

416
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,098
Oh.

417
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,602
How did you know?

418
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,145
You thought I wouldn't know?

419
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,564
Are you keeping an eye on Jun or what?

420
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,859
It's time I got involved.

421
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,571
Honey, wait. Listen, honey.

422
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,783
I've been going easy on him
because I was afraid he'd rebel.

423
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,661
Don't do anything, honey.
I'll take care of everything.

424
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,581
You know what I'm capable of.

425
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,621
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

426
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,016
Hold on. It's so quiet here today.

427
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,726
You're right. Did something happen?

428
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,271
Ra-ra is always here
when she's not playing the piano.

429
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,399
-Exactly.
-That day is finally here.

430
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,110
-What do you mean?
-What day?

431
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,530
Jun's mom is coming here today
to meet with Ra-ra.

432
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,283
-My gosh.
-That woman

433
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:12,495
who screamed "Lunatic" that day?
The wife of Sunwoo Foundation's director?

434
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,249
Wow. She'll cause quite the scene.

435
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,586
My gosh, it'll be so much fun.

436
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,338
I'm not surprised.

437
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,967
I was actually wondering
why she was so quiet all this time.

438
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,139
Even I would go bonkers
and threaten her to break up with my son.

439
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,684
I mean, just check some facts.
It's a no-brainer.

440
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,603
-What is a no-brainer?
-Gosh.

441
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,271
You heartless woman.

442
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,523
Since when were you
such a rational person?

443
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,775
Gosh, we've been close to Ra-ra
for a long time.

444
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,402
Why can't you just take her side?

445
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,112
Hold on. Hey.

446
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:49,908
I know she and I are close, but it's
a different story if she's dating my son.

447
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,825
Don't tell me

448
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,745
you'll bully me
because I think differently.

449
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,662
We will!

450
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,540
Hey, you can't do that
in a democratic country.

451
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,709
-Goodness.
-Gosh! Ouch!

452
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:08,217
But really, that lady is so intimidating.

453
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:12,972
What if that lady throws water
at Ra-ra's face, throws cash at her,

454
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,808
and slaps her face with kimchi
like those dramas we see?

455
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,186
This isn't good. We should get ready.

456
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,772
-Ra-ra doesn't even have a mother.
-Right.

457
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,940
Get ready for what?

458
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:25,193
First, let's prepare ourselves
for unexpected situations.

459
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,333
Mi-ran, you should intimidate that woman
with those big eyes of yours.

460
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,044
Bring it on!

461
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:50,426
And you. Put on a raincoat and
protect Ra-ra if she throws water at her!

462
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,513
Damn it.

463
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,018
Ra-ra won't accept any money
that woman gives her,

464
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,438
so you grab it instead.

465
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,775
What about you? What will you do?

466
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,449
I will

467
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,911
fight that woman and protect Ra-ra
like her mother would.

468
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,173
All right. Are we all ready?

469
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,466
-Yes.
-I'm ready!

470
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,176
Then shall we?

471
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,262
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

472
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,733
I'm not good at being considerate
of others or beating around the bush.

473
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,818
So I'll just cut to the chase.

474
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,781
I've been trying to be patient
for Jun's sake,

475
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,282
but I

476
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,868
really don't like you.

477
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,704
I'm aware, ma'am.

478
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,087
I can't let the two of you
go on like this.

479
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,299
I'm sure you're well aware

480
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,426
this is a critical time for Jun.

481
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:57,720
Yes.

482
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,396
At my age,

483
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,693
this autumn doesn't feel
much different from last year's.

484
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,698
Things become repetitive
because your life is stable.

485
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,576
But it's different at Jun's age.

486
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,995
The choices that he makes

487
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,249
at this critical time of his life
can make or break his future.

488
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,335
That's what you go through when you're 19.

489
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,171
Yes, I'm well aware. I just

490
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,967
couldn't cut him off
because I didn't want to hurt him.

491
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,721
I fully understand
why you're so concerned as his mother.

492
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,726
My father would've reacted the same way
had he been in your situation.

493
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,323
I didn't want to be rude
to someone else's precious daughter,

494
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,327
so I'm relieved and grateful to hear
that you understand.

495
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,708
Jun means the world

496
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,460
to my husband and I.

497
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,255
My husband and I

498
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,050
went through a lot at a late age
to conceive him through IVF.

499
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,388
He loved my sincerely

500
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,685
and filled my heart with joy.

501
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,941
This situation breaks my heart,

502
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,153
but that is what Jun means to me.

503
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,075
Please

504
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:48,080
help Jun get his life back
and return to where he belongs.

505
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,501
Yes, please don't worry.
I'll get it all sorted out.

506
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,338
Thank you so much

507
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,341
for making this decision.

508
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,102
It's the money I've borrowed from Jun.

509
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,271
I haven't paid him back,

510
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,731
but I think I should now.

511
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,869
I'll give this to him.

512
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,121
It looks like I should make sure

513
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,291
he gets this
to help you end things for good.

514
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,559
Ra-ra.

515
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,604
Where did you get that money?

516
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,690
Juju.

517
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,568
Your car? You sold the car
that your dad bought for you?

518
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:05,199
My gosh, you absolutely treasured
that car.

519
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,244
I guess in life,

520
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,706
there are times when you must
give up the things you cherish.

521
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,083
Right, Ms. Jin?

522
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,920
Gosh, you're all grown up now.

523
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,172
My goodness.

524
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:21,966
You really are.

525
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,097
I was always taller than you, you know.

526
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:35,062
I'm tired. Let me go to bed
without washing up.

527
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,065
Okay. Just today, then.

528
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,067
Go on in.

529
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,203
What are you doing here?

530
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,747
I came to see you
because I missed you so much.

531
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,668
There are so many things I want to do
in Seoul because it's been so long.

532
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,213
You must be tired of studying.
I'll treat you today.

533
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,718
Wait up.

534
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,845
-Is it good?
-Yes!

535
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,557
Try this, too.

536
00:39:58,979 --> 00:39:59,980
Eat lots.

537
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,233
Here.

538
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,777
I'm going to have two!

539
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,135
Hello.

540
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,719
Buy me this.

541
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,472
I can buy you a hundred of them.

542
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,019
I want this one.

543
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,439
-No, this one.
-It doesn't suit me.

544
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,398
It's perfect for you.

545
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,494
Is everything okay?

546
00:40:56,162 --> 00:41:00,082
Of course. I just wanted a date with you.

547
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,342
-Jun.
-Yes?

548
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,053
There's one last thing
I want to do with you.

549
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,014
"One last thing"?

550
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,016
I have to get going, you know.

551
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,059
Right.

552
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,354
What is it?

553
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,608
That thing.

554
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,736
You mean, a bicycle?

555
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,698
You hurt your hand while riding one.
You're really something.

556
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,784
I just thought of your back
all of a sudden.

557
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,536
I want to blow my nose on your back.

558
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,541
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

559
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,714
Jun.

560
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:35,135
I hope you can read this letter

561
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,513
without being surprised or angry.

562
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,599
You know,

563
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:45,229
if anyone asks me to name one person
who I want to see succeed the most,

564
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,899
I'd say it's you
without a second's hesitation.

565
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:50,818
And

566
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,738
I want to break up with you
because you mean so much to me.

567
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,742
I bet you'll say again
that my reasoning is weird.

568
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,752
I want you to focus on the things
that you must do now.

569
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,797
Whenever anything happens to me,

570
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,300
you rush to where I am,
and I really appreciate it.

571
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,803
But it also makes me uncomfortable
at times.

572
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:23,100
At the moment, there are many other things
you must focus on.

573
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,979
You're smart, so I'm sure
you know what they are.

574
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,065
Focus on those things first,

575
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,443
and we'll meet again
when we're both ready.

576
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,237
I'll also work hard.

577
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,325
If I bring this up in person,

578
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,702
you'll say you don't want to break up,

579
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,203
so I wrote this letter instead.

580
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,790
You're not crying, right?

581
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,251
If I made you cry,

582
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,586
I'm sorry.

583
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,637
Ra-ra.

584
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,640
I know we'll meet again.

585
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,774
Mr. Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

586
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,443
I broke up with him today.

587
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,863
I'm heartbroken

588
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:22,660
because I'm worried
I might really never get to see him again.

589
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,457
Will we meet again one day?

590
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,003
I won't be logging in for a while.

591
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,277
Ra-ra.

592
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,365
You're getting home late.
I've been waiting so long for you.

593
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,826
Dr. Cha.

594
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,663
I figured it'd be too cold
for ice cream now,

595
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,540
so I got you something else.

596
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,001
Here.

597
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,467
Then are we going to chat
just until I finish this?

598
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,345
Well, I can stay longer.

599
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,056
I'll stay longer if you want me to.

600
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,603
Actually,

601
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,941
I waited for you
because I have a confession to make.

602
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,111
-A confession?
-Oh, don't get the wrong idea.

603
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,864
It's not about having a crush on you
or stuff like that.

604
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,618
It's something I couldn't bring up
because I never found the right time.

605
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,287
What is it?

606
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,746
I actually

607
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,208
saw you before we met at Eunpo Hospital.

608
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,588
I saw you at the graduation recital
at Seohan University.

609
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:04,219
At the time,
I was feeling completely burnt out.

610
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,554
I never smiled

611
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,600
and couldn't even sleep
without my sleeping pills.

612
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,727
I was just miserable.

613
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,398
That day,

614
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,860
when I saw you
suddenly playing Mozart on stage,

615
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,070
I was so baffled that I cracked up.

616
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,408
I thought to myself, "Is she crazy?"

617
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,618
What?

618
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:32,331
Then I met you again when you came
to the hospital with your hand injury.

619
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,582
Is this it?

620
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,126
I just can't help but laugh.

621
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,712
I used to be expressionless,

622
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,883
but I found myself laughing out loud
for the first time in a full year.

623
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,929
"Oh, this woman

624
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,849
must have found me
to breathe life back into me."

625
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,185
That's what I thought at the time.

626
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,819
I'm very grateful to you, Ra-ra.

627
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,449
You mean so much to me,
so please cheer up.

628
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,618
I'm always rooting for you.

629
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,044
Did you look up
the meaning of this flower?

630
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,185
"I will make you happy."

631
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,564
Thank you.

632
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:43,986
Dr. Cha.

633
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,655
I knew

634
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,910
that you were Dodosolsollalasol.

635
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,416
My curiosity has finally been satisfied.

636
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,836
I always wondered how you knew
about the Mozart piece

637
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,629
only my dad and I knew about.

638
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:17,644
6 MONTHS LATER

639
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,857
You two, what's going on?

640
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,946
Why are you both on your knees?

641
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,656
You're making me anxious!

642
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,659
-Mom.
-What?

643
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,077
You know…

644
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,788
Is this what I think it is?

645
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,081
-What?
-What?

646
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,666
What do you think it is?

647
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,293
You two might become in-laws.

648
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,045
-Come here.
-You're so dead.

649
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,047
-No, that's not it.
-No, that's not it.

650
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,424
Calm down, will you?

651
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,176
Let's hear them out first.

652
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,218
-Go ahead.
-Go ahead!

653
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,345
Go ahead.

654
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,604
"Business plan"?

655
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,606
Correct.

656
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,232
BUSINESS PLAN

657
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,777
So you guys want to start
a business together?

658
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,362
Yes.

659
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,245
But the thing is, guys…

660
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,666
Do you have money for this?

661
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,042
Yes, of course!

662
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,797
The money for our college tuition fees.

663
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,216
-What?
-What?

664
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,761
What are you talking about?
You guys didn't even get into college!

665
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,888
Are you saying you won't retake CSAT

666
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,140
-and start a business instead?
-Yes.

667
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,309
You punk. Have you lost your mind?

668
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,269
You'll give up on college and do what?

669
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,187
Gosh, calm down.

670
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,356
They're giving up
because they can't get in.

671
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,108
I hate you even more!

672
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:49,277
Ladies, we're adults now.

673
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,446
We're old enough
to map out what we want to do

674
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,032
with our lives and make our own decisions.

675
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,618
-That's right.
-You and that mouth of yours.

676
00:49:56,702 --> 00:50:00,205
-Mom, no!
-Ms. Jin, no! Just hit me instead.

677
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:03,917
Gosh, you brat. Come here!
Where do you think you're going?

678
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,836
Why are you taking it out on me?

679
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,879
-Gosh, what's with you?
-That hurts!

680
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,965
Well done, Mi-ran.

681
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,093
Those with no kids have it much easier.

682
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,639
SUPULIM MATH ACADEMY
E ENGLISH

683
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,358
-Hello?
-Hey, Jun.

684
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,653
Get a health checkup
while you're at the hospital today.

685
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:37,325
And since you're going there anyway,
why don't you have dinner with your dad?

686
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:41,163
No, I'll pass.
I don't feel comfortable enough yet.

687
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,582
Right, of course. I understand.

688
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,125
All right, then.

689
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:52,424
Gosh, why is this brat so bullheaded?
Who does he take after?

690
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,594
I feel like
walking on eggshells around him

691
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,054
will send me to an early grave.

692
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:02,434
Gosh, what can I do, though? He's my son.

693
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,103
Hello.

694
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,232
-What's up?
-Hey, you're here.

695
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,861
It's nothing important.
Have you heard from Eun-seok recently?

696
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,279
No, why do you ask?

697
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:17,699
While planning my wedding,
I stumbled upon this on social media.

698
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,910
It's a wedding invitation.

699
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,287
Wait, this is Eun-seok.

700
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,373
He's getting remarried
without even telling us?

701
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,625
Check out the next photo.

702
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,628
The bride looks just like your ex-wife.

703
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,171
No way.

704
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,297
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE WEDDING!

705
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,925
Gu Ra-ra?

706
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,220
Why is Eun-seok marrying Ra-ra?

707
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,763
They're getting married?

708
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,309
Who are you?

709
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,562
She's getting married?

710
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,981
I can't believe this.

711
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,655
What was that?
Why is he more shocked than I am?

712
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,448
Hey, doesn't he look familiar?

713
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,328
Their wedding is today.

714
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,582
Hey.

715
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,477
-Hey, Seung-gi!
-Hi, Seung-gi!

716
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,062
Look at you, Chu Min-su!

717
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:31,773
Jae-min, my sweetie.

718
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,025
Hey, isn't that suit
a tad too small for you?

719
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:34,985
It fits me perfectly.

720
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:38,113
He looks good enough
to get married today. Our tough guy.

721
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,448
Gosh, I want to get married.

722
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,951
Come on.
Why bother getting married at that age?

723
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,704
Exactly. You'll just end up
with more headaches.

724
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:49,291
-But it's so fun to plan a wedding!
-Gosh, you.

725
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,542
It's so much fun!

726
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,295
Look here, ladies.
Give me a beautiful pose.

727
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,254
-Beautiful?
-Okay.

728
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,338
What should I do?

729
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,008
-Okay. This time, something funny.
-Funny?

730
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,801
-A funny pose.
-What about this?

731
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,387
-Let's hang off her arm.
-Yes!

732
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,055
Now, say a few nice words.

733
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,473
For the bride and groom?

734
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:09,352
Mr. Cha, it's okay to get a divorce.

735
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,439
Hey! Why bring up divorce
on the day of their wedding?

736
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,441
-I was just joking.
-Goodness.

737
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,318
Don't fight like this.

738
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,028
We wish you happiness!

739
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,613
Be happy!

740
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,800
Ha-yeong, you can even do
the bridal makeup like a pro.

741
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,845
Ra-ra, you know
that I'm good at everything.

742
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:47,474
Just know that you got that from me.

743
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,351
You should always be grateful. Okay?

744
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,728
Sure, sure. I heard you, okay?

745
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,772
-I've heard it so many times.
-Gosh,

746
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,274
it's time. Everyone must be waiting.

747
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:39,693
Now, the bride and groom
will walk down the aisle together.

748
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,612
Bride and groom, you may go.

749
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,033
Be happy!

750
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,036
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

751
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,179
Isn't that Jun?

752
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,723
What's he doing here?

753
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,568
-Gosh, hey.
-My goodness.

754
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,201
Goodness.

755
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,831
Is he crazy?

756
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,250
-My gosh.
-What is happening?

757
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,461
-Hey!
-Can someone stop them?

758
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,963
-Hey!
-My gosh!

759
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:12,619
EPILOGUE

760
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,832
Hurry, quick.

761
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,375
Gosh, hurry up.

762
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:20,710
Goodness.

763
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,754
Gosh.

764
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,102
That's not Eun-seok.

765
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,522
Gu Ra-ra's life is so eventful.

766
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,928
This already happened,
so just think that we got married.

767
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,930
-I don't want to.
-I'll be too anxious.

768
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,516
-Ra-ra.
-I hope winter comes soon

769
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,017
so we can officially date.

770
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,478
Why didn't you tell me?

771
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,813
Because I couldn't stand you.

772
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,982
I don't even know anymore.

773
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,192
I made a wish upon a star

774
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,069
in the sky just now.

775
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,612
I missed you a lot.

776
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,198
Where did you get that courage?

777
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,368
I just had to think of one thing. Ra-ra.

778
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,830
The owner of that piano shop.
Finally! I found him.

779
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:42,500
It's such a happy day.
I wish you were here with me.

780
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,877
Sunwoo Jun?

781
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,089
Found you.

782
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:54,053
