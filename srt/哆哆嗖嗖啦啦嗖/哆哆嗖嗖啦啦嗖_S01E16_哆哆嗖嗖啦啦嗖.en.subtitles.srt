1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,083
Is it working now?

2
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,212
Welcome to LaLa Land.

3
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,548
Do.

4
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,800
This is mi.

5
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,802
This is sol.

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,641
Mimi, here. Play mi. Mi.

7
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,852
Do, re, mi. Mi.

8
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,064
You've finally opened
your online LaLa Land.

9
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:04,981
Congratulations.

10
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,152
FINALE

11
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,570
Jun left a comment.

12
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,698
You're right.

13
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,742
Ra-ra, you should call him.

14
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,495
Ask him how he's doing
and if he misses us.

15
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,123
I can't. He said he's too busy
and that he'd call.

16
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,084
Gosh, he must be studying really hard.

17
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,336
We should work harder too.

18
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,088
Right. How many reservations
did you get this month?

19
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,593
I have many more students now.

20
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,553
I may have to bring in an extra piano.

21
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,930
What? Another piano?

22
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,932
You better not tell us to move out.

23
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,643
I can't guarantee that.

24
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,644
Come on.

25
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,146
Are you bragging
because Jun bought this place?

26
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,441
I know he's your boyfriend,
but he's a close friend of ours as well.

27
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,902
-We will never move out.
-Never.

28
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,447
Who knows?

29
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,952
Goodness.

30
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,579
I can't believe Jun
was Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

31
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:06,543
How could such a young boy be so romantic?

32
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,380
It's only because he's young
that he can sacrifice everything for love.

33
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,092
Don't you remember how he stole
someone else's bride at the church?

34
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,719
Right.

35
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,514
-Right. That was so fun.
-You're right.

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,184
-I was a little jealous too.
-Were you?

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,520
Then you should get a divorce and remarry.

38
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,439
Remarry?

39
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,318
By the way,
I heard Jun is studying in the US now.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,157
He was smart enough
to get into his dream college there.

41
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,369
Does that mean he and Ra-ra
are forced to be apart?

42
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,371
Goodness, they're still madly in love.

43
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,582
-How could they do long distance?
-Oh, no.

44
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,584
That's a useless worry.

45
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:52,046
They spend all night
texting and calling each other.

46
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,591
Their phones are on fire.

47
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,012
I miss dating.

48
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,139
You should only date.

49
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,394
Did you watch the LaLa Land video today?

50
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:07,812
Yes.

51
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,650
I was afraid Mr. Chu might break
my precious piano.

52
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,029
I was scared as well.

53
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,491
It's morning there, right?
You should hurry and go to school.

54
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,702
Go study hard.

55
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,456
We can talk more.

56
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:31,711
Come on, I shouldn't disturb you.
I'm not that dull-witted, you know?

57
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,759
Have a great day today.

58
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,013
Goodnight.

59
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,172
Hey, Jun.

60
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,383
Were you asleep?

61
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,886
Yes. I must've been tired.
I fell asleep early.

62
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,350
Did you wash your face?

63
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,104
No. I can't be bothered.
I'll do it tomorrow.

64
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,940
You're unbelievable.

65
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,193
I may be lazy about everything else,

66
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,904
but you know
I always pick up your calls, right?

67
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,572
I've gotten much better.

68
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,366
Of course.

69
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,703
Did anything fun happen today?

70
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,001
Mimi ate your lettuce.

71
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,670
MIMI THE LETTUCE THIEF

72
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,216
I was going to scold her for eating yours
but decided to share.

73
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,176
After all, we're family.

74
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,554
I miss Mimi.

75
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,308
Is she the only one you miss?

76
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,563
I miss you all the time.

77
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,319
Jun, are you unwell?

78
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,905
You always scolded me
for saying such thoughts out loud.

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,202
I was worried you wouldn't hear me.

80
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,209
Sunwoo Jun, you've changed quite a bit.

81
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,381
I've been under a lot of stress,

82
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,302
so I should get some good sleep.

83
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,220
You're not going to school?

84
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,598
I'll go tomorrow.

85
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,353
Okay. There are times
when you just have to skip school.

86
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,106
Can you sing for me

87
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,692
until I fall asleep?

88
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,445
Sing? Okay.

89
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,954
When did you fall for me?

90
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:16,793
What did you like about me?

91
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,712
I can tell

92
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:26,302
By your smile that you like me

93
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,474
When did I fall for you?

94
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,338
Jun.

95
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,050
Did you not do well on your exam?

96
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:09,929
No.

97
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,099
Is it too tough for you?

98
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,728
Yes.

99
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:35,079
If you endure the tough times,
you will reap the fruits of your labor.

100
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,762
MIJU APARTMENT

101
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,063
Jun.

102
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,442
Did you call
because you missed me already?

103
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,654
After talking on the phone last night,
you appeared in my dreams too.

104
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,908
And now, you're giving me a wake-up call?

105
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,328
Ra-ra, it's me. Cha Eun-seok.

106
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,289
-Hello.
-I had some good news to share,

107
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,917
so I didn't even check the time.

108
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,752
Mr. Kim

109
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,128
has woken up.

110
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,088
Really?

111
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,052
Thank you, Dr. Cha.

112
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,223
You don't need to thank me.
I wasn't the doctor in charge.

113
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:39,310
I did nothing. I can only say
that this was a miracle from God.

114
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,689
Mr. Kim.

115
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,234
Mr. Kim.

116
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,277
Mr. Kim.

117
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,781
Thank you. Thank you so much.

118
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,283
I knew you'd eventually wake up,

119
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,328
but I'm so thankful that you really did.

120
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:01,082
Goodness, you're so happy to see me again.

121
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,878
I am truly grateful as well.

122
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,423
I have to see my patients now,

123
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,133
-so I should get going.
-Okay.

124
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,553
Ra-ra, stop by my office before you leave.

125
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,012
-Okay.
-All right, then.

126
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,727
Mr. Kim.

127
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,148
Thank you for sending me the piano.

128
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,735
I only found out now that it was you.

129
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:35,157
You see, I enjoy repaying
people's kindness twofold.

130
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,001
Use this from now on, not the cassette.

131
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,210
Thank you.

132
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,134
"Dodosolsollalasol"?

133
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,762
I just borrowed Jun's name to do so.

134
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,473
Dodosolsollalasol.

135
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,644
You really know how to hold your tongue.

136
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,815
You knew he was Mr. Twinkle,
so how could you not give me any hints?

137
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,610
I'm a very loyal man.

138
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,280
I always keep my promises
to those I trust.

139
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,744
Maybe that's why you're the only one
Jun left a letter.

140
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,080
Did he go somewhere?

141
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,001
Yes. He's studying abroad.

142
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,794
Studying abroad?

143
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,384
To be honest, I wanted to read it
because I was so curious.

144
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,595
But Jun forbade me to, so I didn't.

145
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,725
Could you read it right now
and tell me what it's about?

146
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,436
Of course not.

147
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,647
I'm going to read it after you leave.

148
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,357
I'm so jealous.

149
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,157
-Ra-ra, how are you?
-Me?

150
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,497
Other than missing Jun terribly,
I'm doing fine.

151
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,707
-Why?
-I was checking on you.

152
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,126
-What?
-Someone asked me to.

153
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,632
Jun told me to take good care of you.

154
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,551
He's unbelievable.

155
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,388
I can take care of myself.

156
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,972
He's really thoughtful, right?

157
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,309
You have no idea.
He acts like a kid quite often.

158
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,479
Whenever we're on the phone,
he asks me what I did today,

159
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,523
to sing, to not hang up…

160
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,608
He asks for so many things.

161
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,779
Ra-ra, are you bragging
about being in a relationship?

162
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,780
What?

163
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,829
You are doing well, indeed.

164
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,792
I should show him your medical record
and tell him not to worry.

165
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,974
What is this tasty smell?

166
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,478
Ra-ra, are you doing something
in the kitchen?

167
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,897
-Yes.
-What could she be doing?

168
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,442
Goodness.

169
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,153
Did you visit Mr. Kim?

170
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,489
Yes. We saw Dr. Cha and Mr. Kim's son too.

171
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,574
Goodness.

172
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,784
Mom, wash your hands first.

173
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,828
Fine, you brat.

174
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,831
You're so naggy. Who do you take after?

175
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,001
Who do you think? It's you, of course.

176
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,003
What? I ought to…

177
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,754
-Come here!
-My gimbap!

178
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,132
-Run!
-You little…

179
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,844
Goodness, look at this heart.

180
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,514
It feels like yesterday
when you kept opening the door

181
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,393
to my salon because you didn't know
how to make gimbap.

182
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,479
When did you become so good?

183
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:55,816
Come on. I made some for Jun
last year as well.

184
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,984
What? When?

185
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,778
When did you make this for him
without my permission?

186
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,197
That's a secret.

187
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,408
I miss Jun even more now.

188
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,370
Right, Jun asked Dr. Cha

189
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,165
to take good care of me before he left.

190
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,292
-Goodness.
-Jeez.

191
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,002
You're so annoying.

192
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,171
Stop bragging about your boyfriend now.

193
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:20,466
Why? You have a boyfriend who treats you
better than Jun treats me.

194
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,346
What? What boyfriend?

195
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,767
What are you talking about?

196
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,649
I mean, she really wants a boyfriend too.

197
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,691
Right.

198
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:46,408
Right. I want to propose to Jun.

199
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,244
What do you think he'll like?

200
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,412
Propose?

201
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:55,376
I've always received things from him.
I want to give him something nice.

202
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,048
When it comes to things like that,
my mom and I are the experts.

203
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,841
That's right.

204
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,511
Will he be flying in for the winter break?

205
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:09,557
Of course.
They're always talking on the phone.

206
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,395
Once break begins, he'll hurry over
since he misses her so much.

207
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,315
How about having a Christmas party?

208
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,570
We can also hold a LaLa Land Concert.

209
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,613
-A concert?
-Yes.

210
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,158
At the end of the concert,
you'll play a piece for him.

211
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,411
After that, you'll propose.

212
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:31,912
That sounds nice.

213
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,126
Ra-ra, you should…

214
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,587
You should play that piece!

215
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,965
Christmas? Hold on.

216
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,387
OCTOBER

217
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,014
NOVEMBER

218
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,182
DECEMBER

219
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,982
I think I can make it.

220
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,317
Really?

221
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,739
We're going to have a Christmas concert.
You and I need to play a piece as well.

222
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,116
-Me too?
-Yes.

223
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,662
I've arranged "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little
Star" so that we could play it together.

224
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,875
I'll send you the score and a video,
so practice beforehand.

225
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,795
Do you think I can do it?

226
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,505
It's not hard.

227
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,217
If it's too hard, I can teach you
through the phone. Okay?

228
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,388
Okay.

229
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,058
DECEMBER

230
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,417
Jun, we may not be practicing
side by side, but we're still together.

231
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,004
I miss you so much. I'll see you soon.

232
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,984
Can you play an opening piece
for the concert?

233
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,154
This is the song you'll play on Christmas.

234
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,073
Let's practice hard starting today.

235
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,284
Sure. I'm good at everything.

236
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,453
You're indeed a BSO.

237
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,122
-Okay.
-Shall we begin?

238
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,465
It's fall now.

239
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,265
Winter will be here soon, right?

240
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,559
I hope winter comes soon.

241
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:02,479
Then the CSAT would be over,
so we can officially date.

242
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,450
My dear dodosolsollalasol,

243
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,162
I'm waiting for the winter.

244
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,374
No. I'm waiting for you.

245
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:47,566
FINALE
DO DO SOL SOL LA LA SOL

246
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,994
CHRISTMAS CONCERT
DODOSOLSOLLALASOL

247
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:11,006
-That one. I made it.
-It's very pretty.

248
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,342
DODOSOLSOLLALASOL

249
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,305
Let's clink our glasses.

250
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,515
There.

251
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,392
-It sure feels like Christmas.
-This is so refreshing.

252
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,936
-It's really good.
-Eat up.

253
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,270
-This is shine--
-What?

254
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,648
-They're shine muscats.
-Shine muscats?

255
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,817
I thought they were just green grapes.

256
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,819
Tell me if you want anything.

257
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,737
It really feels like Christmas,
doesn't it?

258
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,909
It's snowing.

259
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,582
It's a white Christmas.

260
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,128
I heard it's pouring in Seoul.

261
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,927
It's snowing so beautifully.

262
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,428
-You're right.
-It's so pretty.

263
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,889
Thanks to Ra-ra,

264
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,809
I could attend concerts often
and enjoy this Christmas vibe.

265
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,061
My life has been updated.

266
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,564
Upgraded, not updated.

267
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,151
They're the same.
They both have the word "up" in them.

268
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,903
-Updated.
-Fine.

269
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,823
By the way, Jun is coming today, right?

270
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,160
Of course.
Ra-ra has been counting down the days.

271
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,037
They're even going to perform
a duet today.

272
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,665
Goodness!

273
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,544
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

274
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,131
Thank you for coming all the way here.

275
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,299
Don't mention it.

276
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,970
Jun's going to be here.
Of course, I should come.

277
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,598
You're right. You two are best friends.

278
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,100
But he's running late.

279
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:51,857
I was wondering,

280
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,943
are you sure they're just friends?

281
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,822
Why won't you believe me?

282
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,699
Ra-ra is extremely busy

283
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,410
doing long distance with the son
of Sunwoo Foundation.

284
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:07,206
She's head over heels in love
with that Jun guy.

285
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,457
-Seriously?
-Yes.

286
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,669
I heard they had broken up.
When did they get back together?

287
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,088
Kids these days must be like that, right?

288
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,673
I'm so relieved.

289
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,218
He's running late.

290
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,053
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

291
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,347
Ask him where he is right now.

292
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,515
Did he not text you?

293
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,317
Ra-ra, the plane's been delayed
due to heavy snow.

294
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,111
Everyone must be waiting.
What should I do?

295
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,823
I'll send you a video of me playing,
so turn this on while you play.

296
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,118
I'm sorry. I'll get there
as quickly as I can. I miss you.

297
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,788
The plane's been delayed,
so he'll be late.

298
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,834
-Call him first.
-Okay.

299
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,260
The phone of the number you have dialed
is turned off. Please leave a message…

300
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,427
He's not picking up.

301
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,017
Seung-gi, Jun sent me
a video of him playing.

302
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,228
Could you display it on the screen?

303
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,521
Of course.

304
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,732
Let's do that for now. Everyone's waiting.

305
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,317
Okay.

306
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:26,243
DODOSOLSOLLALASOL

307
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,246
Are you enjoying the party?

308
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,957
-Yes!
-Yes!

309
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,836
Thank you for waiting.
It's a beautiful, snowy night.

310
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,216
Now, we will begin Eunpo Christmas Concert

311
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,636
planned by LaLa Land.

312
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,685
Dr. Cha Eun-seok
will be playing a piece first.

313
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,023
How handsome.

314
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,276
"The Seasons No. 12" by Tchaikovsky.

315
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,736
Let's hear it.

316
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,407
He's a genius.

317
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,288
I lost such an amazing man.

318
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,583
I'm going to make him mine again.

319
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,543
At all costs.

320
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:08,178
It sounded like the snowflakes
were waltzing. It was beautiful.

321
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,181
You're amazing!

322
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,851
Calm down, now.

323
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,650
Next up is the pride of LaLa Land.
He's my precious student.

324
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,152
It's Shin Jae-min.

325
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,738
-It's Jae-min!
-What a precious boy!

326
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,700
He'll be playing "Flight of the Bumblebee"
by Rimsky-Korsakov.

327
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,765
I can't believe he can do that.

328
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,185
-He's extremely talented.
-Is that really Jae-min?

329
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,800
You're amazing, Jae-min!

330
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,804
This is the last performance.

331
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:37,434
Actually, Jun and I were going to perform
a duet.

332
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,979
But he's coming from far away
and hasn't arrived yet.

333
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,522
He said he's on his way here.

334
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,984
So we're going to give
a special performance

335
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,861
with the help of technology instead.

336
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,741
The piece we'll play
will sound very familiar to you all.

337
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,411
We have arranged Mozart's variation
on "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"

338
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,580
and have created "Little Star Fantasy."

339
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,625
I hope you enjoy it!

340
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,293
-Okay!
-Okay!

341
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,008
CHRISTMAS CONCERT
DODOSOLSOLLALASOL

342
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,649
Do you want to come here if you're lonely?

343
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,526
Where is this?

344
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,403
I'll go see you right now.

345
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,541
Thanks to you,
I've made some great friends

346
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,876
and am enjoying my life in this new place.

347
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,339
I'll see you soon,
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

348
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,429
I will continue to support you, forever.

349
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,558
Wish us luck
so that we'll get a good result.

350
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,853
I hope it goes well. Best of luck.

351
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,360
Mr. Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

352
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,864
I broke up with him today.

353
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,367
Will we meet again one day?

354
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,417
But I still like you.

355
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,712
I still want you.

356
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,927
JIN BEAUTY SALON
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

357
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,162
Amazing!

358
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,627
Father, why are you crying?

359
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:57,008
Mr. Kim. Were you that touched
by Ra-ra's performance?

360
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:01,054
Gosh, I thought
it was so cheerful and exciting.

361
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,350
I guess he's emotionally sensitive.

362
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:09,187
This will make Jun very happy.
To see how touched his true friend is.

363
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,522
You're right.

364
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,077
You rock!

365
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,128
WELCOME BACK, JUN

366
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,006
Mimi, Jun is really late.

367
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,428
We played the piano together today.

368
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,890
Ta-da!
I wanted to give this to him earlier.

369
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,977
Too bad. I'm sad.

370
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,526
Well, as long as he gets it. Right?

371
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,364
When will he be here?

372
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,867
That must be Jun!

373
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,517
Father, what's the matter?

374
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,940
Jun couldn't make it today.

375
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,235
He couldn't come back.

376
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,532
If you're reading this,
you must've regained your consciousness.

377
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,242
I'm so glad.

378
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,205
Take good care of your health
even after leaving the hospital.

379
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,540
I had to…

380
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,752
leave in a rush
without even saying goodbye to you

381
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,089
because I'm… Mr. Kim.

382
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,425
I'm ill.

383
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,552
I have blood cancer.

384
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,056
But it's acute,
so I need to receive treatment right away.

385
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:13,311
I wanted to tell you the truth
because I'd feel so bad otherwise.

386
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,815
I'll recover soon
and come back in no time.

387
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,317
So don't worry about me.

388
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,111
And please don't tell Ra-ra.

389
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,615
Jun.

390
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,425
I don't know where to start.

391
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,516
Thank you.

392
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,769
I had so many things

393
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,438
to ask you and tell you

394
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,400
if I ever got to see you again.

395
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,071
Yet here I am, thanking you first.

396
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,701
Jun told me

397
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,455
that he was incredibly happy

398
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,877
while staying here.

399
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:25,550
Thinking about how hurt and lonely

400
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:31,347
Jun must've been before he ended up here…

401
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,020
breaks my heart

402
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,230
and I can't even breathe.

403
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:46,779
I didn't even try to understand
my one and only son.

404
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,908
I regret wasting all that time like that.

405
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,706
Did something happen to Jun?

406
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,381
Jun…

407
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,885
can no longer come here.

408
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,179
Well…

409
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,934
I guess his studies are keeping him
very busy.

410
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,186
-I apologize if I distracted him--
-No.

411
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:22,815
Jun…

412
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,404
was very ill.

413
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,206
What do you mean?

414
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,669
What's wrong with Jun?

415
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,839
Where is he now?

416
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,259
He texted me just now.

417
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,260
Look.

418
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,223
I sent that text message.

419
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,069
No.

420
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,406
Jun even played the piano with me earlier.

421
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,158
He must've practiced so hard.
Without a single mistake--

422
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,035
That video

423
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,288
was recorded a month ago.

424
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,896
Do you mean…

425
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,274
Are you saying

426
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,362
Jun is dead?

427
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,457
No.

428
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,916
I don't believe you.

429
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,003
He didn't tell me anything. How could he…

430
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,424
Jun said

431
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:15,803
he didn't want you to see him ill.

432
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,932
I just don't like you anymore.

433
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,644
I had decided to go to the US to study.

434
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,688
Or I might

435
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,857
just settle down there.

436
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,402
That's why he lied to you.

437
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,030
What do you want to do here
before you leave?

438
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,533
Nothing special. Something we used to do.

439
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,452
Play the piano for me.

440
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,412
The song you'd play

441
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,581
whenever I came back from work.

442
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,875
I hope

443
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,878
you can understand

444
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,173
why he kept it from you.

445
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,344
Jun, are you listening?

446
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,303
Hello?

447
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,307
Is all the studying making him sleep more?

448
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,852
I had no idea.

449
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,860
He was always in pain because of
all the treatment he was getting,

450
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,825
but your existence alone
gave him so much strength.

451
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,746
Thank you very much.

452
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,008
And here.

453
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,431
He told me to make sure
I return it to you.

454
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,685
He said he took it
without even asking you.

455
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,316
It's a teacup set my parents used to use.

456
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,403
I want to use it
with my future husband, too.

457
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,281
Where did it go?

458
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,617
Mimi, have you seen my teacup?

459
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:23,139
And he left this letter for you.

460
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,269
TO RA-RA

461
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,907
Jun hoped the winter would come fast,

462
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,952
but he couldn't spend this winter with us.

463
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,671
We all wept in our own way

464
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,509
in mourning of his sudden death.

465
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,237
I'm scared.

466
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,325
If I'd known that would be the last time,

467
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,997
I would've been nicer to him.

468
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,054
I'll never forget this place.

469
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,225
It gave me too many gifts.

470
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,143
The people I met here…

471
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,020
and Ra-ra.

472
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,941
Please take care of her.

473
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,112
Why are you asking me to do that
out of the blue?

474
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,114
Because I won't be here for her.

475
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,751
You had to break my heart like this,
didn't you?

476
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,978
TO RA-RA

477
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,104
Ra-ra.

478
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,190
How would you feel
if I suddenly disappeared

479
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,609
someday?

480
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,616
I'd be sad.

481
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,287
Ra-ra.

482
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,665
I hope you're not crying
because I suddenly disappeared.

483
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,545
Think about it.
To a couple who's aging together,

484
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,172
a five-year gap is really nothing.

485
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,216
What? I have to live with you
until I get all wrinkly?

486
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,177
-Yes.
-No, thanks.

487
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,679
Thanks so much

488
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,599
for saying that
you didn't want to live with me

489
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,559
until you get all wrinkly.

490
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:19,273
Thanks to that,
I can feel a bit more at ease now.

491
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,278
I should've just said I'd live with him.

492
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,575
That day,

493
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,455
I should've just said
I would live with him.

494
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,628
Jun.

495
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,048
You should just cry when you're sad.

496
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,675
Cry all you want

497
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,345
and start over.

498
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:57,395
Ra-ra.
You should just cry when you're sad.

499
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,482
Cry all you want and start over.

500
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,528
Cry and let it all out. Then forget me.

501
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,738
I hope you can be happy.

502
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,989
No.

503
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,699
No!

504
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,160
I won't cry.

505
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,871
I will never cry.

506
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,085
Jun.

507
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,003
-Yes?
-What about the money?

508
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,381
What about the money
I've borrowed from you?

509
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,549
Right.

510
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,426
That.

511
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:34,098
Why don't you keep it for now?
I'll receive it all at once.

512
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,937
And you don't need to pay me back

513
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,064
the money I lent you.

514
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,650
You said you'd be back
to collect the money.

515
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,278
You have to come back.

516
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,114
I can't…

517
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,078
Come back and get your money.

518
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,042
Come back and get your money.

519
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,851
I'm sending you the stars.

520
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:24,648
I hope the stars shine down brightly
on your future.

521
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,528
From Dodosolsollalasol.

522
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,002
5 YEARS LATER

523
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,757
LALA PIANO LAND

524
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,393
GRAND AWARD

525
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,752
Ji-a, let's go.

526
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,591
Say bye to Auntie. Auntie!

527
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,430
Mimi, I'll see you later.

528
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,185
Oh, wait. Hold on a second.

529
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,479
Hey.

530
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,315
Ji-a, it's Daddy. Hi, Daddy!

531
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,528
I'm about to leave with Ji-a.
Are you done for the day?

532
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:56,574
Okay, hurry home. Ji-a misses Daddy.

533
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,952
Ji-a.

534
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,538
Let's go, sweetie!

535
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,040
Let's go see Daddy, okay?

536
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,878
Come on. Let's go!

537
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,729
Don't you make it obvious
to my mom that we fought.

538
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,272
Worry about yourself.

539
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,736
You guys are already here.

540
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,029
She's crying.

541
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,574
-Gosh.
-My gosh, sweetie.

542
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,242
Ji-a woke up.

543
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,702
-My gosh.
-Oh, dear.

544
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,496
-Gosh, Ji-a.
-Come with Daddy.

545
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,791
She kept running around with Mimi.
That must've tired her out.

546
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,002
What were you guys doing here?

547
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,296
Don't tell me

548
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,548
you guys fought again.

549
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,967
No, we didn't. We just…

550
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,510
We were just about to go in.

551
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,138
Ra-ra, thanks so much
for looking after Ji-a today.

552
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,183
Ms. Jin.

553
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,978
Ms. Jin, the blender is here!

554
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,480
Bring it over!

555
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,030
Hold on. Someone's missing.

556
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:22,326
Suk-gyeong, where is your forever admirer,
Director Chu?

557
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,495
Gosh, cut it out.

558
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,914
Goodness, can you accept
his heart already?

559
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,501
I feel so bad whenever I see
those round eyes fixated on you.

560
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,504
Mr. Lee from the real estate office

561
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:37,966
contacted Min-su for a job yesterday,
so he's away for that now.

562
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,052
-I see.
-Really?

563
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,639
Then what if Mr. Lee's wife
wants to join TWD?

564
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,224
Then…

565
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,101
We shall welcome her.

566
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,855
Ladies, I know a lot has happened,

567
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,692
but it's already been 15 years
since we started TWD.

568
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,235
-My gosh.
-I know.

569
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,946
-Oh, my.
-Thank you for only wishing for a divorce

570
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,198
without actually getting one.

571
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,867
-That's so true.
-I owe it all to you guys.

572
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:04,827
Thank you.

573
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,870
Congratulations on the 15th anniversary.

574
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,664
-My gosh!
-It's so pretty!

575
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,707
Thank you, Seung-gi.

576
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,127
Put some candles on it and light them.

577
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,545
-Oh, okay.
-All right.

578
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,464
I want to join too.

579
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,841
-What?
-What?

580
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,305
You told me not to show it.

581
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,600
Look, Ha-yeong.

582
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:32,020
Both your mom and I are
the members of TWD. Must you join?

583
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,605
I want to join too.

584
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,941
-What?
-What?

585
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,696
Welcome to TWD.

586
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,116
-We have two new members.
-Okay.

587
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,409
Enough, both of you.

588
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,537
So why did you have to get married
so young?

589
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,998
We gave you permission
to work together, not marry.

590
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,375
Why? Ji-a is so adorable, you know.

591
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,794
To tell you the truth, I really envy them.

592
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,588
Why would you envy them?

593
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,548
They've been fighting
since they were seven.

594
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:03,302
Did they get married
so they could fight 24-7? You brats!

595
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,347
My gosh, would you please
get your facts straight?

596
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,142
Seung-gi always lets her win
and bends over backward for her.

597
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,769
Right, I'm aware. But despite that,

598
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,398
he keeps chasing Ha-yeong
because he loves her!

599
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,652
They're meant to be. What's the problem?

600
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,489
Gosh, enough. It's a happy day,

601
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,657
so let's all be happy. Hey, Seung-gi.

602
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,284
-Okay.
-Do it together.

603
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,452
Sounds good.

604
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,453
All right.

605
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,997
Make a wish.

606
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,833
-Okay.
-Let's make a wish.

607
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,961
One, two, three.

608
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,092
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

609
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:49,806
Hold on. Ha-yeong and Seung-gi
have been friends since age seven, so…

610
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,226
-Eight…
-We've known each other for 18 years.

611
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,854
Yes, you guys have been friends
for 18 years.

612
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,190
And you ladies have been friends
for 15 years.

613
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,859
I really envy you
for having such good friends

614
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,861
who you can grow old with.

615
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:07,074
Ra-ra, it's already been six years
since you moved to Eunpo.

616
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,284
Right. Since you've known us
for six years,

617
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,328
you deserve to be our honorary member.

618
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,622
-That's right.
-Our honorary member!

619
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,749
Thank you all.

620
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:19,378
I had nothing, but you've trusted me
and always been there for me.

621
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:23,423
Ra-ra, you worked very hard
to run LaLa Land well

622
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,219
and became the most famous
piano teacher in Eunpo.

623
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,806
You achieved that on your own.

624
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,141
-That's right.
-Gosh, my sweetheart.

625
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,561
-Oh, have you heard from Jae-min?
-Yes! Tell us.

626
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,437
Yes, he arrived in Germany safely.

627
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,147
Ms. Gong called me.

628
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,857
-I see.
-That's great.

629
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,486
Ra-ra, you are the first teacher
who discovered Jae-min

630
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,863
and recognized his talent.

631
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,949
-You should be proud of that.
-Right.

632
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,744
Okay. I'm sure Jae-min will come back
as a world-famous pianist.

633
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,413
-Of course.
-No doubt.

634
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,290
Gosh, too bad.

635
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,876
It would've been nice to have them here
on this happy day.

636
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,673
I miss Mr. Kim and Jun even more today.

637
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,049
Me too.

638
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:12,139
Mom, why did you have to bring that up
on a day like today?

639
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:16,310
We should talk about
those who are no longer with us

640
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,687
and reminisce about them
on happy days like today,

641
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,773
instead of just trying to forget them.

642
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,569
Totally.

643
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,365
All right. On that note,

644
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,200
let's cheers!

645
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,577
-Okay!
-Sounds good!

646
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,787
-Here.
-All right.

647
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,956
Ra-ra, do you want to make a toast?

648
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,082
-Yes.
-Yes.

649
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,043
Then…

650
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,172
Here's to our happy days!

651
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,341
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

652
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,676
Come in.

653
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,808
How can I help you today?

654
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,226
Today,

655
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,772
I'm here because my heart is aching.

656
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,441
The clinic is closed now.

657
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,277
Come on.
Are you really going to be like this?

658
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,779
I've been making up

659
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:12,157
all sorts of excuses
to come and see you for five years.

660
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,575
So?

661
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,580
I'm turning 40 soon.

662
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,416
Are we just going to date
for the rest of our lives?

663
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,794
You said you were okay with just dating.

664
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,213
Right. Back then…

665
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,218
I didn't think it'd go on for this long.

666
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,019
-What's this?
-Your prescription.

667
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:46,650
Looking after plants will help you
cure your heartache, Ms. Oh Yeong-ju.

668
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,528
Plants? I love plants.

669
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,656
But why these?

670
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,910
Shouldn't these be in a salad bowl?
This is lettuce and…

671
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,704
What is this?

672
00:49:58,787 --> 00:49:59,996
Romaine lettuce?

673
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,623
Why are you giving me these?

674
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,500
You'll feel fresh and energized.

675
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,502
And you can eat them.
They're good for you.

676
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,422
-Let's grow them together.
-Okay.

677
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,049
What?

678
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:12,634
"Together"?

679
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,596
Did you just say "together"?

680
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,144
Are you proposing to me? You are, right?

681
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,020
My gosh, my face is turning all red.

682
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:29,401
Right, you're giving me potted lettuce
and romaine lettuce as a gift

683
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,486
so that we can make salad

684
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,073
and have breakfast together every morning.

685
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,409
Hey, my gosh.

686
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:42,080
Is that what it means? Sort of?

687
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,000
Well…

688
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,794
Is that your interpretation of it?

689
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,088
That's what it means, right?

690
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,302
Honey.

691
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,143
But you know,

692
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,937
I really like this place.

693
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,315
Ms. Oh Yeong-ju.

694
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,859
Will you live in Eunpo with me
if I ask you to?

695
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,320
Yes, I…

696
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,364
I'll be the most loving wife in Eunpo.

697
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,620
We've failed once, you know.

698
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,956
That's why I've been a bit cautious.

699
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,710
I'm sorry I made you wait.

700
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,671
I'm sorry too.

701
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:46,144
JIN BEAUTY SALON
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

702
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:50,482
LALA PIANO LAND

703
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:54,528
Hyeon-gi, practice it before next week.
And In-yeong, memorize the song.

704
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,489
-Okay. Bye, Ms. Gu.
-Okay. Bye, Ms. Gu.

705
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,824
Bye.

706
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,370
Are you done with the lessons?

707
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,666
Dr. Cha, you don't have a lesson
today, do you?

708
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,003
Really?

709
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:16,174
Yes, I made up my mind.

710
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,303
I thought I should tell you.

711
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,556
Congratulations, Dr. Cha.

712
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,266
I'm embarrassed.

713
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:29,771
To be honest, I was very hesitant
about dating my ex-wife

714
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:33,775
and deciding to marry her again.

715
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,030
Thank you, Ra-ra.

716
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:41,449
Why are you thanking me?

717
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,034
Thanks to you,

718
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,537
I was able to find my new self.

719
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:50,041
I don't know what I did,
but it feels somewhat rewarding.

720
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,669
And…

721
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:58,133
for some reason, I keep thinking
that I wouldn't have been able

722
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,927
to make this decision without Jun's help.

723
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,138
Jun?

724
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,392
Once, I asked him this question.

725
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:12,564
Where did you get the courage to barge
into someone else's wedding

726
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:13,899
and steal the bride?

727
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:18,278
That's not hard at all.
I just had to think of one thing.

728
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:20,989
Ra-ra.

729
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,784
I had a lot on my mind,

730
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,663
but thinking about that moment
helped me find the answer.

731
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,084
Jun said such a thing?

732
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:02,364
Jun, I lived another day to the fullest.

733
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,076
Aren't I so cool, pretty,

734
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,578
and lovely?

735
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,378
Jun, I still haven't been able
to cry as much as I want.

736
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:22,217
So once again, I'm playing the piano
to greet you while thinking of you.

737
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,190
Jun?

738
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,285
Jun.

739
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:35,999
Jun.

740
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,588
Why didn't you contact me at all?

741
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,967
I thought you were really dead.

742
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,386
I thought you were dead!

743
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:34,057
You're so mean! I can't believe this.

744
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,730
I wanted to wait
until I was fully recovered.

745
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,153
Gosh, do I still have to
wipe your tears for you?

746
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:55,954
Don't blow your nose though.

747
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,208
Hey.

748
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,671
You're not a ghost, right?

749
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,384
What can I do to make you believe
I'm right here and real?

750
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,929
You're not a ghost, right?

751
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,848
Jun, thank you

752
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,726
for coming back to me.

753
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,904
That summer when I was 19 years old
and felt lost,

754
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,950
you gave me comfort and rest.

755
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:21,873
And your music welcomed
me when I was weary.

756
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,252
Ra-ra,

757
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,005
whenever I was in pain or things
were difficult,

758
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,050
I thought about that summer.

759
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:37,597
And all the happy moments
we spent together

760
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,683
helped me live again.

761
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:49,317
My Ra-ra, who sparkles
even in the darkest of times,

762
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,280
I love you.

763
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:56,259
