EPISODE 8

2
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,973
-Were you surprised?
-Yes, very.

3
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,310
Then I should surprise you even more.

4
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,938
-Would you like to--
-No.

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,485
Well, but I haven't even finished
my sentence.

6
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,694
I'm sorry, Dr. Cha.

7
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,322
I know that you're a wonderful person,

8
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,325
and it's true that
I'm always grateful to you.

9
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,286
But if you're confessing
your feelings to me, I must say no.

10
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,378
Well, I've never been rejected
this quickly,

11
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,881
so I don't even know
what to say right now.

12
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,426
This is new to me.

13
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,304
I'm sorry if I offended you.

14
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,974
No, I should apologize.

15
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:45,438
Forget everything that happened today.
Let's go back to how we used to be.

16
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:49,567
Let's just meet up occasionally
and go for ice cream or whatever.

17
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,902
What do you say?

18
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,699
I'm okay, for real.
You don't need to worry about me.

19
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,788
That being said, let me ask you something.

20
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,335
Is there someone you like?

21
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,839
-Well…
-Ra-ra.

22
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,805
Did you enjoy the movie?

23
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,224
What? Yes, of course.

24
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,644
I'm sorry, but you should say bye
to Ra-ra here.

25
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,813
We have to go somewhere.

26
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,066
Sure. Good night, then.

27
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,996
What's going on? Why did you rush here?

28
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,498
I made some salad for you and…

29
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,378
I don't want it to get cold.

30
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,298
That's why I rushed here to pick you up.

31
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,884
But salads are usually eaten cold.

32
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,178
I guess you don't know.
The salad I make is warm.

33
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,848
Seriously, it's warm.

34
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,814
Why did you scoff?

35
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,609
Well, your reason makes no sense.

36
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,861
-I learned it from you.
-When did I do that?

37
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,905
You always give such weird reasons.

38
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,867
-But you're always right.
-Jeez.

39
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,703
Let's go eat some salad.

40
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,297
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

41
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,717
-Aren't you forgetting something?
-What?

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,594
When is my lesson?

43
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,763
Don't forget. I'm your first student.

44
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,015
Sorry, I'll teach you first
starting tomorrow.

45
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,686
I'll practice on my own and only get
one lesson. You can teach me then.

46
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,231
-Is that really okay?
-Yes.

47
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,733
Hold tight.

48
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,860
Okay!

49
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,824
Biking with you on this night.

50
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,454
I hoped this moment would last forever.

51
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,546
EPISODE 8
"PLEASURE OF LOVE"

52
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,679
What's up?

53
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,806
Want to thank me for last night?

54
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,141
-But you came empty-handed?
-Here you go.

55
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,271
Wow, you want to skate by
with just a bottle of water?

56
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,232
Fine. At least it's cold. I give you that.

57
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,069
I want your advice on something.

58
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,154
What? Advice?

59
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,658
Everyone looks down on me because
I get bad grades. You want my advice?

60
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,993
It's something simple.

61
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,953
Okay, what is it?

62
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,580
-You have a secret but also want
-Okay.

63
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,333
-to confess your feelings.
-A secret, feelings.

64
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,127
Will you tell her your secret first?

65
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,297
Or will you tell her how you feel
before telling her your secret?

66
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,968
Oh, my. This isn't simple at all.

67
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,554
Is it a big secret?

68
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,766
Will Ra-ra turn you down
if she hears about your secret?

69
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,351
Yes, probably.

70
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,731
Come on. Why hesitate?
Tell her how you feel first.

71
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,233
Wait until you know
she won't break up with you

72
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,861
to tell her the truth.
That's what I would do.

73
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,574
So what's the secret?

74
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,576
Tell me. I won't tell anyone.

75
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,288
I don't want to.

76
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:33,916
Jun!

77
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,837
What's his secret?
Is he an ex-con or something?

78
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,214
My gosh.

79
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,052
NEW BEYER

80
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,432
-Bye.
-Bye.

81
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,225
Mr. Kim!

82
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,436
I want to ask you something.

83
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,189
Why "The Maiden’s Prayer"?

84
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,068
Is there a reason you want
to play that specific piece?

85
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:06,824
Because it's part of my wife's last memory
before she died.

86
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,660
-Have a good day.
-You too.

87
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,875
JIN BEAUTY SALON
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

88
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,879
My gosh,
I guess you just had your piano lesson.

89
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,799
You look like a young girl with that bag.

90
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,592
-Does it look good on me?
-Very good.

91
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,305
It's time for you ladies
to gather at the salon.

92
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,517
-Have fun.
-Thank you. Have a good day.

93
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,188
Try wrapping it in this. It's delicious.

94
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,107
Oh, please. You think that's lettuce?

95
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,566
-What?
-It doesn't look good.

96
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,859
-Just try it.
-Ladies!

97
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,070
What took you so long?

98
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,864
-Hi!
-Because I wanted to bring this.

99
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,950
-What is it?
-It's good for you.

100
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,828
My husband hid them
to have them to himself.

101
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,664
I got so angry when I saw them,
so I brought a ton.

102
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,957
A newly launched health drink?

103
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,710
What is this? Are they numbered?

104
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,255
-What?
-Oh, you're right. Mine says ten.

105
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,256
Mine's six.

106
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,008
My goodness. I guess
your husband numbered them

107
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,136
because he knows you drink them in secret.

108
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:13,099
Then what if he comes after us?

109
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,768
I can't live with that petty jerk anymore!

110
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,395
Divorce him.

111
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,730
-Divorce him.
-Divorce him.

112
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,984
How old are you?
I can't believe you still fight over food.

113
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,068
My goodness.

114
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,363
Even if you're really going to divorce
him, do it after you drink this.

115
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,865
All right, let's all drink one.

116
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,118
My gosh! It's so good.

117
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,121
Your husband sure knows what's good.

118
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,874
Give me a break.
Gosh, it is pretty tasty indeed.

119
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,252
Oh, right. I saw Mr. Kim leaving just now.

120
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,588
How's he doing?
Has he gotten a lot better?

121
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,467
Well, it'll take a while for him
to master the song he wants to play--

122
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,594
Gosh, don't you worry.

123
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,930
He even mastered how to use
a cell phone, which is very hard.

124
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:57,518
That's right. I always see him
jotting things down on his phone.

125
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,020
Is he on social media?

126
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,357
Don't even get me started.
Jun went through hoops for that.

127
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,026
-Right.
-He did?

128
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:14,035
Now, I'm going to create a group chat for
you. A room where you can chat together.

129
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,871
You can write stuff there
like I showed you earlier.

130
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,456
-Write what?
-Pardon?

131
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,124
What do we write?

132
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,461
All right. I'll show you again.

133
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,296
My father-in-law and Mr. Kim

134
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,048
drink together often, you know.

135
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,176
-You can write stuff like this.
-Slow down.

136
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,763
Jun gathered
all the seniors in the neighborhood

137
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,473
-and taught them
-Did you do this?

138
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,309
-how to use a cell phone.
-You can put these together.

139
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,228
I have huge respect for him.

140
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,940
I tried to teach my mother-in-law
how to do online banking a few years ago

141
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,483
and fought with her.

142
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,777
-I almost divorced her.
-I see.

143
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,196
-Get a divorce.
-Get a divorce.

144
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,990
How can she divorce her mother-in-law?
You're so funny.

145
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,075
What's funny?

146
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,953
All kinds of crazy things can happen
when you're married.

147
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:57,870
My gosh!

148
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,706
Suk-gyeong knows the most
when she's never been married.

149
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,584
-Exactly.
-Try running a hair salon for 12 years.

150
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,254
No one knows more about that world
than I do.

151
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,339
Hold on. I have a question.

152
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,927
What was Mr. Kim's wife like?

153
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,681
Up until last year, he was called

154
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,849
"Sister."

155
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,935
Sister.

156
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,979
Sister.

157
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,314
What?

158
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,024
I'm hungry.

159
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,444
We're almost home.
Let's hurry home so we can eat this.

160
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,655
Okay.

161
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,126
-Is it good?
-Yes.

162
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,798
Why aren't you eating?

163
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,183
I hope you're not upset.

164
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,564
The rice has gotten cold, right?
I'll go cook some more.

165
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,150
No, it's okay. I'm full.

166
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,735
Don't worry. Just eat.

167
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:18,367
Sister, I really didn't touch your piano.

168
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,371
I just wiped it with a cleaning cloth.
That's all.

169
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,540
I really

170
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,127
didn't touch it.

171
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,047
Yes, I know.

172
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,844
She had dementia.

173
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,096
But he took such great care of her.

174
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,892
My father-in-law told me
that the two of them went through a lot

175
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,770
after moving to this neighborhood
when they were young.

176
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,021
Oh, boy.

177
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,857
She was such a wonderful person.

178
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,610
Whenever she had leftover flowers,
she'd put them out

179
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,028
-for people to take.
-Yes.

180
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,821
-That's right.
-Oh, that plant!

181
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,574
She gave it to me as a gift
the day I opened this salon.

182
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,201
-I see.
-Hasn't it grown so much?

183
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,161
-My gosh.
-It's grown a lot indeed.

184
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,247
By the way,
what's the song he wants to play?

185
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,083
-"The Maiden’s Prayer."
-My gosh.

186
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,921
He looked like a maiden earlier,
walking like this.

187
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,716
-Like a nice lady.
-Yes, he looked adorable.

188
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,560
PIANO MASTERPIECES

189
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,609
"MINUTE WALTZ"

190
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,568
"TURKISH MARCH"

191
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,576
Use this from now on, not the cassette.

192
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,245
It sounds much better.

193
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,206
I should've gotten you this sooner. Sorry.

194
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,543
You say sorry too often. Thank you.

195
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,253
I'm off.

196
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,547
Why don't you go
after listening to this with me?

197
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,007
I want to listen to this.

198
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,310
JIN BEAUTY SALON
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

199
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,472
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JUN?

200
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,812
I wonder if Jun's well.
I didn't hear from him all day.

201
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,079
RA-RA

202
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,255
-Hello?
-Jun!

203
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,840
Will you get mad at me
if I ask you for a favor now?

204
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,634
Of course.

205
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,970
Why? What do you need?

206
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,559
I've just found out I've run
out of my face cream.

207
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,270
I left the one you bought for me
on the table there.

208
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,438
-Can you bring it over?
-No, I can't.

209
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,274
Oh, really?

210
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,068
It is getting really late, isn't it?

211
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,739
Jun, but I'm sure
you're still happy to hear my voice.

212
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,782
No.

213
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,493
Gosh, you.

214
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,621
Good night, Jun!

215
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,874
-No.
-What?

216
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,220
You came so quickly. Did you run here?

217
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,601
Thanks. I shouldn't have bothered you.

218
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,729
I didn't come here to give you this.
I'm here to see you.

219
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,649
Because I missed you.

220
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,120
Good night.

221
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,497
Night.

222
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,963
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

223
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,715
Well…

224
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,052
The thing is…

225
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,899
Did you find out who left
the skincare set at your door?

226
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,401
Well, no.

227
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,363
-No other strange gifts?
-No.

228
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,408
I think we received a flower basket.

229
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:52,910
Flowers?

230
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,829
But it may have been for someone else.

231
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,542
JIN BEAUTY SALON

232
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,422
Today, it's Beethoven?

233
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,634
I'm actually a Mozart expert, though.

234
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,470
I can also play Beethoven.

235
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,389
Okay, I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

236
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,725
I have something to tell you.

237
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,771
My new student needs to start
preparing for a piano competition.

238
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,022
Okay, what about it?

239
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,900
I'll only be able to teach you
for an hour at a time.

240
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,947
Here. You paid for two-hour lessons,
so I'm returning the difference to you.

241
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,704
If Jae-min wins the competition,

242
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,999
I'll get more students,
and the academy will do very well.

243
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,503
But I don't want this place to get busy.

244
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,801
I mean, I don't want you to get too busy.

245
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,928
Because you'll have less time for me.

246
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,306
Here.

247
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,536
I'm sorry.

248
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,372
Are you Jae-min?

249
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,832
Yes.

250
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,171
-Have fun.
-Thank you.

251
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,652
Left hand, right hand. Stay on the beat.

252
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,029
That's it.

253
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,827
Oh, no. It's getting faster again.
Keep the tempo consistent.

254
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,289
Relax your wrists and shoulders.

255
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,807
Now, the staccato notes.

256
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,679
Now, the dotted notes. Your hand--

257
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,721
Your AC is here!

258
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,059
Jae-min, are you practicing hard?

259
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,395
-Mr. Kim!
-Hello.

260
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,855
You can put it over there.

261
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,065
This is such a huge gift.

262
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,942
Thank you so much.

263
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,571
Jun gave me a gift,
so I wanted to give him something as well.

264
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,032
-Gift?
-The round thing that plays music.

265
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,951
"The round thing that plays music"?

266
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,161
A CD.

267
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,621
I see.

268
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,334
Isn't this too big of a gift
if you wanted to thank him for a CD?

269
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,171
It's been a hot summer.
I want to make sure you're okay.

270
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,216
Jae-min, practice hard.
I'm rooting for you.

271
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,509
Thank you!

272
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,304
Mr. Kim! I'll make sure
Jae-min wins the competition.

273
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,346
All right.

274
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,182
Thank you.

275
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,588
-Mister!
-Hey, I told you to wait!

276
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,757
-Water…
-Dr. Cha!

277
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,258
Water!

278
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,390
-Slap me.
-What?

279
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,226
Slap me on the back.

280
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,230
Dr. Cha, are you okay?

281
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,444
What?

282
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,223
What were those pills?

283
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,392
-Vitamins.
-Give me some.

284
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,353
Next time.
I only brought enough for myself.

285
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,189
Gosh, you're greedy.
They're just vitamins.

286
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,026
Anyway, what brings you here?

287
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,945
Mister.

288
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,991
Are you really going to give up
on Ra-ra like this? Do something.

289
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,159
Take her out for a meal
or make a move on her.

290
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,744
All you do is take vitamins

291
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,789
and play the stupid piano. What's the use?

292
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,250
-She rejected me.
-What?

293
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,422
It was my first time getting rejected
like that, so I'm still pretty shocked.

294
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,257
But I'm actually relieved.

295
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,720
Gosh, you're seriously so annoying.

296
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,555
Ha-yeong.

297
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,267
This line is from one of the movies
I watched a long time ago.

298
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,741
What the hell?

299
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,201
Are you bragging
that you speak English well?

300
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,997
This is why
I can't talk to old farts like you.

301
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,920
I'm already that old?

302
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,176
If you have any tears left

303
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,512
Just let them all out

304
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,724
Under this beautiful sky

305
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:35,437
Just the two of us

306
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,692
Hey! This is a tiny booth.
What the heck are you doing?

307
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,530
-What? Sorry.
-It's too tight in here. Get out.

308
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,783
I said, get out.

309
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,951
Okay.

310
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,167
Can we love?

311
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,628
I took one step closer to you

312
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:03,965
So it's now your turn to come to me

313
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,635
Even if you say you can lean on me

314
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:12,015
But it's not love

315
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,185
It's okay because I can still see you

316
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,853
Why do you only look at Jun?

317
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,357
-I'm only looking at you.
-It's okay

318
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:25,737
Because I will still love you

319
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,451
Do you feel better now?

320
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,705
What do you think of the song?
Isn't it so great?

321
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,916
Shut up.

322
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,755
So? What will you do about Jun?

323
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,757
Will you keep liking him?

324
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,176
I don't know. I'm thinking.

325
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,849
Hey, how about I do a little test
to help you figure out how you feel?

326
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,102
About what?

327
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,316
Try to picture this.
It's raining hard right now.

328
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,486
And you have one umbrella.

329
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,158
Will you give it to Jun

330
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,076
or me?

331
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,414
Are you kidding me? Jun, of course.

332
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,874
Have you lost your mind?

333
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,795
Still a long way to go.

334
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,631
Sure, I'll just get soaked in the rain.

335
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,134
I'll catch a cold, but that's fine.

336
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,428
Ha-yeong, wait up.

337
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,058
That's it.
Jae-min, pay attention to this part.

338
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,102
Stay on the beat.

339
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,646
Faster. A little faster. Yes!

340
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:46,568
From here, don't go faster.
I've marked this part for you.

341
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,986
Remember this part.

342
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,864
This is where it gets slow again.
Go slower.

343
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,365
Good. Stay on the beat.

344
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,076
Jae-min, this is called the trill.

345
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,371
It's a rapid alteration

346
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,790
between do and re within one beat.

347
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,125
-Okay?
-I see.

348
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,218
MORDENT

349
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,221
What is this? Who drew this here?

350
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,722
It was probably Jun.

351
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,059
What's his deal, really?

352
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,355
Where did I see this? In my science class?
Or was it my math class?

353
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,316
Hey, don't you know Ohm's Law?

354
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,904
V equals IR.
We learned it in middle school.

355
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,740
Voltage equals Current times Resistance.

356
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,117
I still got it.

357
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,162
Has he been studying behind my back?

358
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,165
Hey! You can't study alone.
That's cheating.

359
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,382
Whatever.

360
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,635
PRACTICE CHART

361
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:09,859
Did it sound okay?

362
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,697
That face… What's with that face?

363
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,455
THIS WILL PERK YOU UP!

364
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,332
BITTER
FIZZY DRINK

365
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,960
FOR JAE-MIN
THIS WILL PERK YOU UP!

366
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,086
THIS WILL PERK YOU UP!

367
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,223
Jae-min, want something to drink?

368
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,476
Cheers!

369
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,353
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

370
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:14,049
Jae-min, try to make it
sound more fun and exciting.

371
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:18,511
Think of your fun memories
and play with those feelings.

372
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,390
I can't think of anything.

373
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,727
Nothing comes to mind.

374
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,814
Is that so?

375
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,276
Then…

376
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,789
-Hey, what now?
-Did you get my message?

377
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,751
RA-RA: FLOUR FOR COOKIES, BUTTER,
EGGS, CHOCOLATE CHIPS, SUGAR

378
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,088
Buy those and come to Ms. Jin's place.

379
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,964
I don't want to. And I'm busy.

380
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,468
Okay, fine. Have a good day at work.

381
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,063
-What took you so long?
-My gosh!

382
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,899
-You said you were busy.
-Come on, quick.

383
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,694
Jun, I think you need
to learn Korean again.

384
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,279
No. Let's go, Jae-min.

385
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,866
Hey, does "no" means "yes" to you?

386
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,624
This is flour. We need a lot of it.

387
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,292
There.

388
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,422
Jae-min, here.

389
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,343
Jae-min, shall we get started?

390
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:41,928
Okay.

391
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,027
Harder.

392
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,374
There!

393
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,970
Good. And the star too.

394
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,557
The heart too.

395
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,081
We did it!

396
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,294
It smells so delicious.

397
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,844
Oh, no. That looks really scary.

398
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,435
-I'll take care of it.
-No, then I'll feel too bad.

399
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,771
It's okay. Just eat the cookies
with Jae-min.

400
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,607
Thank you.

401
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,569
Jae-min, let's eat. Come on! Let's go.

402
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:27,909
Is it good?

403
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,996
-Was that fun?
-Yes, it was so much fun.

404
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,458
I used to have a lot of fun
baking cookies with my dad.

405
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,001
Eat up.

406
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,045
Have some milk too.

407
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,050
Are you almost done?
You should have some too.

408
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,552
I don't like sweets.

409
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,470
You're so fussy.

410
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,138
Anything else you want to do?

411
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,267
I want to jump rope.

412
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,480
-Open the oven when you get home.
-Why?

413
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,316
You'll find something inside.
Don't share it with anyone.

414
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,868
Go higher.

415
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,495
Look, I'll show you.

416
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,549
RA-RA

417
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,727
RA-RA

418
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,145
My gosh.

419
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,148
He did such a good job.

420
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:47,155
RA-RA

421
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,784
Jun, your heart is burnt.

422
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,292
I guess it was too hot.

423
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,296
Yes, I guess the temperature
was set too high.

424
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,676
It's because
my heart is burning with passion.

425
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,179
My gosh!

426
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,645
What's gotten into him?

427
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,074
My goodness. Is this for real?

428
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,034
I must be losing my mind.

429
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:34,953
Gosh, you're crazy.

430
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,413
It's so cringey.

431
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,387
Are you not feeling well, Jun?

432
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,973
Go to bed. Looks like you need some rest.

433
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:57,976
Jeez.

434
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:01,604
Good night.

435
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,653
SUNWOO JUN

436
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:46,983
What is this?

437
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,652
What the heck is this?

438
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,739
All my shirts are old and worn out.

439
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,075
Oh, no. I'll… My goodness.

440
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,370
I'll go buy a new one for you today.

441
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,707
You're too busy being out and about
to even take care of this?

442
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,500
And your phone's always busy.

443
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,171
What's going on? Are you having an affair?

444
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,008
Gosh, please.

445
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,053
How could you say that?

446
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,930
I'll go buy you a new shirt today.

447
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,058
Goodness.

448
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,882
Have you seen this guy?

449
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:57,136
Around mid-May, he brought an old man here
who was having heart problems.

450
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,971
Well…

451
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,641
I'm not too sure.

452
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,601
Oh, he was here

453
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,062
with a girl a little while ago.

454
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,396
A girl?

455
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,190
Who was she?

456
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,983
She had a unique name.

457
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,777
Was it Ra-ra?

458
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,487
Dr. Kim from Orthopedics said

459
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,614
a funny pianist had been admitted.
Remember?

460
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,200
Hey, aren't you busy?

461
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,956
We can't disclose any information
about our patients.

462
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,624
I'm sorry.

463
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,379
A girl.

464
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,132
A pianist.

465
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,301
Her name was Ra-ra.

466
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,761
Ra…

467
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,013
Ra-ra?

468
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,532
Are you interested in learning piano?

469
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,579
LALA PIANO LAND

470
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,831
Her academy was called LaLa Land.

471
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:10,168
Even a man in his 80s
is learning piano from me.

472
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,463
MAN-BOK

473
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,216
That geezer must be her student.

474
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,969
-He's not here.
-He was here with a girl.

475
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:32,481
LALA PIANO LAND

476
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,360
Is she out with Jae-min again?

477
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,739
LALA PIANO LAND

478
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,574
Should I get a haircut instead?

479
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,376
Oh, my.

480
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,504
-Gosh. Hello.
-Hello.

481
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,757
-It's time for a new haircut.
-Yes. Goodness.

482
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,092
-Goodness. Sit here.
-Okay.

483
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,719
All right.

484
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,640
-Would you like some tea?
-I'm fine.

485
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,682
One minute.

486
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,483
Dr. Cha is at Jin Beauty Salon.

487
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,027
Come here, TWD.

488
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,947
May I have a peach?

489
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,323
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

490
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,407
Goodbye.

491
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,326
What is this?

492
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,373
Dr. Cha?

493
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,183
I'd like one of each.

494
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,146
All of these.

495
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,439
Ma'am.

496
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,109
Have you been well?

497
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,737
This is the first time seeing you
ever since the wedding.

498
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,533
There's a long story

499
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,202
about what happened that day.

500
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,162
I heard.

501
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,542
I've been hooking Jeong-nam up
with other women.

502
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,128
I'll let you know if I have any good news.

503
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,421
Again?

504
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,756
I see.

505
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,676
All right, then.

506
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:28,514
Ma'am, did Jun find a new teacher?

507
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,559
You know, Jeong-nam used to be a student

508
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,271
in Kim So-yeong's Ace Class
of Daechi-dong when he was in high school.

509
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,189
I recently met with Ms. Kim,

510
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,734
and she said Jun had quit
earlier this year.

511
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,739
Who's his new teacher?
Have you found a better one?

512
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,409
I won't comment on that.

513
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,453
Goodbye, then.

514
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,495
Gosh.

515
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,207
Come on.

516
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,878
They completely redecorated this place.

517
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:04,717
By the way, does Jun not go to the academy
on weekends anymore?

518
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,595
Ms. Kim was curious
because she hadn't seen him in a while.

519
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,638
Stop it already!

520
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,515
Quit asking questions.

521
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:18,064
Gosh. Why does everyone like to pry
into other people's lives?

522
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,940
I can never understand.

523
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:25,446
Even though I saw your ex-daughter-in-law
living so poorly in Eunpo,

524
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,948
I turned a blind eye.

525
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,785
But if you pester me like this,
I won't sit still.

526
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,787
She's living poorly in Eunpo?

527
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,955
How do you know that corn dog girl?

528
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,249
We argued a bit
while she was posting flyers.

529
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,418
I believe she's running a piano academy.

530
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,838
What was it again? LalLa Land?

531
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,173
LuLu Land?

532
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,175
LaLa Land?

533
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,844
LaLa Land in Eunpo?

534
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:49,762
LALA PIANO LAND

535
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,347
"LaLa Land"?

536
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,058
Ra-ra opened her own academy?

537
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,648
They say people do whatever it takes
to survive.

538
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,025
I guess she's playing the piano again.

539
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,861
Ma'am, your driver has arrived downstairs.

540
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,571
Thank you.

541
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,868
Then have a nice day, ma'am.

542
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,413
Ms. Im.

543
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:19,708
I'd appreciate it if you could
stop being curious about my son.

544
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,462
Of course.

545
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,298
She's so troublesome.

546
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,847
Hello.

547
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,558
I know we're strangers,

548
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,309
but may I ask you one thing?

549
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,565
Is that ex-daughter-in-law of yours
who has her own piano academy

550
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,650
in Eunpo

551
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,110
a divorcée?

552
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,820
Don't be ridiculous.

553
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,322
My son broke off his wedding.

554
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,992
It wasn't a divorce. It was called off.

555
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,453
"Those Wishing for a Divorce"?

556
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:59,874
Yes, we're just wishing for one together.

557
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,170
None of us could actually get one.

558
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,338
I heard your wish came true.

559
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,840
We were so jealous,

560
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:12,219
so we asked if she could allow us
to meet with you.

561
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,597
Just so you know, I've never been married.

562
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,931
I see.

563
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,476
Right, right. He must be shy right now.

564
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,312
Ask away first, then let's move
to LaLa Land.

565
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,064
Dr. Cha is excellent at playing the piano.

566
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,900
You're going to be shocked.

567
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,152
-That's wonderful!
-I'd love to hear that!

568
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,237
Is playing the piano necessary?

569
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,573
I'm sure that'll be better for you.

570
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:36,327
If not, you'll have to host
a never-ending talk show.

571
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,370
Okay, I'll play the piano, then.

572
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,748
Yes?

573
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,626
What was your reason for divorce?

574
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,174
One day,

575
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:54,386
I suddenly thought about
what I had wanted in life.

576
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,432
That's when I had the desire to cut ties
with everyone around me.

577
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,894
Cut ties…

578
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,146
-Me.
-Yes?

579
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,691
What about a difference in personality,

580
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,318
a cheating spouse,

581
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,695
or conflicts with your in-laws?

582
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,782
Were there any simple reasons?

583
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,326
It was an internal issue for me.

584
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,161
Internal? I see.

585
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,829
-Me.
-Yes?

586
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,790
How did you split your wealth?

587
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,166
I left everything behind.

588
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,626
What? Why?

589
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,795
But why?

590
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,257
-I didn't care much about them.
-He must've gone crazy.

591
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,676
-You shouldn't say that.
-Right.

592
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,427
-Never mind.
-She didn't mean it.

593
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,138
Shall we hop over to LaLa Land?

594
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,974
-Sure.
-Sure.

595
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,267
-Okay.
-Okay.

596
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,568
-What's his problem?
-I'm so flabbergasted.

597
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,946
He looks totally fine on the outside,
but he lacks so much deep down.

598
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,407
I heard he even had
a large practice in Seoul.

599
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,326
Exactly. What does he live for?

600
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,370
He must be going through a rainy period.

601
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,581
-Stormy!
-Period!

602
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,957
That's right.

603
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,459
Mine was also about the weather.
That's good enough.

604
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,961
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

605
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,462
But

606
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,257
I can totally relate to him.

607
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,136
Right. Don't ever think
about getting a divorce.

608
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,555
You should always relate to
and understand men.

609
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,682
Do that forever. Understand.

610
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,643
-Understand.
-Understand.

611
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,853
Eat this.

612
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,565
-Oh, my.
-He's playing.

613
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,233
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

614
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,861
JIN BEAUTY SALON
LALA PIANO LAND

615
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,490
I'm sure I heard something.

616
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,245
But why isn't anyone coming out?

617
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,332
Should I just barge in?

618
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,375
Damn it.

619
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,544
Gosh.

620
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,465
Gosh.

621
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,010
Gosh, you were like Mozart.

622
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,386
Thank you.

623
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,013
How long have you played

624
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,681
-the piano?
-Who are those ladies?

625
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,807
I'm curious too.

626
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,142
You were incredible.

627
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,852
Is one of them the piano teacher?

628
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,896
-That's easy.
-I'll learn if you teach me.

629
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,190
That woman said that she was prettier.

630
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,525
-I'll want to hear it again.
-You were so good.

631
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,235
-I know.
-Right? Teach me, please.

632
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,321
Damn it. Who is it?

633
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,741
-Wow, we got lucky!
-Let's hop in.

634
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,534
-Bye.
-Bye.

635
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,371
-See you.
-I'll be there soon. See you.

636
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,497
Gosh.

637
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:31,001
My goodness.
Has Eun-seok really gone insane?

638
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,129
He came all the way here

639
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,839
to play the piano

640
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,676
and hang out with those old women?

641
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,596
Oh, my. Ma'am.

642
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,306
Gosh.

643
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,809
Hello.

644
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,185
My goodness!

645
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,979
You're here! It's so nice to see you.

646
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,690
When did you get here?

647
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,110
I've missed you. Goodness.

648
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,653
What do you want to get done?

649
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,656
Do you want me to cut it?

650
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,574
Here.

651
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,830
You're getting a blow-dry
this time too, right?

652
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:12,668
Let's see if you can make me 3cm taller
once again.

653
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,380
All right.

654
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,591
Here we go.

655
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,093
Wait.

656
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,808
That must be the teacher.

657
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,811
Do you want to get lessons?

658
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,521
Let me stop by.

659
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,022
Miss.

660
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,233
There's a shortcut.

661
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,070
This way.

662
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,330
What could this be?

663
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,125
It opened.

664
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,086
Ra-ra.

665
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,465
Ra-ra.

666
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,675
You have an important guest.

667
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,511
What? You.

668
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,306
I saw you out front last time, right?

669
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,976
Look at you. You're pretty good.

670
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,563
Can you tell, just by hearing that?

671
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,026
A close friend of mine plays the piano.

672
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,652
And I'm her sponsor.

673
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:25,908
I see. Well, it's just that I'm pretty
ignorant when it comes to music.

674
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,160
By the way, where's your teacher?

675
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,496
She had to go somewhere,

676
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,456
so she told me to practice by myself.

677
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,458
Where in the world did she go?

678
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,460
She's always disappearing

679
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,420
and going somewhere.

680
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,388
Is she the teacher?

681
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,681
Yes, she is.

682
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,309
You said you were prettier.

683
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:55,062
Well… Aren't I?

684
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,231
That's what I think.

685
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,859
Wait, she looks familiar.

686
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,240
I'm pretty sure I've seen her somewhere.

687
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,493
Where was it? Where?

688
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,252
Lesson fees,

689
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,504
competition entry fees, outfit fees…

690
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,631
You don't have to worry about any of that.

691
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,552
That's absurd.

692
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:30,138
Don't give him false hopes.
Just leave him alone!

693
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,058
Just let us live as we have all along!

694
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,143
Damn it.

695
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,065
Sir.

696
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,527
It's not false hope. It's happiness.

697
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,448
Jae-min's face glows
whenever he's playing the piano.

698
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,742
You'll notice at once
if you see him playing.

699
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,913
Right. Here.

700
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,040
Look.

701
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,302
See?

702
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,850
Stop.

703
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:15,892
Stop it.

704
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,524
Who are you?

705
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,486
I'm…

706
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,572
Well…

707
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,326
I'm her husband.

708
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,041
We're running an academy together.

709
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,051
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

710
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,643
Are you crazy? You're not my husband.

711
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:01,855
In any case, what matters is that
he gave us his permission.

712
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,984
And it's finally time.

713
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,779
-For what?
-For my lesson.

714
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,990
So you're finally ready for the lesson?

715
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,077
I'll be showing you no mercy,
so brace yourself.

716
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,161
I'm already so tense.

717
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,331
-Sunwoo Jun.
-Yes?

718
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,416
That wasn't a joke.

719
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,671
I tend to be very scary when I teach.

720
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:29,466
Ha-yeong, come on out. Let's eat.

721
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,301
Come on out.

722
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,763
Let's have some tasty food

723
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:35,847
What did you bring?

724
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,309
What? It's my favorite.

725
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,853
Aren't you happy I came home early?

726
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:42,813
Not really.

727
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,065
-You brat.
-Mom.

728
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,567
Is it really okay to close
the salon early today?

729
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,529
Remember that customer
who comes all the way from Seoul?

730
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,406
She gave me a big tip,

731
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,865
so I just called it a day.

732
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,827
I felt happy, and the breeze was nice.

733
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,121
I also wanted to have
some chicken with you.

734
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,497
But I didn't.

735
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,873
Gosh, what do you mean?

736
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,959
Whatever. Just eat.

737
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:08,296
I'm dying to find out the piece
you've been practicing day and night.

738
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,132
Shall we begin, Jun?

739
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:12,843
"Pleasure of Love."

740
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,766
"Pleasure of Love" is the piece
I'll be playing.

741
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:08,940
Thanks,

742
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:09,941
Nosebleed.

743
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,322
JIN BEAUTY SALON

744
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,092
Cry and let it all out today

745
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,553
so that you can start over tomorrow.

746
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,430
Jun.

747
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,973
Jun.

748
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,841
That was a complete mess.

749
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,888
But it was
the most touching performance ever.

750
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:29,729
You played so well.
As a reward, I'll grant you a wish.

751
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:30,814
Tell me what you want.

752
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,403
Let's go on a date.

753
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,822
A date?

754
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,536
Ra-ra, there's something strange

755
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,497
about that piece by Martini.

756
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,541
It's called "Plaisir d'amour,"

757
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,127
but why does it sound so sad?

758
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,130
You silly.
It's originally an Italian song.

759
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:58,049
In the beginning, it does talk
about the happiness of love.

760
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,886
But you'll be shocked
once you get to the end.

761
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,387
What are the lyrics?

762
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,015
"The happiness of love is long gone,

763
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,267
and only sadness is left behind forever."

764
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,521
What? Hey, forget that I played
that piece.

765
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,689
I'm taking it back.

766
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:53,313
It's gorgeous.

767
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,818
The sun is about to set.

768
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,370
It must be burning as well.

769
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:16,127
You better not talk
about your heart burning again.

770
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,519
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

771
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,442
I tried my best not to like you.

772
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:42,988
But I do.

773
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,701
I was all depressed.

774
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,287
Then one day, joy came to me.

775
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,959
And that was you.

776
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,089
Thank you

777
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,259
for coming to me.

778
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,018
Jun.

779
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,017
EPILOGUE

780
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,030
She's totally my type.

781
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,661
Hello.

782
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,996
I'm your number one fan.

783
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,832
-My fan?
-Yes.

784
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,042
You were great today.

785
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,086
Thanks, but that's a shame.

786
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,005
Today was my last day playing.

787
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,840
What? Why?

788
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,383
Because I've graduated.

789
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,468
I see.

790
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,305
But I'll take a photo
with my number one fan.

791
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,893
When do you think it all began?

792
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:27,230
I think I was a mess every time we met.

793
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:30,858
I won't let go of you no matter what.

794
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,278
This is a gift. Do you remember?

795
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,657
You're being biased.
That's not really fair, is it?

796
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,325
-No.
-I said, come.

797
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,368
Let me go.

798
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,373
Jae-min, what's wrong?
Did something happen?

799
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,041
I figured Ra-ra used it already.

800
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,712
Who the hell are you?

801
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:57,385
