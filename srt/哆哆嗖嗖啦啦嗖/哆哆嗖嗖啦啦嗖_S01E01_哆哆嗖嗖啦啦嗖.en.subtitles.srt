1
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,755
In 1685,
Bach, known as the Father of Music,

2
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,090
was born in Eisenach, Thuringia
in Germany.

3
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,303
In 1756, the music prodigy Mozart

4
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,263
was born in Salzburg, Austria.

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,641
In 1810, Chopin,
called the Poet of the Piano,

6
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,894
was born in Warsaw, Poland.

7
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,854
And…

8
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,733
In 1997, at an obstetrical clinic
in Cheongdam-dong, Korea,

9
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,986
I, Gu Ra-ra the Piano Fairy, was born.

10
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,616
1997, WHEN RA-RA WAS 6 MONTHS OLD

11
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,791
My mother passed away a few days
after giving birth to me.

12
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,709
My father missed her, so he would leave

13
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,753
her favorite classical music radio on.

14
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,610
Mistakenly believing my frowns

15
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,071
were due to a rich musical sensibility…

16
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,365
This is a gift from God.

17
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,535
-my dad pushed me into the world of piano.
-Ra-ra.

18
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,703
She was born with musical talent.

19
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,748
Please help her become
an internationally acclaimed pianist.

20
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,634
My piano teacher, Ms. Gong Mi-suk,
knew I'd never become such a pianist

21
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,304
within just a minute into
the first lesson. But at the time…

22
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,057
Ms. Gong, please. Just a second.

23
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,603
Ms. Gong was struggling financially.

24
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,689
Enticed by my dad's wealth,

25
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,608
she made the big mistake
of deciding to teach me.

26
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,402
Ra-ra.

27
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,197
In the upcoming competition, you'll play

28
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,284
the 12 variations in C major

29
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,871
on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman"

30
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,081
by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

31
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,293
It's actually a French folk song.

32
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,878
It's about a teenage girl

33
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,756
telling her mother
that she's in love with someone.

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,466
It's a love song.

35
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,759
So…

36
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,140
Ra-ra.

37
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,603
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

38
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,021
You know this song, right?

39
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,317
At my first piano competition, I played

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,111
Mozart's variation
on "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

41
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,305
I was so nervous,
I blanked out the next part.

42
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,807
So I kept playing
do, do, sol, sol, la, la, sol

43
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,893
over and over again.

44
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,270
JUDGES

45
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,778
And in my moment of despair…

46
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,538
my dad's voice rang out, telling me
that it's okay to make mistakes

47
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,917
and that I did a great job. It brightened
my heart like a ray of light.

48
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:19,133
After that day, I always thought of my dad
when I played the piano.

49
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,432
Keep it light.

50
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,476
As if you're dancing.

51
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,370
You think that's music? That's noise!

52
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,959
There were countless moments
when I wanted to quit.

53
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,462
But the memory of my dad on that day

54
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,965
always got me back in front
of the piano again.

55
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,145
At my long-awaited graduation recital…

56
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,278
Gosh, she drives me nuts.

57
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,616
That song was dedicated

58
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,661
to only one person, my dad.

59
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,417
LIKES

60
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,462
EPISODE 1
DO DO SOL SOL LA LA SOL

61
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,468
Gu Ra-ra, do you really have to do this?

62
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,347
Ms. Gong, I only learned piano
all these years

63
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,225
to play that song
for my dad at my graduation recital.

64
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,018
Now I've done that so I'm done!

65
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,895
Finished!

66
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,356
You've studied piano for 20 years.

67
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,733
And that was your only goal? That's it?

68
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,945
I'm at a loss for words
because I'm so flustered and embarrassed!

69
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,613
Look at you talking my ear off.

70
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:33,077
Ms. Gong, we all have different
dreams and aspirations.

71
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,662
So? What's your point?

72
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,913
In this era of diversity,

73
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,291
please don't undermine my goals.

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,001
Why you little…

75
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,086
You're moving to Germany anyway.

76
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,087
That's--

77
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,924
What's wrong with you?

78
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,262
Teaching me must've been stressful, right?

79
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,180
Goodness.

80
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,098
At least you know.

81
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,477
You'll miss me when you're in Germany,
but don't be too sad!

82
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,938
I'm so happy I won't
have to see you again.

83
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,106
I love you!

84
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,442
Do that to your boyfriend.

85
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,906
So? What do you want to do now?

86
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,516
Mimi, go!

87
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,861
I'd like three stars on each nail.

88
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,196
So 30 in total.

89
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,406
Isn't that too much?

90
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,909
I've always wanted to but couldn't.

91
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,204
-Why not?
-Because I had to play the piano.

92
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,541
I got it done once,
and my piano teacher hit me.

93
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,085
I see.

94
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,711
So you don't play anymore?

95
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,464
That's right. I quit.

96
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,508
Right, Mimi?

97
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,025
EVERYDAY YOLO

98
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,995
MIMI AND I HAVING A SWEET AND HAPPY MOMENT

99
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,124
LIVE, CREATE, STORY, BOOMERANG

100
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,217
You've been coming home late.

101
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,345
Did you come back early
because of the first snowfall?

102
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,638
Drink while it's warm.

103
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,892
-Here.
-Great.

104
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,562
The ginger tea you make is the best.

105
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,774
What's wrong? Did something happen?

106
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,485
You seem troubled.

107
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,779
No, everything is fine.

108
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,489
I'm just tired. That's all.

109
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,246
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

110
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,832
Do you want to get married?

111
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,253
What? To who?

112
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,671
RA-RA'S FIANCE
BANG JEONG-NAM

113
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,802
Man.

114
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,639
Eun-seok must be raking in the cash.

115
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,442
RANKED NO. 1

116
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,320
Eun-seok.

117
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,406
Hey, you're here.

118
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,160
You have so many patients.

119
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,663
Dr. Cha, you're such an amazing doctor.

120
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,581
Cut the bullshit.

121
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,916
What are you looking at?

122
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,631
The cherry blossoms.

123
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,591
"Blossoms"?

124
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,845
Jeong-nam, do you know the sequence

125
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,889
of blooms in spring?

126
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,225
No, not really.

127
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,894
When spring comes,

128
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,272
forsythias bloom first.

129
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,569
And when the forsythias start to wither,
magnolias bloom.

130
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,656
Then when the magnolias wither,
cherry blossoms bloom.

131
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,117
By the time the cherry blossoms
wither and drop,

132
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,911
the lilacs are in full bloom.

133
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,165
And when the lilacs wither,
acacia flowers bloom.

134
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,627
Then the mountain breeze carries
the aroma of the flowers…

135
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,841
Eun-seok.

136
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,468
Are you okay?

137
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,683
I guess you're saying weird stuff
because you're hungry.

138
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,561
Here, eat this.

139
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,938
Why are you talking about flowers?

140
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,898
Didn't you see the line outside?

141
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:14,984
Thanks for this.

142
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,407
By the way, what brings you by?

143
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,663
I'm getting married.

144
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,679
Ra-ra,

145
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,930
what about these?

146
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,559
Ms. Im, you look

147
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,852
like a loan shark.

148
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,024
You have a very pointy chin,
so you should stay away

149
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,151
from designs like that.

150
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,195
Let's see.

151
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,783
What about these? Try these on.

152
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:09,330
You guys are sure that you can move
into Seocho Ramiang next spring, right?

153
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,414
Yes, I think so.

154
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,167
The Wirye Clinic building is four stories.

155
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,960
That building have seven stories?

156
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,670
-I think so.
-Hey.

157
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,756
-Yes?
-Do you even know anything?

158
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,382
The wedding is soon.

159
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,385
I need to know these things
to come up with a schedule.

160
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,764
I'll ask my dad later.

161
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,605
You're right. These are nice.
I'll get these.

162
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,941
I'll pay for this.

163
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,529
The beauty products we bought earlier
were 720,000 won.

164
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,825
The sunglasses that I bought and this one
come to 680,000 won together.

165
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,995
So, we spent 1.5 million won?

166
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,165
Ms. Im! It means
that we can get the promo gift.

167
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,959
We've only spent 1.4 million won.

168
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,546
No, we didn't.

169
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,007
Well, 72 plus 68 is… And 8, 2, 1…

170
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,552
You can't even do simple math?

171
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,137
Ms. Im.

172
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,892
I heard even Beethoven
struggled with math all his life.

173
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,021
These are so pretty.

174
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,903
I'm speechless.

175
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,906
Does she think she's Beethoven or Mozart?

176
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,119
How dare she always compare herself
to such legendary musical geniuses?

177
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,289
She quit piano, and she's jobless now.

178
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,583
Your father-in-law
will finance your new clinic?

179
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,336
To tell you the truth,
you were always my role model.

180
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,630
And now, I can live like you do.

181
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,468
-I'm getting a divorce.
-I see. A divorce…

182
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,848
Eun-seok. Why?

183
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,684
Because I want to quit working here.

184
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,478
By any chance,

185
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,357
are you terminally ill?

186
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,653
-Yes.
-What?

187
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,946
Yes.

188
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,510
INVITATION
BANG JEONG-NAM, GU RA-RA

189
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,179
What? "Gu Ra-ra"?

190
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,352
"Gu Ra-ra"?

191
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,772
Why didn't you say goodbye?

192
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,690
I wanted to ask the same thing.

193
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,929
Thank you.

194
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,681
Good job today.

195
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,642
Can you cover the shifts until next week?

196
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,772
That young man is such a good worker,
and he never slacks off.

197
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,190
I really like him.

198
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,243
FLEA MARKET

199
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,438
-My gosh.
-Are you all right?

200
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,356
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

201
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,608
Gosh! What are you going to do about this?

202
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,236
-What am I supposed to do?
-It wasn't on purpose.

203
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,905
You ruined my day!

204
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,366
Darn it. The wedding will begin shortly.

205
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,201
Excuse me.

206
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,329
Wait, can you do me a favor?

207
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,207
This has to be dropped off
at that hotel over there.

208
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,375
Can you do it for me?

209
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,502
Make a left
at that intersection over there.

210
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,379
The other flowers were delivered,

211
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,382
but they forgot this.
That's why I'm doing a rush delivery.

212
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,178
The bride might walk without a bouquet.

213
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,138
Damn it. What do I do?

214
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,974
Jeez, nothing is going my way today.

215
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,602
Thank you. Thank you so much!

216
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,158
-My gosh!
-You look gorgeous.

217
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,117
My boyfriend.

218
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,702
-Oh, my goodness.
-Thank you.

219
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,287
-All the best.
-Thank you.

220
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,624
-My gosh, ma'am.
-Hello.

221
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,958
Congratulations.

222
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,837
My husband couldn't make it
because he's still in the US.

223
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,215
I know you're busy.
Thank you very much for coming.

224
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,468
You're like our family.
Of course, I should be here.

225
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,556
Gosh, ma'am.
You really don't have to do this.

226
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,892
-My goodness.
-It's my pleasure.

227
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,770
Dr. Bang, you look very cool today.

228
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,355
And the bride

229
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,107
is very beautiful.

230
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,317
Thank you.

231
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,653
Are you that happy?

232
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,669
It really is her.

233
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,879
-Ra-ra.
-Hey.

234
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,925
They said they sent the bouquet.

235
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,469
-And my dad isn't here yet either?
-No.

236
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,264
Min-ju, can you get my phone from my bag?

237
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,892
Here.

238
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,526
Why isn't he picking up?

239
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,613
I'll bring the bouquet when it arrives.

240
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,198
Try to smile a little.

241
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,867
The bride should look happy.

242
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,047
Good. I'm not too late.

243
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,636
Don't come closer! Stop. Stop right there.

244
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,389
You can just leave it
on that chair over there.

245
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,018
-I don't want to.
-What?

246
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,275
It's not because I think you look filthy.
I'm just scared!

247
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,472
-Oh, no!
-Why are you so startled? You hit me.

248
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,432
-Your nose is bleeding.
-What?

249
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,142
Darn it.

250
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,568
No!

251
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,113
My wedding is about to begin.

252
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,532
What is this? What's your problem?

253
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,450
My dad isn't even here yet,

254
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,536
and I have blood on my dress.

255
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,829
Nothing's going my way.

256
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,748
Don't cry. Hold it.

257
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,667
Just swallow your tears!

258
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,877
You want to ruin your makeup
and end up like me?

259
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,797
Okay, so don't cry.

260
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,218
Hey, where are you going?

261
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,095
What do I do?

262
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,056
-Can I help you?
-I'll bring this back.

263
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,443
By the way,
why are you speaking casually to me?

264
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,571
-What about you?
-You started it.

265
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:03,989
I did?

266
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,699
I wonder why.

267
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,284
Because you look young, I guess?

268
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,828
-How old are you?
-I'm 24.

269
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,955
We're the same age.

270
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,417
I'm sorry for speaking so casually to you.
And for hitting you.

271
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,086
It's okay. We'll never
see each other again anyway.

272
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,634
Can we go faster?

273
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,598
Did I leave my phone in the office?

274
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,435
Use mine, sir.

275
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,981
-Hey, Ra-ra.
-Dad!

276
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,525
I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long.

277
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,277
I'll be there soon, so don't worry.

278
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,612
You just get ready.

279
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,073
Okay, I was so worried.

280
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,949
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

281
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,826
I love you very much.

282
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,663
Come on, Dad. Now's not the time for that.

283
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:54,956
Just hurry up.

284
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,417
I'm saying it now since
I might forget when I arrive.

285
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,921
-Ra-ra!
-Dad, I have to go. Hurry, okay?

286
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,756
Oh, the bouquet's here.

287
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,133
-Your dad? Where is he?
-He's almost here.

288
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,637
We'll escort you to the hall
if you've already spoken to your father.

289
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,930
-Okay.
-Let's begin.

290
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,480
Thank you.

291
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,399
Bye.

292
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,240
No.

293
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,744
-We should get going.
-We're escorting the bride now.

294
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:43,880
We gather here today to celebrate the
wedding of Bang Jeong-nam and Gu Ra-ra.

295
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,674
We will begin the ceremony now.

296
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,051
The groom may enter.

297
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,682
He's finally getting married!

298
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,022
Bang Jeong-nam!

299
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,945
The bride will now enter.

300
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,964
-Oh, my.
-Here comes the bride.

301
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,219
The ceremony has begun.
How come her father isn't here yet?

302
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,763
I heard he's the chairman
of Rara Cosmetics.

303
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,142
I heard the company
isn't doing well, though.

304
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,352
Rumors have been going around for a while.

305
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,189
Come on.
Don't you know how Im Ja-gyeong is?

306
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,859
I'm sure she did her research before
deciding to marry off her dear son.

307
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,070
Her dad financed their apartment,
new car, and his clinic.

308
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,992
Okay. Just a moment.

309
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,619
Sir.

310
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,038
It's Mr. Kang.

311
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,627
Hello, Mr. Kang.

312
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,717
Just this once.
Can you help me out just this one time?

313
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,677
I'm sorry, sir.

314
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,898
-Sir.
-Ra-ra…

315
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,982
-Ra-ra…
-My gosh!

316
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,193
-Sir!
-What happened?

317
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,157
Ja-gyeong!

318
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,452
Ja-gyeong.

319
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,582
What? Are you serious?

320
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,500
Yes.

321
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,337
My goodness. How…

322
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,467
CLINIC, APARTMENT, BENTZ

323
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,510
DEBT

324
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,954
-Come here.
-Mom.

325
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,414
Mom!

326
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,769
Ra-ra! Your father collapsed.

327
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,438
Hurry! The ambulance is here.

328
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,355
What?

329
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,692
-Oh, no.
-My gosh.

330
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,821
One, two, three. Clear!

331
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,656
-200 joules!
-Got it, 200 joules.

332
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,907
Step back.

333
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,076
One, two, three. Clear!

334
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,871
-Charge to 300 joules.
-Got it, 300 joules.

335
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,524
May 2, 2020, 4:32 p.m.

336
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,610
Mr. Gu Man-su

337
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,321
has passed away.

338
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,502
Dad.

339
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:52,962
Dad.

340
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:09,979
Dad.

341
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,566
Open your eyes, Dad.

342
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,321
In the morning, you said that you wanted
to see me in my wedding dress.

343
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:24,577
Dad, you didn't even get to see me
in this dress.

344
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,546
Dad.

345
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:41,761
Just a while ago, you said you loved me

346
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,808
and that I'd see you soon. Dad, please…

347
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,941
You said you love me.
How could you do this to me?

348
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,362
How could this happen? Dad!

349
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,198
Dad…

350
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,039
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

351
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,274
I know you're devastated,
but please listen carefully.

352
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,153
Business has been bad for quite some time.

353
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,282
Even the house
has already been auctioned off.

354
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,331
Ms. Gu.

355
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:54,542
The creditors are after you now,
so you shouldn't be here.

356
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,754
I'll hold a funeral for him
and bury him next to your late mother.

357
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:01,090
You can visit his grave
after things quiet down.

358
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,137
What? I can't even go to his funeral?

359
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,806
You must lie low

360
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,934
until I get all the legal matters
sorted out. Okay?

361
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,484
And take this.

362
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,196
It's not much,

363
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,449
but you should get a place to stay
with that money.

364
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,954
Thankfully, your car wasn't seized
because it was at the hotel,

365
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,373
so you can use your car.

366
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,919
Thank you for everything.

367
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,550
Take good care of yourself, okay?

368
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,138
Okay.

369
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,996
SEIZED

370
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,321
Mimi,

371
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,822
you must've been so scared.

372
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,742
You were hiding there all this time?

373
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,291
It's just us two now.

374
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,169
We'll be okay, right?

375
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,046
Right?

376
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,421
I understand it was urgent,

377
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,340
but how could she just run away?
He was about to get married.

378
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,508
The father collapsed.

379
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,510
The bride even ran out
in her wedding dress.

380
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,263
Is she going to be okay?

381
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,015
That woman.

382
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,863
FULLY FURNISHED LUXURY STUDIO
24-HOUR STAFF

383
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,578
May I help you?

384
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,623
This guy lives here, right?

385
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,345
What's his room number?

386
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,515
You little punk.

387
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:05,937
Room 306.

388
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,557
Farewell,Dad.

389
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,228
Goodbye.

390
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,540
CITY OF DREAMS AND ROMANCE
LOVELY EUNPO CITY

391
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,765
The divorce papers.

392
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,017
Please hand them in.

393
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,061
Where will you go?

394
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,271
To your father's place?

395
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,523
I'll take care of that.

396
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,650
Have a good life.

397
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,863
Don't worry about me.
I'm already elated as is.

398
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,576
It'll be the end if you leave right now.

399
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,746
Are you sure you won't regret giving up
on both the hospital and me?

400
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,581
Let's not go around in circles.

401
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm really fine.

402
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,212
Look at you pretending
not to care about the money.

403
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,047
Get lost.

404
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,174
Your cocky attitude disgusts me.

405
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,259
MY WIFE RA-RA

406
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,515
MY WIFE RA-RA

407
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,809
Jeong-nam.

408
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,312
"My Wife Ra-ra"?

409
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,858
What wife? Your wedding
was called off a long time ago.

410
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,402
Blocked.

411
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,780
This is exactly why I dragged you here.

412
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:54,285
Didn't I tell you that pitying others
is the most useless thing in the world?

413
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,245
In order to become successful,

414
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,997
you need to learn when to let go.

415
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,207
You need to be cold-hearted to succeed.

416
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,335
Answer me.

417
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:07,047
Fine, I got it.

418
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,259
Mr. Bang is on vacation.

419
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,514
Did he go on our honeymoon without me?

420
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,767
The deposit is 5 million won,
and the rent is 400,000 won.

421
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,312
I see.

422
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:26,233
So I need to pay 400,000 won every month?

423
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,820
-Correct.
-Then if I were to pay a lump sum,

424
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,157
I'd only have to pay once
instead of every month?

425
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,784
What's that? You want to pay a lump sum?

426
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,785
I do.

427
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,455
This place was built last year.

428
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,582
What do you say? Excellent, right?

429
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,043
Yes, it's much better
than the previous one.

430
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,630
Of course. A place like this is rare.

431
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,465
You won't find another place like this

432
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,634
for a lump sum of just 100 million won.

433
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,386
If you don't take it,
someone else will in no time.

434
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,933
Let's see. There are four other people
scheduled to see this room today.

435
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,560
I'll take it.

436
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,188
LEASE AGREEMENT

437
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,234
You hit the jackpot today.

438
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,735
Today's your lucky day.

439
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:10,694
Right.

440
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,406
How will you pay the deposit
and the balance?

441
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:16,951
100 million won.

442
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:24,542
My goodness. You had this much in cash?

443
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,919
You're really amazing.

444
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,974
Mimi, are you exhausted?

445
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,770
Moving is no joke.

446
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,900
Should we take a photo in our new home?

447
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,661
What?

448
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,166
"Do you want to come here
if you're lonely?"

449
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,545
Who is this? I don't know this handle.

450
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,636
Where is this place?

451
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,080
"Dodosolsollalasol"?

452
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,127
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

453
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,962
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star"?

454
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,507
Do they know me?

455
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,010
No, they could be a real weirdo.

456
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,220
Yes.

457
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:51,730
I need a blanket and some curtains.
There are many things I need to buy.

458
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,747
Gosh.

459
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:13,210
Hey, I'm here!

460
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,004
Hey!

461
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,090
Open the door!

462
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,804
What? This is the wrong place.

463
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,724
Goodness, this isn't it.

464
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,393
I'm sorry.

465
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,039
It's a bit scary.

466
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,083
Should we sleep with the lights on?

467
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,927
ONE MONTH LATER

468
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,472
JIN BEAUTY SALON

469
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,057
CUTS, PERMS, BLOW-DRY

470
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,936
Look at you eagerly waiting.

471
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,938
Go to school already, you brat.

472
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,232
I'm graduating soon.
I can be a little bit late.

473
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,070
Do well until you graduate.
You know better.

474
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,322
I don't.

475
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,282
I just want to graduate quickly

476
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,035
and get married to Jun.

477
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,787
Don't be ridiculous.

478
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,747
It's about time he came out.

479
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,958
Oh, my.

480
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,084
Gosh! Hey!

481
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,419
Jun!

482
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,545
You startled me.

483
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,757
Surprise. Today, it's tuna rice ball.

484
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:44,635
Thanks.

485
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,720
You don't need to do this.

486
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,347
Jun, wait.

487
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,598
Drop me off at school.

488
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,683
-No.
-Why not?

489
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,602
Your school is nearby. Just walk.

490
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:54,812
But…

491
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,900
Was that such a difficult favor?

492
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,111
Darn it, I'm so irritated.

493
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,073
Hey! Then you shouldn't be
so good-looking!

494
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,408
Gosh, I'm so annoyed. Darn it.

495
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,411
Who made her so clingy?

496
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,956
She's my daughter,
but she's so humiliating.

497
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:14,957
Goodness.

498
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,545
They commented again.

499
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,630
"Are you eating well?

500
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,215
Are you sleeping well?

501
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,633
Are you healthy?"

502
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,262
Why are they nagging me so much?

503
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,893
Who could it be?

504
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,897
-Who is--
-Hello, I'm a real estate agent.

505
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,440
We came to see the apartment.

506
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,358
Why would you?

507
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,030
Lady, how can an apartment this nice

508
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,948
only be 100 million won?

509
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,659
The deposit here is 30 million,
and the rent is 2 million.

510
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,077
The lump sum is 450 million.

511
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,871
Open this door!

512
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:39,499
Open the door! God, this is crazy!

513
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,960
-I can't believe this!
-I'm so furious!

514
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,463
-I'm enraged!
-I even wrote

515
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,214
a contract.

516
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:50,552
The landlord didn't sign this contract.

517
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,472
We're all going to become homeless.

518
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,561
"Homeless"?

519
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,658
WHY ISN'T SHE LEAVING?

520
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,034
I'M GOING INSANE

521
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:14,952
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

522
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,958
Detective.

523
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,503
That real estate lady didn't seem
like a bad person.

524
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,213
She was very friendly.

525
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,466
She didn't look like a scammer.

526
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,968
Ms. Gu,

527
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,552
a scammer

528
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,138
doesn't advertise that they're a scammer.

529
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,266
I've never been scammed before,

530
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,184
so I didn't know.

531
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,269
We're looking into the case

532
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,397
and searching for that lady right now.

533
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,440
I'll call you immediately if we find her.

534
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,985
For now, you should go home and wait.

535
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,152
Detective.

536
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,614
-Yes?
-I've never been homeless before,

537
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,993
so I don't know what to do.

538
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:59,538
When it came to
administrative and legal matters,

539
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:03,083
and other complicated things,
Secretary Moon always took care of them.

540
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,503
Then you can speak with him
about this, right?

541
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,840
I'd like to
but I can't reach him right now.

542
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,263
You can't reach him?

543
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:23,979
INTERNATIONAL CALL

544
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:31,028
-Hello, honey.
-Are you home?

545
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,614
Yes. I mean, no. I'm outside right now.

546
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,492
You don't usually call at this hour.

547
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,910
Is something wrong?

548
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,747
I'm flying in next month.
Just letting you know.

549
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,582
I see.

550
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:46,251
Weren't you supposed to be abroad
for a year?

551
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,128
You're a few months early.

552
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,422
Things sorted out sooner
than I had expected.

553
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,715
I see.

554
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,801
How's Jun? Is he doing well?

555
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:58,013
Of course, he is.

556
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,182
All right, then. I'll see you next month.

557
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,699
It's me.

558
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,536
-How did it go?
-It seems he's gone off the grid.

559
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,371
He changed his phone number as well.

560
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,248
-There are no digital traces-
-Hey!

561
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,668
How much have I already paid you

562
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,088
and this is all you can come up with?

563
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,548
Find him this instant!

564
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,351
That brat.

565
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,237
GU MAN-SU, LEE GYEONG-JIN
WE LOVE YOU. REST IN PEACE.

566
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:57,948
I'm back again.

567
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:11,294
I brought your favorite. Ginger tea.

568
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,467
Aren't you happy to see me?

569
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,928
Aren't I pretty?

570
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,347
Are you happy?

571
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:30,772
Dad, I'm so stupid.

572
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,943
I got scammed and lost my apartment.

573
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,864
What should I do?

574
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,409
Should I just live here?

575
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:46,663
In the past, people lived next
to their parents' graves for three years.

576
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,916
I could do that, too, right?

577
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,432
I can see the sky from here. It's nice.

578
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,393
Right, Mimi?

579
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,482
What?

580
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:19,070
Are you hungry? Oh, my.
I totally forgot to feed you.

581
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,614
Mimi.

582
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,912
Do you have no energy?

583
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,080
I'm sorry I forgot.

584
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:30,165
Here.

585
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,085
Is it tasty?

586
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,967
How can you even pretend that tastes good?

587
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,135
Here. You can have it all.

588
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,721
Eat up.

589
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,482
That's nice.

590
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,083
I miss you, Dad.

591
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,837
You were so happy that day.

592
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,309
"Dodosolsollalasol."

593
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,437
What? These are the notes that come
at the very beginning

594
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,689
of Mozart's
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star".

595
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,234
This is a secret that only my dad
and I know. It can't be…

596
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,746
Secretary Moon's hometown is Busan.

597
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,914
This doesn't look like Busan.

598
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,916
Could it be Ms. Gong?

599
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,877
But she's in Germany right now.

600
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,003
Who could it be?

601
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,589
I'm certain they know my dad.

602
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,597
Where is this?

603
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,807
I'll go see you right now.

604
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,148
Mimi, put on your seat belt.

605
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,611
Eunpo City.

606
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,446
Navigation will begin now.

607
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:07,989
All right.

608
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,700
Shall we go?

609
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,129
JEOLLANAM-DO, EUNPO CITY

610
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,547
I think we're almost there.

611
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,343
What? Mimi.

612
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,804
Is she not feeling well?

613
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,516
What? Oh, my.

614
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:00,768
Mimi.

615
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,979
Is she carsick?

616
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,314
Mimi, are you okay?

617
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,732
Mimi…

618
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:40,642
Hey.

619
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:51,402
Bye.

620
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,949
We have a 24-year-old TA female patient.

621
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,284
Is she badly injured?

622
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,661
I'm a little worried because
she's a pianist.

623
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:45,123
-What's your relationship to the patient?
-Accident victim.

624
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:48,167
What is going on?
The accident victim is looking after her?

625
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,629
Remember when I said, "Bye"
and you said, "No"?

626
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,591
I guess what you said was magic.
Since we met each other again.

627
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,259
He's still not answering?

628
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,344
Jun didn't run away, did he?

629
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,930
I bet he ran away
because it was too much pressure.

630
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:24,555
