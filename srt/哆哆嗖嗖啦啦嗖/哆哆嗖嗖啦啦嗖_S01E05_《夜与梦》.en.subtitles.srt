1
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,054
Oh, he must be here. Sweet dreams, Mimi.

2
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,684
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

3
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,353
All right.

4
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
Bye.

5
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:14,991
Bye.

6
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,799
Jun.

7
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,557
Jun?

8
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,269
What's wrong, Jun?

9
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,856
Jun, are you all right?

10
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,965
Don't go.

11
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,596
Don't leave.

12
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,067
Jun.

13
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,196
Is something wrong?

14
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,413
It's okay.

15
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,545
It's all right.

16
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,089
You're okay.

17
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,603
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,232
Can you not say "bye"

19
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,737
when you leave?

20
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,197
Okay, I won't.

21
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,410
I'm fine now.

22
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,997
You should go. He must've been waiting.

23
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,126
Go.

24
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,976
I'll get going.

25
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,497
Dr. Cha, could you pull over?

26
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,581
-Right now?
-Yes.

27
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,668
Could you pull over
to the sidewalk over there?

28
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,845
I'm sorry. You can go first.

29
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,931
What's wrong? Should I wait?

30
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,933
No, you should leave.

31
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,783
EPISODE 5

32
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,598
"NIGHT AND DREAMS"

33
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,620
That's "Night and Dreams" by Schubert.

34
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,456
Why haven't you gone home?

35
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,250
I just wanted to stay with you.

36
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,630
I was worried too.

37
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,970
I haven't played in a while,
so it was a mess.

38
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,474
Did you play the accompaniment too?

39
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,062
No, a friend of mine did.

40
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,772
A girl?

41
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,109
He was a dear friend.

42
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,986
I see.

43
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,117
Jun.

44
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,040
If you have any sorrows, you can tell me.

45
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,546
A friend of mine once told me
not to share my sorrows with others

46
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,591
and make them carry the burden with me.

47
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,928
I couldn't help but agree with her.

48
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,224
So I told myself not to do that anymore.

49
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,519
It's hard enough for us
to carry our own burdens.

50
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,395
So it's exhausting to worry

51
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,856
and waste our time on others as well.

52
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,443
But…

53
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,281
you can share your sorrow with me.

54
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,700
Because it's you.

55
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm being nice because it's you.

56
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,598
What's going on?

57
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,103
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

58
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,481
Do you know that Schubert died young
because of his illness?

59
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,859
Of course, I know that much.

60
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,697
He composed "Night and Dreams"
after falling ill.

61
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,576
Many of his siblings passed away
when he was young,

62
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,369
and even he fell sick as well.

63
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,830
So he never felt distant from death.

64
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,416
Maybe that's why he wanted to dream.

65
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,794
What about you? What's your dream?

66
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,883
I had one a long time ago,

67
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,093
but not anymore.

68
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,887
Why not?

69
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,933
In order to dream,
you need to look back on your past,

70
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,644
be aware of your present,
and imagine your future.

71
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,773
But I don't want to think
about any of them.

72
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,361
Ms. Jin always scolds me for being
thoughtless, but you're just the same.

73
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,489
Then what's your dream?

74
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,990
Mine? My dream?

75
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,368
My dream…

76
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,499
is to have prime beef tenderloin.

77
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,669
What kind of dream is that? Gosh.

78
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,548
What? Dreams don't have to be grand.
You can dream of whatever you want.

79
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,010
It's been ages since I've had
prime beef tenderloin.

80
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,763
I also want to find ten students

81
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,057
and design bags for them.

82
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,059
You have such grand dreams.

83
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,311
So grand that I'm speechless.

84
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,606
Why? Dreams can be
of various shapes and sizes, you know.

85
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,983
Don't mock my dreams
when you don't even have one.

86
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,027
I didn't mock them.

87
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,487
Yes, it's totally obvious.

88
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,364
-It's not.
-You totally mocked them.

89
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,074
-I didn't.
-Don't play innocent.

90
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,662
EPISODE 5
"NIGHT AND DREAMS"

91
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,914
JIN BEAUTY SALON

92
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,749
LALA PIANO LAND

93
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,731
Did my anxiety stress me out?

94
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,858
Why did I sleep here?

95
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,526
Jun.

96
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,074
Jun.

97
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,592
For breakfast,
freshly squeezed kale apple juice.

98
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,261
Gluten-free quinoa bread
with avocado spread.

99
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,514
Yogurt with blueberry granola
and coconut chunks.

100
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,809
Salad with chicory, radicchio,
romaine lettuce, and lemon vinaigrette

101
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,228
topped with black olives and brie.

102
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,688
Could you prepare them for me?

103
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,691
No. I don't want to.

104
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,236
He says no
but does everything I ask of him.

105
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,870
By the way, where did he go
so early in the morning?

106
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,170
Put that down. I can do it.

107
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,965
Gosh, it's good to be young.

108
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,845
When I was your age,
I could easily carry an 80kg rice sack.

109
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,098
That's exactly why your lower back
aches now.

110
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,474
You should get some rest.

111
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,684
You used to be so quiet.

112
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,020
But now, you nag at me and even smile.

113
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,480
Do you like her that much?

114
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,731
Pardon?

115
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,775
No, I don't.

116
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,536
-Hello?
-Jun!

117
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,206
Where have you gone
after making my favorite meal?

118
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,542
Can you please talk more quietly?

119
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,460
I just went to buy some milk

120
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,754
and bought them at a reduced price.

121
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,257
-At a reduced price?
-Yes.

122
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,634
Did you read the memo I left?

123
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,180
Clean the floor, wash the dishes,
and make the bed afterwards.

124
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,016
Did you just feed me so that I could work?

125
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,601
I'm busy. Bye.

126
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,316
Sir, where should I put this?

127
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,404
Gosh. I was touched for no reason.

128
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:23,159
By the way, is the piano academy
doing well?

129
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,535
Not yet.

130
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,996
But it'll get better.

131
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,124
Oh, right.

132
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,502
Do you happen to have lettuce, kale,
or romaine seedlings?

133
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,173
What for? Are you interested
in growing them?

134
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,674
I'm going to give it a try.

135
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,179
So you've finally decided to settle down.

136
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,017
Sir, what about my son?

137
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,271
Detective Kang, why can't you find my son?

138
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,482
Why is it
that you still haven't found him?

139
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,108
Ma'am.

140
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,403
You cried your eyes out
saying it was a relief

141
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,239
that it wasn't your son's body
just a few hours ago.

142
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,994
Also, how can we find your son solely with
the ID card that we found on the body?

143
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,829
Go home and wait for now.

144
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,290
I'll call you if I find anything.

145
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,917
Detective Kang!

146
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,098
DIRECTOR CHU

147
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,062
Director Chu! Where are you?

148
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,606
Why aren't you here yet? Hurry up!

149
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,149
I've paid you a hefty amount.

150
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,527
How could you still be
so incompetent and slow?

151
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,653
Come here this instant!

152
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:44,240
An unidentified body was found
at Eunpo Marine Park on the 12th.

153
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,993
The autopsy showed
that the man had drowned.

154
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,370
That's so mysterious.

155
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,373
Why can't they identify him
even after the autopsy?

156
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,834
They probably couldn't get
any fingerprints off of him.

157
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,505
Fingerprints? They could've gotten his D…
Well, DHA is found in tuna.

158
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,216
DNA. They could've gotten that.

159
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,553
Come on, now.
They can only identify a dead body

160
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,972
if their DNA is registered

161
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,598
in the NFS database.

162
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,351
Running the DNA test
won't automatically identify them.

163
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,146
After watching
that crime investigation drama,

164
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,274
you've become a detective yourself.

165
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,693
You win.

166
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,486
What time is it?

167
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,031
I wonder if our kids
are taking the test well.

168
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,493
I know that Ye-seo will get top marks.

169
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,288
What about Seung-gi? Did he study hard?

170
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,416
This is the last test
before applying to colleges. Did he?

171
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,626
He did pull an all-nighter.

172
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,128
Happy now?

173
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,421
-Did he?
-Yes.

174
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,631
Then he'll come second to last.

175
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,549
Hey.

176
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,218
Your kimchi is here

177
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,012
-Kimchi?
-It's here

178
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,513
Come over here.

179
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,348
Hurry up.

180
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,601
-Be careful with that.
-All right.

181
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,397
-Is this your mother-in-law's?
-You bet.

182
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,483
It's already chopped. You're so smart.

183
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,735
Of course.

184
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,324
Isn't it good? No matter how many times
we tell her to get a divorce,

185
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,075
she just can't

186
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,412
because of her mother-in-law's kimchi.

187
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,663
You know it.

188
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,750
Hurry up and bring some flour and oil.

189
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,460
-Hurry up.
-Hurry up.

190
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,836
Bring it here.

191
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,120
CUTS, PERMS, BLOW-DRY

192
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,789
How sentimental.

193
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,332
Vegetable pancakes

194
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,085
taste the best on a rainy day.

195
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,211
-You're right.
-Yes.

196
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,090
I feel sophisticated cooking them
while listening to piano music.

197
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,425
Anyway…

198
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,761
-Flip it. You're burning it.
-You're burning it.

199
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,929
Flip it.

200
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,022
By the way, Ra-ra came early today.

201
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,149
She didn't come home last night.

202
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,067
Oh, my.

203
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,611
She slept at the academy
because Jun was sick.

204
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,865
Thank goodness Ha-yeong slept over
at your place after studying.

205
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,367
She would've caused a scene.

206
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,953
Gosh, just thinking about it
is giving me a headache.

207
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,539
He didn't seem sick at all.

208
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,957
-What?
-What?

209
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,459
Hello.

210
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,923
Do you have gluten-free quinoa bread

211
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,009
with avocado spread?

212
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,760
What was that again?

213
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,637
Gluten-free quinoa bread

214
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,557
with avocado spread.

215
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,352
It was qui… Qui…

216
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,270
Quiz?

217
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,023
-No. It's too long to remember.
-Qui…

218
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,233
Anyway, he came to the bakery
looking excited.

219
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,359
What?

220
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,279
He must be a picky eater.

221
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,363
As if.

222
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,450
I can obviously tell
that he was sent by someone else.

223
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,702
-Goodness.
-It was her?

224
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:46,815
Judging by the savory smell,
it must be vegetable pancakes.

225
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,445
I didn't know this was a door.

226
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,136
My goodness!

227
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,891
Why did you come out from there?

228
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,518
That was a door?

229
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,188
My gosh! I almost had a miscarriage!

230
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,439
Are you pregnant?

231
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,441
Did the IVF work?

232
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,986
No, I just meant I was that startled.

233
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,489
Excuse me, but…

234
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,075
May I have a piece?

235
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,537
Did you break through that wall
to have some of this?

236
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,081
I thought it was a door.

237
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,874
-My goodness. No!
-Goodness.

238
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,126
I can't believe it!

239
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,420
This was so expensive!

240
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,050
You can put that on her tab as well.

241
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,470
-Exactly.
-Since you broke down the wall,

242
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,557
-you might as well eat up.
-Thank you.

243
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,518
-Thank you.
-You're different than you seem.

244
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,061
You have some unexpected charms.

245
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,148
Look at you eat.

246
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,025
I'm getting a call.

247
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,737
Hello?

248
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,867
Right now?

249
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,286
Okay, I'm on my way. Okay.

250
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,203
What?

251
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,414
-Okay.
-What is it?

252
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,624
-A student's here!
-What?

253
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,876
Right.

254
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,837
Goodness.

255
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,175
This is for the Grace Kelly Perm
you gave me last time.

256
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,885
Oh, my!

257
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,012
She's finally paying off her debt.

258
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,975
Please leave
one piece of the pancake for me.

259
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,894
-I'll leave two.
-Two.

260
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,354
See you later.

261
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,940
She's going in there?

262
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,157
Miss! Hold on!

263
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,034
Grandpa.

264
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,583
You really want to learn the piano?

265
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,294
I want to play the piece

266
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,921
you played for me last time.

267
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,672
Do you mean "The Maiden's Prayer"?

268
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,758
Is that what it's called?

269
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,677
"The Maiden's Prayer"?

270
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:26,642
But you see,
it's quite a difficult piece to play.

271
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,188
Do you think I'll die
before I master the song?

272
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,526
Look. I'm 80 years old.

273
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,571
How long do you think it'll take me?

274
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,039
A very long time.

275
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,710
Do you charge a lot?

276
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,836
Well…

277
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,424
How much do you get a day
for collecting recyclable paper?

278
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,553
For a total of 8 hours,
I pick up around 100kg.

279
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,515
I make about 5,000 won. Why do you ask?

280
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,933
I see.

281
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,520
I charge 100,000 won per month.

282
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,729
That means…

283
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,149
Oh, dear. I'd have to work
for 20 days straight

284
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,777
and not use a single penny.

285
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,698
Exactly. How could I charge you that much?

286
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,911
It'll take a very long time
for you to play that song.

287
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,206
But I still want to learn how to play.

288
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,462
Then how about this?

289
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,923
I've borrowed a lot of money,
and many people

290
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,968
are curious about my academy,
so I need to do well.

291
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,929
I'll teach you for free,

292
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,764
but keep it a secret, okay?

293
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,684
I'll be in trouble
if my investor finds out.

294
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,687
-I've brought some kimchi pancakes.
-My goodness!

295
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,648
Oh, my. Grandpa.

296
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,943
Where have you been lately?

297
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,988
You didn't even come by
for a haircut. Goodness.

298
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,698
How do you two know each other?

299
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,994
He's the owner of this building.
He's the landlord.

300
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,663
-Did you not know that?
-Pardon?

301
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,711
Have some kimchi pancakes.

302
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,421
They're crispy and delicious.

303
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,432
Hey, Ha-yeong.

304
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,351
Hey, wake up.

305
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,272
You're so annoying. Let me be.

306
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,901
I hadn't used my brain in a while,
so I'm dog-tired.

307
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:49,326
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE

308
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,288
WHILE WALKING BY MY SIDE

309
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,290
What is this?

310
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,084
FEELING NERVOUS
I SECRETLY

311
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,251
Isn't this song nice?

312
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,338
I found this while watching videos
last night.

313
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,382
It came out 20 years ago,
even before we were born.

314
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,385
I think my mom listened
to that song before.

315
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,347
It's nice. So what?

316
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,266
Listen to the lyrics.

317
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,312
I'LL PROTECT YOU LIKE I DID TODAY

318
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:24,361
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
"I LOVE YOU" TOO SOON

319
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:31,326
HOW AM I TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS NOW?

320
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:37,541
EVEN IF EVERYTHING ELSE CHANGES

321
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,376
I WILL CONTINUE TO LOVE YOU

322
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,256
You're right. I shouldn't stop myself
from saying "I love you."

323
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,842
I'm going to confess today.

324
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,469
To Jun, I mean.

325
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,805
I shouldn't stay still like this.

326
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,140
Hey.

327
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,058
What?

328
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,728
Enjoy your food.

329
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,566
-Sir. One chicken sandwich, please.
-Yes?

330
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,193
Right. Here you go.

331
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,361
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

332
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,867
-Jun.
-Yes?

333
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,911
That man keeps staring at you.

334
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,549
What is it?

335
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,135
Do you feel better?

336
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,890
Yesterday, Ra-ra told me
that you were quite ill.

337
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,349
I was?

338
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,519
Judging by your complexion
and seeing you work,

339
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,937
I guess you've recovered.

340
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,857
I didn't recover
since I wasn't sick to begin with.

341
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,737
I see.

342
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,947
I doubt you came all the way here

343
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,284
for a sandwich during our lunch rush
just to check up on me.

344
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,954
To be frank, I came because I was worried.
For a few reasons.

345
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,881
Yes, Nurse Kim?

346
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,051
Sorry?

347
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,390
I have to go. We'll talk again next time.

348
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,600
No, thanks.

349
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,776
How did you know I was here?

350
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,363
Jeong-nam told me.
I heard you two drank together.

351
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,658
Gosh, it's scorching hot.
Let's go somewhere cooler.

352
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,577
I like the wind. Let's just stay here.

353
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,412
Did you just talk back?

354
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,165
No, I just shared my opinion.

355
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,547
What is it?

356
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,008
I was having breakfast.

357
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,136
Then your despicable face
popped into my head, so I came.

358
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,305
You haven't changed at all.

359
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,348
Of course.

360
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,685
I'm still beautiful and perfect.

361
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,064
Even without you,
I've been eating and sleeping well.

362
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm doing great.

363
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,484
Are you here to gloat?

364
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,320
I wondered what you were up to,

365
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,447
but you're still a doctor.

366
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,783
This is all I know.

367
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,328
I have to earn a living
and help out my father.

368
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,082
Right. So why leave everything behind
and suffer like this?

369
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,584
Please don't be so mean.

370
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,878
Are you talking back to me again?

371
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,882
Why did you really come here?

372
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,176
If you're here to pick a fight with me,

373
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,178
don't ever come again.

374
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,346
Wait!

375
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,892
I came all the way here.
You should at least buy me dinner.

376
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,438
I have my piano lesson after work.

377
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,400
-Piano?
-I bet you didn't know I played the piano.

378
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,651
Seriously?

379
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,280
I've finally realized what my issues are
thanks to someone

380
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,241
I met recently.

381
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,618
Never saying what I was thinking

382
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,164
and never sharing my feelings candidly.

383
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,124
-So?
-So,

384
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,713
I'm going to be honest for a change.

385
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,007
Oh Yeong-ju!

386
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,885
Your suit, purse, shoes, and hair.

387
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,096
They don't look good on you at all!

388
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,432
That's it.

389
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,647
Has he developed anger issues?

390
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,232
What's with him?

391
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,118
How many of the same sets did he buy?

392
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,246
LA LA

393
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,415
-Jun!
-I'm not here to see you.

394
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,251
I came during my break to make sure
you got everything done.

395
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,504
Oh, that.

396
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,547
The floor, the dishes, and the sheets.

397
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,466
Yes, I was just about to get on it.

398
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,552
I knew it. This is why I came to check.

399
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,763
-What about my sheets?
-I'm doing it now.

400
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:08,061
Hey, are you seriously calling that
making the bed?

401
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,774
You sound like
Cinderella's mean stepmother.

402
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,485
I brought you lunch. Eat it if you want.

403
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,903
Thanks, Jun!

404
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,534
Eat slowly.

405
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,830
I'm off.

406
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,623
Already?

407
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,583
I said I was stopping by during my break.

408
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,751
Okay.

409
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,670
Wait, Jun.

410
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,298
Why did you buy two
of the same face cream?

411
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,844
Is it so I can leave one at home
and the second one here?

412
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,345
Thanks so much.

413
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,556
You have the same one?

414
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,225
You left it at the door for me,
didn't you?

415
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,228
No, I didn't.

416
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,356
Then who left it there?

417
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,216
JIN BEAUTY SALON

418
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,385
Where's he going?

419
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,774
JIN BEAUTY SALON
LALA PIANO LAND

420
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,194
"LaLa Land"?

421
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,779
LALA PIANO LAND

422
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,156
What a lame name.

423
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,034
Goodness, this is ridiculous.

424
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,911
Do you want to learn piano?

425
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,746
No, I'm not interested.

426
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,373
ORMES
GUCCA

427
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,545
Then what are you doing here?

428
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,673
I don't think I've seen you before
in this neighborhood.

429
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,051
JIN BEAUTY SALON

430
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,803
I'm here to get my hair done.

431
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,930
Wait, hold on!

432
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,556
Come on in.

433
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,767
My gosh, you're very pretty.

434
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,560
What would you like? Coffee or tea?

435
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,853
Or do you want ice cream?

436
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,359
All right.
What would you like to get done?

437
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,528
A perm, new hair color, or haircut?

438
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,239
Just tell me what you want to get done.

439
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,993
Just a blow-dry.

440
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,747
My gosh, blow-drying is my specialty.
How did you know?

441
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:37,252
I can make you look 5cm taller
with your hairstyle alone.

442
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,510
Gosh, the piano sounds so nice.

443
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,845
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

444
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,264
Are there many talented students
at that academy?

445
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,933
That's probably the teacher playing.

446
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,143
I think she only has
two or three students.

447
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,605
-The teacher is a woman?
-Yes.

448
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,606
Is she pretty?

449
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,194
Well, she's pretty cute.

450
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,445
But objectively speaking,

451
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,573
I'm prettier than her.

452
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,117
I see.

453
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,147
That was awful, right?

454
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,941
You said you hadn't played for years.
How did you do that?

455
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:45,862
I played this in a competition as a kid,
so I think my fingers still remember it.

456
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,573
You know how many times
you have to practice one piece.

457
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:52,619
Right, you must practice
over and over again.

458
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:57,248
You can play the piano so well.
Why did you become a doctor?

459
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,460
Because I was too smart.

460
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,546
I was good at piano,
but I was even better at studying.

461
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,132
Frankly, I was good at everything.

462
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,303
Besides, my parents wanted me to study.

463
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,890
You're a BSO.

464
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,644
-What?
-You're a BSO.

465
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,562
A bit of a show-off.

466
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,108
It's been ages since someone
gave me a nickname.

467
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,028
I'll treasure this nickname
for a long time.

468
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,156
Okay, Mr. BSO.

469
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,368
The left hand is more important
when playing this piece by Chopin.

470
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,537
Your left hand isn't quite there yet,
so you have to practice more.

471
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,997
And keep the accents in mind.

472
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,207
Also…

473
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,545
It's not like you're going
to major in piano now.

474
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,674
Why don't you just play the piano
as a hobby on your own?

475
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,594
I think I have nothing to teach you.

476
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:56,391
Honestly, I just want to tell you to come
and play when you want to as a hobby.

477
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,184
Listen, young lady.

478
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:02,021
You have to be determined
if you want to save money.

479
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,607
If you're too compassionate
and considerate,

480
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,276
you'll never earn any money.

481
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,822
But I'm still going to make you pay
for the lessons.

482
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,574
Yes, I'll make sure I always pay on time.

483
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,660
How about we have dinner together
after this?

484
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,744
Sure!

485
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,006
-What is this?
-Do you like it?

486
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,133
Are you blind or what?

487
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,510
Can't you see how upset I look right now?

488
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,054
I guess you absolutely love it.

489
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,850
It sounds like you live in Seoul.

490
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,687
How did you hear about my salon?

491
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,940
Well, maybe I saw a post about it
on social media.

492
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,275
My gosh!

493
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,403
Who's advertising my salon
without my permission?

494
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,739
-My goodness.
-Shush!

495
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,867
I don't hear the piano.

496
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,078
Is the lesson over already?

497
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,380
Wait, ma'am. Here's your change!

498
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,216
Thank you.

499
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,010
See you again!

500
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,346
LALA PIANO LAND

501
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,266
Gosh, where did he go?

502
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,774
-Let's go somewhere else.
-Why? Jun works here.

503
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,111
I was here earlier.

504
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,073
-Oh, you're here.
-Hi.

505
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,700
-Oh.
-What? Why are you here, mister?

506
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,659
Hi.

507
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,252
Why must we sit like this?

508
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,214
We always eat like this
while looking at Jun.

509
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,049
Shall I say this is our rule?

510
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,884
But Jun hates it.

511
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,640
You have a new fan club member.
The man in the suit.

512
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,891
Wasn't he here earlier?

513
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,267
Yes.

514
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,312
I could tell from the way
he was looking at you.

515
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,980
He's totally smitten.

516
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,066
I told you, it's not a fan club.

517
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,610
How was the exam?

518
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,071
Come on, seriously?
I bombed it, of course.

519
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,656
Good for you.

520
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,616
You're a doctor. Did you get good grades?

521
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,744
Of course.
For me, nothing was easier than studying.

522
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,539
Gosh, what a show-off.

523
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,291
Hey, this is obviously why

524
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,918
-he's still single.
-Totally.

525
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,336
I've been married.

526
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,380
I got married and then got divorced.

527
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,968
Gosh, mister.
Did you really have to bring it up

528
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,262
while eating a sandwich
with high schoolers?

529
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,514
Hey, you're putting him on the spot.

530
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:45,434
You're cool. I like you, Dr. Cha.

531
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,396
Yes, you're pretty cool.

532
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,605
So cool.

533
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,028
What's so funny?

534
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,281
Jun, are you done for the day?

535
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,159
By the way, it turns out he's divorced.

536
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,788
Let's go. I have something to tell you.

537
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,836
Jun, let's talk.

538
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,296
About what?

539
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,673
I can't talk
if you're not going to listen.

540
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,383
I had no idea.

541
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,095
Of course. I never told you.

542
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,891
It's not like I walk around
with a sign saying "Divorced."

543
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,937
Jun. I said let's talk!

544
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,482
Okay. What is it? Go on, talk.

545
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,193
I'll confess my feelings for you.

546
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,406
Jun, take me to the toilet.
I really need to go.

547
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,533
What? Go by yourself.

548
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,203
You didn't know?
I can't go to the bathroom alone.

549
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,412
What the hell?

550
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,289
Please, I really need to go.

551
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,957
Take me to the bathroom. Please?

552
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,168
Come on. Let's go.

553
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,003
-Okay, let's go.
-Thanks.

554
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,632
Darn it!

555
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,141
They're such interesting kids.

556
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,478
They're unstoppable.

557
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,151
What? My gosh.

558
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,323
What's this

559
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,575
doing here?

560
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:31,207
No sender or recipient's name.

561
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,254
How pretty.

562
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,052
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

563
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,553
Seung-gi ruined everything.

564
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,930
We're home.

565
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,181
Flowers!

566
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,683
What are the flowers for?

567
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,311
I don't know.
Someone left them in front of the door.

568
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,646
Can it be…

569
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:58,192
Does someone have a secret crush on me?

570
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,987
Who'd have a crush
on an old lady like you?

571
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,655
I'm still a woman!

572
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,325
Hold on, Ra-ra.

573
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,537
Maybe it's from
your twinkle, twinkle, little star.

574
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,373
Hey, check your social media page.

575
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,837
Let's see.

576
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,880
Oh? But I don't have any messages.

577
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,799
Really?

578
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,926
Then who sent the flowers?

579
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:47,408
Grow quickly so that
you can be on the salad plate soon.

580
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,543
I wonder if your big sister
got home safely.

581
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,217
Should I call her?

582
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:12,516
ARE YOU SLEEPING?

583
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,311
DID YOU GET HOME SAFELY?

584
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,692
THANKS FOR YESTERDAY

585
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,322
Shall I call her?

586
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,159
Okay, let's call her.

587
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,213
Why is he still up?

588
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:43,923
Hello?

589
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,259
It's me.

590
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:48,928
Who?

591
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,722
I can't tell who you are
from your voice alone.

592
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,142
I think the guitar might help me
figure it out.

593
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,645
You're still up?

594
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,689
Oh, I was debating whether to wash
my face before going to bed.

595
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,192
You could've washed your face
in that time.

596
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,570
I actually had something to tell you.
I'm glad you called.

597
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,197
What? Is something wrong?

598
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,949
My car is finally ready for pickup.

599
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,244
They called me.
You'll come with me, right?

600
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,287
Of course, that car is practically mine.

601
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,706
Have you forgotten
that it's the collateral?

602
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,458
No, I haven't forgotten.

603
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,169
Just tally up everything I owe you.

604
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,588
-Sure thing.
-By the way, why did you call?

605
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,427
Oh, well…

606
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,095
I called because…

607
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,556
I mean…

608
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,601
I called because…

609
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:41,730
Have a good night.

610
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,150
You're so shy.

611
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,485
Why is it so hard for you to say that?

612
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,655
Have a good night.

613
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,031
Good night.

614
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,951
Have a good night. Good night.

615
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,828
I'm so good at it.

616
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,163
Goodness.

617
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,332
Gosh, I'm suddenly so tired.

618
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,834
I'm not going to wash my face.

619
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,627
Good night, Jun. See you tomorrow!

EUNPO PORT

624
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,373
I want updates.
What have you been doing to find him?

625
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,587
I'm originally from here,
so I sent out my guys to find him.

626
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,088
We're checking the terminal

627
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,341
-since he probably took the bus--
-Wait!

628
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,677
Do not distribute flyers.

629
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,679
My husband must not find out.

630
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,266
Be speedy but discreet.
No one can find out about this.

631
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,144
-Sure thing, ma'am. Also…
-What is it?

632
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,563
I hired more people,
so I need to charge you more.

633
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,065
Jeez.

634
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,028
You should say that
after you find something.

635
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,656
Anything, even the littlest clue!

636
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,449
What have you even done until now?

637
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,459
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

638
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,004
Aren't you leaving?

639
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,881
Yes, ma'am.

640
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,474
Damn it, that woman…

641
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,769
If I didn't need the money, I would just…

642
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,444
Hey, Jun. It's okay. Take your time.

643
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,905
I'm going to get some juice. Okay.

644
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,032
-Here's your juice.
-Thank you.

645
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,659
-Iced coffee, please.
-Sure.

LALA PIANO LAND

647
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,752
Are you interested in learning piano?

LALA PIANO LAND

649
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,644
Here's your coffee.

650
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,107
It's never too late to learn something.

651
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,444
Even a man in his 80s
is learning piano from me.

652
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,488
Miss.

653
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:40,117
Look at my face. Do I look like
I'd be interested in learning piano?

654
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,497
You do look like
you'd smash the piano to pieces.

655
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,382
Boss, someone saw him
at this terminal about two months ago.

656
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,800
Wait there. I'm coming.

657
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,511
Give it back then.

658
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,976
Why take it back?

659
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,436
Because you'll throw it away.

660
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,272
Let go. Give it back. What if I call you?

661
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,815
I know you won't.

662
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,612
I will be sure to call you.

663
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,365
I will come find you.

664
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,456
The lesson costs 100,000 won!

665
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,166
It's 100,000 won.

666
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,139
Why talk to a stranger? It's dangerous.

667
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,142
Well, let's just call it
my aggressive sales tactic.

668
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,483
Please come.

00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,402
EUNPO TERMINAL

670
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,861
Are you sure it was him?

671
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,698
He was wearing a hat that day.

672
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,080
We didn't receive any lost articles today.

673
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,291
It sounds like you got pick-pocketed.

674
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,460
You should report
your lost credit card first.

675
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,298
This has been happening
pretty often lately.

676
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,136
You'll report it, right?
This is where the police station is.

677
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,848
It's okay. Thank you.

678
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,810
Most people would report it to the police,

679
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,228
but he just left.

680
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,815
I remember him
because I thought it was quite unusual.

681
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,167
-Here are your keys.
-Thank you.

682
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,378
It's so good to see you again, Juju.

683
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,798
You did great.

684
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:00,841
Juju?

685
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,469
Did I not tell you the name of my car?

686
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,512
Ra-ra, Mimi, and Juju.

687
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,181
We're like the Three Musketeers.

688
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,142
Do you want to drive Juju?

689
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,313
-I don't have a license.
-You still don't have one?

690
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,523
Then I'll drive. Get in!

691
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,653
My dad bought me this car
when I got into college.

692
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:26,283
He said a few times that
he would get me a new car, but I said no.

693
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,994
-Why?
-Because I'm so attached to Juju.

694
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,126
-Do you know what this is?
-No.

695
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,129
It's supposed to prevent accidents.
My dad made this.

696
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,176
Dad, come on.
I'll be embarrassed if anyone sees that.

697
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,931
Why would you be embarrassed?
Don't lose it.

698
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,225
It shows you how much I worry about you.

699
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:56,772
Thanks to this, you, Mimi, and I only
suffered minor injuries. Do you agree?

700
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:58,982
Yes.

701
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,360
I do.

702
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,945
All right, let's go.

703
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,539
I'm good enough to be a racer, right?

704
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:15,499
Nonsense.

705
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,544
You can't drive,
so you don't know how good I am.

706
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,546
I could totally be a world-famous racer.

707
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,259
You're so attached to this car.
Will you really sell it?

708
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,136
Come on. I'm not completely shameless.

709
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:32,182
I'm hugely indebted to someone who
couldn't even afford to go to high school.

710
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,852
I'll pay you back quickly and move out.

711
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,107
But give me just one more day.

712
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,442
Sure.

713
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,659
Gosh, that lunatic.

714
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,954
Why would she sleep in her car?

715
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,915
Why not? I can totally relate to it.

716
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,209
You girls are two peas in a pod.

717
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,503
Wake her up! Goodness.

718
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,879
Gosh.

719
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,430
Ha-yeong.

720
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,649
I wasn't worried about you.

721
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,360
I just wanted to see
what it's like to sleep in a car,

722
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,945
so don't get the wrong idea.

723
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,504
Ha-yeong.

724
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,800
Thanks for being by my side
on my last night with Juju.

725
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,971
I said, don't get the wrong idea.

726
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,436
So? How much can you get if you sell Juju?

727
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,896
I'll get 15 million won.

728
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,900
I think it'll be enough to pay Jun back
and pay my rent.

729
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:05,984
Good.

730
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,555
Okay, it's all done.

731
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:39,976
I need your vehicle registration card,
certificate of registered seal, and ID.

732
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,770
Great. Thank you.

733
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,106
And your ID? Perfect.

734
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,318
Here you go.

735
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,487
Please check the amount

736
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,657
and sign at the bottom.
Then I'll send you the money right away.

737
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,368
ASSIGNOR

738
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:01,873
Sir, please make sure
you sell it to a good person.

739
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,835
Yes, I heard you.
You've already said that numerous times.

740
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,963
Don't worry. Just sign it.

741
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:16,722
ASSIGNOR

742
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:20,475
Jun?

743
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,895
She's not selling this car.

744
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,443
You can take your time
and pay me back later.

745
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,864
Really? But still--

746
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,073
Instead,

747
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,200
be my driver from now on.

748
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,118
Your driver?

749
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,579
As in drive you everywhere?

750
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,331
You said your dream is to eat prime beef.

751
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,543
I've always dreamed of getting
my own driver.

752
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,463
-What?
-Dreams don't have to be grand.

753
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,673
You can dream of whatever you want.

754
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,594
Dreams don't have to be grand.
You can dream of whatever you want.

755
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,805
But you have to pick me up right away
whenever I call you.

756
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,806
Okay?

757
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,687
Ms. Gu, I want to go for a drive.

758
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,231
Sure thing, sir. Where to?

759
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,451
Be honest with me.

760
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,662
You want me to be your driver
to get your revenge, don't you?

761
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,957
What? For real?

762
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,585
Did you tell me to keep the car
to boss me around?

763
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,755
Well…

764
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,091
It's sad to lose something

765
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,093
you cherish,

766
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,263
so I told you to keep it.

767
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,644
Remember the dear friend of mine

768
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,396
I told you about the other day?

769
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,857
The one who did the accompaniment.

770
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,900
Yes.

771
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,946
He died.

772
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,597
Jun.

773
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,352
You should just cry when you're sad.

774
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:29,980
Cry all you want

775
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,649
and start over.

776
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:39,197
Cry and let it all out today
so that you can start over tomorrow.

777
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,142
Why are you crying?

778
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,728
I don't know.

779
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:13,315
I'm sad because you're crying.

780
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,728
Dr. Cha!

781
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,397
Oh, hello.

782
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,858
You're going to work early today?

783
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,986
I have to go to Seoul
to take care of something.

784
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:06,201
By the way, didn't Ra-ra say
she was selling this car?

785
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,744
Oh, Jun told her to keep it.

786
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:11,164
He told her
that she could pay him back later

787
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,124
and that she should just keep the car.

788
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,459
I see.

789
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,711
That's good.

790
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:17,921
-Oh, your hair…
-Sorry?

791
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,507
-My gosh.
-Let me fix your hair.

792
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,716
Here.

793
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,010
Goodness.

794
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,762
-Gosh.
-I'll make you 5cm taller.

795
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,224
There, it's done.

796
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,726
Thank you. Have a good day.

797
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,651
My gosh.

798
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,654
I even love the way he walks.

799
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,243
TREATMENT ROOM 3

SUNWOO HOSPITAL

801
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,421
Hello.

802
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,381
Eun-seok!

803
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:03,758
Eun-seok!

804
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,011
Eun-seok.

805
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,554
Hey.

806
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,183
What's going on?

807
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,144
What brings you to our hospital?

808
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,563
I'm here to see Dr. Park.

809
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,273
Dr. Park Chun-ho in Neurosurgery?

810
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:19,399
-Yes.
-Why?

811
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,444
Nothing important.
I have something to ask him.

812
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,531
Are you still very busy?

813
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,075
I always have a lot to do.

814
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,161
I'm busy because
I have to go on blind dates.

815
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,204
You haven't changed one bit.

816
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,706
Sorry to take up your time.

817
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,541
Thanks for this. I'm off.

818
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:39,294
Come on. You can stay and hang out.

819
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,129
Gosh, you're so impatient.

820
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,429
SHARING HOPE BY GIVING

821
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,897
What is it?
Do you recognize someone in the photo?

822
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,691
By any chance,

823
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,612
do you know this guy?

824
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:15,371
His dad's the director. The only son
of the Sunwoo Foundation family.

825
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,167
My mom said he goes to

826
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,670
a prestigious high school known
for sending many students to med school.

827
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,633
They want him to become a doctor
before taking over the foundation.

828
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,259
I heard he gets very good grades.

829
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,095
I think he's in 12th grade.

830
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:33,139
Twelfth grade?

831
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,527

833
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,047
-You're here.
-Hey.

834
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,435
Why did you stop?

835
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,105
Jun, you look a little strange today.

836
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:23,606
What do you mean?

837
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,658
What are you doing?

838
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:42,000
You look like you've grown taller
in the past few days.

839
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,588
Do men grow taller even at the age of 24?

840
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,299
What's with that face?

841
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:53,011
Is there a reason the director's son
can't be a high school senior?

842
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,848
Gosh, stay still.

843
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,560
This way, we can check again next month.

844
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,905
Hurry up, will you?

845
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,448
Okay.

1 YEAR AGO, SEOHAN COLLEGE OF MUSIC
GRADUATION RECITAL

847
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,127
I'm sorry.

848
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,254
Gosh.

849
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,259
My apologies.

850
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:18,972
Thanks.

851
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,270
Have we met before?

852
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,217
Gosh, what am I thinking?

853
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,218
I'm losing my mind.

854
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,970
We both have secrets.

855
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:03,016
I lied, and you hid the truth.
That's also deception, isn't it?

856
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,101
So we can each decide

857
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,561
when to tell her.

858
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:10,481
By the way, why do you
only play that song when he's here?

859
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,192
Because it's a welcome song for him.

860
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,695
Even you know, but he has no idea.

861
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,656
Ra-ra, how would you feel
if I suddenly disappeared

862
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,158
someday?
