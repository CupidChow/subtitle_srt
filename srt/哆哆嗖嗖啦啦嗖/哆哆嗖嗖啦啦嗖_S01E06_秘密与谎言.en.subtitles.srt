00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,628
-Take it easy.
-Bye!

3
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,101
I'll get going, then.

4
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,687
Why are you in such a rush to leave?

5
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,856
Are you seeing someone?

6
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,274
No, I have

7
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,359
my piano lesson.

8
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,944
What? Piano?

9
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,452
Piano? That's random.

10
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,957
This looks like romaine lettuce.

11
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,168
This is red leaf lettuce.

12
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,921
And this is kale.

13
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,133
Mimi, it looks like
Jun wants to be a farmer.

14
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,511
Why did he plant so many?

15
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:45,104
You know, you can't eat these, okay?

16
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,732
If you do, people will call you a bad dog.
Understand?

17
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,360
Don't eat these
even if you're starving, okay?

18
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,569
But you can smell them.

19
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,281
My gosh, it's already…
Let's get ready to welcome Jun.

-You're here.
-Hey.

24
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,316
What is it?

25
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,359
Jun, you look a little strange today.

26
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,695
What do you mean?

27
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,871
What are you doing?

28
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,962
You look like you've grown taller
in the past few days.

29
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,674
Do men grow taller even at the age of 24?

30
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,513
Why did I lie to you that day?

31
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,432
-How old are you?
-I'm 24.

32
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,064
We're the same age.

33
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,191
I thought

34
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,486
-we'd never cross paths again.
-Gosh, stay still.

35
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,156
This way, we can check again next month.

36
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,787
Had I known we'd become this close…

37
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,622
Hurry up, will you?

38
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,540
Okay.

39
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,424
Had I known I'd start feeling this way…

40
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,649
Are you okay?

41
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,527
Oh, no!

42
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,153
My gosh.

43
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,408
You're bleeding.

44
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,035
Gosh, sorry. I'm so sorry.

45
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,789
You know, this is the second time.

46
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,624
I'm really sorry, Jun.

47
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,835
Does it hurt a lot?

48
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,016
Jun doesn't like to talk about himself.

49
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,600
He said he has no family.

50
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,563
To tell you the truth,
he seems to have a lot of secrets.

51
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,733
His dad's the director. The only son
of the Sunwoo Foundation family.

52
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,443
Jun's age?

53
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,361
We're the same age. Why do you ask?

54
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,031
I think he's in 12th grade.

55
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,868
He goes to a prestigious high school known
for sending many students to med school.

SECRETS AND LIES

57
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,795
Gosh, what am I thinking?

58
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,256
I'm losing my mind. I must be going crazy.

59
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,802
My goodness.

60
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,728
"Don't be distracted…"

61
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,564
And clean the floor and fridge.

62
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,984
How did he know that I'd be distracted?

63
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,695
Did he put up cameras to watch what I do?

64
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,615
Jeez, there's nothing to watch.

65
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,535
Here's some iced coffee for you ladies.

66
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,870
Is the rerun of The Great Traitor on now?

67
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,372
Which channel was it? Put it on.

68
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,624
I missed it last week.
I'm dying to watch it.

69
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,918
Is Min-gyeong in jail now?

70
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,671
-Come on.
-She was released a long ago.

71
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,756
She got out and bought a new identity.

72
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,175
And she has already seduced three men.

73
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,510
-Really?
-That's right.

74
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,720
The tall guy, the rich guy,

75
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,972
and… Who's the last one?

76
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:15,059
Come on! That ridiculously handsome guy!

77
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,520
-All the guys love her.
-Among them,

78
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,730
my favorite is the rich one.

79
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,234
My gosh, I like the tall guy better.

80
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,988
Whatever. I only care about looks.

81
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,489
My pick is that handsome guy!

82
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,409
So she's busy dating.

83
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,286
When's she going to get her revenge?

84
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,955
Come on.
We've watched enough dramas to know

85
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,082
that the revenge plot is only revealed

86
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,586
halfway through the series
in the case of daily dramas.

87
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,672
-We're obviously not there yet.
-Sure, okay.

88
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,593
Why don't you go write one
if you know so much about dramas?

89
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,039
Mr. Handsome.

90
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,543
Hello.

91
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,338
Can I get a haircut now?

92
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,340
-Of course. Have a seat.
-Thank you.

93
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,259
-Over here.
-This way.

94
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,344
Have a seat.

95
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,182
What kind of cut?

96
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:02,416
When do guys stop growing taller?

97
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,336
"For men,
the growth plates generally close

98
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,838
between the ages of 16 to 18.

99
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,883
Usually, by the time they're
in their second year of high school."

100
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,556
THOSE WITH OPEN GROWTH PLATES
CAN KEEP GROWING

101
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,683
IT VARIES DEPENDING ON THE PERSON

102
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,851
It varies?

103
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,986
I'll give you a trendy haircut.

104
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,362
Sure.

105
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:36,242
All right, let's see.

106
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,797
-Gosh!
-Holy jeez!

107
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,426
Why do you keep barging in
through the wall?

108
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,177
Gosh, I bit my tongue.

109
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,847
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

110
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,557
I didn't know there was a customer.

111
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,143
Ms. Jin,
when did you seal off the wall again?

112
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,060
Oh, gosh.

113
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,438
Why did you break the wall this time?

114
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,356
-Our Mr. Handsome--
-Hey!

115
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,983
You startled the customer too.

116
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,277
I was just really curious about something.

117
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,488
What are you so curious about
that you had to run in here?

118
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,367
Do you know when men stop growing taller?

119
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,579
-That's what you were curious about?
-My husband said

120
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,165
he kept growing
even when he was in the military.

121
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,374
The military?

122
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,630
I see. I guess some men
keep growing well into their 20s.

123
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,632
Suk-gyeong.

124
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,592
Suk-gyeong!

125
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,510
What's wrong? Why are you all quiet?

126
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,180
What? Oh, I was just…

127
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,641
Guys, you all know

128
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,478
that your hair grows
about 1cm a month, right?

129
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,314
What? That's so random.

130
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,483
That's so little.

131
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,442
Just 1cm?

132
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,902
That's it? 1cm?

133
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,071
-This is 1cm--
-Hey!

134
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,252
Gosh, you.

135
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,630
-I'm starving.
-Me too.

136
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,302
Let's just have ramyeon for dinner today.

137
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,637
Sure! I want bibim ramyeon.

138
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,972
-I want jjajang.
-I want the spicy one.

139
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,683
-Wait, I'm cooking?
-Didn't you hear?

140
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,686
I'm still traumatized
by the blunder I made earlier today.

141
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,480
I have no energy left.

142
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,941
-Shall I cook?
-No, don't. Never cook.

143
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,067
Don't waste ramyeon.

144
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,278
Right? It'd be better
to leave it up to the expert.

145
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,947
"Expert"?

146
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,465
-This feels rewarding.
-Hey, thanks!

147
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,092
-You're the best.
-The best indeed!

148
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,053
-Ms. Jin.
-Yes?

149
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,681
What happened at the salon?
Why were you so upset?

150
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:49,518
I cut off a large chunk of hair
on the back of my customer's head.

151
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,978
What? Come again?

152
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,647
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

153
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,274
No, it's really okay.

154
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,818
I'll give you trims for free

155
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,779
until your hair grows out.

156
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:06,368
Here, take this.
And you can come back anytime.

157
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,621
If you feel that bad…

158
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,080
Sure, I'll do that.

159
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,959
Thankfully, he's such a nice person.

160
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,379
He never demanded an apology
or compensation. He didn't even complain.

161
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,174
Exactly. He seemed so nice.

The pom-pom.

165
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,716
Ha-yeong, you're so good at this.
Not just at hairstyling and makeup.

166
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,051
You have such a good eye.

167
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,303
Ra-ra, shall I put this here?

168
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:10,140
Yes! And write "LaLa Land" down here
in calligraphy.

169
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,144
Yes, that's it. It's so pretty.

170
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,069
Ha-yeong, I envy you.
Your boyfriend is so sweet.

171
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,573
He's not my boyfriend.
We're just friends, okay?

172
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,575
He's just a guy friend!

173
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,784
Isn't it the same thing?

174
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,370
-Right?
-My point exactly.

175
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,455

00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,876
I know what you're up to.

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,004
You'll blackmail me later on
with these embarrassing videos of me.

179
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,255
Do you have a death wish?

180
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,340
I had to beg my mom to buy this. Let go.

181
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,175
-Give it back. Now!
-Gosh, it hurts!

182
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,261
-Hey, give it back--
-Stop fighting!

183
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,888
Goodness gracious.

184
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,683
You've been fighting every day
for the past 12 years since you were 7.

185
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,644
What is this?
There's too much going on here.

186
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,396
A bag for the academy?

187
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,441
Yes, that and one of
LaLa Land's fan goods.

188
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,360
Good… What?

189
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,158
Like a special item available for sale.

190
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,994
Some will sign up just to get this bag.
Wait and see.

191
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,287
Yes!

192
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,372
You fools.

193
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,041
Who'd sign up just to get this?

194
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,419
Ms. Jin, kids these days
go to concerts, buy albums,

195
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,921
and wait in line all night

196
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,340
-to get special goods like this.
-Yes.

197
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,467
As if.

198
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,011
Why don't you just post some videos
on social media?

199
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,095
I'll do that too.

200
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,389
Oh, is that so?

201
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,976
Recently, I had a customer

202
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,771
who came all the way from Seoul

203
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,441
after seeing a post about my salon
on social media.

204
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,776
-What?
-No way. Seriously?

205
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,655
Yes. And she was wearing
designer brands only

206
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,406
from head to toe.

207
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,909
Mom, maybe something's wrong
with her eyesight.

208
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,328
You brat! How dare you?

209
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,540
Hey, can you also write
my student's name here? Cha Eun-seok.

210
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,584
Cha Eun-seok?

211
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,964
You mean our upstairs neighbor, Dr. Cha?

212
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,925
Yes! He's my second student.

213
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,969
My gosh.

214
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,225
You know, for some strange reason,

215
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,312
I suddenly want that bag too.

216
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,482
It actually looks pretty nice from afar.

217
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,988
Ra-ra, do you think

218
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,992
it's too late for me to learn piano?

219
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,034
Mom.

220
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,745
Don't you know
Park Myung-soo's famous quote?

221
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,832
-Which one?
-"If you think it's late,

222
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,584
it's way too late."

223
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,046
Gosh, you little brat.
You need a beating. Come here!

224
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,756
-Gosh, no!
-Come here!

225
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,591
-How dare you!
-That hurts!

226
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,135
The kitchen's closed.

227
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,763
I'm saying you came too late.

228
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:00,477
Hey, Jun! We can always make an exception.

229
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,855
He comes here every day, you know.

230
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,690
Right?

231
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,859
Jun, move over.

232
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,986
I'll take your order, sir.

233
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,821
What would you like?

234
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,490
A cup of coffee
and one turkey sandwich, please.

235
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,217
May I take your plate if you're done?

236
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,808
I want to talk to you about something,

237
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,312
but I don't know where to begin.

238
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,731
So I was pondering on it.

239
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,735
Let's talk next time.

240
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,323
I'll leave these with you.

241
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,022
My apologies.

242
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,370
Thank you.

243
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,956
Have we met before?

244
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:05,769
SUNWOO JUN

245
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,480
"The best."

246
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,734
THE BEST

247
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,944
This is so pretty.

248
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,030
I wonder what Jun is up to now.

249
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,161
Hey, Jun!

250
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,042
HEY, JUN

251
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,129
Is he already asleep?

252
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,965
Did he get an overnight job
without telling me?

253
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,259
Jun, are you asleep?

254
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,931
Hello?

255
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,813
This has never happened before.

256
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,069
Is he mad at me
because of the nosebleed yesterday?

257
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,447
You'll pay for this.

258
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,157
You'll pay for this.

259
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,618
I'm going to get back at you!

260
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,287
No, no way.

261
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,709
Is he upset because
I didn't clean properly today?

262
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,338
I told you to clean!

263
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,923
You little…

264
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,842
No, he should be used to it by now.

265
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,183
I know he said
I could pay him back later on,

266
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,853
but maybe he didn't really mean it.

267
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,569
Gu Ra-ra. I want my money back.

268
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,197
Pay me back!

269
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,573
Give me back my money!

270
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,993
Gosh.

271
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,204
No! Jun wouldn't do that to me.

272
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,709
Respond, over.

273
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,544
RA-RA
RESPOND, OVER

274
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:04,388
I want to talk to you about something,
but I don't know where to begin.

275
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,555
Let's talk next time.

276
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,184
Does he remember me?

277
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,020
Or,

278
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,773
does he know something about me?

279
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,948
EUNPO YUNSEUL HOSPITAL

280
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,043
What brings you here so early?

281
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,633
You remember me now, don't you?

282
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,559
There's more.

283
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,936
I've found out a lot more about you.

284
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,817
I happened to spot you in a photo
at Sunwoo Hospital.

285
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,741
Why did you run away?

286
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,207
-Have a good day at work.
-Can you call Jun?

287
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,376
Now?

288
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,338
I can't. He's in class now.

289
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,886
Why is it so hard to see him these days?
Tell him to stop by this weekend.

290
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,722
Oh, his exams are coming up soon.

291
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,099
He's doing fine at the dorm.

292
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,062
If we call and bother him,
he'll bomb his exams.

293
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,606
I'm sure he'll stop by after his exams.

294
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,649
Be patient, please.

295
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,111
We have to bend over backwards
so he can study.

296
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,956
This is driving me nuts.

297
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,840
I don't think I'm obligated
to tell you the reason.

298
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,343
That's true.

299
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,595
Will you tell my parents that I'm here?

300
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,808
Well, I'm not sure
if I need to go that far.

301
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,982
But I guess that could change
depending on the situation.

302
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,238
If I contact your parents,

303
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,073
will you run away again?

304
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,790
I don't really know what happened to you.

305
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,291
But all things aside,

306
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,212
I think you should tell Ra-ra the truth.

307
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,381
That you're a high schooler.

308
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,929
What you're doing is "deception."

309
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,098
You're telling lies

310
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,309
and hiding the truth to fool someone.

311
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,979
It's more hurtful than anything else.

312
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,897
It destroys

313
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,025
one's good faith in the world.

314
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,741
-Have you always been a big eater?
-No, you're just a great cook.

315
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,451
-I am, aren't I?
-Yes, totally!

316
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,828
You're an amazing cook.

317
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,247
-Oh?
-What?

318
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,416
Who's that boy?

319
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,711
Goodness. You're really not observant.

320
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,421
You haven't noticed him before?

321
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,007
He always hovers around here.

322
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,341
Does he live around here?

323
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,719
I see him all the time.

324
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,763
-Really?
-Yes.

325
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,224
-Let's go.
-Okay.

326
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,934
JIN BEAUTY SALON

327
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,940
My gosh. What is this?

328
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,651
Gosh! What is going on here?

329
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,153
What's wrong?

330
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,738
-Gosh!
-Are you all right?

331
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,822
This is…

332
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,200
I smell some adhesive.

333
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,659
Who did this?

334
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,785
-Gosh!
-Who could it be?

335
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,579
What kind of bastard did this?

336
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:02,125
You asshole!
When I catch you, I'll break your wrists!

337
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,668
-Damn it!
-Hello.

338
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,505
-Hello.
-My gosh, hello.

339
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,091
Today, I'm actually here

340
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,093
for the academy.

341
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,013
To learn piano?

342
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:16,973
Yes.

343
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,486
SUNWOO JUN

344
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,403
CHA EUN-SEOK

345
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,586
Oh, right.
Choose what you'd like to drink.

346
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,965
Can I pick two?

347
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,800
You can even pick three.

348
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,472
So you're a total beginner,

349
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,391
and you want to learn it as a hobby.

350
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,143
There will be two lessons a week.

351
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,853
Tell me when is good for you--

352
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,563
Can I pay more and come every day?

353
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,065
Pardon?

354
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,443
Well, I don't see why not, but--

355
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,946
I'll get that bag too, right?

356
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,323
Yes, of course!

357
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,785
-Then when would you like--
-I want to start right away.

358
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,620
-You mean, right now?
-Yes.

359
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,708
-You're very passionate.
-Yes.

360
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,877
I'm sorry, but another student of mine
will be here any minute now.

361
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,963
I'm here, Ms. Gu.

362
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,840
There he is. Mr. Kim!

363
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,633
Oh, you have a guest.

364
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,219
Yes, he's my new student.

365
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,848
Then I'll come back tomorrow.

366
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,391
Have a good day.

367
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,901
My gosh, why won't it come off?

368
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,278
Where's your cooking oil?

369
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,864
It'll come off if you rub some oil on it.

370
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,782
What about you sprinkle some salt on it?

371
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,118
Goodness, stop being silly.

372
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,912
Where's the manicure kit?
Bring the nail polish remover.

373
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,748
-Will that work?
-Just watch.

374
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,665
Here you go.

375
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,334
-My goodness.
-Gosh!

376
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,336
-Does it hurt?
-Who did such a crazy thing?

377
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,628
I can't believe this.

378
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,089
-Shall we call the police?
-Come on.

379
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,718
Maybe someone hates you,
or you did something

380
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,429
to make someone hold a grudge against you.

381
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,430
No, I'd never!

382
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,476
How could you say that
when you've known me for 12 years?

383
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,271
-That's true.
-You said there's a boy who always

384
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,523
lurks around here.

385
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,609
Maybe that kid played a prank?

386
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,697
-Do, re…
-Seriously!

387
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,158
-Goodness gracious.
-Not again!

388
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:44,037
This is nuts.
We were shooting a detective movie here.

389
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,455
That can't be our soundtrack.

390
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,332
Wipe it off. You can be rough with it.

391
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,797
Mr. Kim, imagine you're holding an egg
in each hand

392
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,673
and place them on the keyboard.

393
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,425
Sit straight

394
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,010
and relax your shoulders.

395
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:03,014
And imagine that there's a volleyball
under each arm. Yes, that's it.

396
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,266
Mr. Kim, good posture is everything.

397
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,312
This note under the staff is a do.

398
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:14,401
It's the key in front of
those two black keys. Don't forget.

399
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,027
Okay, I won't forget.

400
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,280
It's very easy.

401
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:22,992
You see this?

402
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,994
Gosh, it's making me dizzy.

403
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,580
All I see are bean sprouts.

404
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,875
This is the song you want to play.

405
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:33,920
I see.

406
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:37,006
Even the sheet music
is so beautiful, isn't it?

407
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,430
I would never learn
to play the whole song at this rate.

408
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:48,435
Even I had to practice do and re
repeatedly at the very beginning.

409
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,561
You can do it!

410
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,400
Re, do.

411
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,194
Mr. Kim.

412
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,822
Have you seen Jun today?

413
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,781
No, I haven't.

414
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,159
He didn't come this morning.

415
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,536
Why? Did something happen?

416
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,830
No, it's nothing.

417
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,383
Hello.

418
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,020
He should be here now.

419
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,738
The phone is turned off.

420
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,492
Please leave a message after the tone.
Additional charges may apply.

421
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,827
Where is he?

422
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,543
-Come on.
-Hey!

423
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,087
It hurts! Get off me!

424
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,256
Hey!

425
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,390
-Hand it over!
-Not a chance!

426
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,851
Seriously. Ouch! Hey!

427
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:12,977
Let's go.

428
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,395
Jeez, I said I'm not going.

429
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,899
It's your dad's birthday.
You can't do this as his only son.

430
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,235
Gosh, you're a terrible son.

431
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,444
What will we do at home?

432
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,822
What do you think? Just follow me.

433
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,448
I don't want to. Gosh, seriously.

434
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,123
I knew it.

435
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,209
See? What did I tell you?

436
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,378
I said my parents were going
to a get-together.

437
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,921
I thought they'd be home early.

438
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,464
Whatever. This sucks.

439
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,424
You're such a jerk.

440
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,051
-I'm off.
-Where are you going?

441
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,719
Bye.

442
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,263
Sure, whatever.

443
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,932
See you tomorrow at the academy, or not.

444
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,436
Hey, Kim Ji-hun.

445
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,814
You're really leaving?

446
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,941
Jeez, he must be pissed off.

447
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,359
Kim Ji-hun!

448
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,195
Wait up, will you?

449
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,447
Don't give me that face again.

450
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,032
Can you try to smile a little?

451
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,909
Whatever. It's none of your business.

452
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,744
Jeez, you're unbelievable.

453
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,498
Hey, you're not even going to say goodbye?

454
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,252
Bye.

455
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,201
Bye.

456
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,627
KIM JI-HUN

457
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,263
You did so well.
You said you didn't even study.

458
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,933
-What is this? Sunwoo Jun!
-My gosh.

459
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,477
Jun got the highest marks
because Ji-hun is gone.

460
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,938
Right? He always came in second.
What's going on?

461
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,191
Hey, maybe this prick
got Ji-hun killed on purpose.

462
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,400
To be number one.

463
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,986
Goodness, that's too far-fetched.

464
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,738
You're an asshole.

465
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,781
Hey.

466
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,499
Stop.

467
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,417
Collect the exam papers.

468
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:42,919
Come on.

469
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,340
MATH
SUNWOO JUN

470
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,812
Honey! My gosh.

471
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,983
-A zero?
-Look at this punk.

472
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,610
I need to knock some sense into him.

473
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,571
I know your friend died,
but what's the big deal?

474
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,077
How could you say that?

475
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,415
If Ji-hun didn't come over that day
because of you…

476
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,916
Who told him to do it?

477
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,712
He came here of his own accord and died,
so it's on him!

478
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,005
Honey!

479
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,007
Gosh, just drop it.

480
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,800
Honey, that's enough.

481
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:34,470
When your job is to save people's lives,
you also deal with death often enough.

482
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,474
You can never do anything important
with such a weak mindset!

483
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,144
Like what?

484
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,564
You know, I don't care.

485
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,775
I won't do anything.

486
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,112
-Jun.
-You brat.

487
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,655
No! Honey, please.

488
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,866
-I must teach him--
-No. Just talk it out!

489
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,075
Jun.

490
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,330
Where did he go?

491
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,626
My gosh.

492
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,919
Did he…

493
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,131
Missus!

494
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,101
You're here again.

495
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:27,398
Ma'am, I told you that I'd call you
as soon as anything turned up.

496
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:31,194
You're making all of us uncomfortable
by coming here every day.

497
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,653
This is hard for you too.

498
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,905
It's because

499
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,201
this is the only thing I can do.

500
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,290
Have dinner with your team.

501
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,046
Ma'am, you can't give us any money!

502
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,048
Why are you doing this?

503
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,683
Will you tell my parents that I'm here?

504
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:07,396
If I contact your parents,
will you run away again?

505
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,942
Do I have to run away again?

506
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,036
Jun!

507
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,372
Jun!

508
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,964
I came here just to be sure.
I'm glad I did.

509
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,090
Have you been

510
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,467
looking for me?

511
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,470
You didn't text back,
and your phone's off.

512
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,597
Is something going on?

513
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,524
Come on. You can tell me.

514
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,822
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

515
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,783
How would you feel
if I suddenly disappeared

516
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,327
someday?

517
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,586
I'd be sad.

518
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,299
I see.

519
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,220
Why? Why do you want to disappear
out of the blue?

520
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,266
Someone's being troublesome.

521
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,143
Could it be me?

522
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,524
Is it that easy for you to move

523
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,568
just because there's someone
who annoys you?

524
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,614
Yes. That's how I am.

525
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,328
Can you give me some space
so I can be alone?

526
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,583
Okay.

527
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,943
Was I that troublesome?

528
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,571
He should've told me sooner.

529
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,619
HAPPY FLOWER SHOP

530
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,872
I saw him before.

531
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,707
Hey!

532
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,045
Hey!

533
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,798
Backpack Boy! Don't leave!

534
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,886
I won't scold you, so stop!

535
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,149
You're the kid
who took three rulers, right?

536
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,487
You want another one?

537
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,242
What's your name?

538
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,120
Jae-min. Shin Jae-min.

539
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,080
Jae-min? Shin Jae-min?

540
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,707
What a nice name.

541
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,627
Jae-min, why do you hover
around here lately?

542
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,424
Do you want to learn piano?

543
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,832
RA-RA: JUN, PICK UP.
13 MISSED CALLS FROM RA-RA

544
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,168
RA-RA: JUN, PICK UP.
13 MISSED CALLS FROM RA-RA

545
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,683
How do you know this piece?

546
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,851
I heard it.

547
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,687
You learned this piece by ear?

548
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,774
Have you learned the piano before?

549
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,152
Then do you have one at home?

550
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:29,325
There's a piano at school,
church, and the park.

551
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:36,374
You're like a gem that's been gifted
by the god of music, aren't you?

552
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,958
A gem?

553
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,961
I had so many friends like you growing up.

554
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,923
They call kids like you prodigies
or geniuses.

555
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,509
You're good too.

556
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,761
Me? Right, I am.

557
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,639
I'm good, but I'm not that special.

558
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,766
You're so lucky.

559
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,186
By the way, why do you only play that song

560
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,271
when he's here?

561
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,440
Did you notice?

562
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,404
Because it's a welcome song for him.

563
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,990
It's a song that welcomes someone

564
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,867
who's coming home from work.

565
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,286
It whispers and beckons to them.

566
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,665
Even you know, but he has no idea.

567
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,919
-You're here.
-Hey.

568
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:25,756
He always comes in looking sour. Then
he grabs some water and gulps it down.

569
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,426
That's not true.

570
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:44,400
First, he just trudges.

571
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,029
Once he hears the piano,

572
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,366
he walks faster and faster uphill.

573
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,912
Then he runs.

574
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,087
Once he arrives in front of the academy,

575
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,839
he takes a breath.

576
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,009
He wipes off the sweat
and tidies his hair.

577
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:13,596
Then he pretends like nothing happened
and opens the door.

578
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,737
Why was this in front of the door?

579
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,703
FLOWER

580
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:38,954
You're back.

581
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,791
Of course. This is my home.

582
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:47,379
You said back there that
you could disappear out of nowhere.

583
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,757
Well…

584
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,551
Don't disappear. Stay by my side.

585
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,723
Why?

586
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,101
I haven't paid you back yet.

587
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,230
I'm sure you already know,

588
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,524
but I hate being indebted to others.

589
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,109
So you better not go anywhere
until I pay you back.

590
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,946
And those. The lettuce and romaine.

591
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,198
Who'll be in charge
of growing all of them?

592
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,658
Were you going to make me do it?

593
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,329
I forgot about them.

594
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,123
I completely forgot about them.

595
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,209
I knew it. Those poor seedlings.

596
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,420
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

597
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,839
I won't disappear.

598
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,969
I'll be by your side.

599
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,225
Because my money is precious.

600
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,895
I'm going to make sure you pay me back.

601
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,817
I'm not going to bilk you.
Seriously, I'm not.

602
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,860
-Do you even know the sum?
-Of course.

603
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,780
Four… Five million… Six million…

604
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,782
Nine million won?

605
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,450
Was it seven million? Or eight?

606
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,838
GRAND PRIZE

607
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,365
I have something to say.

608
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,327
Okay.

609
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,043
A while back,

610
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,254
you said you had also attended

611
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,381
Ra-ra's wedding, right?

612
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,216
Right.

613
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,720
But she didn't even know
that you were there.

614
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,096
Were you the groom's guest?

615
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,806
Yes.

616
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,142
How do you know her ex-husband?

617
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,521
We went to the same university.

618
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,191
Why didn't you…

619
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,321
tell her that?

620
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,407
There was no need to.

621
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,703
I don't think so. You were afraid
she'd feel uncomfortable and avoid you.

622
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,668
You had your chance to tell her,
but you didn't.

623
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,295
You're right.

624
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,882
I lied, and you hid the truth.
That's also deception, isn't it?

625
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,805
-Is that so?
-We both have secrets.

626
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,973
So we can each decide

627
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,267
when to tell her.

628
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,887
Hello?

629
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,350
Jun.

630
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,729
Jun. Why aren't you saying anything?
Did something happen again?

631
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,525
I wanted to say good night.

632
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,571
It's so difficult for you
to say such simple words.

633
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,781
Okay, I'll sleep well.

634
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,616
Sing for me until I do.

635
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,201
No.

636
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:06,972
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

637
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:12,186
How I wonder what you are

638
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,024
Up above the world

639
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,112
Hello? Are you even listening?

640
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,953
JUN

641
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,550
The stress must've knocked her out again.

642
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,997
Mimi, you can do well, right?

643
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,833
I know you can. Shall we warm up?

644
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,545
All right.

645
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,464
Let me massage you.

646
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,049
Mimi, memorize the keys.

647
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,636
This is do.

648
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,932
This is mi. This is sol.

649
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,227
Got it? Mimi, play mi.

650
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,229
Play mi.

651
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,438
She must've gone crazy.

652
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,648
She doesn't seem sane.

653
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:40,816
Let her be.

654
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:44,152
She's going to promote her academy
with her dog.

655
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,613
Mimi, play do. Where's do?

656
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,533
Good. This time, play mi.

657
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,576
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

658
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,494
I don't think she can do it.

659
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,329
You must not know her well.

660
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,291
She's a genius dog. She can do anything.

661
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,293
You can test her if you want.

662
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,129
Really? Then I want her to dance
to TWICE's song.

663
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,631
-You?
-I want to see her use a phone.

664
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,174
Do you want to break the screen?

665
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,218
Look at her toenails. They're so sharp.

666
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,762
Really? What about you?

667
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,433
-What?
-What do you want to watch her do?

668
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,559
I'll pass.

669
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,395
You can't do that. Think of something.

670
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,480
Hurry up.

671
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,317
Factorization?

672
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,530
FACTORIZING
USING A PHONE

673
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,365
DANCING

674
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,409
He must be crazy too.

675
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,620
Isn't factorization

676
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,496
that thing we learn in math?

677
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,208
Since he didn't graduate from high school,
he must want to study more.

678
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,126
It's not like that.

679
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,630
Dr. Cha.

680
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,341
There are many guests.

681
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,302
What is this? Why are you here
on the weekend?

682
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,055
I'm here to eat with Ra-ra.

683
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,266
-If you're done, let's go.
-Okay.

684
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,102
Mimi, stay with Jun.

685
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,104
-Bye.
-Bye.

686
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,272
I'm coming too.

687
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,816
What? Then I'm coming as well.

688
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,526
Then I'll go too.

689
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,120
I don't know why
we're all sitting here together.

690
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,664
I like it.

691
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,707
We're all good-looking.

692
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,167
That's a lame reply.

693
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,920
I guess it is a bit strange.

694
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:29,049
You're a divorcé,
and your wedding got called off.

695
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,468
He and I have been friends
for a very long time.

696
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,261
And Jun

697
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,430
has always been single.

698
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,265
We have nothing in common.

699
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,935
You're right.
Dr. Cha went to graduate school.

700
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,728
She graduated from college.

701
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,939
You and I are in 12th grade.

702
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,982
Jun graduated from middle school.

703
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,859
It is odd.

704
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,488
-You guys knew?
-About what?

705
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,449
That Jun only graduated
from middle school?

706
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,410
-Yes.
-Yes.

707
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,455
Have you told them already?

708
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,500
That's all that they know, so be quiet.

709
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,044
What is it? Why are you guys so close?

710
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,088
What are you whispering about?

711
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,214
Nothing.

712
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:12,342
It's so hot today.
Should we buy some ice cream?

713
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,886
-Sure! I want melon.
-I want chocolate.

714
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,013
-I want vanilla.
-I want red bean.

715
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,391
Is it my treat again?

716
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:24,730
Here you go.

717
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,857
JOONGGUI MART

718
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,066
-Right, Ra-ra.
-Yes?

719
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,651
Isn't Dodosolsol…

720
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,821
You're going to meet

721
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,990
your twinkle, twinkle, little star
soon, right?

722
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,825
-Yes. It's tomorrow.
-Awesome.

723
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,410
Ra-ra, can I record you?

724
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,829
I'll record your historic moment.

725
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,914
You must come. Dr. Cha, you too.

726
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,918
Thanks for the invite,
but I have surgery scheduled tomorrow.

727
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,796
What about me?

728
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,758
Isn't it obvious?
Of course, you should come.

729
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,134
"Of course"?

730
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,386
Why? Why is that a given?

731
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:57,971
Because…

732
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,184
He lent me the most amount of money.

733
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,606
Hey, is that a valid reason?

734
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:10,066
Grown-ups are too difficult to understand.

735
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,033
Are you looking for a shirt?

736
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,077
Doesn't this look nice?

737
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,914
You look very young.

738
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:27,292
No. I want to look neat and tidy.

739
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,003
It must be a formal event.

740
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,216
There's a thin jacket made of linen.
Would you like to see it?

741
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,427
-Sure.
-Please wait here.

742
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:59,282
LET'S MEET HERE ON JULY 22 AT 5 P.M.

743
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,745
Thanks to you,
I've made some great friends

744
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,331
and am enjoying my life in this new place.

745
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:10,836
You've even given me a piano
and have supported me at all times.

746
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,921
Tomorrow, I'll get to finally meet you.

747
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:16,258
My heart flutters as I wonder about you.

748
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,635
I'll see you soon,
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

749
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,779
-Should I add more curls?
-Yes.

750
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,575
How should I do my makeup today?

751
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,953
Let's make you look cute and fresh.

752
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,329
You're the best!

753
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,601
-You're sure?
-Yes, sir.

754
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,729
Hello.

755
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,856
EUNPO TERMINAL

756
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,318
I'm positive.

757
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,986
I remember it clearly.

758
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,823
Had it not been for him,
Man-bok would've been long dead.

759
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,037
TWO MONTHS AGO

760
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,040
What's wrong with me?

761
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,673
-What? Sir.
-My gosh.

762
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,133
Oh, no!

763
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:41,384
-Sir!
-Are you okay?

764
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,677
Are you okay?

765
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,304
-Are you all right?
-Sir.

766
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,388
Goodness.

767
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,515
-Is his guardian here?
-Is he sick?

768
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,225
-Goodness.
-Call 911.

769
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,102
Does anyone know him?

770
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:54,022
Sir, do you have any medication?

771
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,444
NITROGLYCERIN: RELIEVES ANGINA

772
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,905
-Someone please call 911.
-Okay.

773
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,406
I'll call 911.

774
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,952
He was calm and quick,
so I thought he was a doctor.

775
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,079
But from up close, he looked very young.

776
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,873
Judging by his clothes,
he looked like a student.

777
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,418
You know that old man well?

778
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,920
Of course, I do.

779
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,673
He's been around here
for the past 30 years.

780
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,968
Then you must know where he lives.

781
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,357
I'm so nervous.

782
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,235
You're so silly. Why are you nervous?

783
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,820
Because I'm curious!

784
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,405
Don't yell at me.

785
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,324
It's time. Why isn't he here yet?

786
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,832
He's here.

787
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,252
He's just my type.

788
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,504
Is he a celebrity or what?

789
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,797
He's handsome and tall.

790
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,050
Look at his face. He's so handsome.

791
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,595
-He's handsome.
-He's so good-looking.

792
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,271
Babe.

793
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,985
He was already taken.

794
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,487
Of course.

795
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,365
When is he coming?

796
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,676
Wait. It was a woman?

797
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,971
Come to think of it, why didn't it
occur to us it might be a woman?

798
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,231
It really must be her.

799
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,400
Oh, my.

800
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,153
Excuse me.

801
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:06,738
Who are you?

802
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:09,574
-Yeong-ja.
-Hey.

803
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,744
-It's been ages.
-"Yeong-ja"?

804
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:13,995
Come sit down.

805
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,873
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

806
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,833
-She's Yeong-ja.
-You're prettier.

807
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,810
What? What is it?

808
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,492
EPILOGUE

809
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,412
Do, la, fa, mi

810
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,414
Do sharp, si

811
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:02,794
Mi, mi, mi

812
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,337
Not bad.

813
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,466
Hey, kid.

814
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,301
Are you a student here?

815
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:14,139
Goodness. Hey!

816
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,558
What was that?

817
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,690
Oh, my! You're back!

818
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:25,984
Well, I…

819
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,319
Why are you standing outside?

820
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,908
Well… I heard someone playing the piano,
so I was listening.

821
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,953
There's no one in there.

822
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,913
They all left a while ago.

823
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,791
That can't be. I definitely heard it.

824
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,673
Why are you looking at me like that?

825
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,508
I have an ear for music, you know?

826
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,596
I'm positive there's someone inside.

827
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,349
LALA PIANO LAND

828
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,353
It must've been a ghost.

829
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,031
A ghost?

830
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,576
Damn it.

831
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,579
"I hope the music from LaLa Land
will fill the entire world."

832
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,373
I had no idea.

833
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,750
Since when did you know me?

834
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:09,087
He's bound to go back
to where he belongs sooner or later.

835
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,964
Don't meddle in other people's affairs.

836
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:15,051
Jun! Do you have a crush on someone?

837
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,094
Yes.

838
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:19,556
You like Ra-ra, don't you?
I know it's none of my business,

839
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,849
but you should confess to her soon.

840
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,018
Dr. Cha and Ra-ra
might fall for each other.

841
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:36,698
EPILOGUE

842
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:49,210
A glass of fresh juice
always rejuvenates me.

843
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,920
I wanted to make it for you,

844
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,798
but since there's no blender,
I had to buy it. Enjoy.

845
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,388
La, la?

846
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,433
What a unique signature.

847
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,121
Should I buy a blender now?

848
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:34,297
