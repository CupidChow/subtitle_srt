00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,044
FLOWERS

2
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,596
Hi, Grandpa.

3
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:39,849
Now?

4
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,019
Okay, got it.

5
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,248
Mimi.

6
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,815
Hey.

7
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,404
Bye.

8
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,137
Hey, wake up.

9
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,306
Hey!

10
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,122
Is this 911? The location is…

11
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,087
EUNPO YUNSEUL HOSPITAL

12
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:41,804
EMERGENCY ROOM

13
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,775
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

14
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,777
We have a 24-year-old female TA patient.

15
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,413
TREATMENT ROOM

16
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,623
Excuse me.

17
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,542
Looks like
you should get that treated as well.

18
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,794
There's no need.

19
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,214
-What's your relationship to the patient?
-Accident victim.

20
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,425
Then you should be examined
and receive proper treatment.

21
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,678
You may feel fine
after the accident, but--

22
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,972
I said I'm fine. Leave me alone, will you?

23
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,651
Damn it.

24
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,413
How is she?

25
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,002
You're the victim of the accident.
What are you doing here?

26
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,088
I need to be compensated for the damage.

27
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
I see.

28
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,010
Is she badly injured?

29
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,262
No, it's not that serious.

30
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,680
However,

31
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,269
I'm a little worried
because she's a pianist.

32
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,611
EPISODE 2

33
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,255
Wait…

34
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,965
Don't go.

35
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,135
Don't go…

36
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,850
DO NOT DISTURB

37
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,616
Are you all right?

38
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,410
Who is that?

39
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,417
You're…

40
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,754
That Nosebleed?

41
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,924
What are you doing here?

42
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,675
The bike.

43
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,055
You hit me on my bike with your car.

44
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,807
Why, of all people--

45
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,809
I'm as surprised as you are about this.

46
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,103
Sorry.

47
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,940
Are you all right?

48
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,024
Yes.

49
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,026
I'm fine.

50
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,404
I'm relieved.

51
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,160
Mimi.

52
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,330
What about Mimi? Where is Mimi?

53
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:58,918
Don't tell me…

54
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,505
Is she dead?

55
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,882
No, right?

56
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,135
Mimi is not dead, right?

57
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,137
I took her to a veterinary clinic.

58
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,556
She didn't die,
but she's undergoing surgery. 

59
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,810
Thank you, God.

60
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,117
Thanks,

61
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,078
Nosebleed.

62
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,330
Jeez.

63
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,177
Please only say hopeful things.

64
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,180
Even if my condition is hopeless,
tell me that I can fully recover

65
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,806
with the right treatment. Please.

66
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,059
Well, I was going to say that anyway.

67
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,145
Really?

68
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,189
As for the neck, it's a whiplash injury.

69
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,357
The neck brace
will be removed in a few days.

70
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,526
You sprained your right wrist.

71
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,945
The ligament stretched
and ended up with a little tear.

72
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,531
The cast will be kept on
for about a week to minimize movement.

73
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,367
Try not to use your hand
if you want to recover quickly.

74
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,870
Hang in there even if it's uncomfortable.

75
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,164
Yes, of course. I will.

76
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,667
The problem is your left hand.

77
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,463
The extensor tendon
on the back of your hand got damaged.

78
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:28,257
You'll have to wear a cast
for about three weeks,

79
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,052
and you'll receive
rehabilitation and physical therapy.

80
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:38,351
Your job doesn't require
precise movement on your fingers, does it?

81
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,146
Well, I did play the piano for many years,

82
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,774
but I quit, so it's fine.

83
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,026
I see, okay.

84
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,987
By any chance,

85
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,366
will I have a problem
playing the piano in the future?

86
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,912
We'll have to see.

87
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,468
I'm doomed. I shouldn't have come here.

88
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,471
I can't believe
I caused an accident and hurt my hand.

89
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,266
Too bad you couldn't meet Dosollasol.

90
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,810
It's "Dodosolsollalasol."
How many times have I told you?

91
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,520
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

92
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,443
Should I ask them to come here?

93
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,779
Pass me my phone. Quick.

94
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,666
LALA9: WHERE IS THIS?
I'LL COME SEE YOU RIGHT NOW.

95
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,084
DODOSOLSOLLALASOL: EUNPO CITY

96
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,336
GOING ON A BUSINESS TRIP.
MEET ME THERE A MONTH FROM NOW.

97
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,797
What? Is something wrong?

98
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,968
Dodosolsollalasol
left a comment on my Byeolgram.

99
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,598
"Going on a business trip.

100
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,391
Meet me there a month from now"?

101
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,893
Goodness.

102
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,152
Seriously, why did I come
all the way here? Look at the mess I'm in.

103
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,114
And I'm all alone.

104
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,535
Stop crying.
I don't want to wipe your tears for you.

105
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,789
Can you do it for me just once more?

106
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,105
Gosh, that's gross.

107
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,359
Didn't you call me "filthy"?
Where did that pristine bride go?

108
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,904
I'm already so miserable.
Must you make fun of me like this?

109
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,656
Goodness.

110
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,709
Why…

111
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,088
By the way, why did you wait for me?

112
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,339
So I can be compensated.

113
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,009
-What?
-My bike broke.

114
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,178
I also want to be compensated
for the mental stress.

115
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,889
I'm thinking 500,000 won.
300,000 for the bike

116
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,140
and 200,000 for consolation. 

117
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,308
Deal?

118
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,936
-Well--
-I can't go lower than that.

119
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,356
I called the ambulance and the tow truck.
I even had to go to the vet.

120
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,108
It was so stressful.

121
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,985
I'd give you five million won if I could.

122
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,278
Then give me five million.

123
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,697
You see,

124
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,366
I'm broke right now.

125
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,994
-What?
-I promise you that I'll compensate you.

126
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,579
So put it on my tab.

127
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,502
To tell you the truth,
I've never been broke before,

128
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,254
so I have no idea what to do.

129
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,881
You can just call your husband, can't you?

130
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,176
My husband? He ran away.

131
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,346
Why?

132
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:03,848
Enough.

133
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,933
Stop talking about your difficulties.

134
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,102
I'm under a lot of stress these days.

135
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,479
My family also
went through a lot last year.

136
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,398
And my mom fell ill because of that.

137
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,692
I didn't tell you

138
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,944
because I didn't want to worry you.

139
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,072
They say
that shared sorrow is half a sorrow.

140
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,450
But in my point of view, once it's shared,

141
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,202
it can distress the other person
and make them feel uncomfortable.

142
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,457
Some stuff happened.

143
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,169
Hearing all the details
will only give you a headache.

144
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,628
I want to go back inside.

145
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,424
All right.

146
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,384
Be careful.

147
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,386
Careful.

148
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,096
Be gentle.

149
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,480
Thanks, Nosebleed.

150
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,565
Why do you keep calling me "Nosebleed"?

151
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,525
Because I don't know your name.

152
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,195
My name is Ra-ra, Gu Ra-ra. What's yours?

153
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,740
Jun. Sunwoo Jun.

154
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,284
"Sunwoo Jun"? "Sunwoo Jun."

155
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,995
"Sunwoo Jun." Nice, what a cool name.

156
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,247
Get some sleep. I'm off.

157
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,709
Jun!

158
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,005
Sorry, but can I get some water
before you go?

159
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,390
Jun!

160
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,561
I'm really sorry, but do you mind
pulling up the blinds for me?

161
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,063
Over there.

162
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,191
-Is this good?
-A little more.

163
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,651
Just another centimeter.

164
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,905
Jun! I'm so sorry,
but can you get me another pillow?

165
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,073
Wait! Careful!

166
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,116
Jun.

167
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,785
Stop, will you?

168
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,629
Just today, okay?

169
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,798
Thanks.

170
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,051
This is my first time

171
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,262
sleeping with the lights off
after my wedding day.

172
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,639
Good night.

173
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,683
JIN BEAUTY SALON

174
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,563
Gosh, this is so weird.
What's taking him so long?

175
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,941
Did he not come home last night?

176
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,946
Hey, where are you?

177
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,489
Are you not home right now?

178
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,283
Where did you sleep last night?

179
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,538
Gosh, how come
he's not even checking his messages?

180
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,833
It's not like he ever messages you back.

181
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,377
Even if he slept somewhere else
or went on a trip,

182
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,338
it's none of your business.
Move, will you?

183
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,547
Mom, seriously!

184
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,925
Can you please try
to understand your daughter better?

185
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,509
Why you little… Goodness.

186
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,804
-Hello.
-Hi, Seung-gi.

187
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,640
Take her to school at once.

188
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,058
Okay. Hey, let's go.

189
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,517
I'm depressed. Give me a moment.

190
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,937
-Isn't that Jun?
-What?

191
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,896
Where?

192
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,148
Have a good day!

193
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,816
You'll trip and fall!

194
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,903
Gosh, she drives me nuts!

195
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,428
Sorry, did the noise wake you up?

196
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,306
No, not at all. Hi!

197
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,433
Hi.

198
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,020
The children's ward is full,
so they sent us here for the time being.

199
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,817
Is he your husband?

200
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,027
No.

201
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,737
-Then is he your boyfriend?
-No!

202
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,409
Then you two must be siblings.
He's your brother, right?

203
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,576
-No!
-No!

204
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,625
This woman owes me some money.

205
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,587
And we're the same age.

206
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,511
-We're doing our morning rounds.
-Hello.

207
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,310
Hello.

208
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,896
Let's have a look.

209
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,483
Now, the bones just need to heal.

210
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,193
Thank you, Dr. Cha.

211
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,573
Na-gyeom will still be able
to play the piano, right?

212
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,117
She has a competition in a few months.

213
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,660
You play piano?

214
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:22,249
I play piano, too! A pianist.

215
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,277
Stop. You look possessed.

216
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,953
You're a pianist, and you hurt your hands?

217
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,956
It's okay. I quit.

218
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,334
Why?

219
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,753
Because I graduated?

220
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,053
Did you sleep well last night?

221
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,932
Look at me, Dr. Cha.
I obviously couldn't sleep well.

222
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,811
I couldn't sleep a wink
because I was in so much pain.

223
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,776
She's probably in a lot of pain now.

224
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,903
-Right.
-I'll give her an analgesic.

225
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,624
Go ahead.

226
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,919
I'm sleep-deprived,
and my body is aching all over.

227
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,463
It doesn't even feel like my body.
I feel like my body is dead.

228
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,216
-That's how I feel.
-I see.

229
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,469
The pain will subside significantly
by tomorrow.

230
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,846
Okay.

231
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,349
By the way, why are you still here?

232
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,018
You clearly said you're not her guardian.

233
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,815
Hey! Where are you going?

234
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,442
Where's he going?

235
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,280
He said she owes him some money.

236
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,657
I see.

237
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,243
Pardon? How much?

238
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,538
Let's see. The blood work, X-ray,
and abdominal ultrasound.

239
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,581
In total, 430,000 won.

240
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,624
The fracture repair surgery,
2.15 million won.

241
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,793
Two days of hospitalization, 160,000 won.

242
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,754
With the extra emergency service charge,
it's 3.29 million won.

243
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,007
TOTAL: 3.29 MILLION WON

244
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,759
You can pay part of it now,
and the rest can be paid

245
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,178
when she's being discharged.

246
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,846
The surgery went well.

247
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,266
It'll take about two months
for the bones to fully heal,

248
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,643
but she may be discharged
sometime next week.

249
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,189
-I see.
-That's how much it usually costs.

250
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,608
I guess
that was your first time visiting a vet.

251
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,694
But the thing is, I'm broke.

252
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,575
-Lend me some money.
-What?

253
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,660
I owe you some money anyway.

254
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,245
Just add this to that amount.

255
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,625
-I don't want to.
-I'll pay the whole thing back later.

256
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,588
It looks like she's trying
to take advantage of him.

257
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,381
When I get my car repaired,

258
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,675
I'll sell it and pay you back right away.

259
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,802
-Promise?
-Of course.

260
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,222
Add it to my tab.
Quick, before you forget.

261
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,307
BIKE: 300,000 WON

262
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,434
COMPENSATION FOR MENTAL STRESS:
200,000 WON

263
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,228
MIMI: 3.29 MILLION WON

264
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,688
It sounded like she got scammed?

265
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,149
When? How? Why?

266
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,610
I don't know the details
because I didn't ask.

267
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,238
-Then do you know where she is--
-No, I don't.

268
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,989
If you're curious, you can contact her.

269
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,785
I came here
because you practically begged me,

270
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,204
but don't bother me ever again.

271
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,041
I'm sorry.

272
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,043
I'm just

273
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,712
worried about Ra-ra, that's all. 

274
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,381
Put your worries to rest.

275
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,717
Ra-ra is stronger than you think.

276
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,191
I want the braised beef.

277
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,154
The spinach, too.

278
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:29,997
What is going on?

279
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,165
The accident victim is looking after her?

280
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,167
What are you doing?
Are you skipping lunch?

281
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,210
No, I'm coming.

282
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:40,465
My gosh. He lent you money,
and he's even taking good care of you.

283
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,927
I'm going to repay him for everything.

284
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,471
Sure, of course.

285
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,225
Jun, go and pick up
some hydrating facial cream for me.

286
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,060
My skin is so dry that it feels tight.

287
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,687
Get some salad, too.

288
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,481
When I'm not feeling well,
I have to eat fresh veggies to perk up.

289
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,568
That plus some freshly squeezed juice.

290
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,280
Put them all on my tab.

291
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,407
-Of course, I will.
-Water.

292
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,912
Drink quickly. I'm late for my shift.

293
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,500
-You have another shift?
-Yes.

294
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,670
I have to work very hard
to be able to lend you money.

295
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,006
Right, you have to lend me money.

296
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,675
Hurry and make a lot of money!

297
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,469
Okay.

298
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,555
Enjoy.

299
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,267
I have to say,

300
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,438
it looks like Jun works
just so that he can lend you money.

301
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,315
Pardon?

302
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,746
The juice.

303
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,002
This is our new moisturizer. Try it.

304
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,421
-Can I get one more?
-Here you go.

305
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,591
Na-gyeom, you're so good.

306
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,052
Ra-ra,
please look after Na-gyeom for a bit.

307
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,096
Sure, no problem. See you soon.

308
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,225
This will make you prettier
and hydrate your skin.

309
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,726
-Hydrate my skin.
-Yes.

310
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,777
-We'll get another serving of kimchi stew.
-Okay, sure.

311
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,657
This is ready to eat.

312
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,877
-Oh, boy.
-Thank you for the discount.

313
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,513
Gosh, oh my goodness. What an idiot!

314
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,642
-They threatened her.
-She obviously lied.

315
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,269
Why did he believe her?

316
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,937
Is he crazy?

317
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,314
She'll take all his money. She'll take--

318
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,317
Why pull my hair out?

319
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,946
I'm sorry.
I got too immersed in his story.

320
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,449
This is your fault.

321
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,130
KIM JI-HUN

322
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,472
Update, please.

323
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,057
A young woman visited in the morning.

324
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,517
No one has visited since then.

325
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,691
Are you sure you're keeping
a close watch 24 hours a day?

326
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,109
Of course, ma'am.

327
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,575
If he shows up, call me immediately.

328
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,410
Yes, ma'am.

329
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,041
EUNPO YUNSEUL HOSPITAL

330
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,723
You've been coming here right after work?

331
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,939
I need to drop something off.

332
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,233
Why are you looking after Ra-ra?

333
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,321
Do you have
an ulterior motive or something?

334
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,659
I'm doing it because I want to.

335
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,703
You said your name is Jun, right?

336
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,211
-Have we met before?
-No.

337
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,567
Have we met before?

338
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,069
I shouldn't be worried, right?

339
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,620
Jun!

340
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,457
I told you not to barge in like this.

341
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,628
Come on. I saw that the lights are on
and ran in because I got so excited.

342
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,174
What on earth are you up to?
I rarely see you at home these days.

343
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,385
-I've just been working.
-Are you a workaholic?

344
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,636
You'll fall ill at this rate.

345
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,055
It's my health,
so just mind your own business.

346
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,891
I'm just saying you should take it easy.

347
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,476
Because you'll be mine in the future.

348
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,312
Gosh.

349
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,607
Oh, right. I saw this at the bus station
and grabbed it for you.

350
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,778
Isn't it so amazing?

351
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,115
You can make 500,000 won in two days.
And they want to hire good-looking people.

352
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,450
It's perfect for you.

353
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,204
Gosh, I want to graduate quickly
so that I can just work with you.

354
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,083
What? That really is my dream.

355
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:11,588
I want to work at the same places as you
and live a happy life together.

356
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,633
I don't want to be part of your dream.

357
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,550
Goodness.

358
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,387
Oh, what is this?

359
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,266
You don't like vegetables.
You bought this?

360
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,809
Are you crazy? I just…

361
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,022
I found it on the street on my way home.

362
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,198
You brought this home for me,
didn't you? My gosh.

363
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,283
Thanks, Jun. I'll definitely enjoy this.

364
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,330
Oh, boy.

365
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,088
Well, 500,000 won…

366
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,683
Will she be okay by herself?

367
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,353
I'll only be gone for two days.

368
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,021
TWO DAYS LATER

369
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:15,026
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

370
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,326
He's still not picking up?

371
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,287
That's odd. It's already been two days.

372
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,541
Did he go somewhere
with his girlfriend for the weekend?

373
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,293
-Sorry?
-You never asked him?

374
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,045
Where does he live? Where's his family?

375
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,506
Well, I don't know.

376
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,884
Right. What's the point of knowing
such personal information

377
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,302
in a debtor-creditor relationship?

378
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,931
Just borrow as much money as you can
and pay it all back.

379
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,600
My gosh.

380
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,812
What if he ran away?

381
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,275
You'll be discharged soon.

382
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,361
Weren't you going to borrow money
from Jun again to pay your hospital bills?

383
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,072
I knew this would happen.

384
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,658
I bet he ran away
because it was too much pressure.

385
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,620
No way. He already lent me so much money.

386
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,373
Why would he run away
before getting it back?

387
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,208
I'll be honest.

388
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,294
I didn't want to say this,

389
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,714
but it doesn't look like
you can ever pay him back.

390
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,841
Why do you say that?

391
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,844
I can just tell, considering every aspect.

392
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,805
He probably decided to cut ties with you

393
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,099
because he knew
there would be more to lend you

394
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,184
than what you already owe.

395
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,188
No, that can't be.

396
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,485
I was just joking.

397
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,528
Goodness, you're so gullible.

398
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,280
You're like the perfect person to tease.

399
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,240
How could you be so naive?

400
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,763
There's a piano.

401
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,141
THE 14TH MINI CONCERT

402
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,593
It's time to practice.

403
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,345
Come on.

404
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,056
I want to take it easy today.

405
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:53,434
I have too much on my mind
that I have no energy to play the piano.

406
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,644
What's the matter now?

407
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,607
Min-ju and I had an argument,

408
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,277
and she doesn't want
to be friends with me anymore.

409
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,162
Ra-ra.

410
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,833
Play the piano.

411
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,295
When you're sad, when you're happy,

412
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,839
and even when you're depressed
because life is miserable,

413
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,756
just play the piano.

414
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,467
It'll cheer you up.

415
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:28,887
That's what music

416
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,556
and the piano can do.

417
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,991
-Do you want to play the piano?
-Dr. Cha.

418
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,705
This song always sounds so lovely.

419
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:56,664
It does.

420
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,126
"I Want You."

421
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:07,216
Erik Satie wrote this song to confess
his love to a woman named Suzanne Valadon.

422
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,011
To say, "You're mine,
so please love me back."

423
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,138
You know a lot about the song.

424
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,515
Oh, you think so?

425
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,913
You guys are going home?

426
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,958
Yes, the doctor said
her bones have healed nicely.

427
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,043
She'll be back in two weeks
to get the cast removed.

428
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:47,215
By the way, is Jun not coming back?

429
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,384
I wanted to say goodbye to him.

430
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,844
He'll come by today.

431
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,639
You did very well for the past two days.

432
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,016
From this moment, Good&Good

433
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,061
will make your lives prosperous.

434
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,398
MLM.
This stands for "Multi-level marketing."

435
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,817
We minimized the distribution cost

436
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,821
so the consumers can become sellers
and make the wisest purchasing decisions.

437
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:13,074
From the mineral water filtered
through the aquifers in Mount Halla

438
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:17,412
to this body cleanser
that even gets rid of all the fine dust.

439
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,955
Some may never have tried them,

440
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,374
but once they do,
can they resist repurchasing?

441
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,917
-No!
-No!

442
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,254
Once you try Good&Good's products,
you're bound to buy them again!

443
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:32,051
All right. Now, you'll become
our consumers and sellers.

444
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,803
Let's build a fantastic Good&Good…

445
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,347
So they take all the money they give you?

446
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,853
We already gave each of you
500,000 won, right?

447
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,062
-Yes!
-Yes!

448
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:47,316
That 500,000 won will become
five million won before you know it.

449
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,652
It's just a matter of time
before it becomes 50 million.

450
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,281
Of course, if you invest your savings...

451
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,202
Well, why don't you go to the bathroom
after the seminar?

452
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,455
I don't want to.

453
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,458
I'm leaving, so give me my phone back.

454
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,711
Hey, kid. Just stay put
until the event is over, will you?

455
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,632
LET US DESIGN YOUR LIFE

456
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,392
Can I have your attention? Attention!

457
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,604
-Will you let this opportunity slip by?
-Let go!

458
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,115
He didn't come today either.

459
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,081
Did he really run away?

460
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,923
Why is my head itchy?

461
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,889
I can't reach it.

462
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,685
It's been over a week
since I've last washed it.

463
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,898
Gosh, it's too itchy.

464
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,691
It's so itchy.

465
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,653
Gosh, it's so itchy.

466
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:18,991
Come on.

467
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,329
Excuse me.

468
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,334
Darn it, it's so itchy.

469
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,796
Come on.

470
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,063
Ms. Gu.

471
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,150
What's wrong?

472
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,028
Dr. Cha.

473
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,113
What's wrong? Did you fall and get hurt?

474
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,076
Then why are you crying?

475
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,331
Well…

476
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,041
It's…

477
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:52,668
It's because…

478
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,798
my head was just so itchy.

479
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,302
It's itchy,

480
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,137
but I can't scratch it.

481
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:08,059
There's no one
to scratch it for me either.

482
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,645
And I can't move my hands either.

483
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,358
I see. Then should I scratch it for you?

484
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,861
There, there.

485
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,580
-Dr. Cha.
-Yes?

486
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,583
A little bit to the left.

487
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,126
Okay.

488
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,214
A bit more, please.

489
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:39,966
Is this it?

490
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,176
A bit harder.

491
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,219
Okay.

492
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,767
-My gosh.
-Why are you laughing?

493
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,979
I don't know. I just…

494
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,773
I just can't help but laugh.

495
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,235
What are you doing?

496
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,530
Jun.

497
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,064
Where have you been?

498
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,774
I thought you left me for good.

499
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,618
Hey, this is the only suit I have.

500
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,748
Come on, seriously?

501
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,665
Do you feel better?

502
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,462
Good going, crying in front of strangers.

503
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,634
Jeez. Then what about you?
Who beat you up?

504
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,100
On my wedding day,

505
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,228
remember when I said, "Bye"
and you said, "No"?

506
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,187
No.

507
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,230
Do you remember that?

508
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,731
Yes.

509
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,567
I guess what you said was magic.

510
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,236
Since we met each other again.

511
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,198
Darn it. I shouldn't have said that.

512
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,701
I was going to thank you, but never mind.

513
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,124
Last time,

514
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,336
you asked me
why my husband-to-be had left me.

515
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,466
It was because my family went bankrupt.

516
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,219
I guess you can say
that our agreement fell through.

517
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,971
My husband-to-be is a doctor.

518
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:35,307
My dad promised to open his own practice
for him and buy us a house.

519
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,309
But he failed to keep that agreement.

520
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,522
-Why did you want to marry, then?
-My dad told me to.

521
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,190
Are you stupid?

522
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,068
How could you marry someone
you didn't like just because of him?

523
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,280
I may not have liked him too much,
but he was a decent guy.

524
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,906
He liked me a lot.

525
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,577
Gosh, I can't believe you're defending him
after how you were treated.

526
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,413
What? Don't tell me

527
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,415
you saw everything.

528
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,585
What?

529
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,380
Darn it. I'm so embarrassed.

530
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,844
You don't need to be.

531
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,807
Really? Since I'm already so humiliated,

532
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,435
let me tell you one more secret.

533
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,856
-I got scammed and lost my apartment.
-What?

534
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,902
I didn't know where to go
or what to do, so I came here.

535
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,946
To meet "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"?

536
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,908
What kind of lousy plan is that?

537
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,368
What if that person
was just playing with you?

538
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,287
Gosh, I know.

539
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,209
To be honest,
I didn't have anything to worry about

540
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,752
when my dad was around.

541
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,715
But after you left, I realized something.

542
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:51,842
What's that?

543
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,096
Being poor is terrifying.

544
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,142
Being poor leads to many obstacles.

545
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,729
Gosh, took you long enough.

546
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,775
I wasn't even sure
how I would pay for my hospital bills.

547
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,485
"Should I run away?

548
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,946
Should I tell Dr. Cha
that I'd pay him later?

549
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,448
Or should I ask
Na-gyeom's family for help?"

550
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,826
I thought of so many things
in that short period of time.

551
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,620
Jeez.

552
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,747
How can you laugh?

553
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,416
So…

554
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:29,505
until I get back on my feet,
could you keep lending me money?

555
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,675
No.

556
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,471
I will pay you back no matter what,
so don't you worry about that.

557
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,430
Okay?

558
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,725
Gosh.

559
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,279
Let's go. I want to take you somewhere.

560
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:54,863
Where?

561
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,365
JIN BEAUTY SALON

562
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,253
That feels so nice.

563
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,718
A bit harder.

564
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,430
Harder.

565
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,392
To the right. Scratch harder.

566
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,563
You should've brought me here sooner.
I thought I'd get lice in my hair.

567
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,815
Be quiet. The bubbles
are going to get in your mouth.

568
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,407
Did you get your nose done?

569
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,202
-No.
-You have a pretty nose.

570
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,708
What? You have inner double eyelids.

571
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,090
You look different from down here.

572
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,843
I think you're handsome.

573
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,057
What is this? You're so harsh.

574
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,517
JIN BEAUTY SALON

575
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,269
I told you to be quiet.

576
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,823
-Eun-seok.
-Oh, my God.

577
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,703
When will you be done? Should I come up?

578
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,580
Hey. Shush.

579
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,082
You should've called.

580
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,126
I'll come down.

581
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,712
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

582
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,674
What brings you here?

583
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,510
I just wanted to visit you.

584
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,930
I was curious
how you were holding up after the divorce.

585
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,475
You're the one who ditched your bride
on your wedding day.

586
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,435
-Of course, I'm doing fine.
-Damn it.

587
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,979
I didn't want to do that.

588
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,527
Do you know how much I like her?

589
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,820
If you like her so much,

590
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,324
how could you abandon her
when you were aware of her situation?

591
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,409
You know

592
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,286
how exhausting my mom can be.

593
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:12,209
Every time I go out to drink,
my friends always talk

594
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,795
about my mom.

595
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:19,091
We'll be criticized
by everyone until the day we die.

596
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,884
Goodness, congratulations.

597
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,224
Eun-seok, should I just live
with Ra-ra without telling my mom?

598
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,600
You're insane.

599
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,728
I am, right?

600
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,149
I heard she got scammed
and lost her apartment.

601
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,526
I don't even know where she is.

602
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,623
Hey, you should still be careful
for the time being.

603
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,709
Okay. I was just really happy.

604
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,466
Do you have a place to stay
after you get discharged?

605
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,384
Of course.

606
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,139
Per night, 30,000 won.
Food, maintenance, and cleaning included.

607
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,183
-Deal?
-Deal.

608
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,187
Hold on. I want to take a look
at the boarding house before I decide.

609
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,900
You know how picky I am.
After all, I may not like it, you know?

610
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,029
You really have no shame for someone
who's borrowing money.

611
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,071
Don't you think so?

612
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,866
HOSPITAL DISCHARGE FEE
1.29 MILLION WON

613
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,304
Take a cab and go here.

614
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,266
-Isn't this the beauty salon?
-Yes. Wait for me there.

615
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,018
No.

616
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,479
I want to go with you.

617
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,357
-I won't be ending anytime soon.
-That's okay.

618
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,485
Don't worry about me.
Just focus on your work.

619
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,986
I don't feel comfortable

620
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,072
since you keep staring.

621
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,120
-But…
-What?

622
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,957
I don't have any money for a taxi.

623
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,875
TAXI 10,000 WON

624
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,418
Put this on my tab as well.

625
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,010
-I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

626
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,930
Dr. Cha. Are you here for lunch?

627
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:30,973
Yes.

628
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,474
Gosh.

629
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,477
You should be more careful.

630
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,436
Thank you.

631
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,731
There's a cab. I should get going.
See you at my next checkup.

632
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,025
-Taxi!
-Be careful…

633
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:43,944
Taxi!

634
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,588
Hello.

635
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,561
Welcome.

636
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,441
A Chamel bag, a Fedi cardigan,

637
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,609
and Gussi heels!

638
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,778
You're a new face.

639
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,530
Did you move here?

640
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,657
Well…

641
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,535
Oh, dear. You hurt your hand.

642
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,494
What happened?

643
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,204
Oh, hold on.

644
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,000
Here. Sit down.

645
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,501
You're so beautiful.

646
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,632
Excuse me.

647
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,553
It's time for another perm.

648
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,183
Your hair's dry and needs treatment.

649
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,520
You also need to slightly trim your hair.

650
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,440
Right? It's been a while
since I've visited a hair salon.

651
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,818
This is the best hair salon
in this neighborhood.

652
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,487
I'm not sure if you were aware of that.

653
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,782
They call me Cheongdam-dong Scissorhands.

654
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,326
I used to work at a hair salon there.

655
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,744
-Really?
-Yes.

656
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,704
That's where my hair salon is.

657
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,248
Goodness, this is fate.

658
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:23,710
Among countless hair salons
in this entire country,

659
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,879
we met here.

660
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,840
This is the moment

661
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:33,595
I'm certain God sent me to you.
There's no other explanation for this.

662
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,264
I'm so glad to have met you!

663
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,934
She's so gullible.

664
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,396
Let me see.

665
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,064
Let me see.

666
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,524
We'll use the 50,000 won treatment.

667
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:48,360
I'll use natural perm creams
to prevent any more damage.

668
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,569
As for your hairstyle…

669
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,532
How about mixing some C curls and S curls

670
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,659
for an elegant-looking Build Perm?
No, hold on.

671
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,828
You have a very sophisticated face.

672
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,997
The Grace Perm will suit you.

673
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,165
Should we do that instead?

674
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,625
"Grace Perm"?

675
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,003
I'd like that. But…

676
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:09,089
I don't have any money at the moment.

677
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,009
Oh, dear.
Did you leave your wallet back home?

678
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,178
Then you can pay me next time.

679
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,848
-Can I do that?
-Of course.

680
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:21,018
Okay, come here. Oh, my. This way.

681
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:25,397
All right. Gosh, you have long legs.
You have a perfect body ratio.

682
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,773
All right. Be careful.

683
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,152
Gosh, you look like a foreign beauty.

684
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,321
All right.

685
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,533
Let's see what I can do.

686
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,663
Okay.

687
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,835
Gosh, I know this is my work,

688
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,588
but it's such a masterpiece.

689
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,258
-I look so weird.
-Don't be ridiculous.

690
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,970
You look more gorgeous than Grace Kelly.

691
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:23,371
-Hi.
-What? I didn't know you had a client.

692
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,041
This is my daughter.

693
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,001
Oh, my. Seriously?

694
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,879
You have a daughter that big?
I had no idea.

695
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:35,217
People often tell me
that I look very young.

696
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,803
She's in her 30s.
She had me when she was very young.

697
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,137
I see.

698
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,934
All right, you're all done.

699
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,728
The perm is 200,000 won,
plus 30,000 won for long hair,

700
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,439
and 50,000 won for treatment.
That'll be 280,000 won in total.

701
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,276
I really like the prices here.

702
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,487
It's far cheaper than the one I went to.

703
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,448
Right? I gave you a big discount.

704
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,575
Can you pay me in cash?

705
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,702
Okay, I'll pay in cash later.

706
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,704
-Okay.
-"Later"?

707
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,165
-Mom.
-Yes?

708
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,001
Are you putting it on her tab?

709
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,754
She's a new face. How can you trust her?

710
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,756
What if she never pays you back?

711
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,176
What do you mean?
Do I look like the type who'd do that?

712
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,388
Hey! Watch what you say
to a potential regular!

713
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,767
She just moved here.

714
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,145
Really? Then where do you live?

715
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,570
Well…

716
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,571
Yes?

717
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,865
I'll find out soon.

718
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,411
Oh, do you not even know
where your new house is?

719
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,164
Well, it's a long story.

720
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,791
What kind of story is it
that you can't pay her right now?

721
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,085
You're trying to scam my poor mom!

722
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,962
-You…
-No!

723
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,755
Are you trying to ruin her expensive hair?

724
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,757
Mom, could you let go?

725
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,259
You're supposed to be on my side.

726
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,803
-Where are you going?
-Really?

727
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:03,930
Oh, no!

728
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,435
Jun.

729
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,647
What…

730
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,066
What happened?

731
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,445
Do you two know each other?

732
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,157
You should've told me
that you lived next door.

733
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,291
This used to be a flower shop.

734
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,668
Oh, I see.

735
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:38,882
But…

736
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,886
isn't this a bit too shabby
for 30,000 won a night?

737
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,639
-Then do you want to go elsewhere?
-I do. Where's my stuff?

738
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:48,934
Over there.

739
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:52,437
It's late, so spend the night here
and look for another place tomorrow.

740
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,355
Okay.

741
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,734
Do you only have one bed?

742
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,153
-Yes.
-Then where will you sleep?

743
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,199
We'll be sleeping together.

744
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,368
What?

745
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:11,539
"Together"?

746
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,258
She's a lodger at my place.

747
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,933
Gosh! Don't you know doing that
can drive away your luck?

748
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:33,478
That hurts.
There's no luck to drive away anyway.

749
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,648
All you can do is talk back.

750
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,149
Darn it.

751
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,235
Mom, isn't it so strange?

752
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,363
-What do you mean?
-I'm talking about Jun.

753
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,615
That house isn't a cozy place to live.

754
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,368
How could someone want to stay
at such a creepy place?

755
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,495
She owes him money.

756
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:53,456
Can't you tell from the way
she already made a tab at the salon?

757
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,791
Gosh, I'm so irritated!

758
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:55,917
Because of what?

759
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,919
Because of her.

760
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,088
She's too pretty.

761
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,007
I'm annoyed because she's so pretty!

762
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,009
That's so unnecessary.

763
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:07,095
Goodness, you are much prettier than her.

764
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,931
But I'm prettier than you. Go vacuum!

765
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,600
Whatever.

766
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,399
I was just joking.

767
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,320
It gets cold at night,
so make sure to use the blanket.

768
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,654
Okay.

769
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,864
Where are you going?

770
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,407
I'm working a night shift.

771
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:28,908
Really?

772
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,244
I'm going to wash up
before I go. You should rest.

773
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,878
I didn't know
people could live in a place like this.

774
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,805
Do you have a place to stay
after you get discharged?

775
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,057
Of course.

776
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,560
887 HAEAN-RO
JIN BEAUTY SALON

777
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,771
-You should be more careful.
-Taxi!

778
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,026
-What's your relationship to the patient?
-Accident victim.

779
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,446
-You should get that treated as well.
-I said I'm fine. Leave me alone.

780
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,367
Does he not want to leave
any medical records?

781
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,828
Do you have
an ulterior motive or something?

782
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,206
I'm doing it because I want to.

783
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,053
MS. GU

784
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,697
Damn it, not again.

785
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,246
Ra-ra, can you give me two bottles…

786
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,251
Are you sleeping already?

787
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:18,476
JIN BEAUTY SALON

788
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,778
What are you doing?

789
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,655
What? Well…

790
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,491
Damn it.

791
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,343
I was just…

792
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,644
Don't get the wrong idea--

793
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,981
Go put on some clothes!

794
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,229
Why would you bring
this homeless girl here?

795
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,481
So you want to stay here and live off us?

796
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,733
Then you're a parasite, not a lodger.

797
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,653
-I'll vouch for her.
-Are you saying you'll be her guarantor?

798
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,698
Jun from next door brought her here?

799
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,616
What was Jun doing before?

800
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,786
I don't know. He doesn't talk much
and he never talks about himself.

801
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,121
What's wrong?

802
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,164
To congratulate you getting your cast off,

803
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,709
I'd like to take you to dinner.
When are you free?

804
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,103
She's totally my type.

805
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:15,028
