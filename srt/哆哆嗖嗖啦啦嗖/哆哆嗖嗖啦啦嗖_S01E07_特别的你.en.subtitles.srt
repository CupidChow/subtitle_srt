1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,210
I'm positive. I remember it clearly.

2
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,964
Had it not been for him,
Man-bok would've been long dead.

3
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,424
You know that old man well?

4
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,384
Of course, I do.

5
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,928
He's been around here
for the past 30 years.

6
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,954
What? What is it?

7
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,798
-My goodness.
-What is it?

8
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,468
That's the guy
whose hair I accidentally cut off.

9
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,886
-Seriously?
-Yes.

10
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,568
I had no idea.

11
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,738
Since when did you know me?

12
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,285
What took you so long?
You should've told me sooner.

13
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,414
-Dr. Cha?
-I'm far too nervous to say anything.

14
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,209
Dr. Cha.

15
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,803
I thought you had surgery today.

16
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,474
Oh my. You must've come to watch as well.

17
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,771
Why didn't you tell me that he was coming?

18
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,606
He wasn't going--

19
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,901
Hey, why are you talking so loudly?

20
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,780
-Who is he?
-He's Dodosolsollalasol.

21
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,283
He's Mr. Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

22
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,368
All right, you two.

23
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,703
Face each other and smile.

24
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:46,416
Do you think they're getting married
or something? Stop making a fuss.

25
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,500
Well…

26
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,919
Your words of encouragement
helped me so much.

27
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,215
I thought just talking to you online
would be enough.

28
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,467
But then, since you even sent me a piano,

29
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,053
I thought it'd only be appropriate
to thank you in person.

30
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,723
These two thoughts clashed
dozens of times a day.

31
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,641
-Well--
-I'm sorry.

32
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,438
I'm afraid I'm not the person
you've been waiting for.

33
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,316
Hold on. What do you mean?

34
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,736
Aren't you Dodosolsollalasol?

35
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,406
Dodosolsol… What is that?

36
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,283
What? It's not him then.

37
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,952
We were barking up the wrong tree.
Is he not here yet?

38
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:27,415
Then why did you pretend
like you were him all this time?

39
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,295
That's because none of you
gave me the chance to speak.

40
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,422
Of course, we did.

41
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,133
As someone who was recording everything,

42
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,094
I can't help but agree with him.
You three were raving on.

43
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,597
-So he had no chance to speak.
-Right.

44
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,184
Then what are you doing here?

45
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,771
I come to this cafe often
since it has a great view.

46
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,522
-I see.
-Oh, dear.

47
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,608
-Well--
-Dr. Cha.

48
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,237
Isn't it too hectic here,
and aren't your feet sore?

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,531
How about we have some tea
over there while we wait?

50
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,449
Well…

51
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,952
What do you like? Let's go, guys.

52
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:04,869
Okay.

53
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,207
Goodness.

54
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,090
He'll come, right?

55
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,551
Of course.
Let's get some rest while we wait.

56
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,013
By the way, why isn't Jun here yet?

57
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,057
Did he forget?

58
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,187
What is it, Mr. Kim?

59
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,069
Yes, it's him.

60
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,362
Where is he right now?

61
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,866
I don't know why you're looking for him,
but he's not here.

62
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,494
You better not be lying.

63
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,497
We don't go easy on old men.

64
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,251
I think it's been about a month.

65
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,671
He left for Jeonju,
saying he was meeting a friend.

66
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,257
That's what I told them.

67
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,928
But Jun, I'm not sure
if I've done the right thing.

68
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,307
Shouldn't you go back
since your family's looking for you?

69
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,852
I'll go home when it's time.

70
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,189
Thank you for trusting me

71
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,275
and taking my side.

72
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:23,031
Well, I'm sure you have your own reasons.

73
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,423
Ra-ra, any news?

74
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,342
No.

75
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,845
I really wanted to meet him.

76
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,557
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

77
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,060
What if he had an accident coming here?

78
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,355
Don't say such an ominous thing.

79
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,317
What? You also got into an accident
coming here and was hospitalized.

80
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,236
NEW MESSAGE
DODOSOLSOLLALASOL

81
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,655
-Is it him?
-Let's see.

82
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,536
"I'm sorry.
Did you wait long for me today?

83
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,831
For personal reasons,
I couldn't see you today."

84
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,043
"But I will continue
to support you, forever."

85
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,298
I'm relieved.

86
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,592
You made me worried.

87
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,262
Come on. He's fine, so all is well.

88
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,765
She's right. So what if you can't see him?

89
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,101
As long as everyone's well, it's fine.

90
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,770
Life is long.
I'm sure you'll meet him someday.

91
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,190
-I will, right?
-Yes.

92
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,484
You definitely will.

93
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,945
Why don't we take a photo
since we have makeup on?

94
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,905
-It's such a waste not to.
-All right.

95
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,073
All right.

96
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,575
One, two, three.

97
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,731
No.

98
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,390
It's him.

99
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,977
"I'm sending you the stars"?

100
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,995
"I hope the stars shine down brightly
on your future."

101
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,920
Thank you.

102
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,422
I truly mean it.

103
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,917
-That's not true.
-No, it is.

104
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,336
Hey! Where are you going at this hour?

105
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,837
It's urgent!

106
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,424
She's so strange.

107
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,094
She's so fast.

108
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,852
"I hope the music from LaLa Land
will fill the entire world."

109
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:29,569
"I hope the stars shine down brightly
on your future."

110
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,161
"I hope it cheers you up."

111
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,499
Their speeches are similar.

112
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,294
Thanks for the invite,
but I have surgery scheduled tomorrow.

113
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,548
He said he couldn't make it, but he did.

114
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,220
He sent that message after we parted ways.

115
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,138
Has it

116
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,392
ever occurred to you
that the one nicknamed Dodosolsollalasol

117
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,440
could be someone you've already met?

118
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,441
My gosh.

119
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,735
Dr. Cha…

120
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,113
was Mr. Twinkle?

121
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,200
My goodness!

122
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,371
What were you doing?
Why are you so startled?

123
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,459
Gosh.

124
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,794
What are you wearing?

125
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,755
Oh, this.

126
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,716
I was busy thinking about something.

127
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,134
Gosh.

128
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,679
What was it
that you even forgot to wear clothes?

129
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,932
Where were you all day?
You neither came nor picked up my calls.

130
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,521
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

131
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,858
What about the guy? Did you meet him?

132
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:53,986
You must be disappointed.

133
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,529
But

134
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,033
I think I know who it is.

135
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,494
Who is it?

136
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,627
Dr. Cha.

137
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,423
-Who?
-Dr. Cha Eun-seok.

138
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,467
Gosh.

139
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,804
You know
how accurate my hunches are, right?

140
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,808
I used my skills
and put the pieces together.

141
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,727
And they all pointed to one person.

142
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,063
What were the pieces?

143
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,151
Listen carefully. "I hope you do this.
I hope you do that. I hope, I hope."

144
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,445
There's "I hope" on that pot
and my social media.

145
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:41,158
There's "I hope" everywhere
on the pot and my social media.

146
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,161
I'm positive. I'm sure it's him.

147
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,581
And he always messaged me after we met.

148
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,917
"I hope you do this. I hope you do that."

149
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,671
-What do you think? It's perfect, right?
-Not even one bit.

150
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,512
-To tell you the truth, it was me.
-What?

151
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,640
According to your inference,
it could be me as well.

152
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,226
I also told you that I'd be there,

153
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,395
and we've known each other for some time.

154
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,231
And the way he spoke?

155
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,151
"I hope you do this. I hope you do that."
What about that?

156
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,404
I hope you go home,
wash up, and go to sleep. Happy?

157
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,321
Gosh.

158
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,200
You must be jealous
of my inference skills.

159
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,161
Forget it. Gosh.

160
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,664
-Move.
-Gosh.

161
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,417
Hey, I'm Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

162
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,252
That's cute. Whatever.

163
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,046
Gosh.

164
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,141
JUN: ARE YOU HOME?

165
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,976
I'm already sleeping.

166
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,354
JUN: I HOPE YOU KEEP SLEEPING

167
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,108
What? "I hope you keep sleeping"?
"I hope"?

168
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,986
God, he's so childish.

169
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,573
He has a profile photo?

170
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,919
They look so pretty.

171
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:21,967
EPISODE 7

172
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,442
Ra-ra.

173
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,405
-Have you been waiting for me?
-Yes.

174
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,493
It's nice to hear that
even if you didn't mean it.

175
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,036
I did mean it.

176
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,580
Is something going on?

177
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,584
Today's lunch is on me.

178
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,469
What's wrong?
Why aren't you saying anything?

179
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,181
I'm quite busy today,
so I'm afraid I can't have lunch with you.

180
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,977
That's okay. It's my fault
for asking you out of the blue.

181
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,439
Is there anything you're craving?

182
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,528
You got that right.

183
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,614
A doorbell?

184
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,825
I asked Jun to set one up.

185
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,577
She startled me so many times.

186
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,079
Hello!

187
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,914
-You were all here.
-Hi.

188
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,374
What is it this time?

189
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,668
Do you have a julienne cutter?

190
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,712
"A julienne cutter"? What for?

191
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,090
I'm having trouble chopping a carrot,
so I want to julienne it.

192
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,595
You should just eat it whole.
Why are you julienning it?

193
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,597
-Here.
-Thank you.

194
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,934
Do you have sesame oil and minced garlic?

195
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,229
-I should just keep it open.
-How many times should I wash spinach?

196
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,357
Probably until it's clean.
That was an obvious question.

197
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,984
Then

198
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,153
is it okay to flush dirt down the sink?

199
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,154
Not really.

200
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,949
I see.

201
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,827
Excuse me,
but how do you make egg garnish?

202
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,871
I've only cooked fried eggs before.

203
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,666
-What on earth are you making?
-Hold on.

204
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,628
Carrots, spinach, sesame oil

205
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,047
Minced garlic, and egg garnish

206
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,174
You must be making

207
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:30,721
-Gimbap
-Gimbap

208
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,390
How did you know?

209
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:40,773
Every family has their own gimbap recipe.

210
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,569
Every gimbap has its own identity.

211
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,699
My family's gimbap contains
fish cakes boiled down in soy sauce.

212
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:55,913
No matter what others say,
tasty spinach makes the best gimbap.

213
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,290
Our gimbap doesn't contain ham

214
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,918
because it overpowers
all the other ingredients.

215
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,506
All right, then. Shall we begin?

216
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,759
Then how should I help?

217
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,718
You should…

218
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,473
You'll only get in the way,
so just go play the piano.

219
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,185
She's right. Play some nice music
while we roll some gimbap.

220
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,313
Should I?

221
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,177
FISH CAKE GIMBAP

222
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,430
TUNA GIMBAP

223
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,640
NO-HAM GIMBAP

224
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,268
SPINACH GIMBAP

225
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,812
Should I taste them now?

226
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,954
It's so delicious!

227
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,082
She likes it!

228
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,377
Of course it is.

229
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,964
It's quite difficult
for gimbap to not taste yummy.

230
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,759
Right. I've always been curious.

231
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,261
Why do you call yourselves TWD?

232
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,513
"Those Wishing for a Divorce."

233
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,849
In short, it's TWD.

234
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:43,520
Everyone has at least one reason
for wanting a divorce.

235
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,314
Had I gotten my way,

236
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,650
I would've gotten divorced
hundreds of times already.

237
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,736
However, it's easier said than done.

238
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,363
Since we can't get one,
we just wish for one

239
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,908
while gathering together and gossiping.

240
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,661
I guess I could say that you,
who broke off your wedding,

241
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,290
and I, who's single, have it better.

242
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,543
It does make sense.

243
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,506
By the way, why were you making these
so early in the morning?

244
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,176
I wanted to express my gratitude.

245
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,390
Is this fa or sol?

246
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,853
-Do, re, mi, fa--
-It's la.

247
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,816
La, la.

248
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,110
I see.

249
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,196
The last time
I saw music notes was in high school.

250
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,908
Ms. Kim. When an orchestra
is tuning their instruments,

251
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,910
the oboist plays the first tune.

252
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,246
Do you know which note it is?

253
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,374
-No.
-It's la.

254
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,376
La. La, la.

255
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,004
-I see.
-Would you like some?

256
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,258
No, thank you. I just ate. Enjoy.

257
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,732
Let's go.

258
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,485
Practice hard, my daughter.

259
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,611
-Okay, Mom.
-Okay.

260
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,863
SOMANG PIANO ACADEMY

261
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,906
There are so many students
at this academy.

262
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,411
One of their students won the grand prize
at a competition this spring.

263
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,538
So this place is really popular
among moms.

264
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,667
"A competition"?

265
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,964
WORLDWIDE MUSIC COMPETITION

266
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,299
"A competition"?

267
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,596
Sure. My students can also attend one
and win the grand prize.

268
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,891
Let's see…

269
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,479
He lacks time.

270
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,151
He lacks skills.

271
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,112
I'll get that bag too, right?

272
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,906
He's interested in something else.

273
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,744
He's too old.

274
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,206
There's no one.

275
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,509
Jae-min.

276
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,431
Jae-min?

277
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,976
GRAND PRIZE
SHIN JAE-MIN

278
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,977
I'll take the photo.

279
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,562
-I'm so proud of you!
-Smile.

280
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,565
-You've won the grand prize.
-One, two…

281
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,361
-Welcome.
-Hello.

282
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,363
-Hello.
-Hello.

283
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,864
Hello.

284
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,532
-Welcome.
-Hello.

285
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,534
We heard that you're a great teacher.

286
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,911
-Thank you.
-Sure.

287
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,416
Wake up.

288
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,880
What a comfortable life you're living,
napping at this hour.

289
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,301
You should've woken me up a bit later.
I was having a happy dream.

290
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,970
About what?

291
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,516
I dreamed about many students
enrolling at my academy.

292
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,684
Gosh.

293
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,437
By the way, I haven't seen Jae-min lately.

294
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,525
Jae-min, would you like to learn piano?

295
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:22,322
Come back here tomorrow with your parents.
Okay? You must.

296
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,283
I haven't seen him since.

297
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,119
I don't know his address or number.

298
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,124
Jun, is there any way to find him?

299
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,335
I'm not sure.

300
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,008
-Hello.
-I wasn't keeping track of time.

301
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,218
Hello.

302
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,472
I'm going to work.

303
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,071
-Have you eaten?
-Yes. What about you?

304
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,073
I have. I had two bowls of rice.

305
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,616
Two bowls? I see.

306
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,368
Yes, sit here for a bit.

307
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,129
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere.

308
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,382
Sorry? What did you just say?

309
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,594
Instead of receiving lessons,
I'd like to hear you play.

310
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,597
At least until I become
more comfortable with music.

311
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,639
Is that too much?

312
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,976
Well, no.

313
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,562
-But I've never done this before.
-Please.

314
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,899
-Okay, then.
-Thanks.

315
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:37,916
Hello.

316
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,960
Why are you here at this hour?

317
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,755
-Do you want a haircut?
-No.

318
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,261
What are you doing?
The AC is on. It's a waste of energy.

319
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,564
I'll leave the door ajar.
You can take a peek every so often.

320
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,110
I'm growing lettuce at home.

321
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,113
It's very dear to me.

322
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,576
Jun, are you feeling ill?

323
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,828
No. I'll get going.

324
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,914
And I'll buy an air conditioner soon.

325
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,797
Is he coming down with a heatstroke?

326
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,049
He started talking nonsense
out of the blue.

327
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,721
Goodness.

328
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,938
Why is she playing the piano herself
and not teaching him?

329
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,441
That darn girl.

330
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,733
Hello?

331
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,531
Your son saved my life.

332
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:36,451
I've been meaning to see you to thank you.

333
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,495
Right, sure. I heard you.

334
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,915
Do you know if my son has a phone?

335
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,918
A cell phone.

336
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,629
I didn't see one.

337
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,552
And you're sure he is headed to Jeonju?

338
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,971
Yes, that's what I heard.

339
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,476
How did my boy look?

340
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,812
Did he have any money on him?

341
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,106
Don't worry.

342
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,692
I gave him some cash.

343
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,488
You're telling me not to worry
because you gave him chump change?

344
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,701
Would you still say that
if he were your son?

345
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,830
It's impossible to control your children.

346
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,165
Don't worry too much.

347
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,628
He's bound to go back
to where he belongs sooner or later.

348
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,841
Don't meddle in other people's affairs.

349
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:37,596
You don't even know
what kind of family Jun comes from.

350
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,806
-I know all about him--
-Enough.

351
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,983
I'm sure this is a lot more
than the money you gave him.

352
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,820
And if you hear from my son,

353
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,157
please contact me immediately.

354
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,952
Well, then.

355
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,583
Darn it.

356
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,221
"LaLa Land"?

357
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,326
-What would you like me to do?
-What?

358
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,828
Must you ask?

359
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,207
Go to Jeonju at once
and send out your men to find him.

360
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,417
Make them stake out the school.

361
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,835
Yes, ma'am.

362
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:52,962
But my gut says--

363
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,924
Gosh, I don't want to hear it.
Keep your mouth shut!

364
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,720
My head hurts.

365
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,098
Gosh, my head…

366
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,314
TOAST, HOTTEOK

367
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,026
That's Jun.

368
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,529
That's… That's Jun.

369
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,865
Mr. Kim, pull over. I said, pull over!

370
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,495
That looked like Jun. Jun…

371
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,250
Would you like one? I highly recommend it.

372
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,544
Ma'am, you can't run out like that.

373
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,963
-Sir!
-The piano girl?

374
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,299
-Is she your wife?
-Hey!

375
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,177
"Wife"? What the… Jeez.

376
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,680
Goodness.

377
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,849
Gosh, seriously. Get out of my way!

378
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,145
Is she your boss?

379
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,023
I will come find you no matter what.

380
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,279
I charge 100,000 won per month
for the lessons!

381
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,658
Please come!

382
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,202
She looks quite familiar.

383
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,515
Right,
she is Im Ja-gyeong's daughter-in-law.

384
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,730
Im Ja-gyeong's daughter-in-law
looks penniless now.

385
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,365
This must be the newest model.

386
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,910
Let's see…

387
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,119
My gosh!

388
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,373
Did everything go well?

389
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,251
I ate your corn dog.

390
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,670
You should've looked in a mirror.

391
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,257
-No need. I know I'm pretty.
-Let's go over there.

392
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,803
The heat doesn't bother me.
I don't need AC.

393
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,679
We're here for Mimi, not you.

394
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,890
That furball must be hot all the time.

395
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,933
My gosh.

396
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:13,812
Jun, how could you be so handsome,
rich, and warmhearted?

397
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,314
-You're perfect in every way--
-Hey, stop it.

398
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,607
Okay.

399
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,778
I should've kept the appliances
I got as wedding gifts.

400
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,322
I didn't think of it
because I had no place for them.

401
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,826
Shall I call him and ask for them back?

402
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,743
No, forget it.

403
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,705
I love this design. What do you think?

404
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,457
-Are you newlyweds?
-No!

405
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,168
Oh, I see. I got the wrong idea.

406
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,586
I'm sorry.

407
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,673
That's the most popular model we have.

408
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,925
You have a good eye.

409
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:48,179
It's the newest premium model,
and the price is great.

410
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,807
Hold on, how much is it?

411
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,767
My gosh, that is a great price.

412
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,935
-Right?
-Yes!

413
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,979
You seem to know a lot.

414
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,648
Is there anything else you need?

415
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,026
We don't have a TV
or a proper refrigerator.

416
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,695
We also need a washer, dryer…

417
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,739
-And an air purifier as well.
-I see.

418
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,118
Then let's look at some TVs first.
If you buy all of them here,

419
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,663
I'll give you an air fryer
and electric kettle for free.

420
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,123
Really?

421
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,917
My gosh. I want to buy everything now,

422
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,919
but I'm broke at the moment.

423
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,337
Pardon?

424
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,553
We can set up
an interest-free payment plan on the card.

425
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,098
-I don't own a credit card.
-Not even one?

426
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,687
-No.
-Okay.

427
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,153
-Isn't it heavy?
-No.

428
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,825
Every time we buy something new
for LaLa Land,

429
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,661
I feel like my debt to you is growing.

430
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,788
Then pay me back.

431
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,084
You're keeping track of everything, right?

432
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,795
Yes, of course.

433
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,091
Write everything down.
I'm not good with numbers,

434
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,427
so I'll just rely on your tally.

435
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,555
Yes, I'll get everything back,
with interest.

436
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,890
You're so thorough.

437
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:15,975
-By the way…
-Yes?

438
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,897
Why did you scream no
when that guy at the store asked us

439
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,440
if we were newlyweds?

440
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,359
-Do you hate me that much?
-No!

441
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,112
It's not that. How shall I put this?

442
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,699
I just felt bad.

443
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,078
As you know, I've been married once.

444
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,539
And I'm mooching off you at the moment,

445
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:42,043
so I felt bad
that someone would assume that about us--

446
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,629
Who cares
whether you've been married or not?

447
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,257
It doesn't matter to me.

448
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,763
Actually,

449
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,933
I have something to say.

450
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,145
Listen carefully.

451
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,276
Give me your hand.

452
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,000
A special gift for you.

453
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,087
Judging from your nap earlier,
you must be tired these days.

454
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,755
I hope it perks you up.

455
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,605
Jun, I got my energy back!

456
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,443
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

457
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,737
You see…

458
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,780
Jun.

459
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,241
Mr. Kim!

460
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,869
Am I interrupting?

461
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,121
No, not at all.
Did you come out for a walk?

462
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,082
I need to talk to Jun about something.

463
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,709
That's why I'm here.

464
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,626
I see.

465
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,429
Your mother came by earlier in the day.

466
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,140
She is a great mother.

467
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,726
I really like her.

468
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,151
I lied to her for you.

469
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,365
She wasn't rude to you
or anything like that, right?

470
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,950
Right, don't worry.

471
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,205
Jun.

472
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,083
Stay here
until you can pull yourself together,

473
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,502
but you have to tell me
if anything happens

474
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,296
since I am your guardian.
Do you understand?

475
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,758
Yes.

476
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,635
Oh, right.

477
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,055
Your mother gave me this.

478
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,018
-You take it.
-What?

479
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,312
Consider it LaLa Land's rent.

480
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,399
All right, then.

481
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,999
Don't disappear.

482
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,960
I won't disappear.

483
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,628
Stay by my side.

484
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,463
I'll be by your side.

485
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,809
Did you have a nice date with Mr. Kim?

486
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,645
Thanks for today. Good night.

487
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,899
GOOD NIGHT

488
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,872
DON'T FORGET TO WASH YOUR FACE

489
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,212
That kid is…

490
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,230
You can just message me back.

491
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,441
You have to hear my voice, don't you?

492
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,236
Hey, are you calling
to tell me good night?

493
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,534
Dr. Cha!

494
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,454
My gosh!

495
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,164
Thank you. I really enjoyed it.

496
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,500
I didn't do much,
but I'm glad to hear you enjoyed…

497
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:53,961
Is something inside?

498
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,547
Open it.

499
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,054
I was expecting something bigger.

500
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,808
It's getting late, and I know you're busy.

501
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,062
Let's chat here while we eat those.

502
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,021
Thank you.

503
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,397
Oh, thank you.

504
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,615
There were all sorts of gimbap in there.

505
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,116
Bingo!

506
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,827
The TWD ladies made
various kinds of gimbap.

507
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,831
I see. Then what did you contribute
to making the gimbap?

508
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,587
I sprinkled some music on them.

509
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,631
What?

510
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,352
I played the piano
so they could have fun while making it.

511
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,648
I thought it made no sense.

512
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,775
But I tried picturing it,
and it makes total sense.

513
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,779
Right? Which gimbap was your favorite?

514
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,323
Well, the spinach one.

515
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,533
Ms. Jin made that one.

516
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,576
I'll let her know.

517
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,287
Sure.

518
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,583
By the way, Ra-ra…

519
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,671
Why did you say
you wanted to take me out for a meal?

520
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,633
Because you've done so much for me,

521
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,552
and I wanted to thank you.

522
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,471
Oh, really?

523
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,558
But you already know that.

524
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,023
There's a lot that I want to say to you.

525
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,068
Let's have ice cream together
and chat like this once in a while.

526
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,194
Sure!

527
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,139
What's going on?

528
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:16,187
He ignored my message all night.
Couldn't you have messaged me back sooner?

529
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,231
JUN:
MEET ME IN FRONT OF THE MART AT 11

530
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,149
What?

531
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,943
What's he saying? He wants to meet at 11?

532
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,577
Oh boy.

533
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,875
My gosh! You scared me.

534
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,960
Why are you so startled?
Did you do something wrong?

535
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,798
Where are you taking me
on my precious weekend?

536
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,176
You wanted to see Jae-min, didn't you?

537
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,597
Jae-min?

538
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,265
Wait up!

539
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,274
This is it.

540
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,905
This is where Jae-min lives?

541
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,365
Call him.

542
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,036
Jae-min.

543
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,247
Jae-min, are you home?

544
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,088
Jae-min!

545
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,609
You need to eat real food.

546
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,321
I eat lunch at school, so it's okay.

547
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,616
Why haven't you come by lately?

548
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,243
I've been waiting for you.

549
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,456
My mom's gone,

550
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,750
and my dad goes to work,

551
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,337
so there wasn't anyone
to take me to the academy.

552
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,177
You could've come by yourself.

553
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,221
Can I really do that?

554
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,640
Of course, you can come every day.

555
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,602
Help yourself to everything
in the fridge over here.

556
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,562
I'll teach you piano every day.

557
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,856
-Really?
-Yes!

558
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,316
On one condition, though.

559
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,360
Make sure the academy
and your room are always sparkling clean.

560
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,530
You can clean
instead of paying for the lessons.

561
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,949
Can you do that?

562
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,703
If you don't do anything,
you'll feel indebted.

563
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,623
Stand straight and tall.
Come every day to play the piano.

564
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,333
-Promise?
-Promise!

565
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,667
-Let's seal it.
-Here.

566
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,419
-Promise sealed.
-Promise sealed.

567
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,673
Let's see. Today, let's learn this piece.

568
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,634
Shall we start with this?

569
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,594
Well…

570
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,680
-Teacher.
-Yes?

571
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,224
The thing is,

572
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,603
I can't read music.

573
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,772
What?

574
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,192
But I'm sure that he's a prodigy.

575
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,282
If I also have to teach him
how to read music,

576
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,326
it'll be kind of difficult, won't it?

577
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,330
You'll do a great job.

578
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,380
Gosh, you.

579
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,175
If you can make that little kid clean

580
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,844
in return for his lesson fees,
it's game over.

581
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,846
-Hey!
-So what's for dinner?

582
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,099
-We should feed Jae-min, right?
-Dinner?

583
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,645
I know of a place with an amazing cook.

584
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,814
What? Right now?

585
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,192
Jun's coming too?

586
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,987
-Jun?
-Gosh, there isn't much to eat right now.

587
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,781
What should I make?
All right, just bring them over.

588
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,783
I'll just put
three more spoons on the table.

589
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,827
Okay. But take your time.

590
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,413
-Mom.
-Yes?

591
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,832
-Is Jun having dinner with us today?
-Yes.

592
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,167
Chop-chop.
Your future son-in-law is coming.

593
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,669
Fry some chicken or something.

594
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,045
You're going overboard.

595
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,298
What's the air fryer for?

596
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,383
What are you doing?

597
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,011
What are you doing now?

598
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,596
We have no meat? I saw some beef.

599
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,931
Goodness.
Just order some Chinese food then!

600
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,851
All right. It's a feast, isn't it?

601
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,939
It's all thanks to her.

602
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,608
Eat as much as you want, kiddo.

603
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,609
Enjoy the food, Jun.

604
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,901
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

605
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,236
Eat up. Dig in.

606
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,994
Eat up, Jae-min.

607
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,927
What is it?
Are you reminded of the old days again?

608
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,015
I'll bring some water.

609
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,814
What's the matter?

610
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,108
My mom grew up in a children's home.

611
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,196
Well, it's a long story.

612
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:21,241
She gets all emotional
whenever she sees hungry people

613
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,493
gobble down food.

614
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,337
There.

615
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,340
-Thank you for the dinner.
-Thank you.

616
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,717
Feel free to come over
whenever you're hungry.

617
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,178
-Okay.
-I'll take him home.

618
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,682
-Okay.
-Gosh, it's raining. Take an umbrella.

619
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,974
Can I borrow one?

620
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,185
-Of course!
-Sure thing.

621
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,239
-I'll leave it at LaLa Land.
-Okay.

622
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:01,740
Get home safely.

623
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:06,328
Gosh, I can't believe he chose Ra-ra's.

624
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,747
He told her he'll leave it at LaLa Land.

625
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,207
She's always there, you know.

626
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,919
Hey. I'm always at my mom's salon,
which is right next door.

627
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,840
And her umbrella's pink!

628
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:20,092
Why choose pink?
It doesn't suit him at all.

629
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,927
I guess he likes pink.

630
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:26,098
Hey! Are you going to keep talking to me
like that?

631
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,684
I was going to say this earlier.

632
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,103
You don't sound like you care at all.

633
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,230
Am I not worth your attention?

634
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:36,400
You're reading too much
into Jun's meaningless action.

635
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,236
Gosh, you're so annoying.

636
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,571
Whatever! I'm hanging up.

637
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,866
Gosh, it's so annoying.

638
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,970
Shouldn't you be in class now?

639
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,015
No, I have to talk to you
about something now.

640
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,567
What do you want to talk about?

641
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,907
I like you.

642
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,117
-So?
-Go out with me.

643
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,744
I don't want to.

644
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,913
What? Why not?

645
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,582
How could you reject me?

646
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,334
Sorry.

647
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,463
Jun!

648
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,884
Do you have a crush on someone?

649
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,469
Yes.

650
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,887
Is it someone I know?

651
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,816
Jun!

652
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:04,154
Sunwoo Jun!
How could you do this to me? You jerk!

653
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,825
I had to muster up
all my courage to tell you how I feel.

654
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,160
-Want to go to karaoke?
-No!

655
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,038
-Then how about some tteokbokki?
-Go eat it by yourself!

656
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,457
What's so special about Ra-ra?

657
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,334
Why can't it be me?

658
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:20,379
Seriously, I can't believe this.

659
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,172
Summer 2020, age 19.

660
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,841
The day Sunwoo Jun rejected her.

661
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,510
Are you a pervert?
Why are you recording this?

662
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,762
Why not?
Whenever you cry, it looks hilarious.

663
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,224
Look at this!
Black tears are streaming down your face.

664
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,684
-My gosh!
-You jerk!

665
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:34,768
I'll kill you!

666
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,062
Okay, hit me all you want.

667
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:41,108
If that helps you feel better,
beat me up all you want.

668
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,943
What the hell. You're so annoying.

669
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,571
I'm going to get back at him.

670
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,489
How?

671
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,783
I'll kick Ra-ra out of my house.

672
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,496
Hey, then she will move
into LaLa Land right away.

673
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,915
-What?
-Think about it.

674
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,876
You know she has nowhere to go.

675
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,379
Also, they say
that you must keep your enemies close.

676
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:06,133
-Keep her close?
-So you can keep an eye on her.

677
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,302
Haven't you heard of that?

678
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,095
Whatever.

679
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,432
Gosh, you need to study.

680
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,475
No wonder
I always get better grades than you.

681
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,977
Hey, you're talking

682
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,479
as if you get the highest grades
in the entire school.

683
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,606
Jeez.

684
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,650
I take back what I said earlier.
I'll let Ra-ra stay at my place.

685
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,402
You made a wise decision.

686
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,404
Good girl.

687
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,322
What the hell?

688
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,366
So why tell him how you feel
without my permission

689
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,911
and get turned down? It's upsetting.

690
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,788
I can do whatever I want!

691
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,790
It's none of your business.

692
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,173
Doesn't Ra-ra seem a little off
to you these days?

693
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,717
What do you mean?

694
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,346
I think something's going on
between her and Dr. Cha.

695
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,140
Here.

696
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,810
It's Piano Sonatas by Joseph Haydn.

697
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,354
I have this too.

698
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,648
I found it
while organizing my stuff recently.

699
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,067
Oh, this is…

700
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,528
I played it in a competition
when I was in third grade.

701
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,366
My gosh.
I also played this piece in a competition.

702
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,992
I won the grand prize, of course.

703
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,287
I see.
You're good at everything, so I guess

704
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,748
you won the grand prize
in every competition.

705
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,419
I always came in second place. No.
I once came in third place and even fifth.

706
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,798
One of my classmates
was an amazing pianist.

707
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,050
That friend always won the grand prize.

708
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,593
That must've been upsetting.

709
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,803
No, not at all.

710
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,472
Even I thought
that friend of mine was unbelievably good.

711
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,433
Then there's me.

712
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,435
I'm okay with that.

713
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,853
Right, I understand.

714
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,983
How about Jae-min enters
a competition with this piece?

715
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:47,859
Great idea.

716
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,696
My gosh, look at this.

717
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,948
This is what it takes
to be a model student.

718
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,033
What were you like?

719
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,576
Me?

720
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,501
Draw bananas this time.

721
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:12,551
Ra-ra, I hope you know
that this isn't a coloring book.

722
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,510
I know!

723
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,519
What's so funny?

724
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,188
These bananas look like poop.

725
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:29,192
Poop.

726
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:30,986
Poop.

727
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:37,659
Goodness.
I get to laugh thanks to you, I guess.

728
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,496
Had Ms. Gong suffered
from high blood pressure,

729
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,291
she would've collapsed
at least a hundred times.

730
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,629
But to teach him this piece…

731
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,507
All right.
I'll look forward to hearing it.

732
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,928
This will be hard.

733
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,221
I mean, I'm just saying.

734
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,767
The other day, I saw them
eating ice cream in the playground.

735
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,935
-Seriously? Just the two of them?
-Yes.

736
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,897
My gosh, that means
they might start going out.

737
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,525
-Maybe?
-I see.

738
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,236
Good to know.

739
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,282
Hey, I have a brilliant idea.

740
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,160
-What is it?
-I'll need your help.

741
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,954
Dr. Cha!

742
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,875
I'm really late, aren't I? I'm sorry.

743
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,043
It's okay.

744
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,629
What?
Aren't Seung-gi and Ha-yeong here yet?

745
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,589
Oh, I guess they're running late.

746
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:39,554
Ra-ra, Seung-gi and I have to stay
for another class. Sorry.

747
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,140
They can't make it.
They've got another class.

748
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,018
Gosh, this was their idea,
but they won't come?

749
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,728
Exactly.

750
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,573
I guess today won't work, then.
Shall we just go?

751
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,535
Wait, why don't we just watch it?

752
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,079
Since we're here.

753
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,250
MOVIE TICKET

754
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,209
Well…

755
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,711
Sure, let's do that.

756
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:17,884
Here.

757
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,100
This was the only movie
that worked out, time-wise.

758
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,561
-Are you okay with this?
-Of course!

759
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,626
Did she leave early today?

760
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,677
Mimi, where's your big sister?

761
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,554
I DON'T KNOW

762
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,599
She's on her way back? Okay.

763
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,686
Then shall I make some food?

764
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,186
Hi, Jun.

765
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,065
Ra-ra?

766
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,279
I don't know. She's not home.

767
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,664
She must've gone
to the movies with Dr. Cha.

768
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,501
-What?
-They went to the movies for sure.

769
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,475
You like Ra-ra, don't you?

770
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,271
I know it's none of my business,

771
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,356
but you should confess to her soon.

772
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,233
What do you mean?

773
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,861
Gosh, Ha-yeong told me not to tell you.

774
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:29,534
Dr. Cha and Ra-ra
might fall for each other.

775
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,246
Ha-yeong is doing her best
to make it happen.

776
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,166
Darn it. She'll kill me.

777
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,389
I dropped my phone.

778
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,433
Oh, sorry.

779
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:18,208
May I take one step closer to you?

780
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:28,176
JUN

781
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,439
EPILOGUE

782
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,408
Should I get an AC for her?

783
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,031
Why hesitate?
Tell her how you feel first.

784
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,034
Wait until you know
she won't break up with you

785
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,160
to tell her the truth.

786
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,621
Don't give him false hopes.
Just leave him alone!

787
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:23,041
Jae-min's face glows
whenever he's playing the piano.

788
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,959
-Who are you?
-I'm her husband.

789
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,212
But I do.

790
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,757
I was all depressed.
Then one day, joy came to me.

791
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,966
That was you.

792
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,384
Have you seen this guy?

793
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:36,513
Oh, he was here with a girl
a little while ago.

794
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,349
Ra-ra, thank you

795
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,100
for coming to me.

796
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:45,480
