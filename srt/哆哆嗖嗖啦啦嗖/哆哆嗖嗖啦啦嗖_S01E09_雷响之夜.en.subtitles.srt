EPISODE 9

2
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,767
Do you remember our first time here?

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,769
Of course.

4
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,314
I remember all the moments
we were together.

5
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,237
How could I not?
You always asked me for money.

6
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,990
Lend me some money.
Could you keep lending me money?

7
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,575
I've recorded them all.

8
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,577
I will pay you back.

9
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,208
The record is precious to me.

10
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,835
I didn't know at first.

11
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,048
But looking back,
they were all happy memories.

12
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,012
You know what?

13
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,599
You'd make an excellent loan shark.

14
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,976
-It suits you perfectly.
-You're right.

15
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,978
I've rediscovered myself.

16
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,277
-It's fascinating.
-What is?

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,781
I never expected us to turn out this way.

18
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,785
When do you think it all began?

19
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,247
On my wedding day?

20
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,709
I think…

21
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,839
Be gentle.

22
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,258
…I was a mess every time we met.

23
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,217
Jun!

24
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,263
And every time,
the person who protected me…

25
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,441
was you, Jun.

26
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,363
A while ago,

27
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,326
you said that I was the joy
that came into your depressed life, right?

28
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,331
You're the lucky charm
that came into my hopeless life.

29
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,879
Thank you for liking someone like me.

30
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,301
No, I'm more thankful
that you've remained by my side.

31
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,685
-Ra-ra.
-Yes?

32
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,854
I won't let go of you

33
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,733
no matter what.

34
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,157
I hope you do the same.

35
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,297
That was so pretty.

36
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,013
-Was someone here?
-Why?

37
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,392
There's dirt on the floor.

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,021
Mimi must've been eating plants again.

39
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,690
Mimi.

40
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,531
Look at you.

41
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,618
RA-RA, SOMEONE WAS HERE

42
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,535
Mimi.

43
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,664
I told you not to eat the plants
because they're Jun's.

44
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,624
It's okay, Mimi.

45
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,089
JUN, I SAID SOMEONE WAS HERE!

46
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,008
I'm going to learn piano.
Would you like to listen to me play?

47
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,427
THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING

48
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,526
Now, follow me.

49
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,162
Now, speed up.

50
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:57,333
LALA PIANO LAND

51
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,380
Now's not the time for you
to be hanging out like that, kid.

52
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,233
DIRECTOR CHU

53
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,828
Who's calling you at this hour?

54
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,668
Gosh, they must've called
the wrong number.

55
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,670
Why are they calling me at this hour?

56
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,008
The person you are calling is…

57
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,259
What?

58
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,304
Damn it.

59
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,519
DIRECTOR CHU

60
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,379
The phone is turned off.

61
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,756
Why isn't she picking up?

62
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,301
Hasn't she been breathing down my neck
all this time?

63
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,310
Who the hell is he?

64
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,732
If you don't find anything within a week,

65
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,943
I'll fire you
and hire a different company.

66
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,152
It can't be.

67
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,572
Did she hire someone else
without even telling me?

68
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,658
Damn it.

69
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,284
Hey, you!

70
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,871
Don't you have any business ethics,
you punk?

71
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,082
I've finally managed to get my job done,

72
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,000
-so how dare you take it from me?
-Sorry?

73
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,795
Who are you affiliated with, you bastard?

74
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,093
How dare you not reveal yourself?

75
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,553
You bastard!

76
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,267
If I catch you, you're dead meat.

77
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,733
What a little rat.

78
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,319
Where in the world is he hiding?

79
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,822
Damn it.

80
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,539
Gosh, seriously.

81
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,543
Why does he keep tailing me?

82
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,546
This isn't the first time.

83
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,813
I'm sorry.

84
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,274
Could you pack a little bit for me?

85
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,068
You know that Ha-yeong is
such a picky eater.

86
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,863
She only eats your mother-in-law's kimchi.

87
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,323
Okay.

88
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,367
All right. Bye.

89
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,249
What is that?

90
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,423
Hey.

91
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,425
Oh, my.

92
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,678
Sir. Blood!

93
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,973
Is anyone there? Help!

94
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,559
Oh, my! What should I do?

95
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,853
Who-- Who do I call?

96
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,438
Sir!

97
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,565
Oh, no! He must be dead!

98
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,734
What should I do?

99
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,740
EPISODE 9
THE NIGHT OF THUNDER

MONEY ENVELOPE

101
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,257
"Money Envelope"?

102
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,890
Why did you call me late at night?

103
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,728
Hello? Where are you right now?

104
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,438
Hello?

105
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,108
Why aren't you answering me?

106
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,610
First, we need to meet today.

107
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,570
Meet who?

108
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,572
Oh, my.

109
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,659
It's nothing.

110
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:46,497
A friend of mine wants to donate
to the Sunwoo Foundation.

111
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,915
Are you leaving right now?

112
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,837
Ma'am! My husband's leaving!

113
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,971
WRONG PATTERN

114
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,223
WRONG PATTERN

GALLERY

116
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,712
You get nosebleeds so often
for a young man.

117
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,046
Are you eating well?

118
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,716
I have my meals on time, so don't worry.

119
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,052
Don't worry about money
and have some meat. It's my treat.

120
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,430
I'm just too busy to rest. That's why.

121
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,641
-Mr. Kim!
-Goodness.

122
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,060
What brings you all the way here?

123
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,771
I've cooked something delicious
this morning.

124
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,274
-Aren't you excited?
-Not at all.

125
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,318
Gosh. Then don't eat.
Mr. Kim, have it all.

126
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,614
Look at these heart shapes.

127
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,453
-It tastes horrible.
-Don't eat it.

128
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,537
I will.

129
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,748
I like this one.

130
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,046
You must have a sweet tooth.
Jun hates sweet food.

131
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,216
He prefers chocolates to cookies.

132
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,051
And melted ones, at that.

133
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,596
Melted ones? Why?
Is there a story behind it?

134
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,182
What is it?

135
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,018
That smile is making me even more curious.
Tell me.

136
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,398
Let's see…
I think I was around 20 back then.

137
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,360
I used to live in a tiny shoe repair shop.

138
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,528
Goodbye.

139
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,612

142
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,146
Do you repair shoes?

143
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,482
I need some heels replaced.

144
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,568
Sure. Sit down.

146
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,286
Here you go.

147
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,997
Goodness.

148
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,209
They're expensive ones.

149
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,503
They're my landlord's daughter's.

150
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,091
Please fix them up nicely.

151
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,260
Okay.

152
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,348
-Hello.
-Hello.

153
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,026
Hello.

154
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,539
It's way past lunchtime.
Have you eaten yet?

155
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,717
Thank you.

156
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,106
Hello.

157
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,777
It's too cold. I told you not to come.

158
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,571
You could've slipped on ice.

159
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,496
I came to give you this.

160
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,084
The madam gave it to me,
but I wanted to share it with you.

161
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,214
It's from America.

162
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,509
Thank you.

163
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,563
Oh, no. Oh, dear.

164
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,861
It's tastier this way.

165
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,531
Try some, Sun-ja.

166
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,959
It's good.

167
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,464
And then? What happened?

168
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,009
When did you two get married?

169
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,094
After about five years.

170
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,638
Why? You said you were lonely.

171
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,225
-You should've gotten married sooner.
-I had no money.

172
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,020
I got married after barely managing
to get a small room.

173
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,106
A small room.

174
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,152
Don't you have lessons?

175
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,320
My goodness.

176
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,490
Mr. Kim, tell me more about this
next time.

177
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,830
Is something in your eye?

178
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,292
My eye keeps twitching lately.

179
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,670
Goodness, love must be in the air.

180
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,341
Right. Have you told her yet?

181
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,261
Not yet.

182
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,930
She's too busy
preparing for the competition.

183
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,225
I think I'll tell her
after Jae-min's competition.

184
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,562
Mr. Kim.

185
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,109
At times, when I think
about how I should tell her this,

186
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,737
it's a bit…

187
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,490
No, it's quite difficult.

188
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,120
Jun, you feel hurt and upset

189
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,500
when others don't trust you.

190
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,837
But it's even more unbearable
when you have to lie

191
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,510
to someone who trusts you
and hide the truth from them.

192
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,638
I think that's much more hurtful.

193
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,350
I'm just saying that I empathize with you.

194
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,727
Thank you.

195
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,730
We're not strangers. We're friends.

196
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,030
DIRECTOR SUNWOO MYEONG

197
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,702
Have a seat.

198
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,512
Why did you want to see me, sir?

199
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,391
Is there anything you need
to report to me on?

200
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,019
Mr. Kim.

201
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,732
I hope you can hold your tongue,
given how much you're getting paid.

202
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,026
Do you understand me?

203
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,824
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,535
Not at all, sir.

205
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,245
Is that so?

206
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,248
Do you still pick Jun up from school
on weekends?

207
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,416
Of course, sir.

208
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,506
About my wife…

209
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,010
Is she seeing anyone these days?

210
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,096
What do you mean?

211
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,806
Is she seeing a man?

212
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,975
Not at all, sir.

213
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,481
Okay. You may go.

214
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,114
Who do you think hired you

215
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,159
and is giving you your salary?

216
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,913
I think you forgot that it's me.

217
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,297
His vitals are stable,
but he's still unconscious.

218
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,258
Have you identified him?

219
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,553
Chu Min-su, 44 years old, lives in Seoul.

220
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,139
He doesn't seem to have any family.

221
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,724
And the culprit?

222
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,477
Seeing how his wallet and phone are gone,

223
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,646
we believe he was robbed and assaulted.

224
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,566
But there are no CCTV cameras
around the scene,

225
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,319
so it'll be difficult to catch them.

226
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,738
I see.

227
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,784
So you mean you don't know
if he'll wake up at all for now?

228
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,620
-He's still unconscious?
-Oh, no.

229
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,455
Thank you, doctor.

230
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,874
Please let me know as soon as he wakes up.

231
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,377
-Thank you.
-Do they know

232
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,962
-who he is?
-And his family?

233
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,965
They got his name and address,
but he doesn't have any family.

234
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,134
-Is he a bachelor?
-I don't know about that.

235
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,386
How did he look?

236
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,804
-You have a keen eye.
-Right.

237
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,557
It was too dark, and his face was bloody,
so I couldn't get a good look.

238
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,767
Goodness.

239
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,897
Seeing how the culprit took his wallet,
he must've had a lot of cash.

240
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,693
Could he be the son
of a conglomerate family?

241
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,611
Don't conglomerates all have families?

242
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,322
Hey, it's possible
if he was born out of wedlock.

243
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,116
Darn it.

244
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,493
-Let's say he wakes up
-Okay.

245
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,453
but has lost his memory.

246
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,621
-Then what?
-Hey.

247
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,498
Stop watching so many dramas.

248
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,667
You make it sound like
you don't watch them.

249
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,835
-I do.
-Suk-gyeong.

250
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,337
You saved his life.

251
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,631
Won't he repay you for that?

252
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:41,967
If it's not money…

253
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,679
Suk-gyeong, will you be getting
a boyfriend?

254
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,016
No way. What if he's a bad guy?

255
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,809
Find out whether it's fate or not

256
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,062
-once he wakes up.
-It's better if he's a bad guy.

257
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,065
Enough with your imaginations! Be quiet!

258
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,861
By the way, I wonder who did it.

259
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:02,863
Me too.

260
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,036
A stranger appears in a peaceful town.

261
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,205
A robber attacks him.

262
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,083
I'm dying to find out. Tell me.

263
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,670
-Who did it?
-It was you.

264
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,385
You're here early.

265
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,681
This is a gift.

266
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,809
What are the flowers for?

267
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,270
I don't know.
Someone left them in front of the door.

268
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,065
Do you remember?

269
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,570
Why aren't you accepting it?

270
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,448
It must be too heavy.

271
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,743
Let's put this inside
and go have lunch together.

272
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,786
Why would I?

273
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:57,709
I only accepted you
as a student at my piano academy.

274
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:01,296
You should quit if you're interested
in doing other things.

275
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,135
It's okay for some, but not me?

276
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,888
That's not really fair, is it?

277
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,557
Pardon?

278
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,144
Let us know if he calls back.

279
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,562
-Bye.
-Call us right away.

280
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,233
-Hello!
-Hi!

281
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,318
You're the handsome customer from before.

282
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,363
-Did your hair grow back?
-Yes, it did.

283
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,116
-How are your lessons going?
-They're going well.

284
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,077
Oh, my. What are those flowers for?

285
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,747
-What?
-What is this romantic, shy vibe?

286
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,708
Are they for Ra-ra?

287
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,128
-No, they're not.
-Don't lie.

288
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,754
I was throwing them away.

289
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,424
Why? They're so pretty.

290
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,093
Flowers, come home with me.

291
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,679
-He said he was throwing them away.
-What?

292
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:56,810
Ra-ra, we're going to go eat.
Come with us.

293
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,563
-Okay.
-Sure.

294
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,858
I'll refund the lesson fee.

295
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,442
Text me your account number.

296
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,487
No, I'll come back here to get it myself.

297
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,447
Enjoy your meal.

298
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,158
Okay.

299
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,368
-They're so pretty, though.
-Isn't that guy

300
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,495
a bit odd?

301
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,664
You're right. I think he's changed.

302
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,915
It feels strange.

303
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,898
I'm looking to buy a gift for someone.

304
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,320
Wait, Jun.

305
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,655
Why did you buy two
of the same face cream?

306
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,866
You left it at the door for me,
didn't you?

307
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,077
I figured Ra-ra used hers up.

308
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,251
Who the hell are you?

309
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,795
Jun, what are you doing to our customer?

310
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,839
Stop it.

311
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,134
I'm sorry, sir. Oh, dear. I'm truly sorry.

312
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,093
It's fine.

313
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,971
-I'd like to pay for this.
-Yes, sir.

314
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,073
Mimi.

315
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,409
Who do you like more? Me or Jun?

316
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,038
Why can't you answer?

317
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,709
Right, you can't talk. Okay.
Then let's do this.

318
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,544
If you like me more, just stay quiet.

319
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,715
If you like Jun more,
bark three times. Got it?

320
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,883
Let's try it again.

321
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,970
Who do you like more? Me or Jun?

322
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,809
So I'm your favorite, right?

323
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,478
I love you so much too, Mimi!

324
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,690
You like me more, right?

325
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,945
Did you run here? Why?

326
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,746
For Mimi… Because I missed Mimi.

327
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,206
Mimi, did you eat?

328
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,376
Here, you must be thirsty.

329
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,545
Yes, thanks.

330
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,840
Hey, sit down for a minute.

331
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,973
Why do you look all serious?

332
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,727
You have a student
named An Jung-ho, don't you?

333
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,020
Yes.

334
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,480
Something's strange about him,
so tell him to quit.

335
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,524
How did you know?

336
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,943
I told him today to quit his lessons.

337
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,029
Did something happen?

338
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,531
Well, it just looked like

339
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,910
he was after something else,
not learning the piano.

340
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,872
Good.

341
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,334
And if you receive another gift
from an unknown sender,

342
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,461
-report to me right away.
-Report to you?

343
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,879
Yes.

344
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,508
You're talking as if
you're my bodyguard or something.

345
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,972
I said I'll take you home.

346
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,059
-Go back inside.
-No, I'll take you home.

347
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,394
Why? I have Juju.

348
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,729
I'll drive anyway.

349
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,273
I told you, I'll go with you
and walk back home.

350
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,776
It's still hot out.
Just stay home and rest.

351
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,959
My bodyguard can't drive,
so he sits in the passenger seat.

352
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,089
I want to stay with you longer,
even if it's just ten more minutes.

353
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,134
I want to spend more time with you.

354
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,397
Then shall we go for a drive?

355
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,066
I'm your driver, you know.

356
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,862
Shall we?

357
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:22,492
I was feeling down all day,
so I can definitely go for a drive.

358
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,497
-Driver Gu, let's go.
-Yes, sir!

359
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,792
I'll eat it if you don't.

360
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,171
Hey. You should've asked
before you ate it.

361
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,048
I can't believe you already ate it.

362
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:41,594
By the way, are you still being mean
to Ra-ra?

363
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,431
I'm home.

364
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,642
Ha-yeong! Ha-yeong.

365
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,437
-Can we chat for a minute?
-I'm going to bed.

366
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,355
Wait…

367
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,986
What are you doing?
You burn everything you cook.

368
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,071
I'm making breakfast for Ha-yeong.

369
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,532
But she already went to school.

370
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,868
Already?

371
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,748
NEW MESSAGE

372
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,375
Ha-yeong, want to go for tteokbokki today?

373
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,171
I'm busy.

374
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,092
Well, I'm hating her a little.

375
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,597
Enough is enough.
I'm starting to feel so bad for her.

376
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,224
It's Jun that confessed his feelings
to her, you know.

377
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,642
Just eat this.

378
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,895
Let me talk, will you?

379
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,647
Anyway, she's so silly too.

380
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,275
Why walk on eggshells around you?
She should ignore you.

381
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,861
You idiot!

382
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,656
I like her because
she never ignores a nobody like me!

383
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,744
-So you like Ra-ra?
-What?

384
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,039
Gosh, whatever.

385
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,250
Let's go if you're done.
And you clean this up.

386
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,087
Hey! Are you all right?

387
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,093
You're bleeding. Are you okay?

388
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,596
It hurts.

389
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,855
I think you got punished
for being such a meanie.

390
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,192
I got punished? That's stupid.

391
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,069
Stay still.

392
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,312
Are you okay?

393
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,485
Obviously, I'm not okay.
Gosh, you're so annoying.

394
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,531
Sorry. Do you think you can walk?

395
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,658
Yes, of course.

396
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,710
Want a piggyback ride?

397
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,087
What? Forget it.

398
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,427
Hey, hey!

399
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,930
Hey, no. Put me down!

400
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,725
-I don't want a piggyback ride.
-Just let me carry you.

401
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,978
I don't want to. Put me down.

402
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,731
-Hey!
-Don't make me change my mind.

403
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,901
-Hey.
-Yes?

404
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,904
When did your back become so broad?

405
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,698
Why do you ask? Do I make you feel safe?

406
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,617
Jeez, give me a break.

407
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,703
I used to be much bigger than you.

408
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,248
When? Back when we were seven?

409
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,877
Hey, I was bigger than you
up until elementary school.

410
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,421
You were like a tiny booger.

411
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,842
Hey, if your boogers were this big,

412
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,427
your nose would burst.

413
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,890
Hey, I'm sliding down.

414
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,805
Should I get a trim?

415
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,474
My gosh!

416
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,359
Ra-ra.

417
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,028
-Did you use hair conditioner?
-Yes, of course.

418
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,532
How do you want your hair done?

419
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,833
I'll just leave it up to you.

420
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,002
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

421
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,753
Then I'll do whatever I want.

422
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,520
I like it. What do you think?

423
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,485
My sense of aesthetics is telling me
that this looks so weird.

424
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,410
But it's so nice to have you
do my hair and makeup.

425
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,455
-Do I look pretty?
-Yes, you look so pretty.

426
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,669
Did someone punch you in the eye?

427
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,964
And it looks like
you ate a live rat or something.

428
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,467
Did you feed her something bad?

429
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:18,014
I got my hair done by someone
who will become a famous hairstylist.

430
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,140
Who is that?

431
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,726
What do you think?
It's Ha-yeong, obviously.

432
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,688
Ra-ra, tell us.
Why did you want us to gather here?

433
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,899
I know you're busy.
Sorry to call you here.

434
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:31,110
I want you all
to meet the pride of LaLa Land.

435
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:35,114
Ta-da! You all know that Jae-min is
entering the upcoming piano competition.

436
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,283
I wanted you ladies to be his audience.

437
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,367
Jae-min!

438
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,038
-Yes!
-Let's hear it.

439
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,436
How can a kid be this good?

440
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,740
-Oh, my.
-My, I'm so proud of him.

441
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,200
He's a prodigy.

442
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,755
-My gosh.
-Look how fast his fingers are.

443
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,560
I'm tearing up.

444
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,738
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

445
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,031
-Gosh.
-Amazing.

446
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,033
-Unbelievable.
-He's so talented.

447
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,368
My gosh.

448
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,163
-Oh, gosh!
-You're so good!

449
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,372
-My gosh!
-It was great!

450
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,291
-I'm tearing up.
-He's amazing.

451
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,208
What do you think?

452
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,003
He'll do amazingly well tomorrow.

453
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,963
You can totally start celebrating now.

454
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,047
My gosh, he's so good.

455
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:20,136
What's he going to wear? He needs a suit.
Does he have a suit?

456
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,222
Oh, no. I threw out Seung-gi's old suit.
Too bad.

457
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,348
We can rent one.

458
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,142
No, don't. Let me buy one for him.

459
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,978
-What?
-I wish I had a son like him.

460
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,314
I'm so proud of him. And he's adorable!

461
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,982
-My gosh!
-He's so cute!

462
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,276
I want to buy him a suit. Can I?

463
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,320
Yes. Of course, you can.

464
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,155
You buy him a suit, Mi-ran.

465
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,240
And I'll do his hair.

466
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,911
Then I'll get a banner made for you,
Jae-min.

467
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,122
Then I'll get you some flowers.
Flowers are a must.

468
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,458
Thank you so much, all of you.

469
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:56,005
Then what about Jun, Dr. Cha, and Mr. Kim?

470
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,548
What can they do for Jae-min?

471
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,593
Mr. Kim bought an air conditioner
for this academy.

472
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,596
And this piano academy wouldn't exist
if it weren't for Jun.

473
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,848
Okay. Then if Jae-min
wins the competition,

474
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,601
we'll ask Dr. Cha to take us out
for a barbecue!

475
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,478
-Yes!
-Nice!

476
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,938
Good idea.

477
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,191
Ra-ra, Jae-min is good enough
to win the competition, right?

478
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,777
Of course! I guarantee you, 100 percent.

479
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,821
You all know my customer
who comes here from Seoul for a blowout.

480
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,781
-Yes.
-I remember.

481
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:25,034
She said Jae-min is unbelievably talented.

482
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:28,663
She boasted that she sponsors
some pianists or something like that.

483
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:32,250
I'm not sure if it's true.
But anyway, she was very impressed by him.

484
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,834
Really? She said that?

485
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,880
Yes! Oh, right. She also saw that photo

486
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,341
and said you looked familiar.

487
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,636
Maybe you met her
back in your pianist days.

488
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,845
Me?

489
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,847
You have a very common face.

490
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,643
You call that "common"?

491
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,771
Look at the size of her face.
It's about to disappear.

492
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,856
If her face is common, then what about us?

493
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,942
-How rude.
-It's our fault again, isn't it?

494
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,026
We are the odd ones.

495
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,820
-What?
-Her face is so tiny that it's…

496
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,154
Who could it be?

497
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,615
Gosh, where did I put it?

498
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,411
I remember putting it here somewhere.

499
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,625
Is this the one?

500
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,668
GU RA-RA

501
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,504
Yes, it's her.

502
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,137
GU RA-RA

503
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,974
Right.

504
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,644
Even back then,
I thought she had a screw loose.

505
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,107
But I wonder why she opened
a piano academy there.

506
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,869
Hello?

507
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,746
Hey, Si-a.

508
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,540
Ra-ra? Yes, I know her very well.

509
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,794
I heard her dad passed away
after her wedding got called off.

510
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,338
She came to see me,

511
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,424
but I couldn't help her
as I was struggling myself.

512
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,887
Then I guess you don't know
she's running a piano academy in Eunpo.

513
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,055
An academy?

514
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,349
Never mind.

515
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,352
By the way, what happened to her wedding?

516
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,813
I heard her mother-in-law
ran away with her son at the wedding.

517
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,690
What? For real?

518
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,109
I couldn't go to her wedding
because of my mom,

519
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,237
but I met the guy
she was supposed to marry.

520
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,490
Was he a doctor at Sunwoo Hospital?

521
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,118
An orthopedic surgeon, I think.

522
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,790
Don't tell me his name is Bang Jeong-nam.

523
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,793
Yes, I think his last name was Bang.

524
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,629
My goodness.

525
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,964
He's my husband's friend.

526
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,134
I didn't know he got married.

527
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,261
You guys didn't go to his wedding?

528
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,765
No. At the time, we barely talked
other than when we were

529
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,809
at each other's throats about the divorce.

530
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,063
That means

531
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,858
he's known that woman all along.

532
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,215
How are you doing,
Mr. Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star?

533
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,594
My first student is participating
in a piano competition tomorrow.

534
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:35,266
Wish us luck
so that we'll get a good result.

535
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,482
What?

536
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,779
"I hope it goes well. Best of luck."

537
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,117
Thank you, Mr. Twinkle!

538
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,752
You're already waiting outside.

539
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,255
Ms. Gu has to take care of something,
so she asked me to pick you up.

540
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,175
You know me, right?

541
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,471
Let's go.

542
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,724
Ms. Gu told me
that she'd pick me up herself.

543
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,603
Come on. I said I'll take you.

544
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,979
No.

545
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,689
-Come on. Let's go.
-Let me go.

546
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,655
Jae-min!

547
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:20,996
Gosh.

548
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,082
I'm here, Jae-min.

549
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,209
Hello, Ms. Gu.

550
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:29,380
Jae-min, you look so dashing today.

551
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,714
Did you sleep well?

552
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,840
Yes.

553
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,969
All right. Wear your seat belt.

554
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,637
Let's go!

555
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,935
Jae-min.

556
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,605
What's wrong? Did something happen?

557
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,357
No.

558
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,196
Are you nervous? Is that it?

559
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,198
Yes.

560
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,158
Don't worry.

561
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,952
You have me by your side.

562
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:02,997
Shall we get going?

563
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,254
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,467
-Why aren't they here yet?
-My gosh.

567
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,678
He's number 121.
He should be on standby soon.

568
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:18,929
-Yes.
-Exactly.

569
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,723
-See if they're outside.
-Okay.

570
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,474
There they are.

571
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,809
Hey, we're here!

572
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,894
What took you so long?

573
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,438
The traffic was bad.

574
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,148
You should've left early.

575
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,608
-He's sweating.
-Oh, no.

576
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,568
-Gosh, Jae-min.
-You're sweating.

577
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,821
Jae-min. You can do a good job, right?

578
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,199
Jae-min, just relax
and do what you usually do.

579
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,659
Okay.

580
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,202
You're late. You should hurry.

581
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,246
-Let's hurry.
-Let's go, quick.

00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,979
Yes. She has a lovely sound.

Is Jae-min next?

587
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,823
Yes. Even I'm so nervous.

588
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,867
Number 121, Shin Jae-min.

00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,163
-It's Jae-min.
-My gosh, Jae-min!

-Go, Jae-min!
-Go for it, Jae-min!

You got this!

592
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,438
Is he in pain?

593
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,190
-Did he hurt his arm?
-What's wrong?

594
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,566
Muscle cramps, maybe?

595
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,151
No, it doesn't seem so.

596
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,947
-Something's wrong with his arm.
-What's the matter with him?

597
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,376
-My gosh, he's playing with one hand.
-Why is he doing that?

598
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,048
-What's he doing?
-My goodness.

599
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,174
Is he in pain?

What's going on? Is he too nervous?

604
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,411
Bravo.

605
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,331
Bravo!

606
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:02,426
This must be how Dad felt that day.

607
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,560
Bravo!

608
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,066
It's okay to screw up a little today!

609
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,152
You played it so well yesterday.

610
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:23,197
That's right!
You've practiced so hard for today!

611
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,324
Jae-min, it's okay!

612
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,910
-It's okay!
-It's okay!

613
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,125
It must've hurt a lot.

614
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,919
How did you bear the pain?

615
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,046
The joint was dislocated.

616
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,633
Jae-min, when did you hurt your arm?

617
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,760
Why didn't you tell me you were in pain?

618
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,846
I can't believe you tried to play
with this arm.

619
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,937
I just

620
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,941
didn't want to make you sad.

621
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,402
You've been

622
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,781
so good to me.

623
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,535
I was afraid you'd hate me

624
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,121
if I screwed up.

625
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,290
That's why I didn't tell you.

626
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,423
Jae-min, that's such a silly thought.

627
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:28,595
You couldn't play in the competition,
but I still love you, Jae-min.

628
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,472
And I'll always be good to you.

629
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,558
Really?

630
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,809
Of course.

631
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,852
Get well soon.

632
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,028
-My gosh.
-It smells delicious.

633
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,739
Do you know why I love beef?
Because it cooks fast.

634
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,409
Eat lots so your arm can heal fast. Okay?

635
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,412
Guys, let's clink our glasses
to celebrate.

636
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,955
-Yes!
-Yes, totally!

637
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,040
Here's to Jae-min and LaLa Land.

638
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,001
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

639
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,338
All right, guys. This is on Dr. Cha,

640
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,382
so eat as much as you want.

641
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,675
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

642
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,177
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Dr. Cha.

643
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,556
Mom.

644
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,516
-Son! Hurry up and join us.
-What?

645
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,393
-Goodness.
-You called them?

646
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:20,856
When will they get to pig out
on premium Korean beef if not today?

647
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,399
Calm down, will you?

648
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,109
-Hello.
-Have a seat.

649
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,777
Nice, let's eat some meat.

650
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,237
-Amazing.
-Gosh, I'm annoyed.

651
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,615
I should've called Ye-seo too.

652
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,949
-Jeez.
-Please.

653
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,492
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

654
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:36,413
My, look at Seung-gi.
He could easily eat ten servings of meat.

655
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,749
-Of course, he can.
-Sure thing.

656
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,127
Thank you so much, Dr. Cha.

657
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,211
No problem.

658
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,005
Isn't this too much, though?

659
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,298
No, this is nothing.

660
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,758
Just grill the meat well.

661
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,676
Don't you worry about that.

662
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,597
-Mr. Kim, this one is a medium.
-Oh, thanks.

663
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,807
-I want mine well done.
-Well done?

664
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,476
-Eat lots.
-Thanks.

665
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:01,063
I'm the one who's paying,
but you're trying to take all the credit.

666
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,106
Gosh, what are you talking about?

667
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,316
Eat up.

668
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,276
Eat up, Jae-min.

669
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,280
One, two, three!

670
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,784
-My mom's the prettiest.
-Seung-gi, you're the best.

671
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,203
-That's way too subjective.
-No, come on.

672
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,413
-Try this wrap. Here.
-It's okay.

673
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,706
There you go.

674
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,334
-Delicious, right?
-Thank you.

675
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,836
-Do you want one more?
-Doesn't it look amazing?

676
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,713
The mushroom steak.

677
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,633
-How is it?
-Have some kimchi too.

678
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,219
You eat so well.

679
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,221
-Ladies, let's drink.
-Here.

680
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:38,642
Hey. Stop it, will you?
Gosh, you're making me uncomfortable.

681
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,602
Why? You're cute even when you're eating.

682
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,982
Here, eat lots.

683
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,279
-That's what happened.
-Really?

684
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,572
-My gosh.
-Eat up.

685
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,700
-What's going on over there?
-I see.

686
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,868
-Who knows?
-My gosh, Dr. Cha.

687
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,537
Don't you have lessons today?

688
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,040
Well, I'm skipping today.

689
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,960
I'm not in the mood to study, you know.

690
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,672
Right. You can study tomorrow
if you don't today.

691
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,633
-You, seriously.
-What?

692
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,136
This is why I like you.

693
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:22,227
Hold on, Ra-ra. Your makeup looks awful.
Come here.

694
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:26,982
Oh, just a second.

695
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,109
Hello?

696
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,903
Now? Okay, I'll be right there.

697
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,905
I need to move my car.

698
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,907
-Want me to come with you?
-No, wait here.

699
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,330
It's getting late.

700
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,790
Jae-min.

701
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,417
I'll take you home.

702
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,419
-Let's go.
-Let's get going too.

703
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,504
You have to make dinner for your hubby.

704
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:53,341
I already did. Don't you know that
he turns into a zombie when he's hungry?

705
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,553
-You should've brought that zombie.
-Yes.

706
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:59,139
People would freak out
if they saw him devour raw meat.

707
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,475
-Let's go.
-Let's go home.

708
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,143
-I'm off.
-Bye.

709
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,688
Dr. Cha, how much was it?

710
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,149
-Gosh!
-Don't ask him stuff like that!

711
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,485
Next time, we'll have a seafood feast.

712
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,944
-Nice!
-Yes!

713
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,613
I know a great seafood restaurant.

714
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,989
-That's great.
-Really?

715
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,407
-Bye, Seung-gi.
-Drive safely.

716
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,366
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

717
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,659
-See you!
-Bye, Seung-gi!

718
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,786
-Get home safely.
-Bye!

719
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:21,745
-Bye.
-Bye, Jae-min!

720
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,834
All right, we're here.

721
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,923
Thank you.

722
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:36,802
You have to be careful with your arm
until it fully heals.

723
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,553
Okay.

724
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:44,142
Jae-min, there's something
I wanted to ask you all day.

725
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,228
How did you hurt your arm?

726
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,272
That's…

727
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:53,235
It's okay. Even if it happened
while you were goofing around,

728
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,194
I won't scold you.

729
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,571
Actually,

730
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:00,492
a man who comes to the academy
came by earlier.

731
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,577
A man?

732
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,456
He said Ms. Gu had asked him
to pick me up.

733
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,084
He said he'd take me to the venue
and pulled my arm.

734
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,963
But I kept resisting
and ended up dislocating the joint.

735
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,384
Who could it be?

736
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,681
JIN HA-YEONG

737
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,935
-Hello?
-Dr. Cha, where are you now?

738
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,271
I took Jae-min home,
and I'm on the road now.

739
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,147
What's up? Did something happen?

740
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,664
The person you are calling is
not available…

741
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,040
Is she not picking up?

742
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,000
No.

743
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,377
Ra-ra left after getting a call?

744
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,589
Yes, someone asked her to move her car.

745
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,592
I'll go look for her.

746
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,260
Please take Mr. Kim home.

747
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,929
No, I'll go look for her too.

748
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,891
Jun and I will look for her
and let you know. It's getting late.

749
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:10,061
Yes, Mr. Kim.
We all know how unpredictable Ra-ra is.

750
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:13,189
I'm sure she followed a cat
or something. Meow.

751
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:17,319
I bet she's meowing
at the cat like this now. Right?

752
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:21,948
Meow.

753
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,255
JUN

754
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:38,840
Why is this here?

755
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,301
What's that?

756
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,428
Isn't this Ra-ra's phone?

757
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,097
Where's her car? I don't see it.

758
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:50,852
Can you go to LaLa Land and see if she's
there? If not, call the police.

759
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,521
-Okay. What about you?
-I have to make a quick stop.

760
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,833
"An Jung-ho, Unit 203."

761
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,752
Unit 203…

762
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,324
This is…

763
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,368
I can't believe this.

764
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,996
STUDENT ID CARD

765
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,403
SPRING 2019

766
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:38,830
I'm sorry.

767
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,498
No worries.

768
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,429
A watermelon juice, please.

769
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,060
Where did my purse go?

770
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,689
Where are you, my dear purse?

771
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,567
Where did it go?

772
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,821
I'm sorry. This has never
happened to me before.

773
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,975
STUDENT ID CARD

774
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,093
Ra-ra!

775
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,303
Jun, to tell you the truth,

776
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,556
-I've been curious about you.
-Ra-ra!

777
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,848
Ra-ra.

778
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,727
-Get him in the car.
-Jun.

779
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,604
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

780
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,566
Sunwoo Jun. Born in 2002, age 19.

781
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,693
What? What do you mean Jun is 19?

782
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:35,238
Would you feel good to hear a precious
someone's secret from someone else?

783
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,865
That was the loudest
I could speak out against Dad.

784
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,742
How could you hide it from him?

785
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:44,747
Keep on worrying about what others think.
I'll figure out what to do with my life.

786
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,834
You're that piano girl.
You met Sunwoo Jun's mom, didn't you?

787
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,836
I'm looking for Sunwoo Jun.

788
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,213
Oh, that boy? He just left.

789
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:57,885
