2
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,280
Don't move.

3
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,040
Tong, our boss wants to see you.

4
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,680
If you don't want to die in a bad way,

5
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,560
just come with me.

6
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,320
Boss came from such a far place.

7
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,120
I should be the one to visit him.

8
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,760
Then let's go.

9
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,840
All right, wait here.

10
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,660
Whoa, hey!

11
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,540
Oh, my God!

12
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,040
Something time has taken and is already unlinked.

13
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,000
So you've got a special어

14
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,380
forよう

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:11,040
For the

16
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,920
I'll contact you.

17
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,080
You can find me anytime.

18
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,200
And he can't leave without saying goodbye.

19
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Is the surveillance still on?

20
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,000
Probably...

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
I'll go find it myself.

22
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,640
Zhong Qingyang.

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,960
You were just a dog on the street.

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,680
I took you in.

25
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,920
How dare you betray me?

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,320
Five million.

27
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,520
You've made me lose five million.

28
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,680
Boss.

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,360
This isn't South Asia.

30
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,120
You can't run away even if you kill me.

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,080
If you don't, I'll go back with you.

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,560
This life is yours.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,000
Who wants your life?

34
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,720
Boss.

35
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,240
Boss.

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
They have a knife?

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,680
They're from South Asia.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
Mr. Xia, you were in the elevator.

39
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,640
Luckily, you didn't run into them.

40
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,760
He didn't want me to be in danger.

41
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,120
That's why he left with them.

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,720
They're so scary.

43
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,960
Shall we call the police?

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,680
No.

45
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,400
Zhong Qingyang is still in their hands.

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,560
They're the ones who died.

47
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,760
I'm afraid that if we call the police,

48
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
they'll kill Zhong Qingyang.

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
The location information.

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Xia Nan.

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,960
The daughter of Zhong Xia Group.

52
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,960
Isn't she the good sister of Miss Ji?

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,920
No wonder you betrayed me.

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,840
If you hand her life over to Miss Ji,

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,440
we'll have a chance to make a fortune.

56
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,200
Go.

57
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,440
Beat them.

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,160
Don't even think about going out.

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,440
Kill them.

60
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,820
Beat them.

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,320
It's nearby.

62
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,280
Search it!

63
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,620
Started opening the door.

64
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,680
It's me!

65
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,900
Duet for Song Карл pas, I'd not stop to let her rest

66
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
tears

67
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,040
Zhou Xiaoyong

68
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,920
Zhou Xiaoyong

69
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,480
Zhou Xiaoyong

70
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,120
Zhong Xiyang.

71
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,600
Zhong Xiyang.

72
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,200
Zhong Xiyang, wake up.

73
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,640
Zhong Xiyang.

74
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,200
Zhong Xiyang, wake up!

75
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,480
You take me to the sky

76
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,480
And you take away the pain

77
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
Because I see the first way

78
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Whenever you smile

79
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,480
You're so beautiful to me

80
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Can you see

81
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,480
You're so beautiful to me

82
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,480
You said you were going to be my guardian angel

83
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,480
In the wind, in the rain, even if this is not enough

84
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,480
You love me

85
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,480
I want to thank you for the courage you gave me

86
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,480
You're already in the air when I'm running away

87
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,480
You're in the air when I'm running away

88
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,480
You're already far away

89
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Why do I have to love you without hesitation

90
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,480
From this heaven to the ruins

91
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Why are you the only one in the relationship

92
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,480
The wife you can't get

93
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Why do I have to love you without hesitation

94
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,480
In exchange for this love

95
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Don't you have a little bit of you
