1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Zhong Xinyao,

2
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,960
let's get married.

3
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,360
I said,

4
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,320
this is the only thing

5
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,720
I can buy at this moment.

6
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,640
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,000
You married me without asking me anything.

8
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,560
You didn't ask your family?

9
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,560
No need.

10
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,120
They're all dead.

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,400
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,280
It's not necessary.

13
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,600
You got me out of that hellhole.

14
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,360
You made me a daughter-in-law and a bodyguard.

15
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,760
You made me a bridegroom.

16
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,320
Who would be afraid of money?

17
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,680
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
We'll divorce after I get the shares.

19
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
You'll have enough money

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,040
to live a carefree life for the rest of your life.

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,040
Okay.

22
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,840
After you get married,

23
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,240
you'll be the CEO's assistant

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,320
and join the board.

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,120
There are many risks ahead.

26
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,240
Okay.

27
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,040
Do you have any conditions?

28
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,480
I have one.

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,640
During the contract,

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,240
you can't cook anywhere.

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,160
Don't ask.

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,080
I don't like it if you ask.

33
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,320
Happy cooperation.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,720
Happy cooperation.

35
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,520
Happy wedding!

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,800
Happy wedding!

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
Tomorrow, go back to the Xia family

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,720
to meet those two old foxes.

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,440
They're cunning and cunning.

40
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,000
So without my permission,

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,320
you can't do anything rash.

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,480
Don't leave any evidence.

43
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,080
Do you understand?

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,920
You must listen to me.

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,360
I'll listen to my wife.

46
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,480
Don't call me that in private.

47
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay.

48
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,040
Wife.

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,680
Got it.

50
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,960
How may I help you?

51
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,920
I've married

52
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,680
Zhong Xinying

53
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,600
will be the male lead of this Xia family.

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,200
Have you chosen her as your husband?

55
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,200
So casually.

56
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,000
You change your husband so quickly.

57
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,720
You change one every day.

58
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
It's not as fast as you ran yesterday.

59
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,520
Yet you left me with no word.

60
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,080
We are here in your name.

61
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,040
Wait forIA's decision.

62
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,320
Okay.

63
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,120
Hello.

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I told you.

65
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,520
The wild dogs outside are pitiful.

66
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,120
Just give them something to eat.

67
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
Who told you to bring them back?

68
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,120
I also told my mom that

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,320
if the wild dogs outside are gentle,

70
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,520
then forget it.

71
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,120
But if it's a...

72
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,320
A white-eyed wolf?

73
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Come on.

74
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,920
Come on, get it out.

75
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Yes.

76
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
You...

77
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
I set up a memorial tablet

78
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,720
in your mom's room.

79
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,920
Go up and pay your respects.

80
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,720
Tell her about this.

81
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,720
I went to my mom's room

82
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,320
to ask them

83
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,720
to remember what I said last night.

84
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Mom,

85
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,520
if I could go back earlier,

86
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,320
would you be safe?

87
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,720
I will definitely take back Zhong Xia

88
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,520
and avenge you.

89
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Little bodyguard,

90
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,120
you care so much about your master.

91
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,120
No wonder you can't be moved by so much money.

92
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,320
So you're not just looking for money.

93
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,920
You're also interested in your master.

94
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,120
What do you think Xia Nan likes about you?

95
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Or do you have something special?

96
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,920
You made my sister so happy.

97
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,920
She must be very experienced.

98
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,720
Take it away.

99
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,720
Don't touch it.

100
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,120
She used to be a product seller in South Asia.

101
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,920
If she has infectious disease,

102
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:26,080
her body will be full of

103
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,120
bit strong connections.

104
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,920
γά

105
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Wait.

106
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,880
The last one.

107
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,200
Let him take it off himself.

108
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,600
Let's see.

109
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,060
It's as thin as a monkey.

110
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Too much?

111
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,980
Throw that away if you kill me.

112
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,620
Send to rest death.

113
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,160
OK.

114
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,000
Get it off.

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,800
Got it.

116
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,140
Pas.

117
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,980
Pas.

118
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,840
Never mind.

119
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,340
Never mind.

120
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,860
vacate with chair.

121
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:50,920
Take a look.

122
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,740
You did well.

123
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:51,960
OK.

124
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,200
Huo,

125
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,720
it's youriani.

126
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,320
Xia'nuo.

127
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,320
Xia'nuo.

128
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,720
Xia'nuo.

129
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,360
Who told you to hurt my husband?

130
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,440
Xia'nuo.

131
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,080
No.

132
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,240
Xia'nuo.

133
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,080
Xia'nuo.

134
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,600
Xia'nuo.

135
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,160
You...

136
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,480
What are you doing?

137
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,240
I haven't settled the case

138
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,480
about the cold warehouse yet.

139
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,640
Xia'nuo.

140
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,760
Don't be a coward.

141
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,200
Bring all the dirty stuff

142
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,160
to the Xia family.

143
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,280
You know that this is the Xia family,

144
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,040
not the Ji family.

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,200
I brought my husband back

146
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,240
to show you my respect.

147
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,400
Don't be so shameless.

148
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,760
Your clothes are dirty.

149
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,040
Let's go change.

150
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,160
You...

151
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,560
You're still laughing?

152
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,000
Did you not know that

153
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,160
someone scolded you?

154
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,920
Didn't you tell me last night

155
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,360
not to act rashly?

156
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,480
I'm just following your orders.

157
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,000
So you can't act rashly

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,240
without my instructions.

159
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,600
You can't leave any evidence.

160
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,120
Understand?

161
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,040
You must be obedient.

162
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,560
I should listen to my wife.

163
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,640
Why don't I see you being so obedient?

164
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,520
Come here.

165
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,160
You're my husband now.

166
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,440
I won't allow anyone to bully you.

167
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,840
Do you know that?

168
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,880
I realized that it's quite wrong

169
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,840
to be your husband.

170
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,040
So don't be a disgrace

171
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,160
to me from now on.

172
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,720
Understand?

173
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,760
Okay, honey.

174
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,440
Congratulations, Mr. Xia.

175
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,120
You're finally back.

176
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,160
Congratulations, Mr. Xia.

177
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,280
Congratulations, Mr. Xia.

178
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Congratulations, Mr. Xia.

179
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,320
Congratulations, Mr. Xia.

180
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,840
I believe that Mr. Xia

181
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,080
can be comforted in the Spirit of Heaven.

182
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,880
May I ask if I can

183
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,960
inherit my mother's trust share now?

184
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,000
Sorry.

185
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,200
You don't deserve to inherit my mother's share.

186
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,560
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,440
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,360
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
