1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,280
kannst du, ans, du Harley te monitoring

2
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,480
I could only look forward to a beautiful start

3
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,620
evacuate all detected

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:56,100
Destroy the brief am

5
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
Episode 16

6
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,540
Dad, what are you talking about?

7
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,660
Ran Ran.

8
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,940
You'll take care of Zhong Xia from now on.

9
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,060
Your mom and Nuo Er have left.

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,420
Zhong Xia can only count on you.

11
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,180
I'll try my best, dad.

12
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,820
I hope everyone can support me.

13
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,460
Okay.

14
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,180
Okay.

15
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:24,900
Okay.

16
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,820
After all,

17
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,860
I can see her

18
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,660
in the TV.

19
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,860
There's one more thing.

20
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,740
Xiao Zhe.

21
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,100
Xiao Zhe.

22
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,460
Come here.

23
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,940
This is Nuo Er's mom.

24
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,540
The engagement ring that was originally reserved for you and Nuo Er.

25
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,700
Now,

26
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,220
Nuo Er is no longer here.

27
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,380
I'll help you complete

28
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,860
the marriage agreement between Xia Meng and you.

29
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,380
This is also the biggest regret

30
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,180
that I have for Nuo Er.

31
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,620
Thank you.

32
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,020
The bride and groom

33
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,700
are absent.

34
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,020
It is not mine.

35
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,140
What did you just regret?

36
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,180
What should I do?

37
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,420
Don't let others know we're not a match for the Xia family.

38
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,540
Nuo'er.

39
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,420
You're still alive.

40
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,020
How did you get hurt?

41
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,020
Nuo'er.

42
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,740
Nuo'er.

43
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,580
Sister.

44
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,580
I'm so happy that you're back.

45
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,340
So beautiful.

46
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,140
My posthumous photo is so beautiful.

47
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,180
Thank you, sister.

48
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,860
You really made a beautiful funeral for me.

49
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,860
Don't worry about the inheritance.

50
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,580
Just return it to me.

51
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,500
Sister, you escaped from death.

52
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,140
Next time,

53
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,780
you must be careful when you go out alone.

54
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,580
Otherwise, if something happens to you,

55
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,820
what will happen to my father and me?

56
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,460
Nuo'er.

57
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,900
Nuo'er, don't be impulsive.

58
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,420
Sister.

59
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,580
I'm just kidding.

60
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,380
Why are you always fooled by me?

61
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,540
Why is it so big?

62
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,180
The ring is not your size.

63
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,380
It's okay.

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,340
They often have such a fight.

65
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,460
It's okay.

66
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,260
Brother.

67
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,860
Since I'm not dead yet,

68
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,260
our engagement is valid.

69
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,740
It's just a 1999і US bombing.

70
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,740
Yes.

71
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:58,700
Really nice.

72
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,020
Or us period.

73
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:00,660
Oo.

74
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,900
Do I have her in the picture?

75
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,060
Put it anywhere in the picture.

76
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,820
Thank you, sister.

77
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,300
Please don't bother my sister.

78
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,180
Let's go!

79
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,960
One,

80
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,040
two,

81
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,160
three,

82
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,740
four,

83
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,280
five,

84
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,380
six,

85
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,460
seven.

86
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,720
Eight,

87
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,420
nine,

88
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,260
ten.

89
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,140
Twenty-one,

90
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:41,920
ер we're done.

91
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,660
Twenty-one,

92
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,740
the bigger one.

93
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,060
I was just kidding.

94
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,060
I was just kidding.

95
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,140
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,100
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,940
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,580
Are you okay?

99
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:08,940
I'm fine.

100
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,900
Listen to me.

101
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,900
Dad!

102
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,060
Do you know that because of your impulsive action today,

103
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,900
you almost got us all killed?

104
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,540
Then what should we do?

105
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,420
Find out what happened in South Asia.

106
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,980
Why didn't Xia Nuan die?

107
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
What about Brother Zhe?

108
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,580
I've been working so hard for so long.

109
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,900
I'm not willing to give up.

110
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,340
Why are you so anxious?

111
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,660
Do you think this marriage

112
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,020
can be settled so easily?

113
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,100
Uncle Jin, Zhong Xia,

114
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,220
everyone wants to have a taste of it.

115
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,820
Now, the only thing that can make Xia Nuan die

116
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,340
is you and me.

117
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,900
Don't worry.

118
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,700
Let's help each other.

119
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:55,940
Okay.

120
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,060
Congratulations!

121
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,820
Congratulations!

122
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,260
Thank you.

123
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,060
Thank you.

124
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,620
Thank you.

125
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,140
I don't know what my mom is thinking.

126
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,940
She insisted on getting married to get the letter.

127
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,180
Isn't it because I'm worried that you're not taken care of?

128
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,820
Brother, thank you

129
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,220
for your cooperation.

130
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,500
Don't worry.

131
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
When I get the letter and get Zhong Xia back,

132
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,220
we can get a divorce.

133
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,660
It won't be a problem.

134
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,860
Do whatever you want.

135
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,860
Don't worry.

136
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,700
I'll support all your decisions.

137
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,940
My parents are here.

138
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,860
I'll go get them.

139
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,260
Yes, sir.

140
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,220
Are you okay?

141
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,700
I didn't mean what you said.

142
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,700
How dangerous it is!

143
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,660
What's the matter?

144
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,860
How are you?

145
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,780
Bird's Nest has been hurt.

146
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,260
Are you okay?

147
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,220
It's not an accident.

148
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,180
Someone wanted to kill you.

149
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,180
You're responsible.

150
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,140
It's Ji Yan Tao and a man.

151
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,420
Go after him.

152
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,180
What's wrong with you?

153
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,220
My brother is coming back.

154
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,660
He's fine.

155
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,340
Is he awake?

156
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,060
Go.

157
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,220
How did you do it?

158
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,580
If you hurt my sister,

159
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,460
who will take responsibility?

160
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,660
She must be scared.

161
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,380
Take her to rest.

162
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:29,980
Yes.

163
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,980
Miss, please come in.

164
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,940
No need.

165
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,340
I've been taking care of her.

166
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,180
I'll do it.

167
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,340
Let's go.

168
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,580
Let's go back.

169
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,420
Didn't I tell you to go back to your hometown?

170
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,780
Miss,

171
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,820
they want to hurt you.

172
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,380
Xia left you something important

173
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,220
before he died.

174
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,580
Come with me.

175
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,620
Okay, let's go.

176
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,940
Why are there no movements

177
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,500
in these two old foxes?

178
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:31,340
Tian

179
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,340
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,340
Open the door.

181
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Open the door.

182
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,340
I'll leave Guangdong with you.

183
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Wait for me in the hall.

184
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Sorry.

185
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,340
The number you have dialed is not available.

186
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,340
It's connected.

187
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
Please try again later.

188
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Okay.

189
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,340
I'll wait for you in the hall.

190
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
Okay.

191
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
I'll wait for you in the hall.

192
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
Okay.

193
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
I'll wait for you in the hall.

194
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
Sorry.

195
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
Drink less.

196
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Your body will get warm.

197
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,340
Be careful of heat.

198
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,340
Where is Xia Men?

199
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,340
Aren't you a dead bodyguard?

200
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,340
She's dead.

201
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,340
Let me go if you dare.

202
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,340
I'll double the money she gave you.

203
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,380

204
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,340

I'll talk.

209
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
I can't be safe.

210
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,860
My mother's hatred hasn't been avenged.

211
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,380
I must keep my strength.

212
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,300
I can't sleep.

213
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,780
If I can't sleep,

214
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,020
I won't be able to wake up again.

215
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,980

216
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,020

232
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,860
Why you never smile

233
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,860
You're so beautiful to me

234
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,660

Jin Yiren

240
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,860
You did what happened to Xia Nuan today

241
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,620
Brother Zhe

242
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,300
Why you think I did everything

243
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,780
for Xia Nuan

244
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,420
I grew up with you

245
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,620
Why you only care about Xia Nuan

246
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,860
I like you more than Xia Nuan

247
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,460
We are a match

248
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,420
Xia Nuan doesn't deserve it

249
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,140
Enough

250
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,940
You don't want to fight with her

251
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,660
Don't blame me for hurting Xia Nuan

252
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,740
My clinicians

253
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,820
I'm going!

254
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,860
I can't get it.

255
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,020
Don't think about it.

256
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,860
I'm here to see you.

257
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,860
I want to thank you for the courage you gave me.

258
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,860
You're already far away from me

259
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:52,860
when you're running away from me.

260
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,860
Why should I love you without hesitation?

261
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,860
From heaven to ruins,

262
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:07,860
why is it that you're still my wife in love?

263
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,860
Why should I love you without hesitation?

264
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,860
From heaven to ruins,

265
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:21,860
don't you have any pity?
