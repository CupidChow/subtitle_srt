00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,120
So

17
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,520

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,160

When You歲

23
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,660
Don't go.

24
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,420
It's cold.

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,980
The most terrifying thing is

26
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,340
not to leave.

27
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,420
I won't leave.

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,180
In the night,

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,660
I'll put on a mask.

30
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,380
It's okay.

31
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,460
It's okay now.

32
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,580
I've been through this difícil time.

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,620
Seriously.

34
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,460
If you leave,

35
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,420
you'll suffer so much.

36
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,960
You dare say

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,340
you'll suffer because of me?

38
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,780
He

39
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,540
has arrived.

40
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,220
Really?

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,380
I want to thank you for the courage you gave me

42
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,380
In my way, you are already turning in the wrong direction

43
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,380
You have long been...

44
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,380
Even the closest person wants her life

45
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,380
Who can protect her?

46
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,380
Why do I have to love you without any reason?

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,380
From heaven to ruins

48
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,380
How can you be the only one in my heart?

49
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,380
Why do I have to love you without any reason?

50
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,380
From heaven to ruins

51
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,380
How can you be the only one in my heart?

52
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,380
Why do I have to love you without any reason?

53
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,380
From heaven to ruins

54
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,380
How can you be the only one in my heart?

55
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,380
I love you

56
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,380
You're awake

57
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,380
Is there anything else that is uncomfortable?

58
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,380
I love you

59
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,380
So you can sew me a wound

60
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,380
Because you look like a fox

61
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,380
No

62
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,380
Because I can sew wounds

63
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,380
I sewed all the wounds on my body

64
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,380
Buy a new dress

65
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,380
The rest is the bonus for this month

66
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,380
What do you think I am?

67
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,380
I'm going back to the company

68
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,380
Have some ginger tea

69
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,380
Sit here

70
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,380
I installed a positioning system on your phone

71
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,380
As long as we don't turn off

72
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,380
We can keep in touch

73
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
You can find me anytime

74
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,380
I'm going to the company

75
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,380
I'm going to the company

76
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,380
I'm going to the company

77
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,380
I'm going to the company

78
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,380
I'm going to the company

79
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,380
I'm going to the company

80
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,380
I'm going to the company

81
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,380
I'm going to the company

82
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm going to the company

83
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,380
I'm going to the company

84
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,380
I'm going to the company

85
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,380
I'm going to the company

86
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,380
I'm going to the company

87
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,380
I'm going to the company

88
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,380
Eunuch Zhou's heart is small

89
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,380
I don't expect that

90
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,380
His heart is small

91
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,380
Hello

92
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,380
Xia Yu, something happened to Mr. Meng

93
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,380
What ?

94
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,380
Mr. Meng is not in critical danger

95
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
But his legs are seriously injured

96
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,380
He may be disabled

97
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,380
Please be prepared

98
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,580
I'll go buy you a bottle of water.

99
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,780
Mr. Xia.

100
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,500
Mr. Chen.

101
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,420
I've contacted you

102
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,660
to tell you about Mr. Meng.

103
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,060
But he said

104
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,060
that Miss Ji has been at the door of Meng's house

105
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,060
for a day and a night.

106
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,620
She also gave Gao E a large amount of money.

107
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,140
So he decided not to sue her.

108
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,060
You didn't catch a cold yesterday, right?

109
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,180
Are you feeling better?

110
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,860
I want to give this flower to Brother Zhe.

111
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,860
If you like it,

112
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,660
give it to me.

113
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,780
Sister, why are you so upset with Hua?

114
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,860
You scared me.

115
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,940
Didn't the doctor say

116
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,980
that she might just be disabled?

117
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,100
Isn't she still alive?

118
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,140
If anything happens to my brother's leg,

119
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,900
you'll be in jail

120
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,300
for the rest of your life.

121
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,220
Sister,

122
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,980
you should be worried.

123
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,620
Aunt Xia just left.

124
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,900
If anything happens to Brother Zhe,

125
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,540
I'm afraid people will say that you're a bad person.

126
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,700
Don't you like to rob me?

127
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,740
Do you still want to rob me?

128
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,660
Do you really want to rob me?

129
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,940
It costs you a cent less.

130
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,700
Do you regret it?

131
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,700
If you calmed down,

132
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,580
you might have said more.

133
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,700
If I didn't have my idea,

134
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,660
it would be good for you.

135
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,180
Xie Ke

136
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,540
Xiao Yi

137
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,940
My room is clear.

138
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,260
No, the people in your room

139
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,980
are not allowed in this room.

140
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,140
Go to their room.

141
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,900
If she has any trouble,

142
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,860
It can't surprise me!

143
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm scared!

144
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,940
One, two, three, four, five, six

145
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,420
Don't kill me.

146
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,820
Let go of me!

147
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,940
Let go of me!

148
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,500
Let go of me!

149
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,140
I want to kill him!

150
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,100
Kill him!

151
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,900
You will go to jail.

152
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,900
I've made my brother my family.

153
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,380
I'm still so stupid.

154
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,620
I still want to use him.

155
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,820
I destroyed him.

156
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
Let me take you home.

157
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,380
Come on.

158
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,660
Zhong Xingyao.

159
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,820
Let's get married.

160
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,900
You said you would be my guardian angel.

161
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,900
In the wind, in the rain, even if it's a step away,

162
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,900
you love me.

163
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,900
I want to thank you for the courage you gave me.

164
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,900
When I ran away, you were already on the edge of your flight.

165
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,900
You've already been gone.

166
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,900
Why should I love you without hesitation?

167
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,900
From heaven to ruins,

168
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,900
why is it that you are the only one in my heart?

169
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,900
I can't afford to lose you.

170
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,900
Why should I love you without hesitation?

171
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,900
In exchange for this love, I have to walk on the ground.

172
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Why should I love you without hesitation?

173
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Why should I love you without hesitation?

174
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Don't you have a little love?
