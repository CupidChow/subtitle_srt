Time, please.

2
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,600
Dream the quiet universe in darkness.

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,160
I only hope for the beauty of an duckspei.

4
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Fatal Ignition

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,240
The Long Ballad

6
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,240
Episode 16

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Doctor,

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
I want both of the kidney cells.

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Miss Ji,

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,240
your kidney cell is small and your kidney is small.

11
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
One kidney is enough.

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Yes.

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Only one of them is missing.

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Take the other one to feed the dog.

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,240
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
Mr Xia,

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
we've found the man with the most menial body.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Do you want to send him to his room?

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
I can do it myself.

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
You can't enter.

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
I'll buy it.

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,240

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,240
The Long Ballad

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,240
The Long Ballad

25
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Now this is mine.

26
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
He is mine too.

27
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Sorry.

28
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Sorry.

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Sorry.

30
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
You know me?

31
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Zhong Xinying,

32
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
I want you.

33
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,240
The Long Ballad

34
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
I'll give you eight hours to prepare.

35
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Someone will contact you later.

36
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,240
The Long Ballad

37
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Sister,

38
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
come back.

39
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
You're alone abroad.

40
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,240
My parents and I are worried about you.

41
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Don't worry.

42
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
I've found Shen Yuan.

43
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I'll cure you.

44
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Sister.

45
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Sister.

46
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,240
The Long Ballad

47
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Sister.

48
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
When my father was in the Xia family,

49
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
I thought I would have a good life.

50
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:38,240
But today 글די

51
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,360
Someone else is Оng Zhishan's pseudonym.

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,820
Let's go to that reciprocated room

53
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,080
Where did you get her seal?

54
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Is she in other room?

55
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,120
Ahead of college

56
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,880
You weren't online as I thought

57
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
I'm wondering

58
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,120
whether sh зов innovative

59
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,680
as this girl

60
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,880
Don't worry, sister.

61
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,040
I'll give you a pretty photo.

62
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,720
The first shot was successful.

63
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
The anesthetic effect is almost over.

64
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,200
Hurry up and add another one.

65
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,040
Close the wound.

66
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,160
Don't let that woman live.

67
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,880
I didn't blink very much with the dressing.

68
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Last time you saved me,

69
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
hard for you

70
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,200
if you like her

71
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
in the future

72
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,320
sister, please have some Ice

73
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,120
don't worry

74
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
I am looking forward to

75
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,520
Caesar's new novel

76
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,600
The kidney is a standard.

77
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,320
You must take medicine for the rest of your life.

78
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,760
The kidney and kidney are physically and mentally unstable.

79
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,000
Be careful of the blood vessels.

80
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
It's best to prepare R21 blood vessels

81
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,840
to deal with the sudden situation.

82
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,480
Come in.

83
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,880
Who is killed by you?

84
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,680
His Majesty

85
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,160
is taking the stage

86
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,880
to return to stage three.

87
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,560
How could he be killed and killed?

88
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,120
Yi Qian accuses you

89
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,080
of being my bodyguard at least for 24 hours

90
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,680
until I gave back thexisкахmissa shower.

91
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,720
What I should help you with?

92
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,140
Since you saved my life,

93
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,920
I don't care what you do.

94
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,280
You must let him die on the way.

95
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,920
Hush.

96
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,240
Didn't they say he died in the hospital bed?

97
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,480
He has returned to China.

98
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,400
He was cheated by the South Asian bandits.

99
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,520
But don't worry, dad.

100
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,440
I won't let him come back alive.

101
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
Will you fight if you go there?

102
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,640
I won't participate in the fight.

103
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,680
There are media there.

104
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,040
Family conflicts will affect Zhou Xia's reputation.

105
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,800
I won't let those scumbags

106
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,040
ruin my mother's hard work.

107
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,080
I don't think you're good at

108
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,280
being angry.

109
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,680
I'm telling you,

110
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,600
I won't sell my life.

111
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,480
I'll be the first to run away if I'm in danger.

112
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,480
You once said you would be the angel who guards me

113
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,120
No matter in wind, rain or rain

114
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,760
Even if this step is not enough

115
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,360
You love me

116
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,840
I want to thank you for the courage you gave me

117
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,760
Take me away

118
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,360
You are already on the line of the flying list

119
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,360
You have long been far away

120
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,880
Why should I love you without hesitation

121
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,040
From heaven to ruins

122
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,520
Why is it only you

123
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,920
The wife you can't take in your feelings

124
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,000
Why should I love you without hesitation

125
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,480
In exchange for this love

126
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,640
Do you want to be with me

127
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,760
In this love

128
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Don't you have a little bit of you
