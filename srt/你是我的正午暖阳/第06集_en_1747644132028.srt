1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,760
Just tell me.

3
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,880
Stop pretending.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,720
Don't tell me

5
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,400
the one who received the million-dollar money

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,360
wasn't you.

7
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,160
I just got a picture of you and the head of South Asia.

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,240
Put your phone down.

9
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,360
You're quite interesting.

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
You killed Xia Nuan.

11
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,000
How did you sleep with him

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,400
and become his husband?

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,480
You didn't tell him to die, did you?

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,280
How much did Xia Nuan give you?

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,760
I gave you double the money.

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,240
I'll kill him now.

17
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,440
Double the money?

18
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,720
How about it?

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,760
As for the rest,

20
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,360
I can give you

21
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,720
whatever you want.

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,200
And my sister can't satisfy you

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,880
with just one money.

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,840
I'm not interested in the price of double the money.

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,280
Do you believe it or not?

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,520
I'll tell Xia Nuan

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,560
to give you no money.

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,840
You can tell her now

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,520
that your father and you

30
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,360
bribed me to kill him.

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,600
We'll be alone in the prison.

32
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,240
Okay.

33
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,800
Mr. Xia.

34
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,040
Hello.

35
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,320
I'm in the elevator.

36
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,240
I'll be up soon.

37
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
Assistant.

38
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
Mr. Xia.

39
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,400
Why haven't you sent it yet?

40
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,240
Hurry up.

41
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,440
Mr. Ji is pushing it.

42
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,160
Get lost.

43
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,520
Mr. Xia, you're finally back.

44
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,640
I miss you so much.

45
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,040
You're my assistant.

46
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,240
I'm your assistant.

47
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
I'm your assistant.

48
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
I'm your assistant.

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
I'm your assistant.

50
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,480
You're my assistant.

51
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
Who let you do this?

52
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,480
Mr. Xia, you don't even know

53
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,080
how they saved me

54
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,800
when you were not here.

55
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,680
They let me live every day...

56
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,480
Don't cry.

57
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,600
Who bullied you?

58
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,920
Give it back.

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,240
Mr. Xia.

60
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,200
Mr. Xia.

61
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,400
Where's my coffee?

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,920
Why isn't my coffee here yet?

63
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,080
Where are you?

64
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,080
Where are you?

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,720
No one is yours here.

66
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,360
I'm so angry with you.

67
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,120
I fired all the assistants

68
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,280
you and your dad hired.

69
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,640
If you're a real person,

70
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,600
get lost.

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,360
Get lost.

72
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,320
I'm not leaving today.

73
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,080
What can you do to me?

74
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,760
Mr. Xia, are you crazy?

75
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
Let me go.

76
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
Mr. Xia.

77
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Let me go.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Mr. Xia.

79
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Mr. Xia.

80
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,280
Mr. Ji is preparing to start his business.

81
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,320
If you succeed,

82
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,640
you'll be in trouble

83
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
if you fail.

84
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,280
I want to start my business.

85
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,360
I want to split up.

86
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,320
I understand.

87
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,920
What should we do now?

88
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,360
The company is seriously lacking people.

89
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,240
Hurry up and recruit new people.

90
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,640
Take their place.

91
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,160
Okay.

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Excuse me.

93
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Excuse me.

94
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,000
Where is Mr. Xia's office?

95
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,080
He's in an interview.

96
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Interview?

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,080
What are you doing?

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:50,540
Special

99
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,240
From today on,

100
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
we'll handle the interview.

101
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
You can handle the rest.

102
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Give it to me.

103
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,960
I'll go to the company.

104
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,160
I've already decided.

105
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,000
You don't want to do the kid thing.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,360
I won't force you.

107
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,640
You have an interview to find a child?

108
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
That's great.

109
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,360
You three are pretty good.

110
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Go get my assistant to register.

111
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Wait a minute.

112
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:44,720
Here,

113
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,680
I have an appointment for times.

114
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,240
I'll wait until you're done.

115
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,520
Can you work well?

116
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,840
Old Tai.

117
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm a doctor from the North.

118
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,920
Are you single?

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,520
Yes.

120
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,960
You're over 30.

121
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,560
You must be in a hurry.

122
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,760
You must have a relationship.

123
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,680
If you have a relationship,

124
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,720
will you get married?

125
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,600
If you get married,

126
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,680
will you have a baby?

127
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,720
Do I have to

128
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,120
pay you a compensation?

129
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,480
I don't need compensation.

130
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,000
No.

131
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,480
So you don't care about your wife.

132
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,360
You come out to work,

133
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,960
and let your wife

134
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
take care of the baby alone at home.

135
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,000
Do you think it's easier

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,120
to take care of the baby than to go to work?

137
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,760
You're a fool.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,240
You're not a man

139
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,320
who can have a baby with someone like him.

140
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,360
Old Tai.

141
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,840
Your previous job

142
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,120
was in the PR department of GM.

143
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,840
Yes.

144
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,760
I heard that

145
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,280
your boss likes to find

146
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,520
some handsome guys

147
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,440
to work.

148
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,720
It must be hard for you to get a job with a good face.

149
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,960
What's this?

150
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,480
What are you doing?

151
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,320
Can't you see who

152
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,440
brings 800 new eyes here?

153
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,160
You.

154
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,440
Don't be anxious.

155
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,920
I prepared some backup options for you.

156
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,360
They have to be educated,

157
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
and they have to be experienced.

158
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,240
You can choose whatever you want.

159
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,160
Try it.

160
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,720
This is the person you chose.

161
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,480
They're not in this industry.

162
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,600
What about you?

163
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,320
Why can you

164
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
even face these people?

165
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,320
You don't even have a foundation for love.

166
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,560
I didn't expect you to be so casual.

167
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,400
What foundation for love do I need?

168
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,520
They can help me get back the company.

169
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,080
What about us?

170
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,760
Do we have any foundation for love?

171
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,800
I've fired the assistants

172
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,040
that Ji Yantao's couple recruited.

173
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,760
They're now under serious confirmation.

174
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,840
I've been hiring for so long,

175
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,200
but none of them are useful.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,880
You're still laughing?

177
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,280
I was wrong to see you

178
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,000
have a baby yesterday.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
I was too harsh.

180
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
But you have to

181
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,280
have some sense of propriety in the company.

182
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,000
You don't have to help me choose.

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,640
Get out.

184
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,320
Zhou Xinyao.

185
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,160
Get out.

186
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,080
I heard you.

187
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,160
I'll go find someone else.

188
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,320
This is good.

189
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,800
Luo Miao.

190
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
It's been a long time.

191
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,880
I thought you were dead in Nanyia.

192
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm so scared.

193
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,400
Don't talk nonsense in front of them.

194
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:03,960
I understand.

195
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,080
You're handsome.

196
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,520
Boss, you're really something.

197
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,640
You can marry the daughter of your enemy,

198
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,160
and you even put me in the company.

199
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,120
You're amazing.

200
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,280
Let's get to the point.

201
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,440
All right.

202
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,920
You've been to their house.

203
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,960
Do you have any leads?

204
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,160
No.

205
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,440
That's not right.

206
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,160
It should be in the Xia family.

207
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,840
Go and check it out if you're free.

208
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,880
No.

209
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Xia Nuan is very cautious.

210
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,240
If we act rashly,

211
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,280
he'll alert us.

212
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,520
Let's get his trust first.

213
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,720
Okay.

214
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,040
That's obvious.

215
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,360
By the way,

216
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,240
a friend from Nanyia told me

217
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,600
that the leader there is a scumbag.

218
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,040
He's been asking about you.

219
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,120
You saved Xia Nuan and called the police.

220
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,160
They didn't pay you.

221
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,600
They'll definitely come after you.

222
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,440
I got it.

223
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,480
All right.

224
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,040
The princess called.

225
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,160
I'll go now.

226
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,960
Take care.

227
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,840
I'm on the elevator.

228
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,120
Come to the elevator to pick me up.

229
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,960
I'm here, Miss.

230
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,040
You'll see me when you get off.

231
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,200
Don't move.

232
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm here.

233
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,760
I'm here.

234
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,560
I'm here.

235
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,400
I'm here.

236
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,200
I'm here.

237
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
I'm here.

238
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I'm here.

239
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm here.

240
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm here.

241
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
I'm here.

242
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
I'm here.

243
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
I'm here.

244
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
I'm here.

245
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
I'm here.

246
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm here.

247
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I'm here.

248
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm here.

249
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm here.

250
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
I'm here.

251
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I'm here.

252
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I'm here.

253
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm here.

254
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm here.

255
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm here.

256
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
I'm here.

257
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm here.

258
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm here.

259
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm here.

260
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm here.

261
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
I'm here.
