1
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:48,433
Our family fell apart due to my father's business failure.

2
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:51,469
busy mother

3
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:53,538
younger brother

4
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:56,241
I had to work hard to earn money

5
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:59,244
but i have cancer

6
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:02,647
1 year is too short

7
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:06,651
Where should I spend the remaining won until I die?

8
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:59,103
it's my wish

9
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:02,106
There is a fire and algae show earlier.

10
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:04,308
boat ride

11
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:08,045
double the earth

12
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:12,049
There are a lot of people coming and going

13
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:53,457
I'm struggling

14
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:03,233
Guys, let's get ready to open.

15
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:15,279
It's not enough for your company.

16
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:18,549
Oh listen, write it over there

17
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:30,360
yes you are here

18
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:34,865
Make money this week and take good care of your internal affairs

19
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,336
let's just

20
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:58,922
That's where it came from

21
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:01,925
I don't even have a gift.

22
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:11,468
It seems that there will be something to do in the near future

23
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:15,105
This is just a little bit of me, the people and the team members

24
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:20,310
And above all, I wanted to make money.

25
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,279
Let's bet on my last door

26
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,015
I don't go on a ship in Denmark

27
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:29,018
Boss, I'm taking savings

28
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:57,013
that jogyu ah baeda

29
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,416
I should be in Gredan

30
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,251
that wasn't it

31
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:04,520
Please teach me holdom

32
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,195
I don't know what the story is

33
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:16,198
I've seen a lot of people who just closed the holder and broke it.

34
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:21,003
It's easy to access, but it's easy to play with property like ice cream.

35
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:25,041
please let me know

36
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:29,845
I have a seed mother

37
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:31,680
What is Sidmon?

38
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,683
Seed money you can play

39
00:07:35,117 --> 00:07:36,986
They say there are 5 people

40
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:39,989
The more you play the game, the more likely someone will die

41
00:07:41,157 --> 00:07:44,159
If I had 2 or 3 thousand, I would last for a month or two

42
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:50,432
I said I wanted to learn every hole

43
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,236
Then, I'll think about it when I'm ready for 20 million won by tomorrow.

44
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:08,751
Did you achieve a lot?

45
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:11,754
Yes, you will get a lot next time

46
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,589
yes ok come again

47
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:21,163
It's money from your affiliate country.

48
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:38,046
What did you say your name was?

49
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:42,217
do you? Is it Kim Tak-goo’s selected ball or batted ball?

50
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:46,288
Set up from head to toe to look dandy

51
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:50,125
The gold bar is definitely a gamble.

52
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,128
You must never die in a hurry because you look like hogwa or soybean paste

53
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:57,966
People watch and play every single one of those things.

54
00:08:59,134 --> 00:09:02,504
If you don't show off supernatural, have a temper, and have no patience

55
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:06,408
You won't even have the seed money you've found so hard right now.

56
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:11,479
follow me

57
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:24,826
Hey what is this floor

58
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:27,796
I'm thinking a bit too

59
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:29,864
solve very well

60
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:31,166
Take care of Nereke

61
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:55,990
She said she was reporter Kang, who was quite famous on the floor.

62
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:59,727
Run a store and put handymen in accordance with the amount and size

63
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:03,464
It's a kind of agency concept that also receives dividends.

64
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:18,246
This is Taku's furniture.

65
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:21,249
come this way

66
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:26,620
You can see the table on the left.

67
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,124
Numbers 1 through 9 from the left of the middle dealer

68
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,761
Almost 1 is 5, the 8th place is full of 9 people

69
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:36,764
In foreign countries, I play even if there are five of me

70
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:40,234
Two people can rotate

71
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:42,303
I know the number three

72
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,306
Have you ever missed your friends from school?

73
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:47,575
Grandpa is just like that

74
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:50,578
However, X-Rate is the second of the two

75
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:53,881
Just note that this is the lowest line.

76
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:57,351
Look, that's Dealer Botenboy over there.

77
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:04,224
Starting from the left, the blinds called small bigs are made.

78
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,996
1000 won here is 1000 won

79
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:12,266
You can think of it as a kind of Mtic school concept.

80
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:16,970
Handy players can bet up to their chips.

81
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:21,241
Due to the nature of Norimi Foldem, it is possible to go all-in at once.

82
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:28,582
Betting with a millennium is triple la, you see it over there

83
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:34,187
If three shared cards are laid out on the table, it is a turn if more plazas are laid out.

84
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:37,991
Call the fifth and final card the River.

85
00:11:51,104 --> 00:11:54,107
Selling per Siudang

86
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:57,878
fits in one room

87
00:11:57,878 --> 00:12:00,881
Crayons over the weekend

88
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:04,451
Remember Aha!

89
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:06,086
You don't have an out experience

90
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:09,055
oh i see

91
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:15,128
It is a game called Hold'em that has many variables until the last card.

92
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:18,865
I like to call this last fifth card the River.

93
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:24,471
Whether or not to cross the Yeodang River seemed like the last sign of fate.

94
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,042
That's the biggest attraction of this game.

95
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,853
How about riding and watching for a few days?

96
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:43,156
can you do it?

97
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:46,626
It's a practice from now on

98
00:12:50,663 --> 00:13:15,755
Serving, here is the chip price and all-in ticket

99
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:26,933
Our house will be valid

100
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,941
I guess I'm not good at riding

101
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:38,277
how much do you have now?

102
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,479
Obulwi himself has

103
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,717
If 500 out of 20 million won in one day, the preamble is gone.

104
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:49,421
Wouldn't it be nice to continue the original delivery?

105
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:53,259
I'm going back to this for today

106
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:18,417
Am I really not good at it?

107
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:23,122
Yeah let's think back to what we played

108
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,892
what was the problem

109
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:51,149
I thought you wouldn't come right now, but if you did, you wouldn't even start.

110
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,620
please protect me

111
00:14:57,055 --> 00:15:00,058
look over there

112
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,628
how is it? What do you see?

113
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:07,165
Yesterday I was reckless

114
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,638
I see a guy with a hat over there

115
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:17,809
take a good look

116
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:20,812
When betting on a card that comes out of a tight hand

117
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:24,849
When fiddling with 10s, betting and bluffing

118
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,186
You count 10 slowly and push it in.

119
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:31,856
All gamblers have a habit

120
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:34,826
it's hard to fix

121
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:37,362
Think about Mr. Ride yesterday

122
00:15:37,362 --> 00:15:39,864
what was the problem

123
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:42,800
Without reading the other person's expression or pen

124
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,803
He died after only looking at his own hand and shouting ducks.

125
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:50,542
And don't forget that position is important too

126
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:58,549
Watching from a distance, I saw the little mistakes I had made.

127
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,553
After all, the flow of the game is not about fighting gold with two arms.

128
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:06,024
It's a game where one or two players at a table take blind money.

129
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:09,660
If you don't see Hogu, you know I'm Hogu

130
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:59,877
I really have everything

131
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:17,961
it was a lie

132
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,434
always quit

133
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:30,874
that living

134
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:33,877
does not make sense

135
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:46,823
I admit that I am self-contradictory

136
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:54,731
not doing it yourself

137
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:03,440
said

138
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:26,162
fortunately taboo

139
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:31,801
Shall we talk for a minute?

140
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:42,812
what a waste so far

141
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:48,351
2006 Doolos, who couldn’t get what he achieved at first, there were seconds and seconds

142
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:53,056
Then let's put our blinds up

143
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:11,040
I did

144
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,444
Here are the blinds for 5,000 won and 10,000 won.

145
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:18,147
The minimum buyin is 1 million won

146
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:22,051
the player is right

147
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:34,897
Are you done again? what?

148
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:39,268
Ah, if you are strong, that little dot day will rise

149
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:44,640
hold on bro

150
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:48,811
Ramos recorded 20 full time with 30 minutes left

151
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:52,314
I was careful like this, but I got out right away.

152
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:34,456
I'm not the boss, Joe.

153
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:38,227
Seeing earlier, you seem to be picking up a lot. Why don’t you size up a bit?

154
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:41,230
yo. this? Let me introduce you

155
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,034
It's a 5-person security game, and my close brother plays it.

156
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:50,606
I think it would be a good time to go now. Would you like to go?

157
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:53,875
I shouldn't have gone there then

158
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:07,022
This is the person I was introduced to.

159
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:15,697
simply cow

160
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:22,871
er's friend

161
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:27,442
The friend who seems to be doing well under famous places these days is definitely handsome

162
00:21:32,213 --> 00:21:35,216
He raised me from the time I was just serving.

163
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:39,087
It doesn't help that pregnant women's breasts are big

164
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:41,289
good luck my boss

165
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:45,026
It's all right that the military water compatriots ordered everything

166
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:50,131
no holder

167
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:52,267
I'll just teach you other things

168
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:57,372
what? Bread?

169
00:21:58,306 --> 00:21:59,908
Shall we start the game?

170
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:02,911
And one more drink at the motel, gossip is weird

171
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:08,516
Then, since I've never seen this friend, I'll explain the rules.

172
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,721
Which mat is 500 maximum 3000 hours

173
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:20,461
Everyone under stood because it was over when there were only two people left.

174
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:26,300
I'll start the game by spreading it over to the dealer

175
00:22:38,512 --> 00:23:51,084
But there is an end

176
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:05,832
Let’s spread our only arms once together

177
00:24:08,468 --> 00:24:12,339
I want to regret seeing

178
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,844
taken through the hole

179
00:24:17,844 --> 00:24:23,016
sieve hole system

180
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:32,726
check with

181
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:42,035
business friends too

182
00:24:43,036 --> 00:24:46,039
is the impulse

183
00:24:47,774 --> 00:24:50,577
close the door

184
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:55,415
The vaginal nucleus calls

185
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:59,786
You are here

186
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:05,491
Don't buy that scary restaurant

187
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:19,672
Accommodation Creslesjen

188
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:33,753
Kick the first door

189
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:47,233
I called

190
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:54,674
And pretending to be a cushion

191
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:13,225
Also like our conparazzi

192
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:19,632
It's a golf ban.

193
00:26:20,432 --> 00:26:21,600
race plus

194
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,939
Francisco kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss

195
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,610
Woohoo catch it really well

196
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,481
but forgive me

197
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:38,484
just like it said

198
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:42,554
the last card

199
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:46,258
Why is it called River?

200
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:54,867
Caterina is nice too

201
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,303
Pretty says take care of the house

202
00:26:59,037 --> 00:27:01,740
Say no more to this four-dance

203
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,745
Let's keep it for the trainees and see you again

204
00:27:06,745 --> 00:27:09,748
People spit and cough

205
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:16,655
Oh, our store is 7 for 50,000 won.

206
00:27:17,656 --> 00:27:22,094
At home anyway exposed, to the court to the private

207
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:59,931
Can't lead everyone, River Ace has it

208
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:01,966
Trust in S Investment

209
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:04,969
Even the money I’ve saved so far has been blown away

210
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:08,506
What can I say to Mr.

211
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:36,300
I read it all that day

212
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:38,936
well done

213
00:28:38,936 --> 00:28:41,806
don't come here anymore

214
00:28:41,806 --> 00:28:44,809
Chairman Kang is of Yoo Seung-min line.

215
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:51,182
What I did behind the scenes

216
00:28:51,182 --> 00:28:54,185
It's not just for fun

217
00:28:54,752 --> 00:28:57,755
My mother and younger sister are looking at me

218
00:28:58,556 --> 00:29:01,559
After working hard for about a year,

219
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:04,795
At least it will help the family get out of debt

220
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,298
But my desire

221
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:10,301
Is it really beyond

222
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:12,837
I came out with the news that day

223
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:15,806
I should have woken up too

224
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:19,076
I didn't do it to the lecturer alone.

225
00:29:19,076 --> 00:29:22,079
And above all, the lecture hall came

226
00:29:22,813 --> 00:29:25,816
I hated it because the smell came out as 0 in one bite.

227
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:29,286
I knew everything like that bad guy

228
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:32,289
without doing anything

229
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,226
Then, through the introduction of an older sister, I met Chairman Kang.

230
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:40,064
He's the one who first taught me hold'em.

231
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:41,265
I started with rotten

232
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:43,834
Then the cub official

233
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:46,837
Bank Manager And I came all the way here

234
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:51,842
The older sister committed suicide after suffering from Chairman Kang.

235
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,779
I left the store

236
00:29:55,779 --> 00:30:00,417
Even taking on her sister's debt, she gave 29 trillion won of monthly sales to Chairman Kang.

237
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:03,387
on condition of giving

238
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:26,777
I crossed the river Jordan that Mr. Young-seon said, and abandoned it.

239
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:30,847
Cross that river with me once, Blair

240
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:47,497
Noh Kyung-eun, who visited the house, ejaculates like this again, mostly in Sejong Hamburg.

241
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,267
Oppa, you used to act like a really annoying church

242
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:54,604
So I'll take out Chanel for you to be my brother

243
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:57,874
really real owner

244
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:00,276
So watch me buy hitter snobs

245
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:03,413
The rise in promise was large.

246
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:06,416
I chose

247
00:31:24,133 --> 00:32:09,145
much more moist

248
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:22,758
Like a gentleman, like an internet bookstore

249
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:28,063
I bought it for the third year of high school

250
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:45,347
let's watch it

251
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:35,189
Ha ha ha

252
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:38,760
come up, it's okay, it's okay

253
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:43,598
dad i am

254
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,835
what? Police in October

255
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,537
old and new

256
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:51,639
don't read here

257
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,642
No, no one is cursing, but who reports it?

258
00:34:55,443 --> 00:34:57,178
i did

259
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:01,282
Ahn, who is just being nice, bastard

260
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:12,927
That's good bye secured bye sorry for the injection but I need some help

261
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:14,161
what between us

262
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:30,177
what happens

263
00:35:31,278 --> 00:35:34,281
You're not betting, the atmosphere is overflowing

264
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:37,952
ok i got the order

265
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:01,375
Next, the dealers in hell unnies are absolute idols

266
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:05,913
It has to be pretty on a cold day for the landlord to visit

267
00:36:07,281 --> 00:36:11,285
He's the older brother, but he gets upset and leads the game.

268
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:15,155
With me, aegyo, enthusiasm

269
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:19,426
Let's be quiet if we're going to play

270
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:20,727
why? ugh yes

271
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:24,865
okay? Oke sound, get a lot of money

272
00:36:37,544 --> 00:36:40,547
Hey oppa, you have a lot of money

273
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:44,818
Somehow we

274
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:49,322
Have you ever had a laugh here?

275
00:36:49,322 --> 00:36:52,325
Ten million miles by water

276
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:09,442
From the all-in bolt

277
00:37:12,078 --> 00:37:15,081
Also with children

278
00:37:18,918 --> 00:37:23,857
Do not look at the top

279
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:27,026
Let people go, eat and sleep

280
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:33,933
Oh, you murdered me

281
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:36,936
come on here

282
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:44,811
Can't find shoes How much are these?

283
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:47,947
Hey, as you said, 50 is mine.

284
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:50,950
It's still far, it's only half and half now

285
00:37:51,084 --> 00:37:55,655
You choose your jockey, my jumma

286
00:37:56,122 --> 00:38:01,227
By the way, anyone who knows whether I am Kang Hye-jeong or Gangneung is talking about curves.

287
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:04,764
Hey, even though I’m still quite famous, how can I

288
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:09,235
From the server to the dealer, if it's pretty, square it and adjust everything.

289
00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:13,839
If you can't run away, lend money and pay interest, even if you can't pay the interest

290
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:17,243
ask for something else

291
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:20,246
Worse than loan sharks

292
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:23,783
And he is famous for his skills in the card game.

293
00:38:26,352 --> 00:38:29,355
I can't just summarize.

294
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:33,092
Why do you go all the way?

295
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,996
Oh, isn’t it going to be a distribution exchange anyway?

296
00:38:36,996 --> 00:38:40,766
It's okay to be helpful to people

297
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:45,337
Also, we shouldn't keep what our mothers twisted and deposited every month.

298
00:38:46,005 --> 00:38:49,408
You know, it's a lake.

299
00:38:50,576 --> 00:38:54,013
It's better than the manna entrusted to you that people change when they search for it.

300
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:57,016
so what do you do

301
00:38:57,016 --> 00:39:07,926
Next, only blind 5000 here, right?

302
00:39:08,227 --> 00:39:09,895
ah hello

303
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:13,232
You must have been very upset last time, but the rebound today is really good.

304
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:19,504
How much did folk song mine cost from 50 to max 300, then 350?

305
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:22,708
All right

306
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:30,816
You are 300 or 50, why are you 50?

307
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,819
Will it serve as a standard?

308
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:20,298
Please do this alone 2700

309
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,903
I asked for Marie

310
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:29,507
Can you contact me when the edition opens at the place where I last did it?

311
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:33,177

312
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:37,015
all right

313
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:39,050

Mr. Yonsei, take this

355
00:47:34,695 --> 00:47:37,865
They say our breathing matches pretty well.

356
00:47:41,502 --> 00:47:43,270
Would you like a courtesy drink?

357
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:46,273
alcohol is good

358
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:51,912

How about mocking me?

00:48:14,368 --> 00:48:17,337
What about Pando?

363
00:48:19,306 --> 00:48:23,310
Honest things, not money

364
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,683
Is there anything more honest than money

365
00:48:38,091 --> 00:48:41,094
You know how much it is in money

366
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:45,799
20 million won

367
00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:51,772
So I want to convert

368
00:48:53,073 --> 00:48:56,143
I want to know that you are more honest than money

369
00:48:59,212 --> 00:49:02,616
So what is being honest?

370
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:40,205
ah ah ah

371
00:51:41,173 --> 00:51:59,324
ah ah only me ah

372
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:06,331
ah one

373
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:15,207
aaaaaaaaaaa

374
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:21,846
aaaaaaaa

375
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:26,084
AA AA AA

376
00:52:52,277 --> 00:52:58,149
You guys can't act without the line between those two people.

377
00:53:00,418 --> 00:53:03,521
That's why it's an abbreviation for Kang Hye-jeong, which Young-soo knows.

378
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:08,526
Chairman Kang takes a girl with him like a talisman whenever he plays games.

379
00:53:10,028 --> 00:53:15,433
Now, the more ka comes out, the more he touches the thighs of the woman who is equipped or makes unpleasant jokes.

380
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:19,437
hurt someone's ego

381
00:53:19,437 --> 00:53:23,374
And I'll be careful.

382
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,344
that's right? It was like that that day too

383
00:53:26,344 --> 00:53:27,578
So knead and touch

384
00:53:27,578 --> 00:53:30,581
Andong also plucks and eats and often jeons Ayu

385
00:53:30,648 --> 00:53:32,516
Are you taking your medicine?

386
00:53:32,516 --> 00:53:35,653
Genetic Writer Would you like to homo-Oscar with coffee this year?

387
00:53:36,454 --> 00:53:37,688
No nosebleed

388
00:53:37,688 --> 00:53:42,293
It's been a while since Byeongbu-gyeong lived in the America-gyeong with a warm heart.

389
00:53:45,496 --> 00:53:46,063
Oh right

390
00:53:46,063 --> 00:53:49,600
It's crazy that there's not much left.

391
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:50,901
What are you talking about?

392
00:53:52,002 --> 00:53:53,204
it's nothing

393
00:53:53,204 --> 00:53:53,971
I mean taking

394
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:56,974
Whaling has only one year left on the contract.

395
00:53:57,641 --> 00:54:00,678
Aigo taking and no contact

396
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:09,253
So what to do today

397
00:54:09,253 --> 00:54:12,223
It's a place where only doctors can go now.

398
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,158
I've been working on it beforehand

399
00:54:14,158 --> 00:54:18,796
Jin-sang, a chair who has just opened a business in the province of Daegu, is a veterinarian from the countryside.

400
00:54:19,196 --> 00:54:24,768
Well, a veterinarian is also a doctor, so the Quest Team Bishops' Conference

401
00:54:24,768 --> 00:54:32,076
If you drink, the candle is Friday, Saturday and again

402
00:54:37,848 --> 00:54:40,684
Sorry to keep you waiting

403
00:54:40,684 --> 00:54:44,588
But our bodies and corpses are getting prettier and prettier.

404
00:54:47,724 --> 00:54:50,727
The people these people said to the cup are now

405
00:54:51,428 --> 00:54:54,698
Our Dr. Kim is getting younger and younger no matter what he eats.

406
00:54:56,033 --> 00:54:57,167
hello

407
00:54:57,167 --> 00:55:00,170
This is Dr. Kim.

408
00:55:01,371 --> 00:55:03,807
oh that's it

409
00:55:03,807 --> 00:55:05,742
I am also a doctor

410
00:55:05,742 --> 00:55:08,845
Fix a dog, drink and become a dog

411
00:55:09,946 --> 00:55:13,683
Shall we go to the materials when everyone is busy?

412
00:55:14,084 --> 00:55:17,387
You forgot your son. Let's go.

413
00:55:24,427 --> 00:55:29,766
Mr. Jinsang seems to be in a bad condition. Please don't play and rest comfortably next to me.

414
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:33,336
uh what?

415
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:36,673
do you have to be sick?

416
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:40,210
Oh condition organic girl

417
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:43,413
Why are you using strangers?

418
00:55:45,648 --> 00:55:52,755
Oh, as I said before

419
00:55:53,756 --> 00:55:58,862
Money is money when this young doctor loses, and he has decided to help in each area.

420
00:55:59,662 --> 00:56:04,234
Park Eun-ja over there, that male hair loss treatment, Martha

421
00:56:04,534 --> 00:56:08,237
I hit and write it in there, but why is that recommended?

422
00:56:08,237 --> 00:56:12,508
The clinical trial for that new erectile dysfunction treatment is about to take place.

423
00:56:13,343 --> 00:56:21,050
And I decided to help him with all the experiments on the thesis needed for this academic conference.

424
00:56:21,818 --> 00:56:24,821
Kim Dal-do is also a very good friend.

425
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:26,622
Shall we go now?

426
00:56:26,622 --> 00:57:06,662
two are just

427
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:25,047
What are the advantages of both?

428
00:57:25,447 --> 00:57:28,450
If so, one of my dear friends

429
00:57:31,887 --> 00:58:02,584
What's good is easy

430
00:58:03,919 --> 00:58:06,922
So law plywood origami

431
00:58:07,189 --> 00:58:10,459
Because even weak groups against companies have a clear card game

432
00:58:12,427 --> 00:58:15,964
Don't be nervous, Mr. Tau, just like you normally do.

433
00:58:15,964 --> 00:58:33,848
I don't have much of a Joe house already, so I won't accept it.

434
00:58:33,848 --> 00:58:35,116
It's better not to see

435
00:58:35,116 --> 00:58:48,129
If you receive the default, say you saw it as an example

436
00:58:51,232 --> 00:58:53,968
Might be Paul Major

437
00:58:53,968 --> 00:58:58,306
Goal chips must be done, people are peeling off in the open

438
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:07,815
Or, isn't it that the whole head touches people's sense of disgust?

439
00:59:10,618 --> 00:59:13,621
return to morning urination

440
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:15,390
that's in honam

441
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:18,793
If you go and drink is held in any court

442
00:59:19,394 --> 00:59:22,930
Because renal failure and erectile dysfunction are more than twice as common in clinical trials per day.

443
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,203
ah me ah

444
00:59:30,104 --> 00:59:33,107
One day I came back very fun

445
00:59:33,241 --> 00:59:36,244
I wonder if it's young friends or not

446
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:41,382
I had a card to replace it even if I stood up once.

447
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:45,086
If only I could do that

448
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:48,322
Well, I exchanged money here.

449
00:59:50,358 --> 00:59:53,828
I'm coming to pick up another cast soon

450
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:58,699
Ah, I could have done well, but why are you sick today?

451
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:05,639
Let's play another good game next time, let's go

452
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:13,681
Oh, that storm is impotence

453
01:00:14,315 --> 01:00:17,318
Even the cure at that time is dry

454
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:22,356
Did everyone have a hard time at 9 o'clock?

455
01:00:23,224 --> 01:00:24,124
wow me

456
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:26,694
How much did you watch without doing anything today?

457
01:00:26,694 --> 01:00:27,461
you live dead

458
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:30,464
playing with snacks

459
01:00:38,038 --> 01:00:42,409
yes i will come down

460
01:00:44,344 --> 01:00:47,347
who is who? okay

461
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:50,117
Long stop tomorrow

462
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:53,120
really gotta go

463
01:00:54,488 --> 01:01:04,798
Since the topic came up, kiss again

464
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:36,496
hey ride

465
01:01:38,865 --> 01:01:41,868
I'm not feeling very well today

466
01:01:42,402 --> 01:01:45,405
Anhui Fuqing also come early and

467
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:48,775
Even if I just go back, I resent the other place

468
01:01:51,778 --> 01:01:54,247
To the sidewalk on the flower bus

469
01:01:54,247 --> 01:01:57,250
It all turns around, even by myself

470
01:01:58,218 --> 01:02:00,520
sorry for you

471
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:11,197
It is a seed that makes eyes that are not humanly possible in an instant.

472
01:02:25,578 --> 01:02:35,221
It's the same

473
01:02:36,222 --> 01:02:39,225
we talk here

474
01:02:39,325 --> 01:02:43,429
Let's take off and pull even the west side of the flag, etc. Let's talk with a game soon

475
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:46,432
yes we

476
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,036
The roll is the same as last time

477
01:02:50,036 --> 01:02:50,970
Just raise the blinds

478
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:54,941
100,000 to 200,000 and the pando is 5

479
01:02:57,376 --> 01:03:00,379
Call for voting time

480
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:04,984
I don't have enough shields

481
01:03:05,217 --> 01:03:09,288
But then immediately go

482
01:03:11,624 --> 01:03:14,627
Shall we go to the store?

483
01:03:17,163 --> 01:03:21,167
So if I win, get rid of surgery in the future

484
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,603
Why don't you walk to a good place that you run independently?

485
01:03:25,304 --> 01:03:30,542
So it's not that difficult

486
01:03:32,878 --> 01:03:35,848
not start

487
01:03:46,091 --> 01:04:08,747
hall hall hall

488
01:04:13,452 --> 01:04:14,987
position of what

489
01:04:14,987 --> 01:04:17,989
If this continues, the next dog in the incomplete house is with you

490
01:04:18,657 --> 01:04:21,626
You keep chipping like this

491
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:27,032
die from the heart

492
01:04:27,032 --> 01:04:43,648
Do you want to continue? is

493
01:04:49,554 --> 01:05:00,498
That is, if you look closely

494
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:04,936
Even with Korea against China and Japan

495
01:05:04,936 --> 01:05:09,073
Excluding negative perceptions, dissatisfaction is superficially

496
01:05:09,507 --> 01:05:16,748
Provoke armed forces and save the world

497
01:05:18,416 --> 01:05:21,686
It was to arouse suspicion

498
01:05:30,328 --> 01:05:43,808
Chinese former

499
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:20,678
should be one

500
01:06:22,046 --> 01:06:25,015
this is the koran

501
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:49,973
Article 200

502
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:59,883
Consider solving

503
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:11,929
properly

504
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:22,039
Wasn't it something you couldn't do?

505
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:25,642
I don't know how to choose

506
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:33,250
In terms of lameness, only three

507
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:49,766
You too, our big traveler, it's over

508
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:54,437
I put it like this

509
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:58,208
Forgive me, the more you hate this man, the better

510
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:01,911
Think about this young bosom

511
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:07,751
You're leading

512
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,553
I guess it's over

513
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:13,490
Looks like a vomit strategy

514
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:16,493
It happens here for a month or two these days

515
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:19,062
There mother and daughter must continue

516
01:08:19,062 --> 01:08:21,764
I'd rather die

517
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,834
You did enough to make it okay

518
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:30,273
But hey, I'm not in a good mood today

519
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:34,577
I'll go 100m with these bizarre girls

520
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:38,648
I will open

521
01:08:41,818 --> 01:08:44,654
Still, a stranger

522
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:47,690
These days, young people have lived with embarrassing things

523
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:51,227
that's the problem

524
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,330
this is the last prayer

525
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,005
It's quick to lose your center of gravity

526
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:07,510
Didn't I tell you that it's not over until the last ribbon?

527
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:12,048
The governor's house church

528
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:19,655
After doing business like this, it would not be good for a better friend, but I came back

529
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:24,527
You can't do business in Seongnam because you touched your son

530
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:30,032
just let me go anytime

531
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:32,401
circumstance poster

532
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:35,404
Let's put on leather and stick together, huh?

533
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:19,448
Ah oh?

534
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:25,754
I thought the world was shocked

535
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:28,757
affect two in particular

536
01:10:30,692 --> 01:10:39,267
eat low rotation

537
01:10:40,435 --> 01:10:42,938
Good food is expensive

538
01:10:42,938 --> 01:11:00,088
Comes with soup and golf clubs

539
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:05,160
Looking at the address, Mr.

540
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:14,035
Isabi and Pal

541
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:17,005
what is this

542
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:19,808
let's clean up

543
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:23,444
Have you ever heard of a young good neighbor?

544
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:28,583
I said it ain't over 'til it's over

545
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:33,321
Maybe move a little faster

546
01:11:37,825 --> 01:11:41,029
Hey guys, why are you so good and don’t make mistakes

547
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:47,969
See, I'll have to try one before the hands.

548
01:11:50,938 --> 01:11:53,908
I did

549
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:57,545
6:00 Shall we talk

550
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:01,782
I have something to say

551
01:12:01,849 --> 01:12:04,852
Why are you serious?

552
01:12:14,495 --> 01:12:17,498
ah good

553
01:12:26,006 --> 01:12:35,516
I can't beautify it

554
01:12:37,952 --> 01:12:40,955
me? brother Aris why

555
01:12:41,822 --> 01:12:44,825
I have only a few days left to live

556
01:12:45,426 --> 01:12:48,429
i knew

557
01:12:48,596 --> 01:12:50,898
But why

558
01:12:50,898 --> 01:12:53,367
be a day or two

559
01:12:53,367 --> 01:12:56,370
I don't remember what I said at 9 o'clock

560
01:12:56,937 --> 01:12:59,940
Let's cross with me

561
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:03,444
From then on, I made up my mind

562
01:13:04,678 --> 01:13:07,648
Living is a dream anyway

563
01:13:12,152 --> 01:13:15,722
I can't win on the river spinner

564
01:13:15,923 --> 01:13:17,691
when it came out

565
01:13:17,691 --> 01:13:20,694
In your heart, what do you mean by democracy?

566
01:13:20,894 --> 01:13:23,897
Even if it was, Lee Yong-seop didn’t need it.

567
01:13:24,731 --> 01:13:27,801
No, it becomes my excuse to the assailant

568
01:13:29,336 --> 01:13:32,339
I hope to meet you and come back

569
01:13:35,275 --> 01:13:38,278
I'm fine with you

570
01:13:39,746 --> 01:13:43,016
Whether it's a year left or a day left, it goes

571
01:13:43,016 --> 01:13:46,019
Because it's an airline in time

572
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:03,169
what are you doing

573
01:14:04,504 --> 01:14:08,908
Well, where do you two travel and the truth, you can leave it to me for two months.

574
01:14:10,377 --> 01:14:12,412
I mean

575
01:14:12,412 --> 01:14:16,216
I'm a person who was a Naver wish, but can't I operate this for two months?

576
01:14:16,716 --> 01:14:19,719
Where do you two go to cool off?

577
01:14:19,886 --> 01:14:22,622
no, have a good day

578
01:14:22,622 --> 01:14:27,460
Ah, the best thing is to go to a good place while throwing away this bastard’s mouth

579
01:14:36,002 --> 01:14:38,972
The missionary emptied the shop

580
01:14:38,972 --> 01:14:41,975
Report October and

581
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:20,913
If you had one more year left, what would you like to do?

582
01:15:22,048 --> 01:15:24,350
I want to be a fire politician

583
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:33,459
hello darling

584
01:15:33,626 --> 01:15:36,996
I'm afraid I won't answer the phone to someone else

585
01:15:38,063 --> 01:15:41,066
I became a companion last time, so it's a pediatric cancer university hospital.

586
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:45,371
A month and a half has changed since medical records are always available.

587
01:15:46,405 --> 01:15:49,141
So, the diagnosis record is next year.

588
01:15:49,141 --> 01:15:54,680
At that time, we misrepresented that it was cancer, so I'm really determined.
