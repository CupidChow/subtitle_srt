What exactly is going on here?

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,400
Come with me.

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,440
Where is this place?

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,840
Lane 66 Bar.

16
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,730
It's where witches gather.

17
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,520
I'm the Clan Leader here.

18
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,720
Mo.

19
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,120
Why did you bring him here?

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,040
Hui is gone.

21
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,800
Hui?

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,280
She's gone...

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,600
Go look into it.

24
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,640
Find out who killed Hui.

25
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,480
Alright.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,920
I found this beside her.

27
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,400
Did she say anything before she died?

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,640
She was already gone when I got there.

29
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,040
Hui's death isn't simple.

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,000
We need to find out

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,120
who is hunting witches out there.

32
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,320
Alright.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
The necklace is
the Clan Leader's token.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
It's used to seal a contract.

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,920
After we came here,

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,120
my clan members fell ill and grew weak.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
To heal, we have to
form contracts with humans.

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,840
Contract?

39
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,720
I can grant a wish to someone

40
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,640
in despair

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,120
by giving them a fair chance to choose.

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,640
Then we'll get

43
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,200
what we want from them.

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,560
Can any wish be granted?

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,360
Yes, any wish at all.

46
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,560
So making a contract needs the necklace.

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,680
Right.

48
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,160
Only the Clan Leader of the Witch Clan

49
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,840
can make the contract with the necklace.

50
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,120
Ever since the necklace was lost,

51
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,400
our clan members have been fading away.

52
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,280
I have to get the necklace back
to protect us.

53
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,680
So you're saying,

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,200
two things are needed for a contract.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
First, the necklace.

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,400
Second, the Clan Leader.

57
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,400
That's right.

58
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,120
Can you give it back to me?

59
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,200
It's not that I don't want to.

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,840
It's just I can't take it off.

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,240
No way.

62
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,160
The necklace is with you.

63
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,080
If you really want to,

64
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,120
why can't you take it off?

65
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Look.

66
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,360
That's how it works.

67
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,800
How did this happen?

68
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,320
Why is it back again?

69
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
How can I get it back?

70
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,480
Don't stress just yet.

71
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,960
Let's see if there's another way.

72
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,520
Maybe you missed something.

73
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,560
Maybe Aunt Rou can help.

74
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,680
Aunt Rou.

75
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,680
The former Clan Leader's sister.

76
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,800
This was Aunt Rou's favorite beach.

77
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,360
She brought us here seventy years ago.

78
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,680
Maybe someone here knows her.

79
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
Seventy years?

80
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,640
How could anyone

81
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,040
stay in one place for seventy years?

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
Seventy years might feel long to you,

83
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,680
but for us, it goes by in a flash.

84
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,800
When I was little,

85
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,360
my mom used to
take me to shell hunting by the sea.

86
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,960
She'd make the prettiest necklace

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,120
in the world with those shells.

88
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,360
Each one was one of a kind.

89
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,080
Sadly, I never see them anymore.

90
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,840
The beach

91
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,040
means a lot to me.

92
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,400
Remember the first time
I took you to the sea?

93
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,080
That spot means a lot to me too.

94
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,080
Whenever I feel down, I go there.

95
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
So my warmest place

96
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,720
and your saddest place

97
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,240
somehow overlap.

98
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,800
Feels like I've said that before.

99
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,280
Miss,

100
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
can I borrow a towel?

101
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,520
Here, dry off. You're soaked.

102
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,360
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

103
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,080
By the way, miss,
do you have a hairdryer?

104
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,360
Hold on a sec.

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,080
What do you say?

188
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,680
How did you know I have it?

189
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,680
Does that really matter?

190
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,160
I'm not selling.

191
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,440
That's alright.

192
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,560
If you're not selling,

193
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,760
I can invest instead.

194
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,040
We can produce it together.

195
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,960
Your research needs big funding,

196
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,840
right?

197
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Sorry.

198
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,120
I don't plan to mass-produce it.

199
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm not short on cash.

200
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,960
I genuinely admire your talent.

201
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,920
So I want to be friends with you.

202
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,040
You won't turn me down, right?

203
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,440
I just hope
we stay out of each other's way.

204
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,840
Professor Mu,

205
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,160
are you sure you won't reconsider?

206
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,520
Xia Mo.

207
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,640
Aunt Rou.

208
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,080
You're Aunt Rou.

209
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,800
But you're different from before.

210
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,800
To stay here,

211
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,040
I have to "age" a bit.

212
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,800
No wonder
I didn't recognize you at first.

213
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,240
You're here about the necklace, right?

214
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,720
The necklace is with someone else now.

215
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,440
I can't get it back.

216
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,240
The only way to get the necklace

217
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,240
is through its current owner's death.

218
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,800
Then the new owner naturally claims it.

219
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,040
Isn't there any other way?

220
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,600
That person just now...

221
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,320
You have to make up your mind.

222
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,920
A lot of choices seem in your hands,

223
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,800
but they're actually out of your control.

224
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,760
(Five years has gone.)

225
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
(Who would've thought)

226
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,080
(you two still crossed paths.)

227
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,930
(Xia Mo,)

228
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,920
(this time, you have to choose right.)

229
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,000
Careful.

230
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,040
Look how hard you hit Professor Mu.

231
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,080
Professor Mu.

232
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,800
Have you thought it through now?

233
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,360
My answer remains unchanged.

234
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,680
I really don't get it.

235
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,040
It's just a jammer.

236
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,480
Is it worth risking your life?

237
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,080
Unless

238
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,240
you're planning to use it

239
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,560
against Xia Mo.

240
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,720
All the more reason to work together.

241
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,880
We're after the same thing.

242
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,800
Who are you, really?

243
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,080
Me?

244
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,600
I'm just like you.

245
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,680
I deal with witches, too.

246
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,600
We'd make a great team.

247
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Don't lump me in with you.

248
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
We're not on the same side.

249
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,720
Professor Mu,

250
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,880
I thought you were smart.

251
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,240
Turns out, you're just like them.

252
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
If that's the case,

253
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,040
get rid of him.

254
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,680
The only way to get the necklace back

255
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,040
is through its current owner's death.

256
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,680
(I'll collect the body
after you're gone.)
