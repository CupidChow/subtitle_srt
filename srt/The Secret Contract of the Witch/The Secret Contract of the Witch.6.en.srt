=The Secret Contract of the Witch=

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,980
=Episode 6=

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,240
(Witch Contract)
These are all the request cards

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,400
from our clan in five years.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,400
That's a lot.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,920
Mo, does he have to be here too?

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,720
Just pretend he's not around.

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,600
He's like a stubborn sticker,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,080
can't shake him off.

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,040
Let's do this.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,760
When a witch faces trouble,

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,240
she sends a request card to Lane 66 Bar.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,760
They write down exactly what they need

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,520
and sends it to the bar with mystic power.

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,580
Watch where you're going.

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,360
Are you blind?

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,160
We'll look for people who can help,

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,080
then make a contract with them.

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,520
We grant their wishes

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,160
and get what we need in return.

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,320
Anna.

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,000
It's from Anna.

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,600
She needs a pair of corneas.

32
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,480
So have we found the right person yet?

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,280
Xiaoyan.

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,160
She's twenty-three.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,000
Brain cancer.

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,360
Isn't the address already listed?

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,680
It's not for you anyway.

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,720
Hurry and keep up.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,600
Xiaoyan, don't be scared.

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,440
Whatever comes, we'll face it together.

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,240
Stop following me.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,560
Xiaoyan.

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,320
Don't come here again.

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,360
Just forget about me.

45
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,080
I can grant your wish.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,600
As long as you sign a contract with me.

47
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,880
I can make him forget you.

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,440
Don't treat me like a joke.

49
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,800
This...

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,720
Can you really make it happen?

51
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,520
What do I need to do?

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,600
Give me your cornea.

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Alright.

54
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,480
Wait.

55
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
I still don't trust you.

56
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,320
Unless...

57
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,480
unless you show me first

58
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,000
that Tao doesn't love me.

59
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
Okay.

60
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,200
Before your wish comes true,

61
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,160
I won't take your cornea away.

62
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,920
Can we sign it now?

63
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,320
Do you think your kind is good or bad?

64
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Xiaoyan.

65
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,760
She got her wish granted,

66
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,800
but she lost the one she loved most.

67
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,800
But that's what she chose herself.

68
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
Don't come here again.

69
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,480
Do you know what I like about you?

70
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,720
I do.

71
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,040
Then do you know what I like about you?

72
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,360
I do.

73
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,920
Hurry and get rid of Anna.

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,080
Alright.

75
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,240
I'm not just taking her down.

76
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,360
I'll get rid of all the witches.

77
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,160
Except...

78
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,480
Except who?

79
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,920
Ocean!

80
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,720
Wait for me!

81
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,880
You can't just

82
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,360
left me behind.

83
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,440
You're way too slow.

84
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,040
What are you doing?

85
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,520
Ocean!

86
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,480
Look, the sea is beautiful.

87
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,720
- Slow down!
- I could fall.

88
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,640
Ouch, that hurts.

89
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,760
We'll come back.

90
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,800
We'll come back.

91
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,720
We'll come back.

92
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
With you.

93
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,920
- Together.
- Together.

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,440
You've seen it these days.

95
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,320
He's completely moved on from you.

96
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,200
Your wish has come true.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,640
Now it's time to keep your promise.

98
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,780
No.

99
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,480
I don't want to sign this contract.

100
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,160
I'm begging you.

101
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,920
Can you give Tao back to me?

102
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Are you backtracking?

103
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,640
Sorry, I regret this now.

104
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,920
I just want him

105
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,920
to remember me,

106
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,920
even when I'm gone.

107
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,040
I'm begging you.

108
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Please take the contract back.

109
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,640
Is that okay?

110
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,640
Once the contract is set,

111
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
it has to be followed.

112
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,440
Or you'll face harsher consequences.

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,880
Return his love for me to him.

114
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,480
Let's pretend this never happened.

115
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,360
I'm begging you.

116
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,240
Please, I'm begging you.

117
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,760
It's out of your hands now.

118
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
She doesn't want this.

119
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,320
Maybe we should stop.

120
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,880
This is the contract I made.

121
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,920
You don't get to decide for me.

122
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,240
She's been through enough.

123
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,640
Stop pushing her so hard.

124
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,800
This was her own choice.

125
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,120
It's too late to regret it.

126
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,880
But Xiaoyan already knows she was wrong.

127
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,760
Doesn't she deserve another chance?

128
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,760
Once a contract is made,
it must be kept.

129
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,960
Even I can't stop it.

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
Even if I could stop it,

131
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,320
I wouldn't break the rules

132
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,440
for a traitor.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,200
Then go find another way.

134
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,320
Your clan members just ask for help,

135
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,000
but never pay any price.

136
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,120
Xiaoyan

137
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,760
just wanted her loved one to be happy,

138
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,760
but she paid a heavy price for it.

139
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
A deal like this

140
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,280
isn't fair at all.

141
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
You guys can see a doctor,

142
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,760
but we can only rely on a contract.

143
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,000
That's just our way.

144
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,840
If there was another way,

145
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,320
I wouldn't have chosen this either.

146
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,080
It's my mission.

147
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,000
She could've said no at first,

148
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,120
but she didn't.

149
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,160
Yeah, she didn't.

150
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,800
But I can.

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,840
Come back.

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
Come back!

153
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,760
Mu Hanyu, what are you doing?

154
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,960
You know she's always been cold.

155
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Yeah, I know.

156
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,760
So why expect anything from her?

157
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,000
Honestly, I expect nothing

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
from her.

159
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,840
Who would care about

160
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,680
someone so cold?

161
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,420
Serves you right for having hope in her.

162
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,760
You asked for it.

163
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,520
Mu Hanyu,

164
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,400
you've agreed to this contract with me.

165
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,840
If you want to back out,

166
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,040
