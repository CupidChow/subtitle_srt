00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,600

- Delete it.

14

Your eyes...

15
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,160
You're not scared of me.

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,520
I'm not scared.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I think you won't hurt me.

18

Do you want to watch the stars with me?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I didn't mean any harm.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,020
I just saw you under that light,

23
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,000
and you looked amazing.

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,260
So I...

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,240
snapped a quick photo.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,800
Just wanted to capture the moment.

28
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,880

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,200
Honestly, I've always believed

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,920
there are aliens out there.

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,520
Otherwise, why do some look alike?

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,640
I really think my theory is right.

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,000
I have to prove it to everyone.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,420

35
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,000
You're knowledgeable.

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,520
That's all from school days.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,440
I learned it in class.

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,180
Let me tell you something

39
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,360
that isn't in the textbooks.

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm from the satellite near that star.

41
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
You're an alien.

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,600
Are you really an alien?

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,440
You don't believe it?

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,440
Definitely no.

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,160
If you said you had powers,
I'd believe you,

46
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,360
but you're saying you're M2,

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,520
