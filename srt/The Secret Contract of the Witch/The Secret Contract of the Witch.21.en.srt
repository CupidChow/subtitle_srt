11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,840
Slow down, let me help you.

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,520
It's okay, I'll do it myself.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,680
They say my blood is dirty.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,560
It's not dirty at all.

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,760
Why are you standing up for me?

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,680
They'll end up disliking you too.

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,400
I'm the future clan leader.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,280
Who would dare?

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,560
Why are you so kind to me?

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,680
They all call me a freak.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,520
They say I'm not fit to be a witch.

22
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,960
But in my eyes,

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,080
you're one of our clan members.

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,120
You're just like everyone else.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,280
You...

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,560
Can you be my sister?

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,400
Sister?

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,080
Sis.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,040
Sure.

30
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,520
Really?

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,160
Now I have a sister.

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,680
They won't pick on me anymore.

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,160
Okay.

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,680
I'll protect you from now on.

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,320
No one can mess with you.

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,840
Sis.

37
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,520
Good girl.

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,760
Sis.

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,120
Does it still hurt?

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,680
No.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,990
With you here, it doesn't hurt anymore.

42
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,020
Yeah.

43
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,740
They did make mistakes.

44
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,620
But they're still our clan members.

45
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,980
Clan members?

46
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,980
Did they ever treat me like one?

47
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,180
All these years,

48
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,460
only you have truly cared about me.

49
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,140
They only brought me pain.

50
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,260
Why should I let them go?

51
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,860
Xinyi.

52
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,820
When did you become so harsh?

53
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,820
You're acting just like they used to.

54
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,260
Me? Harsh?

55
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,260
Ever since they bullied me

56
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,100
and called me a freak,

57
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,740
I've changed.

58
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,180
Now I'm strong enough.

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,100
I can finally fight back.

60
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,540
They all deserve it!

61
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,740
After all these years,

62
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,900
I thought you'd healed by now,

63
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,620
but I never knew the pain stayed.

64
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,180
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,100
It was my fault. I wasn't careful.

66
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,300
Xinyi,

67
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,940
come back, please.

68
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,180
If not, we'll lose our bond as sisters.

69
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,900
Mo,

70
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,900
are you leaving me too?

71
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,100
Enough.

72
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,340
Catching up ends here.

73
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,260
It's time to wrap this game up.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,860
Get her.

75
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,740
Wait.

76
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,660
I want to do it myself.

77
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,740
So you're just like them,

78
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,620
taking me as a freak.

79
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,940
All you do is pick on me!

80
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,780
Only he...

81
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,940
He gets what I'm going through.

82
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,540
He puts up with all my moods.

83
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,780
He really knows how I feel.

84
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,940
So even if he lies to me,

85
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,220
I'd still go to him.

86
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,180
You once said,

87
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,340
we're the same,

88
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,100
didn't you?

89
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,460
Of course.

90
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,340
It's just a parlor trick.

91
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,620
Xia Mo.

92
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,740
You're betrayed by someone so close.

93
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,780
That's got to hurt, right?

94
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,220
It was the witch who killed my mom.

95
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,100
She turned me into this freak.

96
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,820
Everything you put me through,

97
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,020
I'm giving it all back now.

98
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,020
The one who made you this way

99
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,260
was your mother.

100
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,500
What did you say?

101
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,460
The one who made you this way

102
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,300
was your mother!

103
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,180
Shut up!

104
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,940
You're just like them.

105
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,660
My mom loved me.

106
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,380
You tempted her.

107
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,060
That's why she formed a contract.

108
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,380
She was a good mom.

109
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,060
She gave birth to me

110
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,780
and went through so much.

111
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,220
She never left me.

112
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,620
Until you all showed up.

113
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,900
Then she didn't want me.

114
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,220
She didn't want me!

115
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,100
Do you want to see the past?

116
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,900
What do you mean?

117
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,780
I can send you back for a bit.

118
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,220
See it for yourself.

119
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,100
See the choice your mom made.

120
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,060
Sounds interesting.

121
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,920
Was everything you've done

122
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,220
all for your mom?

123
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,340
If you could go back in time,

124
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,380
wouldn't you want to tell her everything?

125
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,660
Yes, I would.

126
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,180
I'll give you that chance.

127
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,220
But I want you to see,

128
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,780
you're actually the one who's wrong.

129
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,940
Watch her closely.

130
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,460
Go on.

131
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,620
Mom.

132
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,620
Mom.

133
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,300
Son.

134
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,180
Mom.

135
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,500
I have money now.

136
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,100
I can take good care of you.

137
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,020
I'll give you anything you want.

138
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,260
Mom.

139
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,540
You've worked so hard.

140
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,460
I know you're the most caring.

141
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,140
Go with me to Lane 66 Bar again.

142
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,020
Let's make another contract, okay?

143
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,900
Mom, what are you even saying?

144
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,260
Trade your life for mine.

145
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,180
All that money you have?
The witch gave it to me.

146
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,260
It's all mine.

147
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,220
Why would I let you use it?

148
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,500
Mom.

149
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,340
I'm your son.

150
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,300
You're my son.

151
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,780
So your life belongs to me too.

152
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,460
Trade your life to save mine.

153
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,700
I died because of you.

154
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,180
What's wrong?

155
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,660
You don't want to, do you?

156
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,200
You're a monster, and your only use

157
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,900
is to save me.

158
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,420
Since you're so unwilling,

159
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,020
then just go die.

160
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,100
That's why you all deserve to die.

161
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,460
Let's all go hell.

162
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,460
Xia Mo.

163
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,020
Help them.

164
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,300
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,660
We promised we'd face this together.

166
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,460
Why did you keep it from me?

167
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,100
I didn't tell you

168
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,660
because I didn't want you in danger.
