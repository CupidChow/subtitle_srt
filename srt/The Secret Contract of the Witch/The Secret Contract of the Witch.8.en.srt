00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,220
then let it go.

191
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
Slow your breathing,

192
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,860
like you're stalking prey,

193
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,380
just relax,

194
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,140
and shoot.

195
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,980
That's good.

196
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,940
But it's not enough.

197
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,540
I need to take him down.

198
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,020
Who made you this mad?

199
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,780
Someone who should've been gone years ago.

200
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,020
He doesn't deserve to be here.

201
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,340
When I see you mad at someone else,

202
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,020
I can't help but get jealous.

203
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,340
You should be thinking about me.

204
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,540
Want me to take you down with a shot?

205
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,020
Go ahead.

206
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,500
Come on.

207
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,660
Don't chicken out.

208
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,420
Come on.

209
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,940
