=Episode 7=

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,080
Mu Hanyu,

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,920
you've agreed to the contract with me.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,400
If you want to back out,

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,400
then be ready to face the consequences.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,240
Are you serious?

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,160
Let go.

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,520
Feeling hot?

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,720
If you can't take it,

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,200
just beg me,

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,800
and I'll let you go.

21
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,560
You want me to beg you?

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,840
Not a chance.

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,800
Aren't you just playing with me?

24
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,160
Fine, I'll play along.

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,360
Is this all you've got?

26
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,480
It's not enough.

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,440
Hope you keep that tough talk later.

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,840
It's about to get even hotter here.

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,080
Be careful, you might get burned.

30
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,120
Enjoy it while you can.

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,160
Don't be naive.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
You can't get away.

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,880
Do you know what you did wrong?

34
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,440
I just think you're out of line.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,080
There's still time to apologize.

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
You push me like this

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,160
just to make me say sorry.

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,880
I can handle your games.

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,720
Alright.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,080
You've got some nerve.

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,440
If you give in to me now,

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,360
I won't even find it fun.

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,000
Xia Mo,

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,880
you win.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
I lost.

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,080
Now you see your limits, right?

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
I was wrong.

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,480
I'm begging you.

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
What did you say?

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,080
I didn't catch that.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
I said I was wrong.

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,560
I'm begging you.

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,000
Say it again.

54
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,880
I was wrong.

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,040
So now,

56
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,680
you'll do

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,080
whatever I tell you to do, right?

58
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,000
Stand up.

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,600
Take two steps forward.

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,920
Turn around.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
On your knees.

62
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,850
♪You're brave enough to call out my name♪

63
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,340
♪You're brave enough to come and stay♪

64
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,050
♪I say♪

65
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,730
♪You're brave enough to go insane♪

66
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,310
♪When there's nothing left to say♪

67
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,440
You're awake.

68
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,940
- Nightmare.
- You...

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,440
You had a bad dream, right?

70
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,800
You're all sweaty.

71
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,040
Here, have some tea.

72
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,760
It was you, right?

73
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
You dreamed it yourself.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,080
You can't blame me for it.

75
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,760
I've just been making tea.

76
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,920
I heard you keep saying,

77
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,480
"I'm sorry."

78
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,800
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

79
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,800
Was that meant for me to hear?

80
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,320
Xia Mo.

81
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,720
Listen up.

82
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,320
Don't push it too far.

83
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,480
Come on, tell me.

84
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,360
What did you dream about?

85
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,320
I can't remember.

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
It totally slipped my mind.

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,480
Your memory's really bad.

88
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,920
Then you need some tea.

89
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,880
No need.

90
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Don't you like my tea ceremony style?

91
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,040
I like a lot of styles.

92
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,600
But not the way you made it today.

93
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,720
Feels like you lost your sense of judgment

94
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,420
after that dream.

95
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,480
You're confident.

96
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,320
Think you really get love.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,320
So you play with people.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,840
Just average.

99
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,640
At least I get it more than you.

100
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,720
Tell me, what style do you like?

101
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,080
I can find whatever you want.

102
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,760
I play fair with everyone.

103
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,640
As long as you help me out,

104
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,240
I'll even indulge

105
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,480
your little quirks.

106
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,880
That's enough.

107
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,200
Stop pretending.

108
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,800
You did all that just now, right?

109
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,200
I already went easy on you.

110
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,640
Just taught you a lesson in your dream.

111
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,080
If the necklace hadn't protected me,

112
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,160
you would've ended me.

113
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,040
Yeah.

114
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,360
You only care about the rules.

115
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,520
But hurting people

116
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,480
to get what you want.

117
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,040
Is that right?

118
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Not everything is black and white.

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,600
Xia Mo,

120
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,240
what if you were in my shoes?

121
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
If Xiaoyan

122
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,640
was as helpless as your clan members,

123
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,330
would you still push her that far?

124
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,880
We're not the same.

125
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,320
Yes, we are.

126
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,640
People have feelings.

127
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,480
Xiaoyan is doing all she can for love.

128
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,200
Love can make us lose control.

129
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,360
Can you understand that?

130
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,720
Love makes people lose control.

131
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,600
Yeah.

132
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,320
That's why Xiaoyan changed her mind.

133
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,800
I hope you can understand her.

134
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,920
What about you?

135
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,880
If I want you to listen,

136
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,320
should I just make you fall for someone?

137
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,040
Is that really what I'm saying?

138
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,520
Fine, I get it.

139
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,240
What do you mean?

140
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
(I'm putting my hope)

141
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,480
(in the hands of such a ruthless witch.)

142
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,880
(Was bargaining with the devil)

143
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,240
(a mistake?)

144
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Professor Mu.

145
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,760
It's you again.

146
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Why are you here?

147
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,880
I like you, you know.

148
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,640
We're both struggling here.

149
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,080
I get the pain you're feeling.

150
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,440
Those witches aren't good people.

151
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm here to help you.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,440
I thought I told you before,

153
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,880
don't put me in your camp.

154
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,600
From where I stand,

155
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,320
you're no better yourself.

156
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,760
I've made it pretty clear.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Are you still turning me down?

158
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,760
Am I not obvious enough?

159
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,360
True.

160
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,760
I'm not a great person either.

161
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,840
But it's because I'm here,

162
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,880
the witch doesn't act out.

163
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,280
You know how it is.

164
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,080
They love putting on a show.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,320
What I want

166
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,520
is to cut through their lies.

167
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,640
Do you get it now?

168
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,880
Do you still trust Xia Mo?

169
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,300
Why do you care?

170
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,680
Come on, man,

171
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,640
we're like brothers.

172
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,120
Don't you trust me yet?

173
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
Are women any better than brothers?

174
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,200
Join my team.

175
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
What do you think?

176
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,600
No need for that.

177
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
I'm not into extreme types.

178
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,000
Aren't you more extreme than me?

179
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Otherwise,

180
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,440
you wouldn't study a jammer against them.

181
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,440
Look at you.

182
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,440
I just saw right through you.

183
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,200
If I get Xia Mo,

184
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,000
I can see right through you too.

185
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
Think about it.
