A life for a life.

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,680

What if we never find it?

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,960
As long as you're here,

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,600
I can make a contract.

36
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,720
Work with me.

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,880
I need you.

38
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,440
Mo,

39
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,600
did you find a way to get the necklace?

40
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,400
Why not just take him out?

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,960
If we can't do it,
we'll find someone else.

42
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
As long as he's gone,

43
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,880
the necklace comes back to us.

44
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,880
We do need to take him out,

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,980
but it's not the right time yet.

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,880
While he's still around,

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,440
I can still use the necklace.

48
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,960
Mo,

49
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,040
you said we should
keep our distance from people,

50
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,120
but what about you and Mu Hanyu?

51
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,960
Don't use my words against me.

52
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,800
I just hope
you remember what you said today.

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,460
Don't let your feelings

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,680
get in the way.

55
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,600
You seem extra interested in Mu Hanyu.

56
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,240
I'm not.

57
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
I'm just worried he won't help you.

58
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,440
He wouldn't dare.

59
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,280
(You shouldn't have saved me.)

60
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,120
(If only my parents)

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,320
(were as lucky as me/Nfive years ago.)

62
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,240
You're back.

63
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,680
Professor Mu.

64
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,680
So this is where you develop the jammer.

65
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,760
It's kind of basic, don't you think?

66
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,720
It's enough for me.

67
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,280
What trick are you planning this time?

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Or are you here

69
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,680
to get rid of me?

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,000
No, not at all.

71
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,120
You have someone helping you.

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,760
Between you and her,

73
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,760
is there some history?

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,880
Are you testing me now?

75
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
Then join my team.

76
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,160
I'll tell you everything.

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,320
Come on, it'll be fun.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
I can give you whatever you want.

79
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,600
We want different things.

80
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,360
Oh, Professor Mu, really.

81
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,720
It's alright.

82
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,280
Though you don't want to
work with me now,

83
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,640
maybe you'll change your mind later.

84
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
I'll wait for you.

85
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,120
Let's go.

86
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
(It's getting more complicated.)

87
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,960
(I need to bring my parents back soon.)

88
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,580
(Lane 66)

89
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,400
One drink.

90
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,120
Hi, is Xia Mo here?

91
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,920
Hello, ma'am.

92
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,960
Is Xia Mo around?

93
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,200
She's not here.

94
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,960
Did she tell you to say she's gone,

95
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,000
or is it

96
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,900
that you don't like me?

97
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,080
Isn't it obvious?

98
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,920
I really can't stand you.

99
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,360
Here's a warning.

100
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,560
Stay away from my sister.

101
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,400
You'll just

102
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,760
bring her trouble.

103
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,800
I just have something to discuss.

104
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,520
Didn't you see?

105
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,640
She's not here.

106
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,960
Mo,

107
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,120
Mu Hanyu was just here.

108
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
Why did he come?

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,880
No idea.

110
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
But I asked him to leave.

111
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,400
It's fine if he's gone.

112
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,200
(Does she not care about Mu Hanyu?)

113
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,040
You're looking for me?

114
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,600
What's up?

115
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,920
I expected you to desperately need my help

116
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,200
with the contract.

117
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,840
But now it seems

118
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,600
we can take it slow.

119
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,400
That's why I came to see you.

120
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
I wanted to talk to you about this today.

121
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,400
Spent three hours on the road.

122
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,480
All that for nothing.

123
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,320
So, what do you want?

124
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,520
I want some coffee.

125
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,360
Hang on a sec.

126
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,090
Hand-brewed.

127
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,600
Make it a bit fancy.

128
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,960
If not for the necklace,

129
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,040
I wouldn't be bending over.

130
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,460
Wouldn't even bother with hand-brewed.

131
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,620
Mu Hanyu.

132
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,700
What are you mumbling about?

133
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,900
I have my terms for helping you.

134
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,620
What terms?

135
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,380
Not the right time to say.

136
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,540
Not telling me?

137
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,580
What if you ask for too much later?

138
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,990
Aren't you supposed to handle anything?

139
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,420
Don't worry.

140
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,620
You mentioned

141
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,140
a contract has to be fair.

142
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,100
I won't offer unfair terms.

143
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,540
You want to make a contract?

144
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,180
Anyway,

145
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,020
only when you agree to my terms

146
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,220
will I help you.

147
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,740
Since day one, you've been scheming

148
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,660
against me.

149
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,220
How am I supposed to trust you?

150
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,140
You don't have to trust me.

151
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,100
As long as we're useful to each other,

152
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,220
I'll never betray you.

153
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,860
Besides,

154
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,980
I need you, too.

155
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,620
Alright.

156
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,580
But I have my own terms.

157
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,620
Go ahead.

158
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,740
First, you come when I call.

159
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,780
Do what I say.

160
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,980
Be my assistant.

161
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,740
Alright.

162
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,300
When I need to sign the contract,

163
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,540
you have to give it your all.

164
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,500
No showing up late,

165
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,740
no leaving early.

166
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,100
Sometimes, you'll work overtime,

167
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,700
and you can't argue with me.

168
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,900
And, most importantly,

169
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,540
no getting romantic with me.

170
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,780
You're not being serious, right?

171
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,820
We'll see each other a lot now.

172
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,460
To stop you from catching feelings,

173
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,700
