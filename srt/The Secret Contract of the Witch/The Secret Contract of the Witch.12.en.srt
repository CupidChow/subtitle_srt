=The Secret Contract of the Witch=

10

=Episode 12=

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,680
Let's get started.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll give up my life

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,640
to bring back the one I love most,

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,520
safe and sound,

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,360
appearing right in front of me.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,440
The contract is sealed.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,040
What's going on?

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,920
I'll give up my life

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,160
to bring back the one I love most,

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,760
safe and sound,

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,280
appearing right in front of me.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,640
What's going on here?

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,760
Why aren't my parents back yet?

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,040
You want your parents back?

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,400
People can't come back
once they're gone.

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,400
But you said before,

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,720
you could make anything happen.

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,800
Bringing back the dead isn't possible.

29
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,090
I've been searching for you for 5 years.

30
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,560
Now you tell me you can't do it?

31
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Calm down for a second.

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,160
I really can't help with that.

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,560
Life can't be reversed.

34
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,840
It's all my fault.

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm really to blame.

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,160
If I'd just protected myself back then,

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,880
they wouldn't have had to

38
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,800
risk everything for me.

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,720
It all comes down to me.

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,000
Your parents did it out of love.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,720
That's why we made this contract.

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,360
If they were still here now,

43
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,720
they wouldn't want to see you like this.

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,360
I just want them to come back.

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,160
I don't want their lives exchanged for mine.

46
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,920
I can give you one thing.

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,360
A chance to see them again.

48
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Really?

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
For real.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,160
I can actually see them again?

51
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,360
But it's just one chance.

52
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,640
Only one.

53
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,560
Okay.

54
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,280
What do I have to do?

55
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,200
Dad,

56
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Mom,

57
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,440
is it really you?

58
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,160
Sorry, son.

59
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,400
We couldn't be there for you.

60
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,440
Have you been doing well all these years?

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,960
You must've had a tough time.

62
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,720
I had a tough time

63
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,240
just because I missed you both so much.

64
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,360
I miss Mom's cooking.

65
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,720
I miss playing chess with Dad.

66
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,840
I really miss you guys.

67
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,640
I just miss you both so much.

68
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,360
I've tried so hard already,

69
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
but I still can't

70
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
get you both back.

71
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,080
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,800
Kid.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,640
We never regretted it,

74
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,240
not even for a second.

75
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,120
- No.
- If we had another chance,

76
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,000
we'd make the same choice.

77
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,280
Don't choose that again, Mom.

78
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,400
Live well, okay?

79
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,400
Live a good life for us.

80
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,560
Just stay happy and healthy.

81
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,080
Then we'll be content.

82
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,960
Dad.

83
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,840
I think

84
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,640
maybe you need some time alone.

85
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,080
Forming a pact with you,

86
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,800
was it the right call,

87
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,800
or was it wrong?

88
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,400
Does it even matter now?

89
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,240
How did you get here?

90
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,120
You just walked in through the door.

91
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,360
I actually drove two hours.

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,360

After you left,

96
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,680
the yard was empty.

97
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,130

Thank you.

101
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,280
I got to see my parents one last time.

I really wish I could help you.

103
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,680
But I just can't.

104
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,240
I'm truly sorry about that.

105
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,060

that I could let it go.

I wanted too much before,

111
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,360
so I ended up getting hurt.

112
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
I never even thought about
how my parents felt.

113
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,080

Aunt Rou,

122
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,240
what should I do now

123
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,320
to return the necklace to Xia Mo?

124
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,920
The necklace forms a life-and-death bond.

125
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,600
To let go of the necklace,

126
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,880
you'd have to die.

127
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,800
Does Xia Mo know about this?

128
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,920
Our clan has so many stories,

129
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,760
but this rule never changes.

130
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Xia Mo knows all of this,

131
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,000
but she still chose to save me.

132
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,840
Child,

133
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Xia Mo carries the duty
to protect the clan,

134
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,920
but for you,

135
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,480
she would risk everything.

136
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
Xia Mo made her choice.

137
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,800
Now it's your turn.

138
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
What will you do?

139
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,560
Professor Mu, do you have a moment?

140
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm here.

141
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,840
Where's my teacher?

142
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,760
Professor Mu.

143
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,000
Does this block mystic power?

144
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,360
Did you try it on Xia Mo?

145
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,920
You two seem to be having fun.

146
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,000
What are you trying to do?

147
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,320
Professor.

148
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,040
Go ahead.

149
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,040
What do you want from me?

150
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,800
See?

151
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,800
It would've been easier
if you agreed earlier.

152
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,760
This thing

153
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
is so hard to use.

154
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,200
Help me open it.

155
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,240
Let him go first.

156
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,600
Alright.

157
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,520
Let him go.

158
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,760
I've got what I wanted anyway.

159
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Sorry, son.

160
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,880

Xia Mo!

191
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,600
Just be quiet.

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,200
Xia Mo,

193
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,640
you went to great lengths

194
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,560
to get my address from Shen.

195
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,680
So come find me.

196
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,200
I'll be waiting.

197
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,400
Xia Mo.

198
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,860
Xia Mo, stay back!

199
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,320
Xia Mo, it's a trap. Xia Mo!
