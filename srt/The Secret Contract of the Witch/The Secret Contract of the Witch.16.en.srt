I'm not.

68
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,240
He's got to die for you to be safe.

69
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
I'm going to end him.

- Are you okay?
- Xia Mo.

Xia Mo,

82
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,400
did we meet five years ago?

83
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,440
Or

84
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,400
did Xia Xinyi

85
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,120
meet me back then?

86
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,240
(Did something happen five years ago?)

87
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,400
(Otherwise, why would Xinyi target me?)

88
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,840
Hanyu, what's on your mind?

89
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,080
Today,

90
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,600
when that car almost hit me,

91
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,760
I suddenly felt like

92
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,680
nothing matters,

93
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,400
except for you.

94
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,120
You're all I can think about.

95
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,560
Why are you saying this?

96
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
I just realized we haven't

97
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,960
really had a proper dinner together.

98
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,720
So now, I'm officially asking you

99
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
to have dinner with me tomorrow night.

100
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,280
Let me think about it.

101
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,880
Is it really this hard to meet up?

102
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,400
Not scared of me?

103
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,920
I might kill you.

104
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,680
If you do, it'll be for Xia Mo.

105
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,560
I wouldn't blame you.

106
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,160
Trying to play the hero now?

107
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,280
You think I won't...

108
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,720
If my death

109
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,640
could save Xia Mo,

110
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,080
I'd do it.

111
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,160
Xia Mo and I made a contract.

112
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,840
If I break my word,

113
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,320
which means I die,

114
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,400
Xia Mo will face backlash.

115
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,040
What did you just say?

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm warning you.

117
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,720
Stop wasting time with these lies.

118
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,720
Then go ahead. Do it.

119
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,720
Think I won't actually do it?

120
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,120
I made that contract

121
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,600
to bring my parents back,

122
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,960
and it is still valid now.

123
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,720
So we have time to save Xia Mo.

124
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,880
I won't let anything happen to her.

125
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,080
You'd better keep your word.

126
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,920
Remember what you said today.

127
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,960

I swear I'll end you.

129
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
