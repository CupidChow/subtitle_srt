If you hadn't saved me,

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,260
we wouldn't be tangled up now.

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,700
Hey, babe,

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,860
without you,

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,180
this game wouldn't be any fun.

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,460
Why do you keep lying to me?

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,860
Why did you use me?

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,140
Was there ever any real feeling?

20
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,700
We set the rules for us from the start.

21
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,900
You're the one who broke the rules.

22
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,220
It's just a game.

23
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,460
No need to take it so seriously.

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,060
You made it less fun, you know?

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,820
You once said,

26
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,900
we're both freaks.

27
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,820
Only we really get each other.

28
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,180
Back then, you felt so close to me.

29
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,500
I want to ask you one last thing.

30
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,700
Go on.

31
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,820
Did you ever love me?

32
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,380
Love?

33
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,460
Do you think real love exists?

34
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,820
There's no such thing as love!

35
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,260
It's all just lies.

36
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,780
Love is for the helpless.

37
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,540
It's a scam with unfair payback.

38
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,460
I thought you were different.

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,740
I thought you saw through it all.

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,980
Turns out you're just as blind.

41
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,020
I was being foolish.

42
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,100
That's right, babe.

43
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,740
It's just a game.

44
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,180
No need to get caught up in feelings.

45
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,820
Didn't you say you have a score to settle?

46
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,540
Let's keep going.

47
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,820
I promise
I won't bother your sister this time.

48
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,660
Sounds good?

49
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,820
Come here.

50
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,820
Give me a hug.

51
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,180
Come on.

52
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,540
It's been so long.

53
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,220
Good girl.

54
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,740
I've missed you so much.

55
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,820
(We've made so many mistakes.)

56
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,620
(Let's make up for them together.)

57
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Xia Mo.

58
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,740
Let me see your face.

59
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,660
I want to use what time I have left

60
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,660
to remember your eyebrows,

61
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,340
your eyes,

62
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,900
your nose,

63
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,820
and your lips.

64
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,740
I want to remember everything about you.

65
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,020
Xia Mo, you know what?

66
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,820
The first time I saw you,

67
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
it was your eyes that drew me in.

68
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,820
Your eyes shine just like stars,

69
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,500
guiding me closer to you.

70
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,020
Honestly, when we first met,

71
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,780
I was already falling for you.

72
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,740
Me too.

73
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,060
Meeting you has been

74
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,900
the happiest thing in my life.

75
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,780
You taught me how to love.

76
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,340
These past five years,

77
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,340
no matter what happened,

78
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,220
we always stuck by each other.

79
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,220
We've been really lucky.

80
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,340
Yeah, so lucky.

81
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,180
Xia Mo,

82
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,180
I just want to

83
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,380
remember everything about you.

84
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,940
Remember it all

85
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,060
and hope to see you again.

86
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,220
I will always...

87
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,180
always...

88
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,780
Xia Mo,

89
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,780
I won't let you go.

90
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,540
I'd trade my life

91
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,340
for the one I love the most,

92
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,900
just so she stays healthy,

93
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,060
safe and sound,

94
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,460
and lives happily on.

95
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,540
I'd trade my life

96
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,660
for the one I love the most,

97
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,180
just so she stays healthy,

98
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,500
safe and sound,

99
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,460
and lives happily on.

100
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,460
I'd trade my life

101
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,980
for the one I love the most,

102
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,580
just so she stays healthy,

103
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,460
safe and sound,

104
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,220
and lives happily on.

105
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,620
Xia Mo,

106
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,860
do you remember our promise?

107
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,020
No matter when,

108
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,640
no matter what comes our way,

109
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,340
we said we'd always stay together

110
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,900
and face it together.

111
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,380
Of course, I remember.

112
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,620
Mu Hanyu,

113
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,420
no matter if our love

114
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,020
gets forgotten down the line,

115
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,900
do you

116
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,900
take Witch Xia Mo to be your wife?

117
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,620
I do.

118
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,440
Then,

119
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,660
do you take Mu Hanyu, an ordinary man

120
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,020
and be your husband?

121
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,380
I do.

122
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,700
I thought we had more time.

123
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,780
But in the end, it all felt rushed.

124
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,100
Meeting you

125
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,220
was the happiest moment of my life.

126
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,340
We've been through so much together.

127
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,100
Now this day finally came.

128
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,020
I want to be with you.

129
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,140

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,940
♪Autumn leaves, and winter frost♪

191
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,070
♪But I never got to be with you♪

192
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,730
♪To plant flowers
across all four seasons♪

193
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,600
♪I watched sunsets blend into the night♪

194
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,470
♪Waited as the moon drifted,
Milky Way shifted♪

195
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,140
♪Still, I never stayed♪
