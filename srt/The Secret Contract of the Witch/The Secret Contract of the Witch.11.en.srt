=Episode 11=

11
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,850
So we're the hunted now. What next?

12
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,730
We wait.

13
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,530
Just wait?

14
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,330
You can't be serious.

15
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,890
Is your plan today really just to wait?

16
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,770
Xia Mo, have you been online too much lately?

17
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,450
What do you mean, online?

18
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,530
Like using the Internet with the phone

19
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,370
I gave you.

20
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,770
Are you kidding me?

21
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,570
I used my phone just to call you.

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,730
You called me...

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,890
And besides,

24
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,450
you were the one who triggered the trap.

25
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,330
Yes.

26
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,010
That's because you sounded so confident.

27
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,890
Do you remember

28
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,210
how proud you were back then?

29
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,650
The best hunters

30
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,850
always show up as prey at first.

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,250
Didn't you say that?

32
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,770
Do you remember how you looked?

33
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,610
Like this.

34
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,410
The best hunters...

35
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,570
I don't remember.

36
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,690
Someone's coming.

37
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,430
Speak up.

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,330
What does the boss want with me this time?

39
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,130
I've already left you guys.

40
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,650
Why can't you just let me go?

41
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,770
It's you.

42
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,210
Xia Mo.

43
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:30,340
(Certificate)

44
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,210
You know I wouldn't come for nothing.

45
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,330
Let's make a deal.

46
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,050
Help me take on J.

47
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,210
Then I'll help you get what you want.

48
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,490
But now, I'm just a shadow of myself.

49
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,330
There's nothing I can really do.

50
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,290
All I need is his address.

51
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,690
He's ruthless, you know.

52
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,050
If he finds out it's me who gave you

53
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,890
any information,

54
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,570
I won't make it out alive.

55
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,610
So you're scared of him,

56
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,410
but what about me?

57
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,490
What are you planning?

58
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,490
You risk everything for your son.

59
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,210
Work with me on this

60
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,290
and I'll give you what you need.

61
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,850
You know how it is.

62
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,490
I can do it.

63
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,970
I worked for Mr. J for years

64
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,410
and even lost a leg for him.

65
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,970
And for what?

66
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,690
I got nothing in the end.

67
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,770
Now I have nothing left.

68
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,330
Might as well team up with you,

69
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,050
at least leave something for my son.

70
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,410
It's settled then.

71
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,130
Alright.

72
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,770
I'm in.

73
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,570
Didn't expect J to watch people

74
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,770
even this far out.

75
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,490
If he finds out Shen told you,

76
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,290
Shen could be in danger.

77
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,290
I've already sent them

78
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,570
somewhere safe.

79
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,570
No one can find them there.

80
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,690
Why are you helping them?

81
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,050
At first, I thought

82
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,050
he was just taking risks for money,

83
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,130
but I didn't expect

84
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,290
he did it all for his son.

85
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,730
For people like you,

86
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,330
family bonds seem extra strong.

87
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,290
Have you heard this saying?

88
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,290
When gods can't guard everyone,

89
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,450
they send us parents.

90
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,330
To me,

91
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,570
my parents are my real guardians.

92
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,010
They gave me a second chance.

93
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,410
Mu Hanyu.

94
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,490
I promise I'll give you answers.

95
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,730
Xia Mo, what's wrong?

96
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,610
Xia Mo? Xia Mo?

97
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,250
Xia Mo?

98
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,570
Xia Mo!

99
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,570
Xia Mo.

100
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,530
Xia Mo.

101
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,170
Why?

102
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,850
Xia Mo.

103
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,450
She doesn't have much time left.

104
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,570
It's all your fault.

105
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,690
Whether it was five years ago or now,

106
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,890
why do you always show up again?

107
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,970
You think I did this.

108
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,130
You have no idea

109
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,890
what happened before your parents died.

110
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,500
It was all because of you.

111
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,850
She only has five years left now.

112
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,730
You want to save your son.

113
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,210
What do we need to do?

114
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,130
A life for a life.

115
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,130
Your lives will be the price

116
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,890
to keep Mu Hanyu alive.

117
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,010
Once the contract is sealed,

118
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,050
you'll both be gone instantly.

119
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,850
No turning back.

120
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,460
We don't have much time left.

121
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,610
Shall we proceed?

122
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,010
We're ready to trade our lives

123
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,770
for our son's life.

124
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,170
And we want Hanyu

125
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,850
to have the Witch Clan's power,

126
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,930
so no one can ever hurt him again.

127
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,450
You're too greedy.

128
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,010
You want the necklace to shield Mu Hanyu?

129
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,290
Unbelievable!

130
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,890
The necklace... is gone!

131
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,570
Clan Leader.

132
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,810
What is it?

133
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,170
What happened here?

134
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,530
Xia Mo.

135
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,290
You're the new clan leader now.

136
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,690
You must

137
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,570
find the Witch Necklace.

138
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,290
Promise...

139
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,890
Promise me.

140
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,730
Alright.

141
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,330
I promise you.

142
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,770
I'll get the Witch Necklace back.

143
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,890
Remember this.

144
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,890
You only have five years.

145
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,050
After that, the bone-gnawing pain starts.

146
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,290
It could drive you to death.

147
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,730
Clan Leader.

148
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,010
Clan Leader!

149
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,450
My parents changed the contract for me.

150
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,890
That's why the necklace chose me.

151
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,990
What else could it be?

152
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,290
Otherwise, the necklace

153
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,290
wouldn't keep you safe.

154
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,210
Xia Mo became like this

155
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,430
because she lost the necklace.

156
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,890
The former clan leader
cast a curse on her.

157
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,450
If she can't get the necklace,

158
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,410
she'll die.

159
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,850
How can I give the necklace back?

160
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,770
I don't know.

161
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,170
Maybe only if you're gone,

162
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,730
the necklace can go back to her.

163
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,970
What's wrong?

164
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,210
Not ready to die?

165
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,010
My sister ended up like this

166
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,730
all because your parents were selfish.

167
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,770
You should pay for that.

168
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,250
I owe Xia Mo,

169
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,290
but I can't leave just yet.

170
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,650
There's stuff I need to do.

171
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:44,970
I knew it.

172
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,810
Get lost!

173
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,050
If you can't do it, get lost.

174
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,930
Stop acting in front of me.

175
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,410
Get out of my sight.

176
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,970
(I want to trade my life)

177
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,290
(for my parents' lives.)

178
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,370
(Then, the necklace
can be returned to you.)

179
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,050
(Two birds, one stone.)

180
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,890
Does this dish look familiar?

181
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,050
Yeah, I know it well.

182
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,290
It's my dad's favorite food.

183
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,830
Mr. Mu,

184
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,530
you never treat us to dinner.

185
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,990
Are you asking me for a favor?

186
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,650
Yeah, personal stuff.

187
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,930
I'll be away for a while.

188
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,490
I have a few things here.

189
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,370
This one

190
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,510
