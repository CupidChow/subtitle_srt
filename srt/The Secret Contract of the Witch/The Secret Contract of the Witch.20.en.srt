00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,680
- I...
- Delete it.

13
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,600
It's so beautiful.

14
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,480
I want to come here every year
to collect shells.

15
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,720
Let's hang this up.

16
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,880
Do you like me?

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,440
(Turns out, I've loved you all along.)

(Lane 66 Bar)

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,440
Xia Wen.

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,640
What's wrong?

21
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,840
Help everyone.

22
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,640
What's wrong with everyone?

23
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,320
Xia Wen.

24
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,760
Hurry up.

25
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,840
Are you alright?

26
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,600
Are you okay?

27
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,240
Xia Mo.

28
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,400
Finally, you're here.

29
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,040
I've been waiting forever for you.

30
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,320
What do you think?

31
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,680
Pretty impressive here, right?

32
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,040
I'm here to get justice for Hui.

33
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,400
Xia Mo, Xia Mo.

34
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,040
People say witches are above us all.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,120
Didn't expect you to be so clueless.

36
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,840
The same old trap,

37
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,840
yet you fall for it every time.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,840
You guys sure are clever.

39
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,400
Professor Mu is a true expert.

40
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,280
He made such an impressive gadget.

41
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,920
It not only adjusts mystic power,

42
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,400
but also manage pain levels.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,760
How much should I set it to?

44
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,200
A bit stronger?

45
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,200
Does it hurt?

46
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,040
It hurts so much, huh?

47
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,120
Then weaker.

48
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,600
Xia Mo.

49
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,040
You hit my people on my turf.

50
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,480
Don't you think that's out of line?

51
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,400
Even a dog has its owner, right?

52
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,040
So tell me,

53
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,640
with just a tiny bit of power,

54
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,680
what could you really do?

55
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,320
Guys,

56
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,200
show them a good time.

57
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,360
What do you think?

58
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,800
Let's begin.

59
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,320
Xinyi,

60
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,680
I've got some good news for you.

61
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,800
I've rounded up

62
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
all the witches.

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,040
We finally pulled it off.

64
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,360
Really?

65
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,240
Guess who I just caught.

66
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,120
Xia Mo.

67
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
What do you think?

68
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,800
What did you say?

69
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,920
I said I just caught Xia...

70
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,040
What did you say?

71
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
What's wrong?

72
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,800
You told me to wait.

73
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,520
Wasn't it to help catch witches?

74
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,200
You just wanted my sister to show up.

75
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,040
So you've been using and lying to me.

76
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,040
Let me go!

77
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,080
You're no different from them.

78
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,760
Without mystic power, you're useless.

79
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,600
Oh, right.

80
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,240
Almost forgot to tell you.

81
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,680
The last step to catch the witch

82
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,520
isn't Xia Mo.

83
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,560
It's you.

84
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,360
- No rush.
- Get lost!

85
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,200
Good girl.

86
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,800
Xia Mo.

87
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,520
Xinyi.

88
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,760
Mo.

89
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
Xia Mo.

90
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,320
I've got a little surprise for you today.

91
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,520
Guess what it is.

92
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,080
Xinyi.

93
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,800
Are you okay?

94
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,080
Mo.

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,280
Still acting like sisters now?

96
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,920
By now, you should know

97
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,480
who betrayed the Witch Clan.

98
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,360
You get it now, right?

99
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,760
Why did the witches vanish so suddenly?

100
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,680
Why was I able to find you so easily?

101
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,200
Before Hui passed away,

102
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,680
did she say anything else?

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,240
Anything else you hid from me?

104
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,320
No, that's all.

105
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,240
You better not be lying to me.

106
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,240
I'll give you a few minutes now.

107
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,360
You two should talk things out.

108
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,680
Is that you, Xinyi?

109
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,360
It really is you.

110
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Why?

111
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,000
That's right.

112
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,240
It's me.

113
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,360
I want to get rid of these witches.

114
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,120
But they're all our clan members.

115
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,480
How could you hurt them like that?

116
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,800
Do you even know what you're doing?

117
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,040
Do they deserve this?

118
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,360
I've always lived on the edge,

119
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,800
afraid to make a single mistake.

120
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,560
They never once helped me out.

121
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,880
Instead, they laughed at me
and pushed me around.

122
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
First, it was one witch.

123
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,920
Then, a whole group of witches.

124
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,920
They took out all their anger on me.

125
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,800
Only you were kind to me.

126
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,560
They all deserve what's coming.

127
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,140
(Lane 66 Bar)

128
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,240
Is the floor clean now?

129
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, it's all clean.

130
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,480
Is the floor clean now?

131
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,120
No, not really.

132
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,560
I asked you to clean, but you didn't.

133
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,480
It's not clean yet!

134
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,480
You guys...

135
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,480
Still talking back, huh?

136
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,240
Now you're crying.

137
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,440
One tear falls,

138
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,320
and one slap follows.

139
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,360
Just remember this.

140
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,240
You're a half-human, half-demon freak.

141
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,560
You really get on my nerves.

142
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,500
Don't act like that again,

143
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,800
all sad and helpless.

144
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,240
Next time, I'll call you out.

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,880
Did you hear me?

146
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,480
Did you hear what I said?

147
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,200
I didn't...

148
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,080
You...

149
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
If I see you picking on her again,

150
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,480
I won't let it slide.

151
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,200
