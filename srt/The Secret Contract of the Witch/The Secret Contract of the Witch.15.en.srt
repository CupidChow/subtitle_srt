Xia Mo.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
She's running out of time.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,520
It's all because of you.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,360
Xia Mo.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,640
Xia Mo.

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm okay.

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,920
You really scared me.

21
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,860
(I'll be waiting at the beach.)

22
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,520
Mu Hanyu.

23
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,520
Xia Mo.

24
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,720
Today...

25
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,160
I'm here to fulfill the contract.

26
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,880
I'll give up everything I have.

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,880
Just so the one I love

28
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,240
can live her life well.

29
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,080
What are you doing?

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,580
The contract isn't done yet.

31
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,800
You can't quit halfway.

32
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,320
That was your rule.

33
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,730
So everything you did lately

34
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,680
was just to say goodbye to me

35
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,440
and then finish the contract.

36
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,960
This is all I can do for you now.

37
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,160
Did you ever ask if that's what I want?

38
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,640
Xia Mo.

39
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,800
This is the best choice for us both.

40
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,680
I believe that

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,840
anyone who loves you

42
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,320
would make that choice.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,680
I really can't face

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,080
losing the one I love.

45
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,720
What about me?

46
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,880
Am I supposed to
be okay with you dying for me?

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
I can't just pretend

48
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,160
that nothing ever happened.

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,080
Don't you think that's just cruel?

50
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,160
Let's both calm down and think straight.

51
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,240
I can't agree with that.

52
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,040
Absolutely not.

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,440
Xia Mo,

54
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,600
even if you don't keep our promise,

55
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,600
I can still give the necklace back to you.

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,680
Mu Hanyu,

57
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,720
don't do anything stupid.

58
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,120
Dying won't solve anything.

59
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
What do you mean?

60
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,600
Did you forget about Xiaoyan?

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,800
If I change the contract,

62
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,560
I'll face a backlash.

63
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,960
If I don't finish your contract

64
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,800
and you die, the backlash hits me too.

65
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,560

92
