12

How did you catch her?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,160
You really are something.

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,160
She's all yours.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,960
Xia Xinyi, you'll get what's coming.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,000
Too bad,

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,680
you won't live to see that.

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,640
Remember this,

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,320
you don't deserve to be one of us.

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,080
You're just a freak.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,160
Freak.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,160
Freak!

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,360
Only if you all disappear,

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,840
can I finally break free from you.

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,080
Take her away.

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,640
I've helped you take out so many witches.

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Shouldn't I get a bigger reward?

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,480
You want a reward now?

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,400
Isn't it a bit too soon?

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,000
Fair point.

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,160
Let's wait till all the witches are gone.

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,520
We can celebrate after that.

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,920
Every single one?

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,360
Does that include me?

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,560
Not you, of course.

36
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,240
You're not like them.

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,200
How am I different?

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,160
You can't stand them.

39
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,440
You and I, we're the same.

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,560
Don't worry.

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,360
I'll get rid of

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,720
anyone you hate.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,440
Even if it's your sister Xia Mo,

44
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,240
I'll let you deal with her as you want.

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,520
I've told you before,

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,440
if you go after other witches,

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,800
I'm always here to help.

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,440
But if you touch my sister,

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
I'll make sure

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,920
you regret it for life.

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,920
I'm just messing with you.

52
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,000
How would I ever hurt your sister?

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,560
You even look pretty when you're mad.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,240
Hurting you is the last thing I'd do.

55
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
Isn't that right?

56
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,920
This time I knocked first.

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,160
I bought you breakfast.

58
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,570
Got something sweet,

59
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,930
something savory,

60
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,520
something round,

61
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,800
and something bar-like.

62
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,920
What are you up to now?

63
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,160
I need a favor from you.

64
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,400
Help me find someone in J Organization.

65
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,120
Why are you looking for them all of a sudden?

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,080
I found this person's address.

67
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,560
I need to know
what J Organization is up to.

68
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,440
I'm doing this for Hui.

69
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,680
I already told you

70
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm busy.

71
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,840
I'll say it again,

72
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm busy.

73
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
Mu Hanyu,

74
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,360
last time you just ignored me on purpose.

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,800
I don't have time to argue with you,

76
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,640
yet you're still so stubborn.

77
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,400
What's gotten into you?

78
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
I guess I am stubborn.

79
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,120
Was ruining my family
not enough for you?

80
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,220
Now you're here to make my life harder.

81
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,960
What are you really after?

82
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,240
I caused your parents' deaths?

83
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,960
Who told you that?

84
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,840
Can you say you had nothing to do with it?

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,840
If that's true,

86
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,000
then this necklace

87
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,680
wouldn't be around my neck now.

88
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
What do you mean by that?

89
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,180
(Container Street Intersection)

90
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,920
Back then, they made a contract.

91
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,120
They traded their lives to save me.

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,640
You've signed a contract before?

93
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,240
That's right.

94
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,960
If it weren't for that car accident,

95
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,680
my parents

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
wouldn't have died at all.

97
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,240
So you think it was me,

98
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,520
who planned the car accident?

99
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
I might use people's greed,

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,240
but I'm not that low

101
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,000
to go this far.

102
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
Looks like you don't trust me.

103
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,120
If that's the case,

104

from now on,

105
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,960

Nothing else.

I just happened to pass by.

132
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,520
That's some coincidence.

133
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,160

Are you addicted to protecting me?

143
