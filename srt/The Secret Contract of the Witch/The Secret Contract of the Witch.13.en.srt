Xia Mo.

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,930
Xia Mo, don't come any closer!

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:47,970
It's a trap, Xia Mo!

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:51,930
Xia Mo!

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,090
This really is a trap.

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,970
Xia Mo.

17
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,490
Why are you so stubborn, Xia Mo?

18
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,810
Yeah!

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,170
I'm honestly moved.

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,490
I'm about to cry.

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,370
Xia Mo,

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,930
you knew it was a trap.

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,130
Xia Mo.

24
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,090
Still, you came anyway.

25
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,490
Professor Mu,

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,130
she really cares about you.

27
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,530
If I didn't show up,

28
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,810
your game wouldn't work.

29
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,850
Of course,

30
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,130
playing alone is boring.

31
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,650
It's way better with everyone.

32
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,170
Why are you targeting us?

33
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,290
Why go after you both?

34
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,210
Because you need to pay

35
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,810
for what you've done.

36
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,290
Someone made a contract

37
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,370
and you got sacrificed.

38
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,690
So you hold a grudge.

39
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,410
I like playing with smart folks.

40
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,970
Since you know

41
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,450
that you ruined everything I had,

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,450
I'm ending your world too.

43
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,930
Don't you like

44
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,090
making tough choices when things get hard?

45
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,050
Well, today,

46
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,330
I'm going to let you feel

47
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,730
what it's like to make that choice.

48
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,290
No, don't!

49
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,810
You do worry about him.

50
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,810
Want to save him, huh?

51
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,530
Here's your shot.

52
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,810
Just hurt yourself instead.

53
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,690
I'll be fine, Xia Mo.

54
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,930
- Come on.
- I'll be fine.

55
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,850
Xia Mo.

56
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,850
Xia Mo, trust me.

57
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,730
- Come on.
- Xia Mo.

58
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,730
Xia Mo, don't.

59
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,490
- Xia Mo.
- Go on.

60
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,470
Don't do anything rash.

61
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,630
Trust me, Xia Mo.

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,250
Xia Mo!

63
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,610
It's not worth it, Xia Mo!

64
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,170
Xia Mo!

65
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,250
Exactly, that's right.

66
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,610
Xia Mo.

67
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,250
I thought you two were proud.

68
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,410
Turns out you're so humble.

69
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,610
Is that enough now?

70
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,850
Xia Mo!

71
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,090
Do you think that's enough?

72
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,330
I've looked like this for ten years.

73
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,450
Go on.

74
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,050
Xia Mo.

75
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,050
Don't do anything silly.

76
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,930
Come on.

77
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,650
Xia Mo.

78
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,450
That's enough!

79
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,090
Yes!

80
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,730
Impressive.

81
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,050
Xia Mo.

82
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,610
That was amazing.

83
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,330
Do it again.

84
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,530
Hurry up.

85
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,970
Why are you just standing there?

86
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,130
Xia Mo.

87
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,610
Xia Mo, are you okay?

88
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,650
Xia Mo.

89
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,890
Are you okay?

90
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,570
Are you alright, Xia Mo?

91
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,250
I'm fine.

92
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,730
Once my mystic power returns,

93
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,890
I'll heal up on my own.

94
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,650
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,730
I studied the jammer

96
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,010
mainly to find the witch.

97
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,530

He didn't hurt me.

127
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,010

Why are you still here?

129
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,690
Your presence

130
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,410
will only bring her more trouble.

131
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,130

You're hurt too.

133
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,610

Leave.

136
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,770
I told you not to mess with my sister.

137
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,290
She came to me on her own.

138
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,090
I was just defending myself.

139
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,930
Doesn't matter.

140
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,090

142
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,490

I won't end you today

150

151
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,050
But if you touch my sister again,

152
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,490
I'll make sure you pay.

153
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,490
Did you forget Operation Witch Hunt?

154
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,650
That was our promise.

and that's what saved me.

163
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,370
But Xia Mo lost her necklace

164
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,290

165
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,850
