00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,760
this is Hanyu.

91
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,480
I should have said goodbye to you.

But everything happened so fast.

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,600
I was scared to face you.

94
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,220
I didn't know what to say.

95
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,680
Thank you for always looking after me.

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,600
You cared for me like my parents do.

97
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,200

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,840

99
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,680
I hope you'll support me this time too.

100

Do you look down on me like the rest?

119
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,480
I've told you

120
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,960
about my boundaries before.

121
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,760
If I told you

122
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
I look like a weirdo,

123
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,880
would you still want me?

124
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,560

Can't you just sweep it up?

131
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,360
Why so loud just sweeping the floor?

132
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,840

135
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,320
Say something.

136
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,400
Why the long face all day?

137
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Do I owe you or something?

138
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,280

Do you even know

143
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,400
what my biggest mistake is?

144
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,040
It's having you, that's what.

145
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,800

146
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960

All because of you, useless thing.

149
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,800
Loser!

150
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,690

151
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,920
Both of you are thankless.

152
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,280

156
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Mom, I know I was wrong.

157
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,800
Quiet.

158
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,720

everything I want?

160
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,600
Not you.

161
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,800
It's him.

162
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,280
Su Chen.

163
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,960
What a handsome face he's got.

164
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,160
He takes after me, you know.

165
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,280
I used to rely on my looks too.

166
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Su Chen.

167
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Are you willing to make a contract?

168
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,120
Say it.

169
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
Come on, just say it.

170
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,480
If we make a contract,

171
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,280
will Mom stop disliking me?

172
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,280
Does that mean we can

173
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,400
finally live like normal people?

174
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,720
Of course.

175
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,960
Silly kid, we already agreed on this.

176
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,960
As long as you turn your looks into money,

177
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,040
I will treat you well for sure.

178
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm willing.

179
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,600
The contract is sealed.

180
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,280
Everything will go your way now.

181
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,800

You're a freaking immortal.

186
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,160
No need to thank me.

All of this

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,320
My face?

190
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,840
Mom, my face is gone! Mom!

191
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,800
Mom, Mom.

192
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,880
My face...

193
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,960
No amount of money could fix this.

194
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,950
Who let you out?

195
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,160
You're a monster.

196
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,080
Get back in there.

197
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,760
Go inside.

198
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,640
It's all because of the witch.

199
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,280
That's why my mom changed.

200
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,280
It's all the witch's fault.

201
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,080
I'm just a misfit.

202
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,040
Do you still love me?

203
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,080
I do.

204
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,080
I'm a misfit too.

205
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,680
