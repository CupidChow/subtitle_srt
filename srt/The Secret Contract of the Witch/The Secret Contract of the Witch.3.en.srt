Mu Hanyu,

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
even in dreams, you never give in.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,280
You're a real handful.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,920
What do you really want?

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,280
You drank too much just now.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,160
I'm helping you sober up.

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,320
How about

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,800
we do it together?

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,440
You've worked so hard
to get close to me.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
Is it all just for the necklace?

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,440
Right?

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,440
Yeah.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,120
The necklace was always mine.

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,080
But since you have it now,

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,520
I won't just take it for free.

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,200
The necklace was from my parents.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,720
Don't even think about taking it.

28
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,520
If that's how it is,

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,880
I'll just wait till you're gone.

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,240
Then the necklace will be mine.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,040
Why are you laughing?

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,600
If you could really kill me,

33
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,600
you wouldn't try so hard to charm me.

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,880
If I can't get rid of you,

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,160
I'll make your life miserable.

36
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,160
As long as you keep the necklace,

37
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,600
I'll keep haunting you.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,800
If you never give it back,

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
I'll stick with you forever.

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,080
Anyway,

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,760

(without the necklace, I can't go on.)

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,670
The universe is like a world of plants.

49
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,920
It starts with one tiny seed.

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,200
That's just like the Big Bang.

51
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,600
It began from a tiny point,

52
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,240
then kept expanding to what we see now.

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,360
Science works the same way.

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,200
It's a complex and long road,

55
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,360
helping us find new things every day

56
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,760
and explore the mysteries out there.

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,760
Lately, this mysterious force...

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,680
Thank you

59
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,480
for sharing with us through science.

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,360
Professor Mu, you're young and talented.

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
You must have a ton of admirers.

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,200
Do you... have a girlfriend?

63
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,640
- No, I don't.
- No?

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,520
Actually, he does.

65
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,040
I'm his girlfriend.

66
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,520
Our relationship

67
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,640
is just like the Big Bang.

68
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,610
It's big news.

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,840
From a tiny spark,

70
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,080
it grew into what it is now.

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
So, Professor Mu,

72
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,640
is she really your girlfriend?

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,320
Hey, good morning, everyone.

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,440
Hey, morning.

75
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,960
I brought you all breakfast.

76
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,160
What a surprise!

77
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
Breakfast?

78
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,240
- Here you are.
- Thanks!

79
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,080
Thank you.

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,050
This one's yours.

81
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,560
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

82
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,480
I've been staying at your place.

83
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,480
You haven't rested well these days.

84
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,500
Get some proper fuel in you.

85
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,400
Aren't you worried you can't keep up later?

86
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,920
I'm good. I can handle it.

87
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,280
Where's Xia Mo?

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,000
Who do you think you are?

89
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,480
It's none of your business.

90
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,480
Hand over the Witch's Necklace.

91
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,840
With the necklace,

92
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,640
I'm sure that woman will show up.

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,120
If you want it, come get it yourself.

94
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
I'd really like to find out,

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,200
is it your stubborn mouth,

96
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,040
or your tough bones?

97
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,400
Teach him a lesson.

98
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,400
Don't hold back!

99
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,080
Break his legs first.

100
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,840
You just stand there and watch.

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,840
You won't give me the necklace anyway.

102
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,800
Might as well let them grab it first.

103
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
I can snatch it back later.

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,720
Get him.

105
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,600
Hit him.

106
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,080
Let go!

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,960
No, stop, please!

108
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,360
Let's go.

109
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,600
Go, just go.

110
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600

113
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,960
I'm fine.

114
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,960
You're tougher than you look.

115
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,080
You're pretty good in a fight.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
Just a few street punks.

117
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,240
Nothing to worry about.

- Keep running.
- It's you.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,520

139
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,120
Betrayal?

140
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,200
Except for my sister,

141
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,280

That's right.

143
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,760
You're not one of us.

144
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,090

145
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,960
Freak?

146
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,400
But do you know

147
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,240

148
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,880

Who's next?

158
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,360
Take them all out.

172
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
It's my fault.

173
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,480
I can't even protect my clan members.

174
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,720
I'm not fit to be a clan leader.
