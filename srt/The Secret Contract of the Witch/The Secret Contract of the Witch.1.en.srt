=Episode 1=

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,360
Did you bring what I asked for?

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,960
What you want is right here with me.

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,400
If you want it,

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,200
you'll have to beat me first.

15
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,400
Mu Hanyu.

16
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,040
Who are you?

17
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,200
It doesn't matter.

18
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,200
What matters is

19
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,280
that you lost.

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,440
Does it hurt?

21
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,200
What are you really after?

22
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,480
With the Witch's Necklace as witness,

23
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,680
make a contract with me.

24
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,040
Give me what I want,

25
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,200
and I'll spare you any punishment.

26
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,840
I don't need that.

27
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,400
The contract is fair.

28
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
It'll not only spare you,

29
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
but also give you

30
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,680
everything you ever wanted.

31
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,400
Everything I ever wanted?

32
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,200
The people you want to see,

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
the things left unfinished.

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,120
The people I miss.

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,120
Come on,

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,960
hand me the necklace.

37
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
But you can't make a contract now.

38
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,320
Because the real Witch's Necklace

39
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,560
is with me.

40
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,100
(One day earlier)

41
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,820
(M224 Era, Jiang City, Earth)

42
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,160
Mo.

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,440
Another petal just fell.

44
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,280
If you can't find the necklace...

45
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,760
I already know

46
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
where the necklace is now.

47
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
Mu Hanyu, a famous physicist,

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,160
skipped the ceremony,

49
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,860
sparking public speculation

50
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,680
about his absence.

51
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,560
You must be Xia Mo.

52
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,880
Mu Hanyu.

53
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,600
You're late.

54
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,760
Something held me up.

55
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,480
You seem anxious.

56
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,440
Did you bring the necklace?

57
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,120
Let's open it and check.

58
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,280
I need you to trade me something.

59
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,480
The amount

60
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,120
is enough to make that trade.

61
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,720
I don't want it.

62
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,440
I think

63
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,500
you'll need to

64
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,000
trade something better for it.

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So what do you want?

66
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,760
Power? Status?

67
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,280
Women?

68
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,000
I've heard the Witch's Necklace

69
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,440
is used for contracts
between witches and people.

70
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,880
If someone pays the price,

71
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,440
they can wish for anything.

72
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,040
So, are you a witch?

73
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,000
Maybe check the amount inside first.

74
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,280
I told you, I don't need it.

75
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,480
What do you really want?

76
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,760
Are you a witch?

77
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,600
Give me the necklace and I'll tell you.

78
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Say you're a witch,

79
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,560
and I'll hand it over.

80
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,880
So you're a real witch.

81
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,120
It's empty.

82
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,280
How dare you?

83
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,560
You used the necklace to lure me out

84
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,400
just to check who I really am.

85
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,000
I had to make sure.

86
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,840
See if you're a witch.

87
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,600
Not bad at all.

88
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,200
I actually ran into one.

89
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,600
It turns out witches are real.

90
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,840
If we catch her,

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,960
we'll make a fortune.

92
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,720
Brought backup, huh?

93
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,040
I don't know any of them.

94
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,120
All lies from start to finish.

95
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,400
You're not trustworthy.

96
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,440
Grab them for me.

97
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,720
Stay out of the way,
don't cause trouble.

98
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,960
We'll settle our scores later.

99
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,280
Go, get them!

100
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,840
Let me down!

101
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,160
Tell her to stop, right now.

102
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,280
Useless, all of you.

103
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,920
(So the necklace is with him.)

104
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,280
I want her gone, for good.

105
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,240
Wait.

106
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,480
Where is this place?

107
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,400
How did you do that?

108
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,560
Do you want to know?

109
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,280
Come with me.

110
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,960
That's pretty wild.

111
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,280
How'd you pull that off?

112
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,720
Can you go anywhere you want?

113
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
Like the desert?

114
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,480
Or the rainforest?

115
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,640
Where are they?

116
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Can other witches do this too?

117
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,160
Can the necklace do that too?

118
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
Come with me.

119
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,600
You saw it yourself.

120
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,800
Through that door,

121
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,840
I could go anywhere I want.

122
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,840
I am the witch.

123
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,600
Can you sell me the necklace now?

124
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,380
I haven't decided on my price,

125
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,320
so I'm not selling it.

126
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,280
You backtrack.

127
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,640
Don't push me or I kill you!

128
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,160
Is this how witches say thanks

129
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,280
to their saviors?

130
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,960
Only you know if you're a savior

131
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,080
or just a schemer.

132
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,640
Yeah.

133
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,600
I shouldn't have bothered

134
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,720
saving you.

135
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,200
