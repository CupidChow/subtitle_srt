Don't worry.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,000
There's no way

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,320
I'd let you die

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
so easily.

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,240
You made me suffer so much.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,480
I want you and Mu Hanyu

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,520
to watch each other in pain

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,840
and slowly fade away together.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,360
That's the best payback I can give you!

(Lane 66)

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,080
He actually made it out alive.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
We can't let him hurt Mo again.

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,520
All of this

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,760
needs to end now.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,680
Liu Tian.

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,400
As long as you agree,

27
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm willing to try.

28
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,200
Why would I, babe?

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,600
Mo.

30
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,600
You're finally back.

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,200
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,480
It's good that you're home.

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,120
Mo,

34
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,960
I don't deserve to be with you now.

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,040
I know it's hard to move on,

36
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,120
but we can work out

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,480
whatever is between us.

38
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,560
I just don't want you fixing things for me.

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,960
That's why I had to leave.

40
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,960
No matter what happened before,

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,960
you've always been there for me.

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,840
Mo,

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,920
you don't owe me anything.

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,480
You're my little sister.

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,040
There's nothing to repay.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,120
I've made so many mistakes.

47
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,840
I can't fix things anymore.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,600
I can't come back here again.

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,760
So are you leaving anyway?

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm here to say goodbye, Mo.

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,040
Where will you go?

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,240
I honestly don't know.

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,600
Maybe I'll be like Aunt Rou,

54
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,400
staying somewhere else for decades.

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
I don't have much time left.

56
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,320
I can't watch you leave me.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,160
Leaving is a relief for me.

58
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,520
Alright.

59
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,520
Okay.

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,280
Mo.

61
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,440
If I see you bully her again,

62
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,880
I won't let it slide.

63
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,280
Can you be my sister?

64
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,320
Sure, I'd like that.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,200
You always say it's your fault,

66
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,440
but you never change.

67
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,120
Mo.

68
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,200
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,440
She's just half-human,

70
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,400
yet you let the clan members pick on her.

71
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,280
Xinyi, can you help me get out?

72
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,280
Okay, I'll help you.

73
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,880
Mo is the only one who's nice to me.

74
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,990
The others deserve what they get.

75
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,600
Go on.

76
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,800
Go.

77
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,400
Mo.

78
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm leaving now.

79
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,800
It's you.

80
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,720
You're still alive.

81
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,440
Xia Mo's still alive.

82
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,440
How could I die before she does?

83
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,960
If you have a problem, come at me!

84
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,760
Professor Mu,

85
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,720
stop trying to be the hero.

86
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
I'm not interested in you.

87
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,280
Xia Mo used my mom

88
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,800
to create this illusion here.

89
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,720
She tricked me.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,760
I almost believed her.

91
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,600
She always acts superior,

92
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,600
controlling everything.

93
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,720
But now, it's my turn.

94
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,160
Just wait and see.

95
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,600
I'll make her regret it all.

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,400
Go ahead and try.

97
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,520
Oh, by the way,

98
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,440
Xia Mo doesn't have much time left.

99
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,320
You care about Xia Mo so much.

100
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,280
You'd risk your life for her, wouldn't you?

101
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,160
How could I let you die?

102
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,280
I'm trying to save you.

103
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,960
You should thank me.

104
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,000
Once Xia Mo is gone,

105
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll let you go.

106
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,440
Is that alright, Professor Mu?

107
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
You're only

108
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,280
making me pity you.

109
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,240
You're trash.

110
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,600
Trash?

111
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,040
So, what now?

112
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,440
You only use

113
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,400
these dirty tricks

114
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,320
to get your way.

115
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,840
If you've got guts,

116
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,130
let me go.

117
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,040
We'll settle this like men.

118
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,280
Like men, huh?

119
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,240
Alright.

120
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,760
Bring it on.

121
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
Didn't expect you to save me.

122
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,040
My sister's matter...

123
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,260
What is your plan?

124
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,080
Her time was running out.

125
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,890
I'll accompany her to the very end.

126
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,360
What does it mean?

127
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,950
You only watched her die.

128
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,480
Don't forget

129
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,480
that your life was hers given.

130
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,840
I won't let her perish.

131
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,080
I'll fulfill the contract.

132
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,760
Okay.

133
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,280
Then, I am relieved.

134
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,840
Please uphold your commitments.

135
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,840
Hurry back.

136
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,360
My sister is waiting for you.

137
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,840
Did you meet her?

138
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,040
Yes.

139
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,920
How is it you do not return?

140
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,840
There are other matters to attend to.

141
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,520
I want to check out somewhere else.

142
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,080
I've already told my sister.

143
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,640
Maybe,

144
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,280
it'll be years before we meet again.

145
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,040
Or maybe no meeting anymore.

146
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,960
Xia Xinyi,

147
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,400
after I finish the contract,

148
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,720
if you're not with her,

149
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,800
she'll end up lonely.

150
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,840
You're a good person.

151
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,480
My sister was right about you.

152
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,750
Go back now.

153
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,720
Take care of her.

154
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,080
Brother-in-law.

155
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,480
About what happened 5 years ago,

156
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,480
I'm sorry.

157
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,280
Please forgive me.

158
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,680
Hey, babe,

159
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,080
long time no see.

160
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,160
I wish

161
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,960
I never really knew you.

162
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,360
All of you,

163
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,440
why do you think you're better?

164
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,600
Why push me around?

165
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,920
Why?

166
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,280
I'll tell you why.

167
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,860
Because you're half-human, half-demon.

168
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,400
You don't belong with us!

169
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,800
Are you okay?

170
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,600
Why did you save me back then?

171
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,960
If you hadn't saved me,

172
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,440
we wouldn't be tangled up now.
