=Episode 2=

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,120
I shouldn't have bothered

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,240
saving you.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,960
(You're right, you shouldn't have.)

14
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,440
(What happened to my power?)

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,560
(What was that just now?)

16
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,560
(So the necklace is protecting him.)

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,600
(Maybe there's another way
to handle him.)

18
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,440
Thanks for saving me last night.

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
This thing's dangerous.

20
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,320
You shouldn't leave it lying around.

21
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,600
Did I scare you yesterday?

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,080
How was your sleep?

23
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,720
Not sure if those people left.

24
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,600
Without you,

25
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,720
what if something happens to me?

26
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,160
When you wanted to hurt me,

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,440
you weren't like this at all.

28
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,880
You're my savior.

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,480
I'd love to do more to thank you.

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
Why would I hurt you?

31
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,160
But...

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,440
why are you

33
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,520
staring at my necklace?

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,880
No, I'm not.

35
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,440
I swear I was looking

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
at your chest.

37
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,000
So, do you want to live here,

38
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,360
or

39
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,200
just hang around here?

40
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,200
Either's fine with me.

41
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,760
You should leave.

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,200
Mu Hanyu.

43
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,560
I did spend the night at your place.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,730
And...

45
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,580
No ands.

46
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,240
Your tricks won't work.

47
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,120
See you.

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,760
Boss.

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,680
Where's the witch?

50
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,280
She ran off.

51
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,440
Boss,

52
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
give me another chance.

53
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,040
I'm on it right away.

54
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,040
I'll make sure to catch her.

55
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,280
Turn around.

56
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,040
If you can't find her,

57
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,440
I'll break your head.

58
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,280
Yes.

59
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,240
Do you understand?

60
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,600
Yes, I understand.

61
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,960
Get lost!

62
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,560
Okay, boss. I'm leaving now.

63
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,440
I'll go look for her.

64
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,000
Dad.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,880
We're willing to trade our lives

66
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,280
for our son's life.

67
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,280
Mom.

68
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,000
We want Hanyu to
get the Witch Clan's power.

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,040
So he'll never get hurt by you again.

70
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,760
I found the witch.

71
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,040
The necklace is with me now.

72
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,640
I swear I'll bring you both back.

73
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,380
(Bus Route)

74
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,100
(Lane 66)

75
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,040
Xinyi.

76
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,720
Xinyi.

77
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,200
Let me tell you a wild rumor.

78
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,280
They say witches exist here.

79
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,840
They can make a contract with people.

80
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,320
You just have to pay the right price

81
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,040
and one of your wishes can come true.

82
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,120
For real?

83
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,320
Are you kidding me?

84
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,160
It's true.

85
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,760
My great-grandma made a contract.

86
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,320
She said this was their gathering spot.

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,440
If that's the case,

88
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,640
I'd wish for endless money.

89
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,560
I'd even trade ten years of life.

90
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,980
What would you wish for?

91
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
The witch

92
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,600
must be gorgeous.

93
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,600
Feels like a waste just to wish.

94
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,440
Wouldn't it be better to marry her?

95
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,000
Come on, come on.

96
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,840
So what do you want then?

97
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,040
I can't help it.

98
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,980
Why did that girl
go to the real world again?

99
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,540
(Lane 66)

100
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,000
Xia Xinyi.

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,920
Mo.

102
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,040
Oblivion.

103
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,880
Mo.

104
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,880
Come with me.

105
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,720
I told you unless you have to,

106
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,840
don't get close to people.

107
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,760
It'll cause trouble.

108
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,160
Mo,

109
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,080
are you mad at me?

110
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,960
Mo,

111
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,160
teasing people when bored is fun.

112
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,400
It's interesting.

113
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,680
Last time you left someone in the hills.

114
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,520
It almost turned into a big deal.

115
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,880
That bar nearly got dragged in.

116
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,440
Mo.

117
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,400
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,000
I won't do it again, okay?

119
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,080
You always say you're sorry,

120
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,320
but you never really change.

121
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,440
Mo.

122
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,640
Oh right, Mo.

123
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,520
Did you find the necklace?

124
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,360
Yeah, I found it.

125
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,400
Really?

126
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,800
That's great news.

127
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,800
Once the necklace is back,

128
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,160
the clan members
will accept you as the new clan leader.

129
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,760
You won't have to risk your life, then.

130
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,440
But the necklace is with a man.

131
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
I can't get it back.

132
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,840
A man?

133
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,240
Then let's just take it from him.

134
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,000
The necklace is protecting him.

135
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,440
So, what do we do now?

136
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,880
You've only got three months left.

137
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,080
If we don't get the necklace soon...

138
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,320
Maybe,

139
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,840
I can make him willingly

140
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,000
hand over the necklace to me.

141
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,600
Xinyi,

142
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,320
can you look up this person's info?

143
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,000
I need to know him to handle him.

144
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,560
His name is Mu Hanyu.

145
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,760
Mu Hanyu.

146
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,120
Do you know him?

147
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,160
No, I don't.

148
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,640
Mu Hanyu,

149
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,880
male, twenty-six years old.

150
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,080
He's at Jiangbei University,

151
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,520
the youngest professor of astrophysics.

152
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,520
He holds countless patents

153
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,640
and landed huge investments.

154
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,680
He started his own company

155
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,880
and he's the top rising tech star now.

156
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,320
Both his parents passed away.

157
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,640
He doesn't have much family left.

158
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,320
All these years,
he's focused on research,

159
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,000
and hasn't even dated once.

160
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,280
His life...

161
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,160
Wait a second.

162
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,680
He never dated before.

163
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,240
Finally, you're back.

164
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,200
I've waited for you so long.

165
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,000
Why are you in my house?

166
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't you know that's rude?

167
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,120
It's my birthday today.

168
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,440
I wanted you to celebrate with me.

169
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
You don't even care about your birthday.

170
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,080
Don't you want to celebrate with me?

171
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,520
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

172
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,440
You saved me once.

173
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,960
So I decided on my own

174
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,200
to count you as half a friend of mine.

175
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,760
Having you here for my birthday

176
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,240
would really make me happy.

177
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,560
It's your birthday, just enjoy it.

178
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,640
Why are you wearing my clothes?

179
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,880
I'm just trying to show you

180
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
it wasn't the real me yesterday.

181
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,200
This is the real me today.

182
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,200
Wearing men's clothes and all.

183
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
Is that your truest self?

184
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,240
Just stay and celebrate with me.

185
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,160
Happy birthday.

186
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,160
Cheers.

187
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,400
Alright, time to make my wish.

188
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,640
I hope for a special birthday gift.

189
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,200
The necklace.

190
