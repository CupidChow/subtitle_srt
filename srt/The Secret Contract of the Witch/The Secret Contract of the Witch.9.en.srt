00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,200
I get jealous when you care about others.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,560
You should be thinking about me.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,720
Want me to take you down with a shot?

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,240
Go ahead.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,680
Come on then.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,880
Don't hold back, do it.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,680
Come on.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,080
Aim right here.

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,880
With full strength.

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,960
Come on, don't waste time.

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,280
Got all the info.

22
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:05,620
(Container Street Intersection)

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,400
Professor Mu,

24
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,360
it turns out we're the same type.

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,040
Again and again.

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,680
What are you really after?

27
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,400
I didn't do anything, Professor Mu.

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,840
I just cleaned your photo, that's all.

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,560
Don't get so worked up.

30
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,520
Professor Mu,

31
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
I came today

32
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
just to let you know

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,480
witches keep tempting others,

34
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
including you.

35
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,480
All they want is to make a contract.

36
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,200
In the end,

37
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,280
she'll turn on you, Professor Mu.

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,600
Why do you still trust them?

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
I'll say it again,

40
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,560
what are you really after?

41
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,160
Professor Mu,

42
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,020
here's a video from five years ago,

43
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,200
showing your car accident.

44
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,600
Want to watch it?

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,560
After watching, you'll know

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,120
how silly it is

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,560
to trust Xia Mo.

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,520
Take a good look.

49
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,940
(March 15, 2019,
Container Street Intersection)

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,200
Xia Mo caused the accident on purpose,

51
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,680
so your parents
would risk everything

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,960
and make a contract to save you.

53
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,480
Can't you see how naive you are?

54
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,840
Now you believe me, right?

55
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,760
What kind of people are they?

56
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
So shameless!

57
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,160
Come on, join me,

58
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,680
let's take them down together.

59
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,600
What do you say?

60
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
What are you doing?

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,140
You didn't text me back

62
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,960
or answer my calls.

63
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,000
The phone you gave me
is just for show, huh?

64
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,680
I've been busy. I didn't see it.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,840
Alright then.

66
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,560
I've found some people who need help.

67
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,600
Come with me.

68
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,160
No time.

69
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
Also,

70
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,880
before coming in,

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
knock on the door.

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,400
What?

73
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,200
This is my private space.

74
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,160
I like being alone.

75
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,160
Mu Hanyu, what's up with you?

76
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,320
You were fine just yesterday.

77
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,000
Was I not clear enough?

78
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,960
I just like

79
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,680
being by myself.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,840
Are you going or not?

81
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,840
If you don't, I'll break your door.

82
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,560
Go ahead.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,880
Mu Hanyu.

84
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,800
Mu Hanyu!

85
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,440
Knocking on the door.

86
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,420
Once I open the door,

87
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,760
I can go anywhere I want.

88
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,040
I don't have to inform you.

89
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,680
Knock the door, huh?

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,280
It's so annoying.

91
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,880
Why bother knocking?

92
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,840
Honestly, that's not even

93
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,160
the real problem here.

94
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,720
Mo,

95
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,280
you're caring more about him.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,120
Me? Caring about him?

97
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,720
I'm worried he'll mess up my contract.

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,440
Then why are you so mad?

99
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,840
I'm mad because he's so confusing.

100
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,840
Just days ago, we made a wish together.

101
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,560
He looked like he wanted to get close to me.

102
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,000
When I went to see him today,

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,200
he didn't even look at me.

104
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,200
Is he always this unpredictable?

105
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Do you mean

106
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,600
his attitude toward you changed?

107
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Yeah, exactly.

108
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
What does he think I am?

109
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,160
Mo, that's just his tactic.

110
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,720
He creates this on purpose.

111
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,960
It messes with your emotions.

112
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,200
That way, he can control you better

113
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,280
and use you.

114
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
That's what PUA is.

115
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,440
PUA?

116
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,000
He wouldn't do that.

117
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,680
How's your Jammer Project going?

118
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,000
It's still in progress.

119
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,280
It's almost finished.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,480
I know your parents died mysteriously.

121
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,880
You think all this

122
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,600
is connected to an alien power.

123
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,720
But I hope you won't let your obsession

124
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,840
ruin your whole life.

125
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,000
Let the past stay in the past.

126
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
Professor,

127
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,000
some things are left behind

128
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,720
because people lose hope

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,680
and have no other choice.

130
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,040
They're forced to move on.

131
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,880
What's wrong?

132
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,280
Is there trouble with the experiment?

133
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,800
Professor,

134
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,200
when my parents passed away,

135
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,880
were they at peace?

136
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,920
I can see you really love them.

137
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
But anger can't fix anything.

138
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't let it cloud your choices.

139
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,480
So you think

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
I shouldn't seek revenge?

141
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,800
Don't you think dating Xia Mo now

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,760
would be unfair to my late parents?

143
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,360
What happened before

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
shouldn't hold you back.

145
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,360
What's wrong, feeling down?

146
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,320
Tell me.

147
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
If two people spend every day together,

148
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,920
isn't it easy to catch feelings?

149
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,120
That really depends.

150
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
I was drawn to you from the start.

151
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,880
But if it were your sister Xia Mo,

152
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
I'm not so sure.

153
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,800
But she's always with Mu Hanyu now.

154
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm a little worried.

155
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,360
Let me surprise you.

156
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,600
How about it?

157
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,880
A surprise?

158
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,360
Anna.

159
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,920
How did you catch her?

160
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,360
You really are something.

161
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,400
