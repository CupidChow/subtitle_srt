[FIRST MARRIAGE]

00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,130
She didn't need a torch in her world.

[Episode 2]

5
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,330
She was her own light.

6
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,710
What do you want to do?

7
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,070
Who on earth are you?

8
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,110
I'm your sister-in-law.

9
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,620
Would my sister-in-law kiss

10
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,750
a strange man in the ballroom?

11
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,180
It looks like

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,520
you've mistaken me for someone else.

13
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,230
Not to mention that

14
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,890
I've never been to a ballroom,

15
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,110
even if I had been to a ballroom,

16
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,710
I wouldn't have done such an outrageous thing.

17
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:20,030
If other people had seen me,

18
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,990
gossiped about it

19
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,050
and reproached me,

20
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,870
it would be such a disgrace

21
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,730
for the Shen Family, wouldn't it?

22
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,740
You're so eloquent.

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,580
I have a way

24
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,450
to prove whether what you said

25
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,800
is true

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,170
or not.

27
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,740
I knew it.

28
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,870
If you keep being unreasonable,

29
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,150
I'll scream

30
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,310
so that everyone can see

31
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,460
what my brother-in-law's true personality is like.

32
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,289
Young Master Tanqian.

33
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,289
His Lordship wants to see you.

34
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,290
Young Master Tanqian,

35
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,900
please.

36
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,520
Tanqian.

37
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,450
What's wrong with our father?

38
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,410
He had a stroke.

39
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,040
What did the doctor say?

40
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,670
He should take more rest,

41
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,400
and we should disturb him less.

42
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:38,870
Father.

43
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,070
Hold him down now!

44
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,870
Hold him down!

45
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,550
Nurse!

46
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,940
-Father!
-Nurse!

47
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,030
-Father!
-Come on.

48
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,590
Father.

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,070
Father.

50
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,150
Young Master Tanshu.

51
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,280
Please come with me.

52
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,070
Okay.

53
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,030
What does this mean?

54
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,150
Young Master Tanqian.

55
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,520
The dinner party is ready.

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,180
Please go downstairs and eat.

57
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,990
Okay.

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,050
It looks like my father didn't fall sick by accident.

59
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,520
What on earth has happened at home?

60
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,190
Come on.

61
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,670
Let's celebrate that

62
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,550
Tanqian has come back home.

63
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,710
Second Sister, you're biased towards him.

64
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,990
Yuqing has just come back as well, hasn't she?

65
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,750
Since this is a welcome-home party,

66
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,410
we should celebrate these two events together.

67
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,540
I won't ask you to celebrate it for me.

68
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,200
Besides, I wasn't away from home for a long time.

69
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,750
I can't compare to my brother-in-law, who was away from home for so long.

70
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,390
Whether it was a day

71
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,430
or a year,

72
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,790
after you two left the Shen Family,

73
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,350
there was no news about you anyway.

74
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,350
It was no different from being dead.

75
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,390
Now that you've come back to life

76
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,550
and returned home successively,

77
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,510
we should celebrate it for both of you.

78
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,150
Second Sister.

79
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,270
Am I right or not?

80
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,350
Alright.

81
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,850
Come on.

82
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,380
Let's celebrate that

83
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,050
Tanqian and my daughter-in-law have come back home together.

84
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,390
Why are you laughing?

85
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,340
Second Sister.

86
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,120
What are you talking about?

87
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,530
They came home together?

88
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,420
It sounds like there's something between them.

89
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:57,930
Enough!

90
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,110
What are you talking about

91
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,740
in front of the whole family?

92
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,900
I'll just drink it.

93
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,260
Cheers.

94
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:07,990
Cheers.

95
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,390
Brother Tanqian.

96
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,890
Let's eat.

97
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,750
I'll make you guys suffer the consequences caused by yourselves.

98
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,610
Whether it was the toxin put by you

99
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,630
or the killer you hired,

100
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,800
and whether you're cunning like a snake

101
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,120
or vicious like a scorpion,

102
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,870
I'll make you all get the punishment for every sin

103
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,150
you've committed

104
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,800
and pay the price for every injury you've caused.

105
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,790
I'm full.

106
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,080
Just tell me.

107
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,620
You kept winking at me

108
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,670
at the dinner table just now.

109
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,190
What was the matter?

110
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,390
What else could it be?

111
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,710
Of course it was because of Feng Yuqing.

112
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,180
What's wrong with her?

113
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,930
Don't you think it's strange?

114
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,750
She's like a different person now.

115
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,880
After she went through so many things,

116
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,910
it's quite normal that she is

117
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,970
different now.

118
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,910
I...

119
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,110
I'm not as good as you in accounting.

120
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,490
But you're far inferior to me in judging people.

121
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,360
Though a person's personalities might change,

122
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,860
he can't fool others with his temperament.

123
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,880
How do you want to prove that

124
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,390
she's not Feng Yuqing?

125
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,740
Do you remember that she has a birthmark on her body?

126
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,790
As long as we take a look at her when she's taking a bath, we can...

127
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,350
Alright.

128
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,840
The accounts of our family's business are in a mess.

129
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,310
The trouble is already big enough for me.

130
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,350
If you want to mess around,

131
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,400
just do it by yourself.

132
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,610
I... I'm not messing around.

133
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,850
I'm doing this for you, Second Sister.

134
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,280
Now that Tanqian is back,

135
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,390
Tanshu will have one more person to support him in the future.

136
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,150
Maybe he'll be able to take away the Shen Family's business in the future.

137
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,260
You've been working diligently day and night for the Shen Family,

138
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,390
but you only have a daughter yourself.

139
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,790
In the end, well...

140
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,250
The property of the Shen Family

141
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,780
will be all up to those two brothers, won't it?

142
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,560
Have you finished talking?

143
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,360
I know you're donig this for my own good.

144
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,810
It's getting late.

145
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,530
Just go back to your room and rest.

146
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,080
Look. I still have many things to deal with.

147
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,350
Just go.

148
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,610
Young Master Tanqian.

149
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,090
Don’t be afraid.

150
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,550
Let me ask you something.

151
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,150
I saw Tanqian today.

152
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,390
He doesn't look like you at all.

153
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,710
In what way do you think he doesn't look like me?

154
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,310
His appearance, temperament,

155
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,110
behavior and dispositions are all not like yours.

156
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,630
Maybe

157
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,320
it has something to do with his experiences outside.

158
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,950
Where has he been these years?

159
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,919
My father sent him abroad to study.

160
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,010
Where did Young Madam Yuqing go previously?

161
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,740
I also don’t know where she went.

162
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,110
But previously, she just suddenly

163
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,550
disappeared.

164
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,480
Young Master Tanshu was sad for quite a long time.

165
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,790
She disappeared?

166
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,590
Yes, she disappeared.

167
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,120
Many people were sent to look for her,

168
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,630
but they couldn't find her.

169
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,530
No one dared to mention this matter.

170
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,270
We were afraid that it would make Young Master Tanshu unhappy.

171
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,510
But a few days ago,

172
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,590
Young Madam Yuqing suddenly came back herself.

173
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,110
Put it back.

174
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,450
I'm your brother-in-law.

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,910
Do you have to kill your brother-in-law

176
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,910
just for a letter?

177
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,310
Since you know that I'm your sister-in-law,

178
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,310
why did you intrude into my bathroom?

179
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,220
Aren't you afraid of being seen by others

180
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,770
and reproached by the people?
