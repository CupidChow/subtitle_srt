The romantic relationship between a man and a woman

[Episode 14]

5
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,430
arose from the fate that brought them together.

6
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,710
A lack of any detail

7
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,460
would lead to fallaciousness.

8
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,310
Tanqian.

9
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,590
Tanqian.

10
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,440
Happy birthday.

11
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,600
I thought you had left.

12
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,350
It's such an important day today.

13
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,350
How could I leave?

14
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,170
I asked someone

15
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,950
to swap identities

16
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,090
with Tanqian in the toilet at the train station.

17
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,950
Then he avoided Shen Tanshu's spies successfully.

18
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,030
When that brat found that the person had been swapped,

19
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,620
I guess

20
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,500
he had already arrived in Paris.

21
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,020
Thank you, guys.

22
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,380
Yuji.

23
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,050
On behalf of everyone,

24
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,290
I wish you

25
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,480
"Heippy

26
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,530
bathe a dad".

27
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,600
Why is it "bathe a dad"?

28
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,990
Why not "bathe a mom"?

29
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,990
Feng.

30
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,370
It's "Happy birthday".

31
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,870
That's... That's right.

32
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,420
I said, "Heippy bathe a dad."

33
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,780
Alright.

34
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,990
Make a wish now.

35
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,829
Okay.

36
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,860
-Good!
-Good!

37
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,070
Let's start eating.

38
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,110
I'm starving.

39
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,940
You should

40
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,590
really try Tanqian's cooking.

41
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,110
In order to prepare for this meal,

42
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,110
he almost made the kitchen explode.

43
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,160
Right, Feng?

44
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,079
I can testify.

45
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,990
Okay.

46
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,390
Then I'll taste the food.

47
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,880
How does it taste?

48
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,990
Not bad.

49
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,040
Thank you all

50
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,440
for preparing all these things for me today.

51
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,250
Let's

52
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,270
drink a toast.

53
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,230
Okay. Cheers.

54
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,550
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

55
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,950
There's music.

56
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,350
What's that jarring noise?

57
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,990
-What kind of dance are you performing?
-Feng.

58
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,590
I can't defeat you in a fight.

59
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,550
If you dance,

60
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,300
you may not be able to defeat me.

61
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,390
Brat, all you can do is bragging.

62
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,620
In terms of dancing,

63
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,520
you can't defeat me as well.

64
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,600
Don't just sit there.

65
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,350
Today,

66
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,620
I'll battle

67
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,850
with the three of you.

68
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,350
Look at this brat.

69
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,270
Come on. Let's do this together.

70
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,230
Let me tell you.

71
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,590
Today,

72
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,590
I'm drunk,

73
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,920
but

74
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,470
I will wake up again

75
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,670
to welcome

76
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,770
tomorrow's sun.

77
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,470
Okay.

78
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,590
May the strong wine

79
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,790
encourage us

80
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,030
to go forward bravely!

81
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,720
Even if

82
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,630
we're in darkness,

83
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,830
we'll still make the stars in the sky

84
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,390
twinkle again.

85
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,220
Twinkle!

86
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,770
Thank you all

87
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,520
for preparing all these things for me today.

88
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,220
It's a pity that

89
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,360
time has passed so fast.

90
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,390
Then do you

91
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,710
want to know

92
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,390
what wish I've made?

93
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,050
It won't come true if you tell me about it.

94
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,390
Don't you want to know?

95
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,190
Yes, I do.

96
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,590
I wish that

97
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,600
time could start over.

98
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,700
I wish that

99
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,620
I had got to know you earlier.

100
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,990
I... I have to go.
