Feng Yuqing!

00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,260
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,850
Who is it?

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,310
Third Madam.

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,320
It's me.

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,030
Come in.

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,350
Third Madam.

14
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,050
Young Madam Yuqing asked me to return the cheongsam to you.

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:03,990
Get lost!

16
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:04,989
Yes.

17
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,390
We're here, Third Madam.

18
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,060
What are you going to do?

19
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,330
No hurry.

20
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,070
You'll know later.

21
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,480
Are you sure

22
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,150
she has transferred the dock

23
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,039
to you?

24
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,520
Don't worry.

25
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,070
We've already signed the contract.

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,840
By then,

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,230
let's change the dock to gold.

28
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,910
Baby,

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,070
we can go away together.

30
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,600
Good.

31
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,510
Thank you for your hard work these days.

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,190
You've sacrificed yourself to serve that woman.

33
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,030
I wonder what's so good about her.

34
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,630
Why did Master Shen marry her as his concubine?

35
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,150
Alright.

36
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,870
Let's not talk about her.

37
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,070
Now,

38
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,470
the most important thing is...

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,730
You're so annoying.

40
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,750
Come on.

41
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,800
Let go.

42
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,790
Didn't you say she wouldn't come until Sunday?

43
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,470
I treated you so well. It's all in vain!

44
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,310
I fed you,

45
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,350
gave you gold,

46
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,910
and even gave you the dock.

47
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,350
Didn't you say you only loved me?

48
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,350
Why are you doing this to me?

49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,190
Why did you lie to me?

50
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:05,810
Get lost!

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,950
I did lie to you,

52
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,750
but you also got my body, didn't you?

53
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,590
You didn't suffer any loss, did you?

54
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,150
You...

55
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,710
You...

56
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,130
How are you?

57
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,070
If I can't have him,

58
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,670
nor can you!

59
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,190
I'll kill you!

60
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,470
She's not guilty at all after killing people.

61
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,600
Is she worth saving?

62
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,190
But...

63
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,920
Don't worry.

64
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,910
On my way here, I asked the rickshaw puller to report to the police.

65
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,040
The police should be on their way here.

66
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,180
Let go of me!

67
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,630
Let go!

68
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,420
Right ahead.

69
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,630
Let go!

70
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,530
Don't move.

71
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,070
Let go!

72
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,410
Let go of me!

73
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,440
-I can walk myself.
-Let go!

74
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,029
Go.

75
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,470
Let go of me!

76
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,130
Don't move!

77
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:19,709
Go!

78
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,519
Let go of me!

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,830
Go!

80
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,000
I underestimated you.

81
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,470
I should have put more of the poison back then

82
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,030
to put you to death!

83
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,030
Wait.

84
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,390
Go.

85
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,040
Serve it to Young Madam.

86
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,190
Well...

87
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,040
Hurry up!

88
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,190
Yes.

89
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,520
Young Madam,

90
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,200
your coffee.

91
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,110
Tell Tanshu

92
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,860
I'll be back a little late tonight.

93
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,660
Okay.

94
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,190
Feng Yuqing,

95
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,150
don't be gloating.

96
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,030
As long as I'm alive,

97
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,590
you won't have an easy life.

98
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,150
Go!

99
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,200
Do you think you can defeat me like this?

100
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,680
Go.

101
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,510
Why didn't you tell me

102
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,370
Third Madam had poisoned you?

103
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:46,510
Would you believe me

104
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,510
even if I told you?

105
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,270
Oh no.

106
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,010
What happened?

107
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,220
Third Madam was arrested for murder.

108
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,030
Look.

109
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,190
Look what she did.

110
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,760
Third Madam gave the dock away?

111
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,409
I'll get her out of the police station first.

112
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,700
You bitch!

113
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,920
You made me stay overnight

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,070
in a dirty and smelly prison.

115
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,710
How dare you even hit me now?

116
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,640
You...

117
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,060
Third Mother.

118
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,230
Shen Tanqian.

119
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,610
So, you know I'm your Third Mother?

120
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,750
Now you're protecting an outsider!

121
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,390
I finally understand.

122
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,780
No wonder you were also there yesterday.

123
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,270
So, you've been messing around with your sister-in-law for a long time!

124
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,070
Third Mother.

125
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,510
Don't make irresponsible remarks.

126
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,659
There's nothing between Yuqing and me.

127
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,430
Nothing?

128
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,150
Then, why are you protecting her?

129
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,950
Get out of my way!

130
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,750
Third Sister.

131
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,380
Second Sister.

132
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,700
Second Sister,

133
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,630
you have to help me!

134
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,340
I don't know what trick this bitch used

135
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,710
to mesmerize Tanqian.

136
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,910
They ganged up to bully me.

137
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,360
How long are you going to keep fooling around?

138
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,980
Don't think you can do anything in this house

139
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,100
just because Master is bedridden.

140
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,510
I'll get even with you

141
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,400
what you did behind my back.

142
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,830
Butler.

143
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,470
Send Third Madam back to her room.

144
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,030
Okay.

145
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,890
Second Sister.

146
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,320
Second Sister.

147
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,030
Feng Yuqing.

148
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,240
You bitch!

149
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,429
Wait and see!

150
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,000
Feng Yuqing!

151
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,250
Yuqing.

152
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,170
Did Third Mother bully you?

153
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,750
Don't worry.

154
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't worry.

155
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,150
I know

156
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,990
what happened last night.

157
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,560
Brother,

158
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,580
I have something to tell you.

159
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,880
Go ahead. What is it?

160
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:19,800
Brother,

161
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,670
how are you going to deal with Third Mother?

162
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,790
Deal with her?

163
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,790
You must know what she did.

164
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,730
She must be punished by law if she kills someone.

165
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,130
Why did you take her back to the Shen Family?

166
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,460
Well...

167
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,910
That is Second Mother's decision.

168
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,770
Brother Tanshu, do you also think

169
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,400
it's normal to be like this?

170
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Third Mother said

171
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,390
if this gets out,

172
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,100
it will affect our Shen family's reputation.

173
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,840
If we let a murderer go unpunished,

174
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,510
won't that affect the Shen family's reputation?

175
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,030
I don't believe Father can tolerate something like this

176
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,150
in the Shen family.

177
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,820
Tanqian,

178
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,650
we are both juniors.

179
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,520
Second Mother has her own thoughts

180
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,790
about this matter.

181
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,950
Let's not bring trouble to them.

182
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,330
Tanqian.

183
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,340
Yuqing, you're not sleeping

184
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,550
but wandering around at this hour.

185
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,590
Why is that?

186
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,560
It's none of your business.

187
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,180
I promise I won't disturb you

188
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,100
before you succeed.

189
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,390
But

190
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,010
there should be a time limit for everything.

191
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,370
When exactly

192
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,950
will you give it to me?
