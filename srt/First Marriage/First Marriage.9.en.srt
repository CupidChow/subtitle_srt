Yuqing.

8
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,680
Tanshu, I...

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,030
How are your wounds?

10
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,670
I'm sorry. That day, I...

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,510
It's okay.

12
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,030
Don't worry.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,230
It's quite cold outside.

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,160
Let's go inside.

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,590
Okay.

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,740
Sir.

17
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,740
Why did you send men to kidnap

18
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,140
Tanshu and Feng Yuqing without telling me?

19
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,910
Calm down.

20
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,340
Feng Yuqing knows my relationship with Yue.

21
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,550
Back then, I tried to kill her to avoid future trouble.

22
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,150
But you can't act on your own.

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,430
No.

24
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,150
I'm just worried about you and Yue.

25
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,930
There's no need to do everything ourselves.

26
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,650
I have my own way

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,630
to deal with Feng Yuqing.

28
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,860
My Lady.

29
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,590
This is for you.

30
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,550
It can reduce swelling and heal bruises.

31
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,210
Thank you for saving Brother Tanshu and Yuqing.

Young Madam.

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,510
Yuqing,

35
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,860
what's the matter?

36
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,200
Tanshu and I were in danger not long ago.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Luckily, Tanqian and Mingzhao came to save us in time.

38
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,180
I've always wanted to buy some gifts for them these days.

39
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,360
But I'm not close to them.

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,890
I don't know what they like.

41
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,040
Why don't you...

42
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,100
go with me?

43
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,060
Sure.

44
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,930
But

45
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,270
as you know,

46
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,710
my mother doesn't allow me to go out.

47
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,350
If she blames you,

48
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,190
just tell her

49
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,480
I forced you.

50
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:11,810
Let's go.

51
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,070
This.

52
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,350
Ladies, take a look.

53
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,950
My products

54
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,110
are top-quality.

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,640
Do you have lighters?

56
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,320
Yes.

57
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,660
Miss,

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,210
you came to the right place.

59
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,280
The lighters here

60
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,710
are the best.

61
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,690
Miss,

62
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,090
who will you give it to?

63
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,800
Are there any particular considerations?

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,640
If

65
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,230
you'll give it to an elder,

66
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,220
you can pick a simple one.

67
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,180
If you'll give it to your lover,

68
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,830
you should pick a fancy one.

69
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,070
It's not for her lover.

70
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,670
It's for my Brother Tanqian.

71
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,080
I'll take this then.

72
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,730
Okay.

73
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,149
What's wrong?

74
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,350
Yuqing,

75
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,470
what do you think Mingzhao likes?

76
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,910
It doesn't have to be a gift.

77
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,150
But what else can I give him?

78
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,810
Have you heard of a saying?

79
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,950
A girl will doll herself up for those who like her.

80
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,000
Miss.

81
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,390
Let's go over there.

82
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,320
Goodbye.

83
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,390
Yuqing,

84
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,390
what color did you choose for me?

85
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,550
Red.

86
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,230
I don't want red.

87
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,300
Red... is very beautiful.

88
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,670
It suits you well.

89
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,159
But I can't distinguish its color.

90
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,950
You know I'm color-blind.

91
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,000
Just

92
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,470
trust me.

93
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,320
Beautiful.

94
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,400
Miss,

95
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,480
you look great in red.

96
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,790
How about this?

97
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,030
If you place an order today,

98
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,240
I'll give you one piece of clothing for free.

99
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,350
We have the best cloth

100
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,030
in the city.

101
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,910
Didn't I ask you to protect Yue?

102
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,480
Why are you here?

103
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,910
Let me ask you.

104
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,130
Is Yue my biological daughter?

105
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,470
How many times have I told you?

106
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,150
Yes.

107
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,050
Then why is Yue color-blind?

108
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,390
Who told you that?

109
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,440
I'm not color-blind,

110
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,420
but Shen Wanxiu is.

111
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,909
Yue is his daughter.

112
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,909
In order to make me help you do things,

113
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,970
you've hidden it from me for 18 years.

114
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,290
Truth will come to light sooner or later.

115
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,990
Yes.

116
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,110
I did lie to you.

117
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,120
But all these years,

118
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,710
you've gained many benefits

119
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,390
in the Shen family, right?

120
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,030
If you're sensible,

121
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,000
don't make a fuss.

122
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,150
I'll treat you the same

123
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,420
as before.

124
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,530
You sound like

125
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,140
I should be grateful to you.

126
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,420
We are in the same boat now.

127
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,790
If you are against me,

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,390
we'll both lose.

129
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,990
We'll both lose?

130
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,390
We'll both lose.

131
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,900
Just you wait!

132
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,140
You...

133
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,350
You took Tanyue out?

134
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,790
Yes.

135
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,320
You know what kind of person her mother is.

136
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,440
She can't stay by her side forever.

137
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,890
Tanyue has grown up.

138
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,990
She can make decisions for her own life.

139
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,790
But what if

140
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,590
you're in danger again?

141
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,910
Thank you

142
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,550
for saving me last time.

143
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,770
I have something for you too.

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,100
I can't stop you from taking revenge.

145
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,010
I can't help you kill your enemy.

146
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,799
I can't be by your side all the time either.

147
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,470
So I bought you this.

148
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,430
Die!

149
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,480
Die!

150
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,190
If you die,

151
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,150
Yue will be my daughter.
