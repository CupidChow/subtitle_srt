you'll make the same mistake.

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,090
You'll still make the same mistake if you remember the past.

00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,910
Die!

8
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,320
Die!

9
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,800
If you die,

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,840
Yue will be my daughter.

11
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,269
Die!

12
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:05,880
Stop!

13
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,310
Father!

14
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,380
Father, are you alright?

15
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,030
My father treats you as his brother.

16
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,490
Why do you want to kill him?

17
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,500
Because

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,890
he is

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,400
Yue's biological father.

20
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,410
Even if you kill him,

21
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,990
Tanyue won't take you as her father!

22
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,550
So what?

23
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,390
I treat Yue

24
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,070
as well as Shen Wanxiu does.

25
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,160
All these years,

26
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,700
I have always considered Yue

27
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,380
as my own daughter.

28
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,030
Master.

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,300
Tanyue.

30
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,310
Yue.

31
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,480
Yue.

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,910
Leave him to me.

33
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,450
You must be hungry.

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,230
How is Yue now?

35
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,540
Don't worry.

36
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,830
She's fine.

37
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,130
You should worry about yourself.

38
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,270
Since

39
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,270
you made such a big mistake,

40
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,470
no matter how I plead for you,

41
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,760
the Shen family won't let you stay here.

42
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,790
But Tanshu said

43
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,940
since you have served the Shen family

44
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,470
for so many years,

45
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,660
he'll just put you in jail.

46
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,790
When things calm down,

47
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,760
I'll figure out a way to get you out.

48
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,880
Just

49
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,610
finish your last meal in the Shen family.

50
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,070
Forget it.

51
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,590
Forget it.

52
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,420
The porridge... is poisonous.

53
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,690
Help me.

54
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,030
Just die in peace.

55
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,390
It's all because of Feng Yuqing.

56
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,240
I've collaborated with the Japanese.

57
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,230
I will avenge you.

58
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,230
I will never believe

59
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,590
forgiving others is freeing ourselves.

60
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,350
I watched my loved one being killed.

61
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,680
The only purpose of my life is taking revenge.

62
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,710
Even if I kill you 1,000 times,

63
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,030
I won't show you any mercy.

64
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,630
Sister,

65
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,150
those who hurt you

66
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,710
have been punished.

67
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,710
Rest in peace.

68
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,360
If there is a next life,

69
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,409
I'll be the big sister.

70
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,640
Where are you going?

71
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,540
I'm leaving.

72
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,120
Anyway,

73
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,560
I've done what I should do.

74
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,270
There is no need for me to stay here.

75
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,910
Well... what do you plan to do next?

76
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,230
I don't know.

77
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,240
Let nature take its course.

78
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,590
Where...

79
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,590
can I find you?

80
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,940
We'll meet when it's time.

81
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,720
Right,

82
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,320
I haven't officially introduced myself.

83
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,350
My name is Feng Yuji.

84
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,420
Shen Tanqian.

85
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,730
Please.

86
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,470
Mr. Shen.

87
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,180
Long time no see.

88
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,780
Mr. Kojima,

89
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,710
why did you ask me here so urgently?

90
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,559
I heard that Mrs. Shen came back to life

91
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,440
and has returned home.

92
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,809
Is it true?

93
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,299
How did you know about this?

94
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,520
Answer me first.

95
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,970
That's... not my wife.

96
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,840
She is my wife's twin sister.

97
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,230
They just look alike.

98
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,410
They are not the same person.

99
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,330
Mr. Shen, you are affectionate.

100
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,460
Since she is your wife's sister,

101
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,320
it's very likely that she's also a member of the Volunteer Group.

102
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,880
Aren't you worried something might go wrong

103
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,250
if you keep her by your side?

104
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,620
Mingzhao.

105
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,770
Go ask Yuqing here.

106
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,470
Yes.

107
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,180
Young Madam,

108
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,380
Mr. Shen wants you to go to the ballroom.

109
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,780
Yuqing.

110
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,230
Young Madam, you came.

111
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,830
Yuqing.

112
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,850
Let me introduce.

113
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,760
This is the chairman of the Yamato Chamber of Commerce,

114
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,960
Mr. Hidekawa Kojima.

115
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,410
Hello, Mr. Kojima.

116
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,510
Young Madam, please sit.

117
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,130
Young Madam, don't be afraid.

118
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,660
I invited you here today

119
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,240
to watch this show.

120
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,870
There are three members of the Volunteer Group there.

121
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,340
Young Madam, have you heard of the Volunteer Group?

122
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,560
No.

123
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,900
The Volunteer Group is a folk organization.

124
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,580
They do bad things

125
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,590
in the name of patriotism.

126
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,630
Mr. Shen is right.

127
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,810
They've interfered with our business many times.

128
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,600
I heard they have a single-chain network

129
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,760
to avoid being eliminated completely.

130
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,130
Even the members of the Volunteer Group

131
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,880
don't know each other.

132
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,730
It's hard to tell who they are.

133
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,210
Mr. Kojima,

134
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,800
how did you catch them?

135
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,480
-It's okay.
-These damn members of the Volunteer Group

136
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,510
tried to assassinate me!

137
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,700
I... I can't believe this.

138
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,770
What...

139
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,780
What is this?

140
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,140
[To Mr. Kojima]

141
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,470
The letter says

142
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,860
the Shen family's young madam

143
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,310
planned the assassination.

144
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,850
This is impossible!

145
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,310
Of course I don't believe it.

146
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,850
They want to drive a wedge between us

147
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,360
with an anonymous letter.

148
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,830
They underestimated us.

149
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,580
But...

150
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,900
someone leaked the information.

151
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,830
If I don't figure it out,

152
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,370
I can't sleep or eat well.

153
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,390
Young Madam, I won't make things difficult for you.

154
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,910
Please prove your innocence.

155
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,960
Isn't this Young Master Tanqian of the Shen family?

156
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,660
So Mr. Kojima, you know me.

157
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,110
Tanqian,

158
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,240
put the gun down.

159
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,660
Yuqing doesn't even dare to kill a chicken.

160
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,830
Brother, I can't believe you asked her to kill a man.

161
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,850
Pay attention to the occasion.

162
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,730
Occasion?

163
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,790
This is an occasion for the Chinese.

164
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,000
Mingzhao!

165
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,750
You've got guts.

166
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,780
Now let's see

167
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,670
if you can stand this.
