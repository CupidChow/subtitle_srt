[FIRST MARRIAGE]

3
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,390
In this desolate spiritual wilderness,

4
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,670
[Episode 12]

5
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,110
I am alone, tasting the bitterness of being misunderstood.

6
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,470
Even if the Shen family falls,

7
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,190
it's better than being a traitor!

8
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,200
What did you say?

9
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,730
If I remember correctly,

10
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,600
you still haven't finished your studies.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,670
Continue to study.

12
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,630
Hidekawa Kojima is vengeful.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,710
You offended him.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,590
He won't let you go.

15
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,270
I caused the trouble.

16
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:16,110
I'll take responsibility myself.

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,270
How?

18
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:19,950
Tanqian.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,380
Tanqian!

20
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,110
Brother,

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,030
Father said "were it to benefit my country I would lay down my life".

22
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,270
What does it mean?

23
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,700
I will do whatever it takes to serve my country

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,360
even at the cost of my own life.

25
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,289
Brother, you're impressive.

26
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,210
Did you hear what I said?

27
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,020
I heard everything outside.

28
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,310
I prepared medicine for you.

29
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,950
Am I hurting you?

30
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,350
No.

31
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,000
When I got hurt,

32
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,960
my sister would always apply this medicine on me.

33
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,150
She said

34
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,940
this medicine

35
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,020
can heal wounds quickly

36
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,400
and can comfort hearts.

37
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,080
So magical?

38
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,410
What medicine is this?

39
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,500
Its name is...

40
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,709
Yuji.

41
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,180
It only works on some people.

42
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,160
I should be one of them, right?

43
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm not sure.

44
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,630
This medicine has a side effect.

45
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,620
It might make you addicted.

46
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,310
I'll... leave this medicine to you.

47
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,350
Wait.

48
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,970
I'm sorry, Yuqing.

49
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,350
What's wrong?

50
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,300
It's all my fault.

51
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,710
I

52
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,000
didn't say clearly to Mr. Kojima today

53
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,909
and made him think you're a member of the Volunteer Group.

54
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,710
I even asked Mingzhao

55
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,350
to ask you there

56
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,909
when you were unaware of the situation.

57
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,930
I almost got you into trouble.

58
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,420
I don't blame you.

59
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,490
Come on. Sleep now.

60
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,690
Come on.

61
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,330
Yuqing,

62
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,400
you lie down too.

63
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,580
Hideo Miyazaki is the chief guard of Hidekawa Kojima.

64
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,380
They're both from the Yamato Chamber of Commerce.

65
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,350
What on earth does Tanshu have to do with the Japanese?

66
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,610
Does my sister's death

67
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,159
also have something to do with him?

68
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,210
Tanshu.

69
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,500
Tanshu, do you want some water?

70
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,870
Tanshu.

71
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,720
Tanshu?

72
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:58,850
Tanshu.
