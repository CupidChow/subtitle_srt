Mr. Shen, you are such an affectionate man.

8
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,530
I'm going to say it again.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,190
Life is short.

10
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,440
Don't be too obsessed.

17
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,270
Stay out of it.

18
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,460
Go back to your room.

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,910
Let's go. Yue.

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,240
Let's go.

21
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,440
Young Madam, where are you going?

22
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,580
This is my house.

23
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,890
Do I have to tell you

24
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,200
what I want to do?

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,910
Young Madam,

26
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,039
don't make things difficult for us.

27
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,750
Move!

28
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,630
Why are you here?

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,340
Did my brother threaten you to marry him?

30
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,670
This is the only way to save Feng.

31
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,190
I don't want you to marry him.

32
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,190
I know.

33
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,150
But I don't have a choice.

34
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,910
You do.

35

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,030
Open the door!

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,680
Open the door!

40
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,670
What?

41
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,070
Can't I move freely at home?

42
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,540
I'm sorry, Young Madam.

43
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,370
We don't want you to run away.

44
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,079
Mr. Shen asked us

45
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,530
to keep an eye on you.

46
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,000
You're not allowed to leave this room.

Feng.

49
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,870
You shouldn't have come.

50
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,520
Go now!

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,079
She doesn't know the Volunteer Group's rules.

53
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,120
Don't you know?

54
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,440
When we joined the Volunteer Group,

55
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,990
we vowed to ignore our lives.

56
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,200
You're taking the risk to save me.

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,170
None of us can get out!

58
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,650
No wonder we can't eliminate

59
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,870
all the members of the Volunteer Group.

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,260
It turns out all of you are cold-blooded and heartless.

61
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,020
Tanqian,

62
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,530
have you received the gift

63
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,630
I gave you?

64
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,760
I mean the guy from the tailor shop.

65
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,630
I've watched him for a long time.

66
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,670
For your own selfish desire,

67
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,810
you betrayed your family,

68
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,540
your friends,

69
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,540
and your country.

70
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,990
You are a traitor.

71
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,650
You betrayed your country for your own benefits.

72
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,870
You're already an unforgivable villain.

73
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,490
The Volunteer Group's members won't let you go.

74
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,670
Did you discuss with us

75
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,730
when you joined the Volunteer Group?

76
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,070
If you continued to study abroad

77
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,410
as I planned,

78
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,330
none of this would have happened.

79
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,110
In that case,

80
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,720
he died because of you.

81
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,350
Brother,

82
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,790
why did you become like this?

83
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,040
Have you forgotten what Father taught us?

84
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,409
Were it to benefit my country I would lay down my life.

85
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,980
What then is risk to me?

86
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,710
The Shen family's water transport business

87
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,550
is for the prosperity of the country.

88
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,550
It's for the people and the country!

89
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,370
I don't know what changed you

90
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,700
and made you so twisted

91
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,110
and despicable.

92
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,909
You've forgotten everything Father taught you.

93
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,470
Of course you don't know.

94
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,600
Because you can never feel

95
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,710
the pain I've felt.

96
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,620
Since we were little,

97
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,480
I've been better than you in every aspect.

98
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,150
Why did Father pin all his hopes

99
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,480
on you?

100
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,680
Why did he always give you the best things?

101
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,670
He sent you abroad to study.

102
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,710
What about me?

103
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,230
I became a cripple.

104
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,550
A cripple!

105
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,910
If

106
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,940
I still don't fight for myself,

107
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,740
I will only

108
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,900
be a loser who relies on others

109
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,690
for the rest of my life.

110
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,280
But have you thought about this?

111
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,320
You became a cripple

112
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,740
because of the Japanese!

113
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,159
You should get even with the Japanese.

114
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,810
Why did you collude with them?

115
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,010
That was because Father offended them.

116
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,280
Otherwise, why would they kidnap me?

117
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,880
Why would they break my legs?

118
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,700
So,

119
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,790
I also wanted him

120
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,860
to feel the pain.

121
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,790
Look what you've done!

122
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,520
You are such a disappointment!

123
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,220
From today onwards,

124
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,860
stay out of the water transport business.

125
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,020
Just stay at home.

126
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,070
Father.

127
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,420
Father,

128
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,980
I was wrong.

129
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,840
Shen Tanshu!

130
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,450
Tanqian!

131
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,600
What are you waiting for?

132
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,200
Beat him!

133
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,000
What a loving couple!

134
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,440
The game has begun.

135
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,920
Feng Yuji,

136
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,240
one bullet,

137
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,790
two choices.

138
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,920
Either

139
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,600
he dies,

140
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,060
or

141
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,700
he dies.

142
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,250
I'll only count to three.

143
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,370
If you don't make your choice,

144
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,930
I'll kill both of them.

145
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,870
Yuji,

146
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,870
don't hesitate.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,870
Let him kill me.

148
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
I'm old.

149
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,450
My death wouldn't be a pity.

150
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,030
Shen Tanshu,

151
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,370
kill me if you dare!

152
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,150
Do you think you're still a three-year-old boy?
