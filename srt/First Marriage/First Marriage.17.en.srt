00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,810
but are always in the shackles.

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,500
Brother Tanshu is very cautious.

7
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,830
All deals

8
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,599
will be recorded in the secret ledger

9
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,530
as a memorandum.

10
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,730
This ledger

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,810
is the key to recovering the treasures

12
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,470
and stopping the opium trade.

13
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,259
Shen Tanqian sent you, right?

14
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,380
It has nothing to do with him.

15
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,030
It's not as simple as you think, Yuqing.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,910
I only know

17
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,120
your behavior

18
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,750
has already harmed our country and our people.

19
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,080
No.

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,979
You don't understand.

21
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,430
Even if I don't do

22
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,350
those things you mentioned,

23
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,870
someone else will.

24
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,590
Too many people have betrayed their ancestors.

25
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,590
They are numerous,

26
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,870
like locusts.

27
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,990
They can't be eliminated

28
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,800
or wiped out.

29
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,670
They just flatter the enemy

30
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,350
and have no bottom line whatsoever.

31
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,910
What I do is nothing,

32
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,430
compared to what they do.

33
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,710
Now that you knew

34
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,320
they were wrong,

35
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,780
why didn't you destroy the opium

36
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,390
and retrieve the relics,

37
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,960
but instead, you went along with them in their evil deeds?

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,360
Because I'm not strong enough yet, Yuqing.

39
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,560
I know too well.

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,270
about the consequences that I fight against them.

41
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,470
It would only be that I

42
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,920
die the cruelest death.

43
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,080
Didn't you

44
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,820
lie to me like this, too?

45
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,430
You knew everything?

46
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,960
Yes.

47
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,550
Give it to me.

48
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,110
I have my own way.

49
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,950
Are you really going to do this?

50
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,280
You should know clearly

51
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,390
that whether you're willing or not,

52
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,530
I will take it away.

53
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,470
Okay.

54
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,550
Yuqing.

55
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,590
No.

56
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,270
Maybe I should call you

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,110
Feng Yuji.

58
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,310
Why didn't you do it last night?

59
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,590
It's fake.

60
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,740
The handwriting is not completely dry yet.

61
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,600
It's obviously just been copied.

62
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,110
How did you get it?

63
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,990
I saw Sun Mingzhao

64
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,720
give the ledger to Shen Tanshu,

65
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,990
who put the ledger in a drawer.

66
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,610
Then, I secretly stole it.

67
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,250
He did it on purpose.

68
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,290
He deliberately took you to the warehouse

69
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,550
to show you what he did.

70
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,850
He deliberately took out the ledger in front of you.

71
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:05,870
Yuji.

72
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,230
This is a trap for you.

73
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,850
How did you get out of the Shen's Mansion?

74
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,150
He spotted me

75
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,590
when I got the ledger.

76
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,990
He gave it to me voluntarily.

77
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,600
I looked around when I came here.

78
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,660
No one followed me.

79
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,600
No.

80
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,610
It's not that simple.

81
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,250
This is not like Brother Tanshu's style.

82
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,270
He must have done this

83
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,180
for a reason.

84
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,440
If no one was following you,

85
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,270
it means

86
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,880
he already has something on you

87
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,040
and is sure you can't escape from him.

88
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,110
Feng!

89
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,720
Let's go.

90
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:48,560
Feng.

91
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,990
Feng.

92
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,790
Feng!

93
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,909
There are no signs of fighting here.

94
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,390
Where could Feng be?

95
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,440
There's another possibility.

96
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,590
Feng willingly followed them.

97
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,600
Where are you going?

98
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,630
I'm going to save Feng.

99
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,080
It's useless for you to go back to the Shen's Mansion now.

100
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,910
You'll just fall into Brother Tanshu's trap.

101
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,510
Not only can't you save Feng,

102
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,030
but also, you'll fall into his hands.

103
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,790
Then tell me,

104
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,210
what should I do?

105
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,190
I'll find you a place to stay.

106
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,970
During this period,

107
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,960
just like me,

108
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,230
go out less

109
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,230
and wait for the right time.

110
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,910
Don't worry.

111
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,150
I'm here.

112
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,300
I'll find Feng.

113
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,680
What are you going to do?

114
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,590
If both of us are arrested,

115
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,670
there's no leeway for this matter.

116
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,390
Even so, you shouldn't go out.

117
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:08,960
Listen to me.

118
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,530
If he wanted to kill me,

119
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,100
he would have done it long ago.

120
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,770
But...

121
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,510
No.

122
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,440
I can't let you take the risk alone.

123
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,020
I knew you'd be here.

124
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,800
Let's go.

125
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,670
Come to a place with me.
