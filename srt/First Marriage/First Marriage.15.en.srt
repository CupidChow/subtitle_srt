[Episode 15]

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,650
That's why there are lies.

6
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,750
Be careful.

7
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,720
I'll move it here for you at once.

8
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,580
Do it gently!

9
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,410
Mr. Kojima.

10
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,800
This is our best blue and white porcelain.

11
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,480
It is said that it has a history of more than a hundred years.

12
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,510
Good!

13
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,310
It's really good.

14
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:16,970
Shen Tanshu,

15
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,140
I was right about you.

16
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,500
As the old Chinese saying goes,

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,620
"Those who pursue the highest ethical standards don't agree with vulgar people's opinions,

18
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,210
and those who have made great achievements don't discuss things with the common people."

19
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,730
It's a description about capable people like you.

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,360
People outside all treat the Empire of Japan

21
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,550
as a dangerous wild beast.

22
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,470
That's because they are short-sighted.

23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,070
Only you, Shen Tanshu,

24
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,850
are quite sensible.

25
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,110
Mr. Shen.

26
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,100
Here are the goods you want.

27
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,270
Tanqian.

28
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,070
Didn't you go to Paris?

29
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,930
Second Mother.

30
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,660
I want to cooperate with you.

31
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,829
For what?

32
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:35,829
How come you have this?

33
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:38,190
You transferred the property of the Shen Family

34
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,920
in order to give Tanyue a better life, didn't you?

35
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,550
However,

36
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,030
I'm afraid it was inappropriate to do this

37
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,290
without my father's permission, right?

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,570
What do you want me to do?

39
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,870
I want to know

40
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,390
all the information about the transaction

41
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,790
between my elder brother and the Yamato Chamber of Commerce.

42
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:18,870
Sir, take a look.

43
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,070
You're here.

44
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,210
I've found a way to fulfill your wish.

45
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,690
Here you are.

46
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,470
Look at this one.

47
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,880
Time is passing.

48
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,680
Then turn it upside down.

49
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,720
Time has gone back to the beginning again.

50
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,110
Listen.

51
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,790
What is this?

52
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,910
The sound of time going back.

53
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,470
Give the stuff to me.

54
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,080
What are you talking about, sir?

55
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,360
I don't understand.

56
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,660
You're playing dumb?

57
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,970
Why did you poison the Japanese man to death?

58
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,930
Wasn't he killed by you, sir?

59
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,350
Give me the stuff which was possessed by him.

60
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,550
Then I'll let you go.

61
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,500
By the way,

62
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,909
I didn't find anything

63
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,350
on the Japanese man.

64
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,880
But today,

65
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,159
I saw a delivery list

66
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,550
in Shen Tanshu's study room.

67
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,230
But the list didn't specify

68
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,470
the goods which would be transported.

69
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,670
There was only the time and the location.

70
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,470
When?

71
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,350
Tomorrow.

72
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,830
I'll try to find out

73
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,470
what the goods are.

74
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,420
Be careful.

75
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,630
Don't let my elder brother know your real purpose.

76
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,390
Okay.

77
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,830
Tanqian.

78
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,120
How come she's here?

79
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,710
Hide first.

80
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,670
Okay.

81
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,450
Second Mother.

82
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,320
I've found something interesting after my investigation.

83
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,870
I really didn't expect this.

84
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,280
It's already hard enough for those who

85
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,680
are living in this world.

86
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,150
Now even the spouse who sleeps by your side

87
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,230
can't be trusted.

88
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,470
What do you mean

89
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,240
by saying that?

90
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,280
Read it by yourself.

91
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,590
What...

92
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,610
are you doing?

93
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,750
Nothing.

94
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,470
Mr. Kojima,

95
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,180
I've decided to follow your advice

96
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,020
and sacrifice the woman I love.

97
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,430
Please go to the train station immediately

98
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,750
to stop my wife

99
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,530
from passing any information about the ledger.

100
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,870
If necessary,

101
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,270
you can kill her

102
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,590
to protect the interests

103
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,610
of the Shen Family and the Yamato Chamber of Commerce.
