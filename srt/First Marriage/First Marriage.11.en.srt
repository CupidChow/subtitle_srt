00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,060
is hypocrisy.

6
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,640
Really?

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,950
I heard about it too.

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,830
Miss,

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,320
this is our new French wine.

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,070
Have a taste.

11
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,070
Thank you.

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,200
Miss,

13
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,209
are you alone?

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,630
Do you want

15
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:06,960
to drink with me?

16
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,510
Sorry.

17
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,730
I don't know how to drink wine.

18
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,539
You don't know how to drink wine?

19
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:15,180
I can teach you.

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,690
Bastard.

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,030
Do you know who I am?

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,740
Mingzhao!

23
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,390
You've got guts.

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,590
Now let's see

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520
if you can stand this.

26
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,210
Mr. Kojima, sorry.

27
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,070
Bring them here!

28
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,910
Yes.

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,110
He shot my man with my gun.

30
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,470
How dare he!

31
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,460
Mr. Kojima,

32
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,770
I didn't discipline him well.

33
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,490
Please let him go.

34
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,060
That depends on your performance.

35
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,120
Mr. Kojima.

36
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,390
I heard you never drink wine due to your legs.

37
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,550
Drink with me today.

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,079
Drink!

39
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,320
Drink!

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,350
Drink.

41
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,090
Do you know something?

42
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,480
Drink!

43
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,870
Drink!

44
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,590
Sir,

45
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,990
I've found the person who sent the letter.

46
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,000
The letter was made up by a tabloid.

47
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,710
It's a misunderstanding.

48
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,310
Mr. Shen.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,380
It's a misunderstanding.

50
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,210
Mr. Kojima,

51
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,329
now can you let my wife,

52
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,820
my brother, and my sister go?

53
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,160
Mr. Shen,

54
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,690
don't be angry.

55
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,829
About your wife,

56
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,770
it's a misunderstanding.

57
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,110
Thank you.

58
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,579
But

59
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,070
your brother shot my man.

60
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,240
I will not let this go!

61
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,030
My Lady,

62
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,520
let me do it myself.

63
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,390
You got hurt because of me.

64
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,350
Tanyue,

65
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,030
why are you here?

66
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,840
No one was home,

67
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,270
so I snuck out.

68
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,470
Then I saw you walk into the ballroom.

69
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,870
So I followed you inside.

70
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,600
Don't do this again.

71
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,880
Got it.

72
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,330
You... You're not dead?

73
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,230
These damn members of the Volunteer Group

74
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,230
tried to assassinate me!

75
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,440
What's the relationship between Hideo Miyazaki and Hidekawa Kojima?

76
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,350
Hideo Miyazaki is the chief guard of Hidekawa Kojima.

77
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,150
They're both from the Yamato Chamber of Commerce.

78
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,150
Then why was Tanshu

79
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,270
with someone from the Yamato Chamber of Commerce?

80
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,600
The problems have been solved.

81
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,830
About the Volunteer Group,

82
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,730
it's just a misunderstanding.

83
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,420
Brother,

84
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
are you okay?

85
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,350
I'm fine.

86
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,910
It's late.

87
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,110
Let's go home

88
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,590
and rest now.

89
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,300
Where did she go?

90
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,470
Mother.

91
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,350
Yue.

92
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,090
Are you alright?

93
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,830
I'm fine, Mother.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,040
-I'm fine.
-It's good that you're back.

95
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,570
It's good that you're back.

96
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,090
Mother!

97
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,920
Feng Yuqing,

98
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,520
I'm warning you.

99
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,830
If anything happened to Yue today,

100
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,120
you would suffer too!

101
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,230
Mother,

102
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,550
I went out myself.

103
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,909
It has nothing to do with Yuqing.

104
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:39,710
Yue,

105
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,230
she wants to harm you.

106
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,520
Why are you still defending her?

107
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,600
You silly girl.

108
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,850
Yuqing is so nice to me.

109
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,090
Why would she harm me?

110
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,610
Tanyue could have come back unscathed.

111
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,570
But someone

112
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,930
sent an anonymous letter to the Japanese,

113
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,680
saying I'm a member of the Volunteer Group.

114
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
That's why the situation got worse.

115
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,290
Second Mother,

116
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,640
in your opinion,

117
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,230
who sent this letter?

118
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,350
How would I know?

119
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,960
All right.

120
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,000
Since everyone has come back safely,

121
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,400
you guys should go get some rest.

122
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,390
Tanqian.

123
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,240
Come with me to the study.

124
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,970
Let's go, Yue.

125
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,610
Do you know how reckless

126
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,330
you were tonight?

127
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,390
Brother,

128
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,070
have you forgotten what Father taught us?

129
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,450
It's better to sacrifice ourselves

130
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,710
than to live as slaves.

131
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,230
Everything I did is for the Shen family.

132
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,030
During the years you were away,

133
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,670
the domestic railway industry started to boom,

134
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,710
causing the water transport business to wane.

135
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,900
The Shen family's business dwindled by nearly half.

136
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,120
Without the Yamato Chamber of Commerce,

137
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,390
this family would've fallen long ago.

138
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,390
So what?

139
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,290
There are many things we can do to make a living.

140
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,000
Why do you have to work with the Japanese?

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,630
Should I just watch our father's

142
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,550
lifetime of hard work be destroyed?
