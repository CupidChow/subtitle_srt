[Episode 13]

5
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,440
is quite an easy thing.

6
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,110
Tanshu.

7
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,150
It's so late now.

8
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,789
Why are you in the study room at this hour?

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,300
I happened to have some work

10
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,670
to deal with suddenly.

11
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,310
What's the rush?

12
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,520
It won't be too late to deal with it tomorrow morning.

13
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,410
But I...

14
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,350
Tanshu.

15
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,650
Have you forgotten what you told me before?

16
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,150
You told me that

17
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,670
no matter how busy you were,

18
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,600
you would find time to stay with me.

19
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,910
It's fine that you're so busy during the day.

20
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,789
But you are also so busy at night.

21
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,229
As a couple,

22
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,830
we're spending less and less

23
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,270
time with each other.

24
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,830
But I...

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,620
Okay. I understand.

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,500
Well, let's go back to our room.

27
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,480
Okay.

28
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,520
Brother.

29
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,730
You're going out so early?

30
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,210
What's the matter?

31
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,710
I want to talk to you about going to Paris.

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,630
I've made up my mind.

33
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,430
Don't talk about it anymore.

34
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,550
Brother.

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,470
Do I have to go?

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,530
I'm doing this for your safety.

37
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,130
You must return to Paris as soon as possible.

38
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,070
This is a ticket for tomorrow morning's train.

39
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,580
Brother, you really can't wait to

40
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,730
let me leave home.

41
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,110
I'm doing this for your own good sincerely.

42
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,590
Yesterday, why did you ask me to take

43
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,329
the key of the study room?

44
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,110
This matter is too complicated.

45
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,710
I'll explain it to you later.

46
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,829
Do you know that

47
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,010
Shen Tanshu was holding a gun last night?

48
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,720
A gun?

49
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,230
That's right.

50
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,680
I've never seen him being so cautious.

51
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,870
He must care about that stuff

52
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,430
in the study room very much.

53
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,450
Have you found your stuff?

54
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,350
Not yet.

55
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,320
Is the thing you're looking for

56
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,860
related to the Yamato Chamber of Commerce?

57
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,029
Listen to me.

58
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,149
Don't look further into this matter.

59
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,150
The less you know, the safer you'll be.

60
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,350
But this matter is very important to me.

61
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,720
Previously, I just couldn't figure out

62
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,120
why my elder sister provoked the Japanese.

63
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,780
Until that day, I saw Shen Tanshu

64
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,030
associate with Hidekawa Kojima.

65
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,050
Only then could I be sure that

66
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,950
my sister must have found out about their secret.

67
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,240
That was why the misfortune happened to her.

68
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,920
So,

69
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,370
Shen Tanqian,

70
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,720
I need to know what that stuff is.

71
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,640
No.

72
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,040
It's too dangerous.

73
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,540
For my sister,

74
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,840
I can even sacrifice my own life.

75
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,640
But have you ever thought that

76
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,970
your sister only wanted you to live well?

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,860
Why do you and Feng both think that

78
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,570
hiding the truth from me is for my own good?

79
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,940
She is my sister.

80
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,210
I can't let her death become an unexplained sacrifice.

81
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,050
Otherwise,

82
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,370
I can never have a quiet

83
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,520
conscience for the rest of my life.

84
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,910
Alright.

85
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,970
Then I'll tell you the truth.

86
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,910
After Yuji went to study abroad,

87
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,760
her elder sister joined the Volunteer Group.

88
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,330
The Volunteer Group found out that

89
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,330
Shen Tanshu and Hidekawa Kojima

90
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,909
had a secret deal.

91
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,350
Thus,

92
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,470
they sent Yuqing to approach him.

93
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,350
To make sure nothing went wrong,

94
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:49,940
Yuqing pretended to be a young lady who had the same name as her

95
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,060
and had been dead for many years.

96
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,610
Then she married Shen Tanshu

97
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,940
and found the evidence.

98
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,190
It was that ledger?

99
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,380
Yes.

100
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,010
She wanted to spread the news about the ledger

101
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,360
on the day when Yuji came back from abroad.

102
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,390
But unexpectedly,

103
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,270
two people were killed successively.

104
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,710
One of them

105
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,050
was Hidekawa Kojima's subordinate,

106
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,690
Hideo Miyazaki.

107
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,610
Stop talking about it.

108
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,150
I want to be alone for a while.

109
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,220
Shen Tanqian.

110
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,840
I want to join the Volunteer Group.

111
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,220
No.

112
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,990
Why?

113
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,160
You just want to take revenge.

114
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,960
That's right.

115
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,770
But the Volunteer Group also wants to eliminate the Yamato Chamber of Commerce.

116
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,370
As long as the result is the same,

117
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,780
so what if the goals are different?

118
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,750
If you join the Volunteer Group,

119
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,480
you must take the overall situation into consideration

120
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,440
and put personal feelings

121
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,900
and personal grudges aside

122
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,180
in order to achieve the great cause.

123
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,600
You'll have to dedicate yourself to the country and the people

124
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,330
and get ready to sacrifice your own life anytime.

125
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,350
When you arrive in Paris,

126
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,780
remember to write letters to your family often.

127
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,830
I'll read your letters to our father.

128
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,830
Please take good care of our father.

129
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,470
Brother Tanqian.

130
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,000
You've only been back for a few days.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,460
Why are you leaving again?

132
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,230
Tanyue.

133
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,450
You've grown up.

134
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,950
Don't cry.

135
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,390
Who specifies that adults can't cry?

136
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,470
Alright.

137
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,690
It's not like Tanqian won't come back.

138
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,810
Second Mother is right.

139
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,570
I'll be back

140
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,890
after a period of time.

141
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,470
I have to go.
