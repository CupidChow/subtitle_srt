00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,020
it was the best.

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,140
Let's give our best wishes

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,110

22
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,700
Next, let's...

23
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:40,910
Sir!

24
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,509
Young Master Tanqian broke in with his men.

25
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,990
You are mine.

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,750
No one can take you away from me.

27
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,610
Not even my elder brother.

28
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,020
[Hideo has the ledger. Take it now.]

29
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,829
The mask suits you very much.

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,000
I wonder what you look like behind the mask.

31
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,560
I'll tell you about it

32
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,990
after you finish drinking this cup of wine.

33
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,700
So it's okay now?

34
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,750
The wine is poisonous.

35
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,030
You...

36
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,670
You're not dead?

37
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,269
Thank you.

38
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,470
Escape now!

39
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,350
Yes.

40
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,370
He was poisoned?

41
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,510
You saved my life.

42
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,330
If there's a chance in the future, I'll repay you.

43
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,020
Give the stuff to me.

44
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,530
I don't understand

45
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,420
what you're talking about, sir.

46
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,710
You're playing dumb?

47
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,040
Why did you assassinate that Japanese man?

48
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,640
Wasn't he killed by you, sir?

49
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,010
Step aside!

50
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,170
What are you doing?

51
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,770
Search carefully.

52
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,210
Search carefully.

53
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,490
Sir, did you save me for another purpose?

54
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,150
Give me the stuff which was possessed by that Japanese man.

55
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,280
Then I'll let you go.

56
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,270
What if I don't give it to you?

57
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,890
Do you have to choose the hard way?

58
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,750
The murderer is not here. Let's go over there to take a look.

59
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,010
Go look for him at once!

60
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,730
Do you believe that I'll hand you over to the Japanese?

61
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,350
-Step aside!
-Step aside!
-Step aside!

62
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,350
It's him!

63
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,150
Stop!

64
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,500
Stop!

65
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,700
Don't move!

66
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,630
In the end, I'm back to my home

67
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,260
in this way.

68
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,240
These are all for the use of you and Tanyue.

69
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,860
You two can use them more.

70
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,870
Young Master Tanqian is back.

71
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,310
Come on. Hurry up.

72
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,190
Brother Tanqian.

73
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,050
Second Mother.

74
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,990
Third Mother.

75
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,850
Brother.

76
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:58,790
Tanyue.

77
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,600
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

78
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,670
Come on, Tanqian.

79
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,670
Brother.

80
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,960
How have you been abroad?

81
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,530
I've been fine.

82
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,950
It's good that you've been fine.

83
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,950
Brother Tanqian.

84
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:12,760
Tanyue.

85
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,240
You’ve grown up so soon.

86
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,390
Look.

87
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,160
Tanqian.

88
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,550
You've been away from home for a few years,

89
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,220
but you never wrote letters to your family.

90
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,430
Some people know that you went abroad to study,

91
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,470
but those who don't know that

92
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,550
might think that you abandoned this family.

93
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,430
Third Sister.

94
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,870
I'm just talking nonsense.

95
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,600
I'm happy that Tanqian is back.

96
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,430
It's good that you're back.

97
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,870
Yue.

98
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,150
Come here.

99
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,010
Come on.

100
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,270
Tanqian must be tired after having a long trip.

101
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,600
Let him go back to his room for a rest first.

102
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,410
Butler.

103
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,550
Go prepare a welcome-home party for Tanqian.

104
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,910
Yes.

105
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,790
Go at once.

106
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,170
Second Mother.

107
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,950
Why isn't my father here?

108
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,160
Tanqian.

109
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,720
I have to tell you something first.

110
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,910
Ask Eldest Young Madam to come downstairs.

111
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,640
Tanshu.

112
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,150
I'm here.

113
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,400
Come on.

114
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,310
Tanshu.

115
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,750
Who is this?

116
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
This is your sister-in-law.

117
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,030
Yuqing.

118
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,270
This is my younger brother whom I've been

119
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,330
mentioning to you,

120
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,590
Shen Tanqian.

121
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,910
My dear sister-in-law, you look quite familiar to me.

122
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,770
I seem to have seen you somewhere.

123
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,190
Really?

124
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,790
But this is my first time

125
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,070
seeing you.
