00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,030
Why are you here?

7
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,940
I'm here to buy books.

8
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,960
How long have you been here?

9
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,010
I've been here for a while.

10
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,870
You heard everything?

11
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,950
Yes.

You're Feng Yuqing's younger sister.

What's your name?

If you still want that thing...

22
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,550
I won't tell anyone.

23
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,190

25
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,669
Your lie has made me so painful.

Of course

27
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,360
you should do something to make it up to me.

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,510
What do you want me to do?

00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,460
am fine.

43
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,840
Okay.

47
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,870

Yes.

51
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,500
We're going back first.

52
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,470
I called you many times in the bookstore just now.

53
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,870
Why didn't you answer me?

54
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,350
I was too absorbed in the book.

55
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,790
I didn't hear you call me.

56
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,740
What book were you reading?

57
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,100
A book about planting.

58
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,840
It's something you're not interested in.

59
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,540
Really?

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,120
I thought you were talking to Tanqian

61
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,990
and didn't dare to answer me.

62
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,310
Why would you think like this?

63
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,590
Because I can always

64
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,010
see you with Tanqian.

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,570
I saw you in the shower room

66
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,830
and the garden before.

67
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:00,040
I saw you again in the bookstore today.

68
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,710
They were just coincidences.

69
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,310
There's nothing between us.

70
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,710
Nothing?

71
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,230
I'm crippled,

72
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,590
but I'm not blind.

73
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,270
If there really is nothing between you,

74
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,150
why do you always flirt with each other?

75
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,230
The way he looks at you indicates there's something between you.

76
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,990
Do you still dare to say you didn't cross the line

77
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,720
or show your affection for your brother-in-law?

78
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,840
Shen Tanshu!

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,790
Yuqing!

80
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,710
Don't move, Mr. Shen.

81
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,570
So you are members of the Volunteer Group.

82
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,830
Then there is a misunderstanding between us.

83
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,990
Exactly.

84
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,840
You're old. I didn't expect you to be so strong.

85
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,230
You hit me so hard.

86
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,030
Who's old?

87
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,430
I'm still young.

88
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,110
Listen.

89
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,270
This is a work accident.

90
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,930
I demand reimbursement from the organization.

91
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,320
Right,

92
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,180
what mission are you two on?

93
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,960
Why are you investigating me?

94
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,150
We discovered that Feng Yuqing has the ledger

95
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,910
documenting the Yamato Chamber of Commerce's opium trafficking

96
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,640
and smuggling of cultural relics and treasures.

97
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,540
You're mistaken.

98
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,790
She doesn't have the ledger.

99
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,540
She doesn't have it?

100
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,000
Then why did she assassinate Hideo Miyazaki?

101
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,500
She went to avenge her sister.

102
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:39,270
She came back from Japan that day.

103
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,590
When she was studying in Japan,

104
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,150
she missed her sister the most.

105
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,110
Sister.

106
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,560
So on the day she came back,

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,150
she and her sister agreed to meet

108
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,550
at the train station.

109
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,230
Sister.

110
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,320
But unexpectedly,

111
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,520
when she just got off the train,

112
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,659
she saw her sister

113
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,730
being killed by someone.

114
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,390
Something's going on over there.

115
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,590
Hurry up!

116
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,470
Let's go! Now!

117
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,280
Get on the train now!

118
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,360
This is her autopsy report.

119
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,240
Apart from the two stabs,

120
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,100
they detected arsenic in her body.

121
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,170
Who... Who did this to her?

122
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,510
What happened...

123
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,810
happened to my sister?

124
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,340
Don't worry about this.

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,930
Leave it to me.

[To my husband]

127
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,840
Why didn't my sister tell me she married someone?

128
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,110
Does her death

129
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,190
have something to do with Tanshu?

130
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,590
So this is why she cried.

131
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,500
Yuqing.

132
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,590
What do you want?

133
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,240
Who sent you here?

134
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,750
I'll pay you twice the amount!

135
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,350
Let me go!

136
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,280
Don't touch her!

137
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,330
-Let go of me!
-Yuqing!
