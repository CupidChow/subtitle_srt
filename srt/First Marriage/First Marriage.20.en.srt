kill me if you dare!

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,030
Do you think you're still a three-year-old boy?

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,150
Feng!

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,630
Shen Tanshu!

15
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,400

Young Madam.

17
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:12,630
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,190
Shen Tanshu!

19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,890
This is what you have always wanted.

20
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,140
I won't let you have it.

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,790
Shen Tanshu!

22
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,450

30
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,750
No.

31
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,110
Young Master Tanshu.

32
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,910
You may leave.

33
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,870
Father,

34
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,360
I have something

35
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,829
to tell you.

36
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,040
Tanqian is gone.

37
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,010
The ledger I burned

38
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,440
in front of him last night

39
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,270
was fake.

40
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,510
But he took it seriously.

41
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,120
Before he died,

42
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,070
he looked like

43
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,690
he wanted to eat me alive.

44
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,200
Father, tell me.

45
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,030
He was a noble young master

46
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,850
who lived a worry-free life.

47
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,380
Why did he insist on going on adventures?

48
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,590
He joined

49
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,240
the Volunteer Group

50
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,720
and stood against me.

51
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,269
So...

52
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,230
Father,

53
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,110
I...

54
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,150
killed him.

55
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,640
I threw his body

56
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,770
into the river.

57
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,659
I made your wish come true

58
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,890
by letting him return to the sea.

59
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,560
You want to hit me?

60
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,840
What's the point?

61
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,990
Look at you.

62
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,390
What can you do?

63
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,360
What I want is simple.

64
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,080
I just want a healthy body

65
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,190
and a good life.

66
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,010
Why can't you give it to me?

67
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,170
Do you still remember

68
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,460
how I became a cripple?

69
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,760
The Japanese wanted to take revenge on you back then.

70
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,080
You only cared about Tanqian.

71
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,230
You secretly sent him abroad.

72
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,230
But what about me?

73
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,740
Have you ever cared about me?

74
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,850
I...

75
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,400
I...

76
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,250
We both are your biological sons.

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,770
Why can't I be the one you chose?

78
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,730
Why can't it be me?

79
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,150
Father.

80
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,340
Father.

81
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,120
Father.

82
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,270
Father.

83
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,020
Father.

84
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,310
I did something wrong again.

85
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,110
I did something wrong again.

86
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,370
Father.

87
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:12,550
Here.

88
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,210
Have some porridge.

89
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,160
You haven't eaten for three days.

90
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,960
Eat it while it's hot.

91
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,080
There's no need to get back at me with your health.

92
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:33,990
Right?

93
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,150
Here.

94
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,100
You'd better tie me up like this forever.

95
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,710
Or I'll kill you

96
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,810
to avenge Feng and Tanqian

97
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,830
after I get out.

98
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,090
Do you hear me?

99
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,130
But it's their fault

100
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,740
that they ended up like this.

101
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,070
Why are you doing this?

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,490
Come on.

103
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,590
Have some while it's hot.

104
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,850
Come on.

105
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,310
Look at me.

106
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,490
Look at me.

107
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,590
Look at me!

108
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,950
I...
