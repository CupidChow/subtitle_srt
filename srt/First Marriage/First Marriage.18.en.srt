00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,620
That is the setting sun.

[Episode 18]

5
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,390
They thought it was the dawn.

6
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,400
I knew you'd be here.

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,400
Let's go.

8
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,370
Come to a place with me.

9
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,110
Feng!

10
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,990
Feng!

11
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,670
Don't move.

12
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,030
Feng.

13
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,390
I'm glad you're fine.

14
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,310
Let him go.

15
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,880
If you want to kill someone,

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,650
come at me!

17
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,470
I have to say

18
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,330
you and your sister

19
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,039
not only look alike,

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,460
but also

21
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,220
have very similar personalities.

22
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,150
How dare you mention my sister?

23
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,750
If it weren't for you,

24
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,270
she wouldn't have died tragically.

25
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,910
She betrayed me first.

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,670
I thought

27
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,780
she married me

28
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,470
because she loved me.

29
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,420
Tan... Tanshu.

30
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,389
You don't love me at all.

31
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,430
You approached me

32
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,270
and married me

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,120
just for this ledger, right?

34
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,350
Just because I love you,

35
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,579
I can't watch you go astray

36
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,840
and trade ancestral relics

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,790
for opium with the Japanese.

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,290
You are ruining the future of yourself

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,600
and the Shen family.

40
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,980
You're betraying your ancestors

41
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,740
and the country.

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,560
But I did these for the Shen Family.

43
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,710
You know

44
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,550
the water transport of the Shen Family is near its end.

45
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,990
We cannot make ends meet.

46
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,270
Especially after my father came down,

47
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,660
those snobs who had always wanted something to happen to the Shen family

48
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,320
made things difficult for us.

49
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,390
As the eldest son of the Shen family,

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,110
I can't watch

51
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,270
our family be gone!

52
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,960
If it's for the Shen Family,

53
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,120
you shouldn't get involved with the Japanese even more.

54
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,270
But only the Japanese

55
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,670
are willing to cooperate with us now!

56
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,550
That's not cooperation at all.

57
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,070
They are just using you.

58
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,420
They want to steal

59
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,280
our precious relics through you.

60
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,860
If you betray our nation

61
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,410
for the short-term benefit

62
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,070
and help them sell opium,

63
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,920
you will destroy the bodies and spirits

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,079
of our compatriots.

65
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,210
If the situation becomes turbulent,

66
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,770
we can only be meat

67
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,200
on their chopping block.

68
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,390
By then,

69
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,870
the country will be destroyed.

70
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,070
Where can our home be?

71
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,940
Do you really think those Japanese

72
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,990
would be so kind

73
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,670
to keep you safe forever?

74
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,530
I...

75
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,440
I've memorized all the information

76
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,079
in the ledger.

77
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,360
Either

78
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,829
you kill me,

79
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,390
or

80
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,870
you let me go.

81
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,790
I promise

82
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,260
nothing will happen to the Shen family.

83
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,110
Sir.

84
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,390
Her Ladyship has…

85
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,540
Have you brought her body back?

86
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,980
No.

87
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,450
Tell me. Am I wrong?

88
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,790
Sir,

89
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,800
you have your reasons for your decision.

90
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,390
Sir.

91
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,480
Sir!

92
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,580
Sir.

93
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,870
Sir.

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,480
Are you okay?

95
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,470
Sir.

96
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,230
Sir.

97
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,710
Sir.

98
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,230
Although

99
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,230
she kept promising me

100
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,300
nothing would happen to the Shen family,

101
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,909
my cooperation with the Japanese was at a point of no return.

102
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:53,710
Once it stopped,

103
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,440
all my efforts would be wasted.

104
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,270
So,

105
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,830
you let the Japanese kill her.

106
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,050
She lied to me.

107
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,210
She even lied about her identity.

108
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,040
She said she loved me

109
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,350
and she'd treat me well.

110
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,150
In the end,

111
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,170
it was all for a ledger.

112
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,470
You too.

113
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,320
No.

114
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,270
Your acting skills are much worse

115
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,990
than your sister.

116
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,590
Now that you knew who I was,

117
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,070
why didn't you expose me?

118
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,940
I wanted to use you.

119
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,350
I wanted to use you

120
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,350
to kill Third Mother,

121
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,710
Cui,

122
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,990
and Butler.

123
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,790
They all depended

124
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,930
on the Shen Family,

125
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,760
but in the end,

126
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,780
they did nothing

127
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,350
but betray our Shen family.

128
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,790
They deserved to die.

129
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,540
Did you do it for the Shen family or for yourself?

130
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,350
I think you know it best deep inside.

131
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:50,780
Yes.

132
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,600
I know it clearly.

133
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,590
You always compare me to Tanqian, don't you?

134
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,210
Yes.

135
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,909
We're different.

136
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,690
He has all limbs intact.

137
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,590
Everyone loves him.

138
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,390
What about me?

139
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,230
I sit in a wheelchair all day long.

140
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,850
I suffer the pain in my legs day and night.

141
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,910
All of you treat me as a cripple.

142
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,790
Only the Japanese treat me as a human.

143
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,250
They chose to work with me!

144
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,710
You're wrong.

145
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,670
The Japanese never treat you as a human.

146
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,130
They only treat you as a dog who betrays its owner to fawn on others.

147
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,110
Yes.

148
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,430
I am a homeless dog.

149
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,470
But I can decide

150
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,200
the life and death of all of you.

151
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,720
You want to save him?

152
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,710
Marry me.

153
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,710
I can consider

154
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,270
sparing his life.

155
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,250
No!

156
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,230
Don't promise him.

157
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,220
Why?

158
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,810
Because I love you.

159
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,170
I want to give you another chance.

160
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,520
Feng Yuqing.
