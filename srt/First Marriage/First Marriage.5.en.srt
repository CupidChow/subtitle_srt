[Episode 5]

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,470
has never been the ugly faces of villains,

6
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,380
but the masks on their faces.

7
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,350
Third Mother.

8
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,180
May you return to the sea

9
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,930
and find eternal bliss in the afterlife.

10
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,390
If there is an afterlife,

11
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,870
don't

12
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,000
repeat the same mistake again.

13
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,350
Third Mother.

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,420
Why did you commit suicide?

15
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,420
It must be because

16
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,710
I was harsh on her yesterday.

17
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,900
That's why.

18
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,420
Third Mother was arrogant and domineering.

19
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,229
She didn't feel guilty even after killing someone.

20
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:34,690
How could someone like her

21
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,740
commit suicide?

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,979
Second Mother,

23
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,940
does Father know about this?

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,200
I haven't told Master about this yet.

25
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,620
Father has been bedridden.

26
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,350
We'd better not disturb him.

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,960
I don't know what's going on in this family.

28
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,120
All these things happen

29
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,650
one by one.

30
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,710
Ever since Tanshu got married,

31
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:22,660
this family has never found peace.

32
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,350
Second Mother, you don't have to make innuendoes.

33
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,450
Since I was young, I've suffered the losses of my parents

34
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,579
and my other family.

35
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,670
I've been treated with disdain for too many times.

36
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,510
If you dislike me,

37
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,240
I'll leave.

38
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,870
Yuqing.

39
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,740
Yuqing.

40
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,550
Let her go.

41
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,700
As you all heard,

42
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,770
I didn't say anything about her.

43
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,850
Second Mother.

44
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,350
Yuqing didn't mean that.

45
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,320
Then, what did she mean?

46
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,620
If I had known this,

47
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,560
I shouldn't have agreed

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,790
your marriage.

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,340
Second Mother, please calm down.

50
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:07,960
Yue.

51
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,810
Let's go.

52
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,990
Brother Tanshu and the others thought you had left,

53
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,320
so they went back early.

54
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,540
Are you going back

55
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,480
or staying here?

56
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,340
Thank you.

57
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,240
Cui just took a leave with me and went home.

58
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,030
Let her go.

59
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,280
She killed Third Madam.

60
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,300
What?

61
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,700
Didn't Third Sister commit suicide?

62
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,120
I saw it with my own eyes last night.

63
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,770
After killing Third Madam,

64
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,620
she set the scene as a suicide.

65
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

66
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,030
I have no evidence.

67
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,560
Would everyone believe me?

68
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,750
Besides,

69
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,440
Young Master Tanshu didn't want this news to spread,

70
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,280
so I...

71
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,470
Go.

72
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,820
Get her back.

73
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,390
Okay.

74
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,510
Young Madam.

75
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,480
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,730
I didn't mean it.

77
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,540
I was threatened by Butler.

78
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,200
The more I think about it, the more I find it wrong.

79
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,730
When Feng Yuqing came back,

80
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,020
she should have gone to Cui first.

81
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,120
Why is she picking on me?

82
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,920
Cui must have told her

83
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,420
it was me who poisoned her.

84
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,340
She left herself clean.

85
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,520
If you can't handle this,

86
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,990
why did you do those things in the first place?

87
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,850
Second Sister,

88
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,310
Cui

89
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,460
knows so many secrets of the Shen family.

90
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
We can't keep her.

91
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,280
Who is it?

92
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,670
Third Madam.

93
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,240
Your wine is here.

94
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,190
Come in.

95
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,690
Young Madam.

96
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,630
I know I was wrong.

97
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,830
I'm really sorry.

98
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,710
I beg you.

99
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,350
Please let me go.

100
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,480
I was possessed by devils.

101
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,140
I only did what Butler said.

102
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,450
I'm really sorry.

103
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,240
Young Madam.

104
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,330
Young Madam,

105
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,640
please forgive me.

106
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,000
Thank you for telling me about the poison.

107
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,640
Go to the prison to repent.

108
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,530
Young Madam.

109
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:50,670
Young Madam.

110
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,900
I'm really sorry.

111
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,950
Let me go!

112
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,470
Young Master Tanqian,

113
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,159
Please spare me.

114
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,850
Young Master Tanqian, I really know I was wrong!

115
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,670
Go.

116
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,490
Get up.

117
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,920
Get up. Hurry.

118
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,030
Sir.

119
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,690
Sir, do you want an umbrella?

120
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,070
Why are you here?

121
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,670
I overheard the conversation between Butler and Second Mother.

122
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,070
Now that I think about it,

123
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,620
it was all for me.

124
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,990
Hatchetmen were ambushing into that room in advance.

125
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,950
They colluded with the maid

126
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,950
to kill you.

127
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,480
That's right.

128
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,789
You knew that,

129
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,870
but you still took the risk.

130
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,310
If I didn't go there,

131
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,070
how could I have caught Cui?

132
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,870
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,920
For what?

134
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,590
I thought

135
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,630
you killed Third Mother.

136
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,880
It's true that I wanted to kill her,

137
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,430
but God had mercy

138
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,410
and killed her in advance.

139
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,790
Maybe this

140
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,300
is the best result

141
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,900
for her, for the Shen family,

142
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,750
and for you.

143
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,550
Maybe.

144
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,590
There's an Iron Flower Show!

145
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,860
Hurry up! There's an Iron Flower Show!

146
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,990
It's so beautiful. Go and have a look.

147
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,630
Okay.

148
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,550
It's so beautiful.

149
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,870
So beautiful.

150
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,890
So beautiful.

151
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,220
Good.

152
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,030
Good!

153
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,710
So beautiful.

154
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,260
Once more.

155
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,120
Great!

156
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,470
Let's go.

157
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,680
Let's go home.

158
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,150
Let's go have a drink.

159
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,550
Let's go home for dinner.

160
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,450
What are you doing?

161
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,900
What's wrong with him?
