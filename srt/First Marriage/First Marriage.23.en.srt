[FIRST MARRIAGE]

00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,590

[Episode 23]

5
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,240
continuously rippled over their bodies.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,640
They couldn't help themselves.

7
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,220
Yes!

8
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,820
I killed him.

9
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,800
But I did it for his own good.

10
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,950
Freeing him early is better

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,130
than letting him be a burden in bed.

12
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,110
I advise you not to play tricks with me.

13
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,240
Do you really think I dare not kill you?

14
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,470
If you want to kill me,

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,760
you would have done it long ago.

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,470
You keep me alive

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,110
because you feel guilty

18
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,320
towards my sister.

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,080
When you look at my face,

20
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,390
you would tell yourself my sister is still alive.

21
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,190
Shut up!

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,030
Shut up!

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,690
Has it ever occurred to you

24
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,820
that my sister married you because she really loved you?

25
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,729
You don't believe me?

26
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,729
See for yourself.

27
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,250
So what?

28
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,009
In the end,

29
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,830
she still betrayed me.

30
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,030
Guards,

31
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,950
take her to her room

32
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,470
and keep an eye on her!

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,340
-Yes.
-Yes.

34
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,680
Mingzhao.

35
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,350
Under.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,490
So Father wanted to tell me

37
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,740
the ledger is under the bed.

38
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,070
Father,

39
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,270
I won't let you down.

40
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,950
I will get back the cultural relics Shen Tanshu gave

41
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,010
to Hidekawa Kojima

42
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,870
and catch them all.

43
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,670
Are you crazy?

44
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,370
Your brother will be here soon.

45
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,600
This is my home.

46
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,230
Where do you want me to go?

47
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,470
You're drunk.

48
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,970
Look at me.

49
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,970
I'm not drunk.

50
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,190
Shen Tanqian,

51
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,050
let go of me!

52
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,060
I'm your sister-in-law.

53
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,560
You are mine.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,230
No one can take you away from me.

55
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,900
Not even my brother.

56
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:00,470
Yuqing.

57
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,400
Are you ready, Yuqing?

58
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,020
Yuqing.

59
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,660
Are you ready, Yuqing?

60
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,750
Yuqing, are you in there?

61
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,380
I'm ready.

62
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,690
What are you doing, Yuqing?

63
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,230
Are you okay?

64
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,780
-I...
-Yuqing.

65
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,500
I... I'm fine.

66
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,420
What did you say, Yuqing?

67
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,820
I can't hear you clearly.

68
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,360
Yuqing.

69
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,850
How much longer will it take, Yuqing?

70
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,380
Do you want him or me?

71
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,400
Yuqing.

72
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,950
I... I'm coming in.

73
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,220
Tanshu,

74
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,400
I... I'm getting changed.

75
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,800
You... You go entertain the guests.

76
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,760
Okay, I'll wait for you downstairs.
