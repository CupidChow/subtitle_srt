You care so much about me.

168
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,280
Is it because you want to get back the stuff you're looking for

169
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,210
or is it because of something else?

There were so many clothes for me to choose from in the shop today.

186
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,270
As a man, Tanshu couldn't decide which one he should buy.

187

this color

189
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,790
is a bit old-fashioned.

190
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,210
It's not that the dress is old-fashioned.

191
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,270
You're the one who is old-fashioned.

192
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,340
What do you mean, Third Mother?

193
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,360
Don't say you don't know that I ordered this dress.

194
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,110
You also

195
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,110
ordered the same dress?

196
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,030
No wonder

197
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,610
the owner of the shop refused to sell it to me.

198
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,040
He said it had been custom-made for a rich concubine,

199
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,810
and it was the only one in the entire city.

200
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,340
I spent a lot of money

201
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,770
and said many nice things

202
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,480
to persuade the shop owner to sell it to me.

203
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,670
Well,

204
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,580
since this Cheongsam belongs to you,

205
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,150
I can't take away or occupy

206
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,210
the dress you like.

207
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,870
Later,

208
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,870
I'll return it

209
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,260
to you intactly.

210
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,030
You...

211
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,070
What?

212
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:23,950
Tanqian.

213
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,720
Have you also been attracted

214
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
by this coquette?

215
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,370
You're protecting her and going against me?

216
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,910
Third Mother.

217
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:31,970
Calm down.

218
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,110
Just now, my sister-in-law also said that

219
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,640
she didn't do it on purpose.

220
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,190
You've really been attracted by this coquette.

221
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,270
You're even taking her side while talking.

222
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,070
Third Mother.

223
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,550
It's just a dress.

224
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,550
Why do you have to be so angry?

225
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,080
You even wanted to hurt her?

226
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,930
If Second Mother knows this,

227
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,740
how will you explain it to her, Third Mother?

228
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,830
Alright.

229
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,070
All of you

230
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,170
have Second Sister's support,

231
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,900
so you all disrespect the elders.

232
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,630
Feng Yuqing.

233
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,030
I won't let you off.

234
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,240
Let's go!

235
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,710
Why are you still standing there?

236
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,310
Yes.

237
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,760
Do you want to watch

238
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,390
a good show?
