[Episode 6]

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,490
it's more accurate to say her beauty is unique.

00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,490
Tanyue.

7
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,510
Yuqing.

8
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,590
You're here.

9
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,670
Are you making lanterns?

10
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,790
The lights are broken.

11
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,350
The maintenance worker hasn't come yet.

12
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,070
I thought

13
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,970
I could make some for us to use now.

14
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,110
Let me help you.

15
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,390
Here.

16
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,380
My Lady. Young Madam.

-Have some tea.
-Thank you, Butler.

19
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,990
Thank you.

20
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,690
Yuqing.

21
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,750
Your cup looks nice.

22
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,550
Can you swap with me?

23
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,710
Okay.

24
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,410
Sorry.

25
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,190
I forgot to add sugar.

26
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,390
I forgot to add sugar.

27
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,750
The detailed information of your sister-in-law.

28
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,830
Haven't we read it before?

29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,510
Take a closer look.

30
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,070

31
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,810
Both parents are dead.

32
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,150
Inherited a huge sum of inheritance.

Reclusive and eccentric.

Having no relatives or friends.

35
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,350
She died at 25 years old.

36
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,710
Is there a mistake in this?

37
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,990
It's 100% true.

38
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,720
Then, the one in our house is...

39
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,400
Someone else.

40
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,390
Impossible.

41
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,390
If she's a fake,

42
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,320
why didn't Brother Tansh find out?

43
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,270
Here is another document

44
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,400
to help you prove your sister-in-law

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,130
is not the real sister-in-law.

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,790
Allergic to peanuts?

Tanyue.

48
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,870
Pass me the red paper.

49
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,460
Okay.

50
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,830
Not this one.

51
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,660
Red.

52
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:26,550
Here.

53
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,070
Tanyue,

54
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,430
can't you tell red from green?

55
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,270
Yuqing,

56
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,010
don't tell anyone about this secret,

57
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,990
especially Brother Tanshu.

58
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,230
Why?

59
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,990
My mother said

60
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,090
if people know I have eye problems,

61
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,590
they will dislike me.

62
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,210
Brother Tanshu will be more worried.

63
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,160
I won't tell anyone.

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,020
Go.

65
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,770
It's hot.

66
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,420
Brother Tanshu.

67
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,080
Yuqing.

68
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,390
Tanqian, you're just in time.

69
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,470
Sit down and eat with us.

70
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,980
I brought you something delicious.

71
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,280
Pastries from Manfu Bakery.

72
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,780
Try it.

73
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,910
Thank you.

74
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,420
Try it.

75
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,800
By the way, Brother Tanshu,

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,150
when I was buying the pastries at Manfu Bakery,

77
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,150
I met someone

78
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,390
who claimed

79
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,470
to be Yuqing's old friend.

80
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,370
Old friend?

81
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,230
He was very happy

82
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,270
to hear that Yuqing had married into the Shen family.

83
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,130
When he saw that I bought peanut cakes,

84
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,130
he reminded me

85
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,550
that Yuqing was allergic to peanuts.

86
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,460
Right!

87
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,720
You can't eat it. You'll get allergic.

88
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,920
Yuqing.

89
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,630
Are you okay, Yuqing?

90
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,520
Tanqian, call the doctor.

91
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,470
No need.

92
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,470
Brother Tanshu.

93
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,270
I haven't finished yet.

94
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,270
That man reminded me that Yuqing was allergic to peanuts,

95
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,980
so I changed them all into water chestnut cakes.

96
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,090
It is said that they have similar tastes,

97
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,110
but few people can tell the difference.

98
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,650
Water chestnut cakes?

99
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,520
Then, Yuqing, why did you...

100
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,230
My chest was a little stuffy.

101
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I have a headache.

102
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,030
Mingzhao.

103
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,470
Mingzhao.

104
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,030
No…

105
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,710
Mingzhao.

106
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,590
No need.

107
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,130
Let's go back to our room and rest.

108
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,480
Are you really okay?

109
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,430
You investigated me?

110
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,480
I investigated my sister-in-law,

111
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,220
not you.

112
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,420
Apart from asthma,

113
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,510
one would also have red spots

114
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,840
when they're allergic to peanuts.

115
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,700
You didn't change peanut cakes into water chestnut cakes.

116
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,530
That's right.

117
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,030
I was just giving you an out

118
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,390
in front of my brother.

119
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,270
There are so many people with the same name.

120
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,550
How can you be sure

121
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,040
the Feng Yuqing you investigated is me?

122
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,490
Then, why are you panicking?

123
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,270
Am I?

124
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,140
Don't worry.

125
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,710
Before finding out who you really are,

126
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,390
you are still my sister-in-law.

127
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,030
Yuqing.

128
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,230
Tanqian.

129
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,400
What are you doing?

130
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,400
Brother Tanshu.

131
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,790
Yuqing said

132
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,670
today's water chestnut cakes are delicious.

133
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,200
She asked me to bring some more home tomorrow.

134
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,240
Why didn't you tell me?

135
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,030
I can buy them for you.

136
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,240
You've been busy lately.

137
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,930
I didn't want to disturb you.

138
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,080
We're husband and wife.

139
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,590
How can you call it "disturb"?

140
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,350
Tomorrow,

141
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,470
I'll buy them with you.

142
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,020
Okay?

143
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,980
Okay.

144
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,970
It's getting late.

145
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,010
I'm going to bed.

146
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,160
Brother Tanshu.

147
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,830
Yuqing.

148
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,400
You should rest early, too.

149
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,010
Why did he hold your hand just now?

150
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,090
I wanted to drink some tea,

151
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,159
but I got burned by the teacup.

152
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,110
Tanqian was too worried.

153
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,530
Tanqian

154
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,760
is young and passionate.

155
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,960
He doesn't understand some etiquette.

156
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,280
As his sister-in-law,

157
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,140
you should behave properly.

158
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,180
Okay.

159
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,190
You urgently called me here.

160
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:04,890
What is it?

161
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,070
The Volunteer Group sent a message.

162
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,470
They ask us to get the ledger as soon as possible,

163
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,470
saying the Japanese will make a big move soon.

164
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,270
How about you?

165
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,150
Have you found out her identity?

166
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,150
Her identity is indeed suspicious.

167
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,590
As long as you threaten her with her identity,

168
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,870
she will definitely hand over the ledger.

169
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,510
She doesn't buy it.

170
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,430
If I threaten her with her identity,

171
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,430
she will threaten me with the ledger instead.

172
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,890
I have to find another way.

173
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,950
Her identity is going to be exposed,

174
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,410
yet she's still fearless.

175
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,740
She must be a deep one.

176
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,920
At this point,

177
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,470
I can only use my trump card.

178
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,390
What trump card?

179
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,470
You!

180
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,520
Me?

181
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,210
Yuqing!

182
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,350
Yuqing.

183
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,600
Don't do this.

184
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,260
Yuqing.

185
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,350
Are you so…

186
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,860
impatient?

187
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,260
Do you like it?

188
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,500
Do it.

189
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,420
Do whatever you want to me!

190
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,090
What kind of trump card is that?

191
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,190
As the old saying goes, even a resolute woman can be won over by a persistent suitor.

192
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,830
How about you

193
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,590
sacrifice your beauty

194
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,110
for the ledger?

195
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,750
Enough.

196
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,310
I'll figure it out myself.

197
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,000
Wait.

198
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,030
I have another plan.

199
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,810
Again?

200
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,730
Wait.

201
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,900
Take it.

202
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,270
This is...

203
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,050
You'll know when you get there.

204
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,700
[No. 38 Fuqi Lane, Qiuzhi Bookstore]

205
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,800
Quality tea!

206
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,050
Take care.

207
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,480
Please have a private seat upstairs.

208
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,150
Yuji.

209
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,350
Sister.

210
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,820
Where did you get this pinwheel?

211
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,830
Director made it for us.

212
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,750
He said

213
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,840
that as long as we were together,

214
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,830
the pinwheel would spin.

215
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,470
So, if we are together forever,

216
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,750
then the pinwheel will spin forever?

217
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,590
Sister.

218
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,310
Yuqing.

219
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,990
Yuqing.

220
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,790
What's wrong?

221
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,630
It's windy.

222
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,850
Let's go inside.

223
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,850
Okay.

224
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,000
Yuqing.

225
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,870
Have you found the book you're looking for?

226
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,470
Wait for me here.

227
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,770
I'll look elsewhere.

228
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,490
Okay.

229
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,470
What is my sister's purpose

230
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,830
to marry into the Shen family?

231
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,560
Why is she allergic to peanuts?

232
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I'll explain this

233
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,630
to you later.

234
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,090
Leave the Shen Family now.

235
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,830
Stop pretending to be your sister.

236
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,400
No.

237
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,080
I've found the murderer who killed my sister.

238
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,880
They haven't paid the price yet.

239
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,280
The Shen family is not easy to deal with.

240
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,510
Do you want

241
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,650
to repeat your sister's mistake?

242
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,190
I can stop,

243
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,400
but you have to tell me everything about my sister.

244
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,950
Kid,

245
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,540
why are you so stubborn?

246
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,510
Otherwise, how can I let it go?

247
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,070
I grew up with my sister.

248
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,750
Who would have thought

249
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,200
when I just came back from abroad,

250
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,580
I'd watch her

251
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,920
collapse in front of me?

252
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,820
Fine.

253
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,950
It's okay if you don't tell me.

254
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,630
I'll investigate it myself.
