she has to come to the brink of destruction.

00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,870
Second Mother,

7
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,470
you're worried

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,110
you'll be implicated.

9
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,040
So you're in a hurry to leave here.

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,280
Right?

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,700
Tanshu,

12
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,740
at this point,

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,130
I'm going to be frank with you.

14
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,310
You already killed two of your family members.

15
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,460
Maybe one day,

16
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,850
you'll kill me and Tanyue.

17
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,310
You really

18
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,820
consider me a beast.

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,720
Aren't you a beast?

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,820
How did Master become like this?

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,670
How did Feng Yuqing die?

22
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,350
How did you kill Tanqian?

23
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,570
Everything you did

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,780
would shock the world.

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,880
You're just the type

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,470
with wild ambition.

27
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,830
Tanyue, come and sit.

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,810
Come and sit.

29
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,490
Yue.

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,350
Come and sit!

31
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,320
What a righteous speech!

32
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,670
Do you want to talk about

33
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,920
what you did in front of Yue?

34
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,310
Shen Tanshu,

35
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,430
I've done many things

36
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,270
for you all these years.

37
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,790
Especially when Master was paralyzed,

38
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,040
you wouldn't take care of the Shen family's affairs.

39
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,880
As you asked,

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,150
I also killed Third Sister and the butler.

41
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,860
Brother Tanshu!

42
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,430
Y-Yue.

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,940
Tanshu,

44
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,920
I... I'm begging you.

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,250
Please let Yue and me go.

46
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,950
Let us leave this family.

47
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,860
We're even.

48
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,350
We're even?

49
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,370
Second Mother,

50
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,910
you transferred the Shen family's assets.

51
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,940
How can we be even?

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,130
Don't tell me you want to take the assets with you.

53
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,250
I can give everything back to you,

54
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,090
as long as you let Yue and me go.

55
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,190
Yue is my sister anyway.

56
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,440
Do you really think I'm a devil who kills people like flies?

57
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,150
Sign it.

58
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,250
Leave the assets

59
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,510
and you can leave.

60
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,110
Yue.

61
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,960
Let's go.

62
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:50,840
Hurry!

63
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,190

Mingzhao.

66
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,000
It's okay.

67
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,030
My Lady, goodbye.

68
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,600
You are the person I trust the most.

69
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,360
You should know the consequence

70
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,450
of betraying me!

71
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,230
Sir, I'm at your disposal.

72
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,450
Get lost.

73
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,910

Master Shen died.

75
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,350
Young Master Tanshu has inherited the family business

76
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,900
and decided to hold a wedding in three days.

77
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,270
Extra!

78
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,270
Young Master Tanshu of the Shen family

79
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,590
will hold a wedding in three days.

[Master Shen died. Young Master Tanshu has inherited the family business and decided to hold a wedding in three days]

81

Let's go back together

82
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,150
and put an end to this.

83
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,350
Tanqian,

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,790
don't blame me for being cruel.

85
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,630
Only adversities and challenges

86
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,150
can make you a real man.

87
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,230
I'm looking forward to the day you come back.

88
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,270
Shen Tanshu must have killed my father.

89
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,300
Otherwise, he wouldn't have died suddenly.

90
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,220
He was just paralyzed.

91
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,560
He didn't have an incurable disease.

92
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,480
I'll help you

93
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,790
take revenge at the wedding

94
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,850
when Shen Tanshu lowers his guard.

95
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,500
No.

96
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,640
It's too dangerous.

97
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,590
Now that the ledger is lost,

98
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,990
do you have a better idea?

99
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,480
What are you doing in my father's room?

100
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,990
I'm thinking

101
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,520
why Master

102
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,010
suddenly died.

103
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,620
He has been paralyzed for a long time.

104
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,880
His health condition worsened long ago.

105
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,490
He suffered an epileptic seizure.

106
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,140
So,

107
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,560
he died.

108
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,590
Is this really the truth?

109
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,280
I heard you went to his room

110
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,420
on the day of Master's death.

111
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,400
Yes!

112
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,970
I killed him.
