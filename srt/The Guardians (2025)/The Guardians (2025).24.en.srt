[The Guardians]

00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,920
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,180
You were out of
the institute all day today.

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,020
Don't tell me

5
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,900
you went to a brothel in broad daylight.

6
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,180
I do have reasons I can't speak of.

7
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,660
I had a craving for opium.

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,260
I slipped back to have a few puffs.

9
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,060
Really?

10
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,220
Yeah.

11
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,820
But that's not what Joseph Lee said.

12
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,130
He said you came back to send a message.

13
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,340
He's slandering me.

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,270
He...

15
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,820
If he says that,

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,260
I could also say
he came to send a message.

17
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,100
How can a blind man send messages?

18
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,500
Sorry, sorry.

19
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,780
Sorry, sorry.

20
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,820
I forgot, I forgot.

21
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,610
He still has Charlie.

22
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,260
Right?

23
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,660
Yes, he has Charlie.

24
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,260
Yes, Charlie.

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,820
I saw Charlie.

26
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,260
It was Charlie who sent the message.

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,540
Do you have proof?

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,380
No.

29
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,380
You don't.

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,260
No evidence.

31
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,380
Without it, I can't help you.

32
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,660
Joseph Lee has no evidence too,

33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,940
yet he can frame me.

34
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,260
Evidence, evidence.

35
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,500
Evidence, evidence.

36
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,660
Let me think.

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,290
Evidence.

38
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,980
Evidence.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,610
Evidence.

40
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,100
Let me think.

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,940
Evidence.

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,010
The radio.

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,220
The radio.

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,060
The radio is the evidence.

45
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,820
Whoever holds the radio
is the Communist spy.

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,660
I know.

47
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,820
Yi Aida.

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,540
Yi Aida and

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,610
her father,

50
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,820
Yi Xiuyuan.

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,380
They are the Communist spies.

52
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,540
That Yi Xiuyuan

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,570
hides in the institute

54
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,660
every day,

55
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,100
with a cold face, ignoring everyone.

56
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,380
So sneaky.

57
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,500
Does he know Yi Aida is dead?

58
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,290
Arrest him, don't let him run!

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,340
I told you before.

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,220
It's not them.

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,290
Not them?

62
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,540
Then it's...

63
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,500
Dong Jinbo and Liu Fangbai?

64
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,380
Although you sent them
on a secret mission,

65
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,380
maybe

66
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,980
they secretly sneaked back to Sanyangli

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,100
and sent messages for the Communists.

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,980
Director Liang.

69
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:15,940
Huan.

70
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,580
I want to expose you.

71
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,980
Shen Wanqing is the Communist spy.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,660
Huan.

73
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,050
What nonsense are you talking about?

74
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,730
In the evening,

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,980
my brother helped him clean his car.

76
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,700
There was blood in his car.

77
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,340
My brother was bewitched by him

78
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,980
and died protecting him.

79
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,020
It's you who killed my brother!

80
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,340
Huan, what's wrong with you?
What's wrong?

81
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,020
Are you out of your mind?

82
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,780
I'm your master.

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,980
Director Liang, don't listen to her.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,340
She must be upset because

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,580
her brother died.

86
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,580
Huan, Huan.

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,700
Don't touch me!

88
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,700
You murderer!

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,170
He stored something

90
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,050
in the Continental Bank.

91
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,460
Li Huan!

92
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,220
The Biography of Loyal Heroes.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,340
I stored it for him.

94
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,540
He thought I was young and naive.

95
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,700
At the time, I thought

96
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,140
what's so special
about keeping an old book?

97
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,220
So I secretly took a look.

98
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,140
Inside, there was

99
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,370
a photo

100
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,340
about the decoded Xige Code.

101
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,020
Director Liang, I really don't know
anything about that book.

102
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,220
I just stole a little bit of
the Xige Code's material.

103
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,780
I wanted to sell it on the black market

104
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,140
and make some money.

105
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,020
That was all Kuomintang stuff.

106
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,020
It wouldn't cause any loss
to the New Government.

107
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,780
As for the New Government's things,

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,050
I haven't taken even the tiniest bit.

109
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,660
Really.

110
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,980
Li Huan,
why would you make up this stuff

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,460
to frame me?

112
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,140
This could get me killed!

113
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,700
Mr. Shen, please.

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,780
Director Liang.

115
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,020
Sit.

116
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,340
Director Liang.

117
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,220
Don't listen to her, Director Liang.

118
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,340
She...she's crazy.

119
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,140
Li Huan, are you sure?

120
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,340
Amu, go to the Continental Bank

121
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,220
and get me that book she mentioned.

122
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,220
Continental Bank
only goes by the account holder's face.

123
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,700
That's fine. Take two more people.

124
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,900
Bring Miss Li along.

125
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,220
Wait.

126
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,020
Since you've already
severed ties with your master,

127
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,140
there's no need to
wear his clothes anymore.

128
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,850
Return it to him.

129
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,900
What you've given me,
I'll return twofold!

130
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,220
Ungrateful traitor!

131
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,460
Everything she said is false.

132
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,540
She's framing me.

133
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,700
Director Liang, Director Liang.

134
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,700
Director Liang.

135
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,340
Director Liang, I didn't.

136
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,340
I really...

137
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,460
Do you drink coffee?

138
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,140
No.

139
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,540
Director Liang.

140
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,780
Who would you sell the material to?

141
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,460
The Communists?

142
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,780
I didn't intend to
sell it to the Communists.

143
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,980
Even if I did sell it to the Communists,

144
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,580
you still can't call me a Communist spy.

145
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,980
As for the Xige Code's matter,

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,490
we can put it aside for now.

147
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,100
If that Biography of Loyal Heroes

148
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,770
is really in that safe,

149
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,220
then you can't escape your identity
as a Communist spy.

150
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,820
Director Liang, I was wrong.

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,220
I was wrong.

152
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,460
I won't dare again.

153
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,220
Director Liang, spare me.

154
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,340
I was really wrong.

155
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,340
Director Liang, I won't dare again.

156
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,700
There won't be a next time.

157
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,940
Director Liang.

158
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,820
Director Liang, please spare me.

159
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,580
Director Liang!

160
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,250
I...

161

[Continental Bank]

162

Huan.

163
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,060
Master.

164
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,580
Thank you, Master.

165
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,180
It's chocolate.

166
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,060
Is it sweet?

167
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,460
Very sweet.

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,580
Thank you, Master.

169
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,340
Huan.

170
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,060
Remember what I told you.

171
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,580
If one day something happens to me,

172
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,580
then tell them about the thing I hid

173
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,770
in the Continental Bank.

174
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,100
It will save your life.

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,580
Do you still remember

176
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,340
what I told you?

177
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,580
You must listen to me.

178
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,980
Put it on.

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,600
[The intelligence is in my coat]

[Li Huan will take it out]

181
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,340
Mr. Shen is right.

182
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,140
Li Huan.

183
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,380
You must live well.

184
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,260
Chaosheng Troupe, find Wu.

185
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,860
Director Liang!

186
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,410
Something's wrong, Director Liang.

187
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,740
Li Huan has escaped.

188
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,260
Director Liang.

189
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,860
Li Huan suddenly attacked us.

190
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,650
The car lost control
and overturned into the river.

191
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,890
Li Huan is a strong swimmer.

192
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,020
Captain Amu
took another man to catch her.

193
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,860
Useless!

194
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,620
Li Huan has escaped?

195
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,340
Director Liang,
what a lousy job you've done.

196
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,170
At this point,

197
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,170
I don't think
we need to say anything more.

198
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,500
Director Liang,
you should know very well

199
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,220
that once Li Huan escapes,

200
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,500
it confirms her identity
as a Communist spy.

201
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,860
What you should be doing now

202
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,500
is requesting the Colonel to authorize
a citywide manhunt for Li Huan

203
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,340
and lift the blockade on Sanyangli,

204
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,340
instead of wasting time

205
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,020
pointlessly on us.

206
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,740
Charlie, I think
we should be able to leave now.

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,860
Yes, Mr. Lee.

208
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,500
Do you think I'm a fool, Joseph Lee?

209
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,620
The Communist spy is among you.

210
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,500
Today I will definitely expose you!

211
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,620
Close the door!

212
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,980
Enough, Liang Jingyuan!

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,620
What on earth are you trying to do?

214
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,980
Earlier, when the radio
was in Yi Aida's hands,

215
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,860
you said she wasn't a spy

216
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,100
just because you believed her.

217
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,980
Now Li Huan has escaped too.

218
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,860
Give me an explanation.

219
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,380
If neither of them are spies,

220
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,290
then who exactly is?

221
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,690
It's you!

222
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,100
Joseph Lee, you're a Communist.

223
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,740
I saw you instructing Charlie
to send the message!

224
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,980
You're the Communist spy.

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,860
I saw it. You're the Communist spy!

226
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,360
[Betray me]

227
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,340
I saw it. You're the Communist spy!

228
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,500
Shen Wanqing, I have no enmity with you.

229
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,220
Why are you framing me?

230
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,740
Director Liang said

231
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,740
the Communist spy is between you and me.

232
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,100
If it's not me, it must be you.

233
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,340
Can you take responsibility
for what you said?

234
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,980
It was you who framed me first.

235
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,500
Even my disciple turned against me.

236
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,500
Not to mention you, a blind man

237
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,500
who came out of nowhere.

238
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,100
Director Liang,
I have something to report.

239
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,500
I know something

240
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,620
that can confirm
Shen Wanqing is a Communist spy.

241
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,500
Today at around six o'clock,

242
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,220
I was resting in bed

243
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,980
when the desk lamp started flickering

244
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,500
for a few minutes and then stopped.

245
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,860
Sanyangli's electrical circuit

246
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,100
has always been in an aging state

247
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,740
and cannot handle
a high-powered radio transmission.

248
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,220
But the one sharing a circuit
with Mr. Lee's

249
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,740
is Shen Wanqing.

250
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,500
So I suspect that at that time,

251
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,020
Shen Wanqing was sending a telegram.

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,020
Nonsense.

253
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,980
What do you mean nonsense?

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,260
Power supply here
has always been problematic.

255
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,500
Unstable circuits are common.

256
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,860
But at exactly six o'clock?

257
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,100
That's too much of a coincidence.

258
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,260
Fine, I also have a report.

259
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,500
Director Liang, before you told me

260
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,980
that the Bai Ye you were looking for
had stomach trouble.

261
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,100
Shen Wanqing has stomach trouble.

262
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,340
He has a serious stomach problem.

263
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,500
He is that Bai Ye.

264
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,980
Earlier, in the lab restroom,

265
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,980
I heard him vomiting.

266
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,140
He must have used some method

267
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,620
to get through the physical examination.

268
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,570
That's right, Mr. Lee.

269
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,620
It was laudanum.

270
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,100
Director Liang, it was opium paste
and strong liquor

271
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,340
mixed into a powerful painkiller.

272
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,620
He must have drunk that

273
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,140
to mask his stomach pains.

274
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,980
Once we brushed past
each other going downstairs,

275
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,620
and he had this pungent smell on him.

276
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,410
It was exactly the smell of laudanum.

277
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,500
It must be him.

278
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,690
Nonsense, both of you.

279
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,860
Mr. Lee, please calm down.

280
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,740
What else do you have to say?

281
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,620
I'll fight you both!

282
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,840
[Pouring out my heart and soul]

283
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,090
Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee...

284
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,700
Director Liang, save Mr. Lee!

285
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,080
[Sacrificing myself
to save others in peril]

286
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,220
Shen Wanqing!

287
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,980
Mr. Lee's about to be strangled,
Director Liang!

288
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,980
Shut up.

289
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,530
What are you trying to do?

290
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,460
Dead.

291
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,220
I want you dead!

292
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,700
Liang Jingyuan.

293
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,900
Help me!

294
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,460
Help me!

295
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,960
[Farewell, comrade]

296
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,420
Help him!

297
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,900
Let me go!

298
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,140
Who told you to fire?

299
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,010
Mr. Liang.

300
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,980
Mr. Liang.

301
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,220
You promised me.

302
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,900
And the result?

303
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,140
The Communist spy Bai Ye
has been executed.

304
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,660
So all I got was a corpse?

305
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,980
Didn't you say that capturing him

306
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,730
would lead us to the CCP
Shanghai underground network?

307
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,700
The Continental Bank has their evidence.

308
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,900
It's already been verified.

309
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,220
The item has already

310
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,900
been taken by his comrades.

311
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,460
Mr. Lee.

312
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,460
You've worked hard tonight.

313
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,620
I heard Mrs. Lee is still
in the hospital.

314
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,860
We will definitely do our best
to treat her.

315
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,420
Mr. Lee.

316
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,460
Let's go to the hospital.

317
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,140
Director Liang.

318
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,140
Mr. Lee.

319
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,860
Calm down.

320
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,900
What are you doing?

321
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,140
Then you should ask

322
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,980
what Director Liang was doing just now!

323
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,900
Liang Jingyuan.

324
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,770
Liang Jingyuan.

325
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,220
You harbor malicious intentions.

326
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,010
You wanted to use the Communist spy
to get rid of me.

327
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,620
I originally thought you were
just dissatisfied with my work.

328
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,620
I didn't expect

329
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,140
you actually wanted to eliminate me.

330
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,980
Colonel, Colonel.

331
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,980
Colonel.

332
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,140
As Grand Duke Tonoji's adopted son,

333
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,900
I was unjustly framed by this man.

334
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,980
I don't know
if this was his personal act

335
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,460
or if someone gave him orders

336
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,220
and granted him such power.

337
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,140
Or perhaps,

338
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,220
this was your intention, Colonel.

339
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,700
This is simply a direct challenge

340
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,980
to the entire Tonoji family

341
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,220
and an immense insult
to the Japanese Imperial family!

342
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,420
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

343
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,460
It's my incompetence

344
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,620
that has allowed the situation
to escalate to this point.

345
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,900
On behalf of the Japanese military,

346
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,620
I apologize to you.

347
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,900
In his current state,

348
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,980
Liang Jingyuan can no longer
handle the institute's affairs.

349
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,860
Mr. Lee,

350
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,010
as the pillar of
the Cryptography Institute,

351
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,220
please take over all the affairs

352
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,980
of the institute.

353
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,620
Mr. Lee.

354
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,460
From now on,

355
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,250
you are the director
of the Cryptography Institute.

356
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,940
Also,

357
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,730
collect all items
related to the Communist spy.

358
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,420
Take them back to
the military police to be sealed.

359
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,220
Send the body to the Army Hospital.

360
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,140
Army Hospital.

361
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,420
Mr. Shen, you went out this afternoon?

362
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,220
Director Lee, don't ask.

363
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,420
It's fine if you won't give me a ride,

364
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,860
but you got angry.

365
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,860
How does it feel here?

366
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,980
Does it hurt here?

367
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,620
Are you alright, Master?

368
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,460
Wipe it clean.

369
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,640
[Pouring out my heart and soul]

370
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,920
[Sacrificing myself
to save others in peril]

371
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,980
Help me!

372
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,850
Order of the 33rd Division of
the Kuomintang

373
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,130
to attack Huangqiao.

374
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,420
They decided to continue
the attack the enemy at dawn today

375
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,500
and occupy Huangqiao.

376
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,090
Corps Commander, Sun Qiren.

377
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,260
Earlier you told me

378
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,700
that after finding him

379
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,530
we would leave.

380
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,660
Now I'm not leaving.

381
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,050
He used his own life

382
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,660
to teach me

383
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,660
the working methods
of a Communist Party member.

384
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,420
I want to know the mission
he had afterwards.

385
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,260
Please allow me to complete it for him.

386
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,740
I want to become Bai Ye.

387
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,460
My master is gone.

388
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,500
My brother is gone too.

389
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,650
Uncle Wu said
he would take me to Yan'an.

390
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,690
Actually, my master

391
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,940
had long foreseen this day.

392
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,860
So he told me in advance

393
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,500
the way for my brother and me to escape.

394
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,820
He told me to expose to Liang Jingyuan

395
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,420
the staff in the Continental Bank
that could prove

396
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,610
he was a Communist spy.

397
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,460
Director Liang.

398
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,380
Huan.

399
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,900
I have something to report.

400
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,020
Shen Wanqing is the Communist spy.

401
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,500
This way,
even if his identity was exposed,

402
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,090
my brother and I could still be safe.

403
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,900
At that time,

404
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,820
I already knew he was prepared to die.

405
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,570
I just didn't expect
that day to come so soon.

406
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,650
I didn't even get to
see them one last time.

407
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,650
That night, Master told me

408
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,860
the intelligence to be delivered
was inside his coat.

409
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,420
I knew I had to

410
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,860
betray my master

411
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,420
to get the information out.

412
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,020
Originally, I thought that
as long as I got out successfully

413
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,090
and retrieved the item
from the Continental Bank,

414
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,860
you and Master
could pin Bai Ye's identity

415
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,020
onto me.

416
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,820
But I didn't expect

417
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,980
I still couldn't get the coat out.

418
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,980
That's why Master
had to take such a tragic course.

419
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,530
I knew you were a good child.

420
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,500
Nothing more needs to be said.

421
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,050
Take good care of your brother.

422
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,170
His head is filled with math.
He's a bit of a fool.

423
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,690
If one day I'm no longer around,

424
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,460
don't be afraid.

425
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,820
Live bravely.

426

Keep your eyes wide open

427
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,050
and help me to see

428
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,090
the new world.

429
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,940
In fact, from the moment
my brother and I

430
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,340
started following Master,

431
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,530
we knew exactly what path he had chosen.

432
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,610
The victory at the Battle of Huangqiao

433
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,690
resolved the biggest issue.

434

The Eighth Route Army
and the New Fourth Army,

435
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,900

436

437
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,090
and most thorough in revolution,
have united.

438
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,050
They could now coordinate much better

439
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,340
and develop further.

440
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,940
It connected
the anti-Japanese democratic bases

in northern Jiangsu

442
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,340
and that in northern China.

443
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,690
Not only did it lay

444
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,130
the foundation for the anti-Japanese
democratic base in northern Jiangsu,

445
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,420
it also gave the revolutionary
forces in central China

446
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,460
their first advantage,

447

I'll join the army, and
walk the path my father walked.

and complete the mission
the Party gave him?

480
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,900
I always thought

481
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,050
the hardest was
stepping from audience to stage.

482
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,980
Now I know

483
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,820
the hardest thing

484
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,690
is going from the spotlight
to the shadows.

00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,050
they did not sacrifice for nothing.

487
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,090
I will be like them,
