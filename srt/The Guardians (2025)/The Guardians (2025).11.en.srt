192
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,770
Didn't I say let's move on?

193
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,530
Why are you still grabbing the gun?

194
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,650
Our wounds aren't enough yet.

195
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,530
Since we're back,

196
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,770
leaving isn't an option now.

197
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,180
We have to finish this.

198
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,770
Honestly,

199
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,650
you should be the one who gets shot.

200
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,420
If I get shot,

201
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,770
it just doesn't fit my story.

202
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,300
I told you, don't move.

203
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,940
If you move, I might miss.

204
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,940
Hold on, wait a second.

205
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,770
Gu Yangshan, just hear me out first.

206
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,420
Maybe we should rethink our plan.

207
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,650
There could be a better way.

208
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,180
Wait.

209
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,940
These two are clueless.

210
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,300
They're actually serious.

211
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,530
Report.

212
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,530
The Joseph Lee you asked about,

213
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,530
Inspector Li said they found him.

214
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,650
Looks like I didn't miss.

215
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,770
This isn't just a scratch.

216
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,530
This is a serious wound.

217
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,420
How does it feel to get shot?

218
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,290
You jerk.

219
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,250
I knew it, you really are one.

220
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,140
Hurry up.

221
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,420
Hand me the gun right now.

222
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,490
I'll shoot you too, jerk.

223
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,220
Have you ever fired a gun?

224
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,420
No, I haven't.

225
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,570
Never?

226
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,180
We'll need to tweak the script.

227
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,460
I took the bullet for you up close,

228
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,660
so let me pull the trigger.

229
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,420
Okay, time's almost up.

230
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,570
The Japanese should be here soon.

231
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,570
Come on, let's head inside.

232
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,980
You two, keep watch outside.

233
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,940
Alright.

234
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,570
Cool.

235
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,940
You two are quite the team.

236
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,940
Perfect.

237
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,700
Nailed the meaning.

238
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:20,940
Pick one.

239
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,570
Lie down.

240
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,570
See you in a bit.

241
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,140
Seriously, man?

242
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,810
You guys hide well.

243
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,330
Don't let me work for nothing.

244
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,940
Hello!

245
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,330
Go inside and check.

246
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,900
Yes.

247
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,180
Coffin? Sounds like coffer.
Means money's coming

248
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,810
and life's booming.

249
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,940
One grenade blast,

250
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,570
ten thousand taels of gold come.

251
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,220
Found him.

252
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,460
Stop!

253
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,180
Don't shoot.

254
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,980
Mr. Takeda,

255
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,220
I found the person you wanted.

256
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,570
To search for Joseph Lee,

257
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,660
I got hurt,

258
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,220
and so many of my guys died,

259
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,940
I need you to give me
a lot more money.

260
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,940
I still have to pay my men
the compensation payment.

261
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,180
Okay?

262
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,420
Charlie.

263
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,460
Charlie's still inside.

264
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,940
Charlie.

265
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,180
There's someone else here.

266
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,330
It has to be Charlie.

267
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,660
It must be Charlie, Mr. Takeda.

268
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,330
Hurry, save him.

269
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,660
Someone, help.

270
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,900
Did you check their IDs?

271
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,140
Yes, all clear.

272
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,570
That Anti-Traitor Squad was amazing.

273
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,810
But this guy,

274
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,660
Joseph Lee's not up to much.

275
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,420
He freaks out over nothing.

276
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,660
We had to focus on saving him.

277
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,020
But as for Charlie,

278
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,740
good man.

279
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,610
A real stand-up guy.

280
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,610
Impressive.

281
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,700
He stays calm no matter what happens.

282
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,660
A good man.

283
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,850
Who found him?

284
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,940
That person is gone.

285
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,260
It was one of my people.

286
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,370
The Anti-Traitor Squad took him out.

287
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,220
Mr. Takeda,

288
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,940
everything's been checked.

289
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,020
One of the bodies
was from the Anti-Traitor Squad.

290
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,740
This coffin shop

291
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,260
might be one of their bases.

292
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,980
It's my fault.

293
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,980
I let a security gap happen here.

294
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,180
Give the money to Inspector Li.

295
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,980
Let him go.

296
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:53,740
Yes.

297
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,980
Good job.

298
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,850
See you next time.

299
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,220
Bye-bye.

300
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,610
What?

301
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,180
Are you kidding me?

302
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,260
That's more like it.

303
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,960
[Army Hospital]

304
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:38,980
Joseph Lee.

305
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,020
Take care, Mr. Lee.

306
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,220
My name's Ding Yi.

307
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,460
I'm an actor.

308
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,460
I've got a role for you.

309
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,660
You're the true lead.

310
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,260
If the Japanese

311
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,220
see through me,

312
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,610
what do I even do then?

313
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,130
We're talking about Takeda.

314
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,850
If he flips out,
he'll even hurt his own guys.

315
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,900
You know how he gets.

316
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,940
Ding Yi!

317
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,130
She's gone!

318
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,850
She's gone, you get it? She's gone!

319
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,420
It's all I ever think about,

320
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,610
he can't pretend to be blind forever.

321
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,740
That's not the same thing.

322
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,370
They've lost their lives already.

323
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,980
Blinding him in one eye
won't change anything.

324
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,850
Who are you?

325
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,700
I'm not Joseph Lee.

326
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,460
I'm not.

327
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,260
I'm not Joseph Lee.

328
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,980
I'm really not.

329
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,220
I'm not Joseph Lee.

330
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,180
I am.

331
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,420
You just said you're not Joseph Lee.

332
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,180
So who are you then?

333
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,850
I even dream about it.

334
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,940
If I run into the Anti-Traitor Squad,

335
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,940
I'll say I'm not Joseph Lee.

336
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,660
Who should I say I am then?

337
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,900
Just say you're a crew hand
at my troupe.

338
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,980
With the way you look right now,

339
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,370
you actually fit the part.

340
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,700
Ms... Ms. Xian.

341
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,940
Ms. Xian.

342
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,460
How could you be so careless?

343
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,980
Look at how badly you hurt yourself.

344
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,610
Ms. Xian, please don't worry.

345
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,220
We're just putting on an act.

346
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,980
We know how to pull our punches.

347
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,130
Nothing happened to the bones.

348
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,610
You two are way too bold.

349
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,850
Do you realize how risky this is now?

350
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,900
Don't think that

351
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,420
just because Grand Duke Tonoji
covers you,

352
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,900
you can do whatever you want.

353
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,980
Takeda only needs one call

354
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,610
and he'll know

355
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,740
if the adopted son is real.

356
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,940
Grand Duke Tonoji is close

357
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,700
to the Japanese Imperial Family.

358
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,130
He once served as Ambassador to the UK.

359
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,900
His position is extremely high.

360
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,740
Back when he studied in Europe,

361
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,940
he was a classmate
of Joseph Lee's father.

362
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,610
The two of them are pretty close.

363
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,370
After Grand Duke Tonoji
returned to Japan,

364
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,050
he invited Joseph Lee's father
over multiple times,

365
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,260
mainly to work on cipher projects.

366
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,020
So if that's the case,

367
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,770
is it also possible

368
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,610
that the two of them

369
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,370
are sworn father and son?

370
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,180
No idea.

371
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,500
Luckily, Grand Duke Tonoji
has no children,

372
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,260
but for the Japanese,

373
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,850
it's common to make sworn children.

374
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,020
So it is possible
that he took Joseph Lee

375
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,460
as his sworn son.

376
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,660
Wait,

377
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,180
but what if

378
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,740
their relationship isn't like that?

379
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,460
You just said Takeda could call anytime.

380
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,900
Wouldn't I be exposed then?

381
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,850
Guess you've just been lucky.

382
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,980
Grand Duke Tonoji

383
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,980
had a stroke not long ago

384
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,770
and he's still unconscious.

385
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,460
But you need to leave Shanghai soon.

386
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,260
Even though your ties
with Grand Duke Tonoji

387
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,420
aren't confirmed,

388
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,290
Dr. Miyamoto will arrive any day now.

389
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,260
You can't possibly hide

390
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,260
that you're not blind.

391
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,180
I've come up with a plan.

392
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,850
I got you a week's time.

393
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:27,850
Hello?

394
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,370
Is this
Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Bureau?

395
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,260
You need to get to the dock right now.

396
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,220
There are so many sick chickens here.

397
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,220
It's really scary.

398
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,460
Aren't you going to help?

399
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,220
Okay, okay. Goodbye.

400
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,460
There's an outbreak at the dock.

401
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,130
Dr. Miyamoto's ship can't dock now.

402
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,460
He can only wait outside the city.

403
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,850
The authorities needs to check
for infections.

404
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,180
It'll take seven days.

405
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,460
During these seven days,

406
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,460
we'll figure out how to get you out.

407
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,220
Seven days.

408
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,130
That's enough.

409
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:09,980
Enough for what?

410
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,980
To get revenge for Hongyu.

411
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,660
Are you out of your mind?

412
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,460
Ms. Xian,

413
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,500
I know Hongyu died
for the resistance against Japan.

414
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,700
So,

415
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,220
are you two

416
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,980
with the Eighth Route Army?

417
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,500
You don't have to say it. I get it.

418
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,530
You can't just tell anyone who you are.

419
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,610
But that's alright.

420
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,290
I'm joining you.

421
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,700
Let's get revenge for Hongyu together.

422
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,420
So, what do you think?

423
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,530
If you're just after revenge,

424
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,980
you're letting Hongyu's sacrifice down.

425
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,020
Hongyu saved you,

426
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,220
not so you'd throw your life away.

427
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,020
But...

428
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,180
But Hongyu was one of your own.

429
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,700
Someone from your side died,
and you don't care?

430
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,740
One of your own lost life,

431
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,900
aren't you going to do something?

432
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,980
Otherwise, my Hongyu died for nothing.

433
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,220
Didn't she just die in vain?

434
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,850
Fighting Japan takes careful planning.

435
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,220
Just charging in with a grenade

436
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,700
won't drive out the Japanese.

437
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,850
If that worked, I'd go first.

438
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,610
But a pointless sacrifice like this

439
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,130
won't make the Japanese leave.

440
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,700
If that's what you believe,

441
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,980
I can't agree with you.

442
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,420
At yesterday's military meeting,

443
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,700
the Navy mocked us
over the cipher leak,

444
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,020
really giving us a hard time about it.

445
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,700
They said people from the Army

446
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,370
shouldn't be running the MSS.

447
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,850
Even if we did make a mistake,

448
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,260
it's not their place to call us out.

449
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,900
If we don't catch whoever leaked this,

450
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,850
everyone will think they can blame us.

451
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,980
Joseph Lee and Xian Biyun
aren't ordinary.

452
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,460
I've always suspected
there's more to them.

453
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,740
What if the problem is
inside the MSS?

454
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,220
This...

455
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,180
If you suspect their background,
investigate.

456
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,850
Find out the truth as soon as possible.

457
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,420
Once Grand Duke Tonoji wakes up

458
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,980
and confirms Joseph Lee
as his adopted son,

459
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,980
even if Joseph did leak the cipher,

460
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,420
there'll be nothing we can do.

461
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,130
You get what I'm saying?

462
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,660
No matter what the truth is,

463
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,370
the one who leaked the cipher

464
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,940
can't be inside the MSS.

465
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,700
Yes.

466
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,610
What do you mean by that?

467
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,690
Mr. Lee is blind. He can't see.

468
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,090
I need to look after him!

469
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,300
Sorry.

470
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,380
At Joseph Lee's place,

471
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,980
our people are taking care of him.

472
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,980
Your people?

473
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,380
Can your people do what I do?

474
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,020
I've always looked after his daily life.

475
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,860
Can your people really handle it?

476
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,530
Listen,

477
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,900
I have to look after Mr. Lee today.

478
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,020
Sorry.

479
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,860
If you keep this up,

480
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,130
I'm going to report you
to Mr. Takeda!

481
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,860
Charlie!

482
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,130
What are you even trying to do?

483
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,530
Charlie, Charlie.

484
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,780
Mr. Lee? Mr. Lee.

485
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,940
Charlie!

486
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,130
Mr. Lee.

487
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,420
Is this what you call
caring for someone?

488
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,980
So this is your idea of help?

489
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,820
Mr. Lee.

490
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,340
Charlie.

491
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,380
Mr. Lee.

492
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,530
Mr. Lee.

493
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,420
Move aside now!

494
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,820
Charlie, is that you? Charlie.

495
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,300
Yeah, it's me.

496
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,980
Is that you, Charlie?

497
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,650
Charlie.

498
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,980
That's great, that's really great.

499
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,500
Mr. Lee.

500
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,380
You're still alive.

501
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,570
That's honestly amazing.

502
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,530
We're at the Army Hospital,
so keep it down.

503
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,530
I'm here to get you out of this.

504
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,460
Work with me on this.

505
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,570
That's perfect.

506
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,900
Mr. Lee, let me help you upstairs.

507
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,050
I thought you were gone.

508
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,980
Sorry about that.

509
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,610
Mr. Gu.

510
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,980
Mr. Gu, you can't leave yet.

511
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,460
You need to go back
to your hospital ward.

512
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,900
Charlie is my eyes.

513
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,300
Why separate us?

514
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,980
Even if I go to the restroom,

515
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,460
he's got to be within
five meters of me.

516
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,250
Right now,

517
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,340
send him back
to my hospital ward.

518
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,730
Do it right away. Now!

519
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,980
Now!

520
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,530
Sir, we won't bother you anymore.

521
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,730
Thank you.

522
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,820
We barely got through last night.

523
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,460
But Dr. Miyamoto will still show up.

524
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,250
Seven days.

525
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,250
Will these injuries of mine

526
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,300
heal all the way in seven days?

527
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,730
Seven days for what?

528
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,250
Ms. Xian just told me,

529
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,050
Dr. Miyamoto was supposed
to reach Shanghai soon,

530
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,780
but she used avian influenza

531
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,730
to buy us seven days.

532
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,460
I know what you're thinking.

533
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,860
But no matter what,

534
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,340
before Dr. Miyamoto arrives,

535
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,250
I have to get you out of here.

536
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,500
Either way,

537
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,340
in these seven days,

538
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,530
I have to take out Takeda.

539
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,570
Ding Yi, I want to as well.

540
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,130
I want to stop every invader here.

541
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,460
But look at things now,

542
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,650
we can't even get close to them.

543
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,530
How do we take him out?

544
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,090
Then I'll poison myself blind.

545
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,250
I'll finish
the Sword Thrust Operation for you.

546
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,090
You help me take down Takeda.

547
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,340
Let's team up.

548
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,980
You're being ridiculous.

549
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,900
Your top priority is
leaving here.

550
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,900
Keep yourself safe first.

551
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,780
If you're safe, then you get
a chance for revenge.

552
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,650
I've already helped you so much.

553
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,050
Can't you help me just this once?

554
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,940
No, I can't.

555
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,820
If you don't, I'll give you up.

556
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,650
Excuse me?

557
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,730
Who's this?

558
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,530
Mr. Lee, it's Kobayashi.

559
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,650
What's he here for?

560
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,340
Probably to tell you
the check got delayed.

561
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,570
Captain Kobayashi.

562
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,940
Is that Captain Kobayashi?

563
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,500
Mr. Lee.

564
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,460
Is Dr. Miyamoto here too?

565
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,730
I've waited so long for you.

566
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,610
My eyesight...

567
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,780
I finally have hope for my eyes.

568
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,780
Mr. Lee, you've got the wrong person.

569
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,460
Where is Dr. Miyamoto?

570
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,650
He hasn't arrived yet.

571
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,500
What?

572
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,940
But Captain Kobayashi said

573
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,300
Dr. Miyamoto was supposed to come today.

574
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,530
Dr. Miyamoto's ship

575
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,570
can't dock for now.

576
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,940
Why's that?

577
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,980
Mr. Lee,

578
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,340
we just got word about it.

579
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,300
Sorry to have to tell you.

580
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,130
There's a suspected avian influenza
at the dock.

581
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,130
To be on the safe side,

582
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,860
Dr. Miyamoto will have to
stay on the ship.

583
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,900
To be on the safe side,

584
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,530
Dr. Miyamoto has to stay on the ship.

585
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,130
Avian influenza?

586
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,570
So, how much longer will this last?

587
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,090
According to the rules,

588
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,300
it's seven days.

589
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,980
Seven days?

590
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,780
Are you guys just brushing me off?

591
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,050
You told me before
that Dr. Miyamoto was busy.

592
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,500
And I let it slide.

593
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,530
But he's here now,

594
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,340
why won't you let him meet me?

595
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,340
Tell me,

596
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,130
do you have any other conditions?

597
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,340
Mr. Lee, please don't be upset.

598
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,130
We're not breaking our word.

599
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,460
There really is an outbreak
at the dock.

600
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,460
Now we suspect that

601
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,500
someone's trying to mess
with our army.

602
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,130
Mr. Takeda has handled it already.

603
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,980
The Navy has joined the investigation.

604
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,900
I think we'll get results soon.

605
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,780
Mr. Takeda is already on it.

606
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,820
Also, the Navy...

607
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,610
Anyway,

608
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,460
Mr. Lee, please wait patiently.

609
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,500
So, Mr. Lee, please be patient.

610
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:11,980
Tomorrow,

611
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,340
we'll bring Dr. Miyamoto back.

612
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,780
Tomorrow?

613
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,340
Well, I'll leave you to it.

614
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,420
Why did it suddenly move to tomorrow?

615
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,900
That can't be.

616
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,570
Why not?

617
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,050
I'm talking to you.

618
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,050
The Japanese Army and Navy

619
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,460
have always had strategic conflicts.

620
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,780
But Takeda is just

621
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,050
a manager at the MSS.

622
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,940
How can he mobilize the Navy?

623
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,980
What do you mean?

624
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,980
Kobayashi just slipped up.

625
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,460
He said Takeda moved the Navy.

626
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,340
While it was translated,

627
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,900
he suddenly realized it

628
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,460
and stopped right away.

629
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,780
He didn't want us to know.

630
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,050
We don't have time to worry now.

631
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,340
You need to tell Ms. Xian fast.

632
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,940
The eye check is moved up to tomorrow.

633
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,050
We have to find a way through this.

634
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,340
I can't blow my cover yet.

635
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,050
Navy...

636
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:24,860
[Shanghai Japan Naval Club]

637
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,660
I've sent someone

638
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,250
to talk to the Port Office

639
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,460
of the Epidemic Prevention Bureau.

640
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,090
I can't promise about tomorrow.

641
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,780
But no later than the day after,

642
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,570
we'll definitely get through.

643
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,610
Thank you, brother.

644
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,980
Idiot.

645
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,570
I've already told you.

646
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,820
Don't call me that out here.

647
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,530
Sorry.

648
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,610
Colonel Kumamoto.

649
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,460
Please, sit down.

650
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,500
Here's the medical file
you asked for.

651
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,040
I got help from intelligence personnel

652
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,610
stationed in the UK.

653
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,820
That's how I managed to get it.

654
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,530
It was risky enough already.

655
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,530
For things like this from now on,

656
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,500
don't come to me again.

657
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,460
Sorry for the trouble.

658
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,460
If you do this again,

659
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,530
you'll be sent home right away.

660
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,900
You really don't think things through.

661
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,090
Don't drag the Kumamoto Family
into this.

662
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,090
