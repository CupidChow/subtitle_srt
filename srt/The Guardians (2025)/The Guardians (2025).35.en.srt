00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,660
a monologue excerpt

8
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,330
from Romeo and Juliet.

9
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,260
Romeo, why must you be Romeo?

10
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,730
A rose, even by another name,

11
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,850
would still smell as sweet.

12
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,450
It's only your family name
that I despise.

13
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,340
Without Montague, you'd still be you.

14
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,220
What kind of line delivery is that?

15
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,540
So over the top.

16
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,820
Slow down.

17
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,980
Comrade Ding Yi,

18
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,540
your partner, Mr. Gu Yangshan,

19
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,540
passed away

20
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,100
at Taipei Veterans General Hospital
in 1973.

21
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,380
As of today,

22
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,100
the thirty-year confidentiality period
has ended.

23
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,540
Before his final moments,

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,540
his last instruction

25
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,540
was to deliver this

26
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,820
into your hands.

27
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,220
The geese flying south,

28
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,100
at last,

29
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,660
have returned north.

30
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,930
Mr. Cao.

31
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,340
When the Communist Luo Han

32
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,730
was meeting his handler, Xian Biyun,

33
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,580
I caught them

34
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,100
and took them both down.

35
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,660
They fell from the rooftop.

36
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,780
Mr. Cao.

37
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,100
Sit down, have a seat.

38
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,810
Tell me,

39
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,810
what happened?

40
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,220
Mr. Cao.

41
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,540
No matter how we calculated,

42
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,340
we never thought Luo Han
was a Communist.

43
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,900
Last night, while I was monitoring,

44
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,540
I picked up signals
from a mysterious radio.

45
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,460
So I checked with someone
from the Cipher Division.

46
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,340
Turns out it was a new radio

47
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,100
Deputy Chief Luo applied for days ago.

48
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,900
Did you know about that?

49
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,020
He claimed it was
for some secret mission.

50
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,460
A brand new radio?

51
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,540
Well,

52
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,900
so you didn't know either.

53
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,580
Tell me this,

54
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,100
with radios in the station unused,

55
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,580
he applied for a new one instead

56
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,540
and sent out his own private codes.

57
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,700
If that's not colluding with the enemy,
what is?

58
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,900
He didn't file a backup
with the Confidential Office.

59
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,020
Well, he did file one,

60
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,810
but it was a fake record.

61
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,540
I noticed that after sending a telegram,

62
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,340
he called the Confidential Office.

63
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,660
I forcibly took

64
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,460
this codebook from his hands.

65
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,020
But when I compared it with the message,

66
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,100
not a single word matched.

67
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,250
Mr. Cao,

68
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,100
falsifying intelligence work

69
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,340
is an act of treachery.

70
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,460
So I want to ask you,

71
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,700
based on this alone,

72
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,140
do I have the right to take him out?

73
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,340
How could that be possible?

74
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,580
What about the people he brought?

75
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,580
They're all dead.

76
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,340
At first, I thought

77
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,100
it was just the two of them
meeting in secret,

78
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,580
but after I got into
a shootout with them,

79
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,140
his accomplices came charging out.

80
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,660
This is my gun.

81
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,900
Out of bullets.

82
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,930
This is

83
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,900
taken from his remaining men.

84
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,900
Also used up.

85
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,660
I got lucky.

86
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,220
I made it out alive.

87
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,810
The rest are gone.

88
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,810
All of them are gone.

89
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,580
Deputy Chief Luo is a Communist,

90
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,850
but he's taken down
so many other Communists.

91
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,890
He...

92
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,530
There's something you don't know.

93
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,460
Even though he killed Communists,

94
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,340
he's also once betrayed us.

95
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,770
Years ago,

96
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,010
he was taken to Yuyin Pavilion
by Sasaki.

97
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,220
When he was imprisoned there,

98
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,770
he sold me out.

99
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,180
Report.

100
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,610
Checked and verified.

101
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,980
The bullet
in the female Communist's chest

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,610
was indeed from Director Gu's gun.

103
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,770
It was Director Gu who killed her.

104
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,650
You sure?

105
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,250
No mistake about it.

106
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,250
Deputy Chief Luo made it clear,

107
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,130
every bullet in Director Gu's gun

108
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,370
must be specially marked.

109
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,250
Everyone in that building died
from those bullets,

110
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,530
including Xian Biyun.

111
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,530
I had already marked his issued bullets

112
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,180
back at the Bureau.

113
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,610
Even if you kill me,

114
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,010
Gu Yangshan won't escape the blame.

115
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,700
Wait... hold on.

116
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,530
What did you just say?

117
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,180
My bullets were marked?

118
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,250
Show me.

119
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,650
The two of us

120
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,010
will both die under Gu Yangshan's gun.

121
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,370
What are you doing, Xian Biyun?

122
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,420
Mr. Cao.

123
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,130
The Party-State still doesn't trust me.

124
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,370
Yangshan.

125
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,130
It's not that we don't trust you.

126
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,370
Deputy Chief Luo is a Communist.

127
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,010
No one really believes it.

128
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,300
The Communist Party
is about to enter the city.

129
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,370
And now, at this moment,

130
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,890
he lands me in such a huge mess.

131
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,730
What terrible timing.

132
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,850
What terrible timing.

133
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:44,770
Yangshan.

134
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,370
There are still many matters
at the Bureau.

135
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,770
I need to wrap them up.

136
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,530
As for Deputy Chief Luo's betrayal,

137
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,250
we'll investigate later.

138
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:54,890
Alright.

139
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,940
Fall back.

140
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,060
Yangshan, once the scene is settled,

141
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,130
get back here right now.

142
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,130
Pull the team back.

143
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,650
Alright.

144
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,530
They've all left.

145
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,610
Where's the codebook?

146
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,370
The one I got was a fake.

147
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,060
The real one must still be with Luo Han.

148
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,770
I'll find it.

149
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,250
Alright.

150
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,220
Go get it, now.

151
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,890
I'll head back right away.

152
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,650
I'll send it to you once I get it.

153
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,770
Then you get ready to send the message.

154
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,650
Got it.

155
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,250
I'll go prepare right now.

156
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,490
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,890
We have to find that codebook.

158
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,370
We can't let Biyun's sacrifice
be for nothing.

159
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,650
I swear on my life.

160
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,580
I swear I'll finish my mission.

161
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,890
Don't swear on your life.

162
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,420
You can't die.

163
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,650

00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,130
fear no sacrifice.

190
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,250
Fear no sacrifice.

191
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,820
For the cause of Communism.

192
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,130
For the cause of Communism.

193
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,250
For the cause of Communism,

194
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,340
I will fight till the very end.

195
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,090
Mr. Cao.

196
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,730
All of Luo's files have been cleared,

197
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,810
but the codebook is missing.

198
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,900
I can't worry about that now.

199
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,490
The Public Security Headquarters lost.

200
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,570
The 51st Army turned against us.

201
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,620
The Communist Forces
have reached the Suzhou River.

202
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,140
Listen.

203
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,810
Right now, at the airport,

204
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,380
there's one last plane
leaving for China Taiwan.

205
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,570
I've got two seats reserved on it.

206
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,810
If we don't go now, it'll be too late.

207
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,330
I've devoted my whole life
to the Party-State.

208
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,290
I thought it'd take care of me
in my old age.

209
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,140
Never imagined

210
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,290
I'd be the one to see its last days.

211
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,250
But Mr. Cao,

212
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,810
Director Mao personally arranged

213
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,570
remarkable people
for the scorched earth tactic.

214
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,050
One day,

215
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,570
if the Party-State retakes the mainland,

216
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,050
they'll be outstanding
intelligence agents.

217
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,530
Enough.

218
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,380
But…

219
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,380
Luo has betrayed us.

220
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,900
He's surely handed that list
to the Communist Party.

221
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,010
If we don't have the battle cipher,

222
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,380
we can't get in touch with them.

223
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,810
Then they'll all be wiped out.

224
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,290
Mr. Cao.

225
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,050
What if everyone's gone by then?

226
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,730
I just remembered something.

227
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,490
Luo had a box loaded on the plane early.

228
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,660
Let's look for it there.

229
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,140
Come on, let's move!

230
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,380
Why are you spacing out?

231
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,900
The headlights are out.

232
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,380
Forget the headlights.

233
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,380
Just go, now.

234
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,900
Hurry up, everybody.

235
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,620
Last five minutes!

236
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,010
Hurry up.

237
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,770
I can't wait anymore.

238
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,770
Hurry up.

239
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,140
Watch it.

240
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,090
That's Blue-and-White Porcelain.

241
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,530
All of Luo Han's luggage is here.

242
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,530
Yeah, it's all here.

243
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,730
Go check for me again.

244
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,770
There's really nothing else.

245
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,770
Find it!

246
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,090
Alright.

247
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,330
Yangshan, what else are you looking for?

248
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,900
The plane's about to take off.

249
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,530
If we don't leave now, we'll miss it.

250
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,810
The Communist Forces
will be here any minute.

251
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,660
I still have a truck of belongings
not yet loaded.

252
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,180
Inside there's something
from the Ming Dynasty.

253
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,810
"Picture of the Heavenly Maiden
Scattering Flowers".

254
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,090
I barely snatched it from a traitor.

255
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,730
It's worth a fortune.

256
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,530
I'm willing to
leave the painting behind.

257
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,090
And you're still hunting for a codebook?

258
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,330
You've lost your mind.

259
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,290
Mr. Cao,

260
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,570
without that codebook,
when we get to China Taiwan,

261
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,730
how do we explain this to Director Mao?

262
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,530
Our Shanghai BIS
can't explain this away!

263
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,530
What's more important,
explaining or staying alive?

264
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,770
Talk!

265
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,370
There are a lot of enemy troops inside.

266
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,050
And U.S. Military pilots too.

267
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,940
Why don't we wait a little longer?

268
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,770
Our main force will be here any minute.

269
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,610
No way.

270
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,660
I have to go in.

271
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,570
Reporting, Director Gu.

272
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,130
We just checked at the airport.

273
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,610
It seems Luo had two suitcases,

274
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,940
both filled with important documents.

275
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,290
They were on the previous flight.

276
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,570
That plane already left
for China Taiwan.

277
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:34,850
What did you just say?

278
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,420
Isn't that fate?

279
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,660
Yangshan.

280
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,610
The codebook got there ahead of us.

281
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,420
Hurry, let's go.

282
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,460
Move it!

283
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,850
Come on, go now.

284
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,460
We'll be too late if we don't leave.

285
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,610
Another truck's here.

286
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,130
My painting.

287
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,460
Come help carry this.

288
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,900
Come on, help with these things.

289
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,370
I didn't find it.

290
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,130
It went to China Taiwan
on the last flight.

291
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,420
I have to head to China Taiwan.

292
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,770
Wait for my telegram.

293
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,050
Don't let Comrade Biyun down.

294
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,610
Gu Yangshan.

295
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,290
Don't forget.

296
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,610
You still have to be a teacher

297
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,530
and go to Peiping to find Miss Meng.

298
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,850
You still have to live a new life
in the sunshine.

299
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,420
Look.

300
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,290
This is the land of our hometown.

301
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,180
This is the crimson blood
of an old friend.

302
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,460
Now it's my turn to protect it.

303
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,370
So, Ding Yi,

304
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,050
I need you to do something for me.

305
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,770
Please keep Miss Meng safe

306
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,610
and protect my homeland

307
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,130
and...

308
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,850
the new life under the sunshine.

309
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,330
On the day China Taiwan is freed,

310
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,850
put this on.

311
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,570
No matter how much you change,

312
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,850
I'll still recognize you.

313
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,530
Alright.

314
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,370
Comrade Ding Yi,

315
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,130
see you in the new China.

316
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,180
See you in the new China.

317
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,090
Luo Han's belongings.

318
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,770
Mr. Cao,

319
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,900
with this,

320
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,850
our Bureau can report back
to Director Mao.

321
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,660
Yangshan.

322
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,290
Can you tell me

323
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,940
what your mission was
after you got to China Taiwan?

324
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,090
Playing dumb.

325
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,420
Still pretending with me.

326
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,370
I've actually known for a while.

327
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,900
Xian Biyun and Luo Han
killed each other, right?

328
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,180
You tried to save them
but didn't make it in time.

329
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,530
Am I right?

330
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,610
Mr. Cao, if you don't have proof,

331
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,050
you really shouldn't say that.

332
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,770
This...

333
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,180
This could cost me my life.

334
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,330
Maybe I don't know much,

335
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,130
but...

336
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,130
I'm pretty confident in reading people.

337
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,530
Luo Han has killed so many Communists,

338
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,530
and yet the Communist Party went crazy,

339
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,660
even wanting to recruit him?

340
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,290
That doesn't mean
I had anything to do with it.

341
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,610
Yangshan.

342
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,530
Look, even though
the Ministry of National Defense

343
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,940
keeps shouting about counterattacking.

344
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,530
Without support from the US,

345
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,660
the Chairman couldn't even
hold Guangzhou.

346
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,420
If you ask me,

347
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,180
a wise man knows when to adapt.

348
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,850
Once the plane lands,

349
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,330
I'll head straight to Director Mao

350
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,330
and back up the claim
that Luo betrayed us.

351
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,610
If China Taiwan can't be held either,

352
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,020
you vouch for me

353
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,180
that I contributed to the liberation.

354
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,810
What do you say?

355
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,180
Mr. Cao.

356
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:49,420
I've spent these years studying ciphers.

357
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,530
If I really had that kind of skill,

358
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,180
I'd say,

359
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,530
you don't put me on a pedestal.

360
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,570
Yangshan.

361
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,180
I knew it since you were in school.

362
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,130
You've always been a smart kid.

363
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,420
After we get to China Taiwan,

364
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,770
we'll be starting over.

365
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,610
We have to look out for each other.

366
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,560
♪Flames dancing alone♪

367
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,250
♪Broken candle wax♪

368
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,100
What are you staring at?

369
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,820
You dropped something?

370
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,100
Sometimes I think,

371
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,620
if we were really family,

372
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,580
that would be amazing.

373
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,370
When the War of Resistance is over,

374
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,010
let's find a place
with mountains and rivers.

375
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,010
You can bring Miss Meng too.

376
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,900
We could be neighbors.

377
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,340
If you run out of oil, borrow from me.

378
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,900
If I run out of flour,
I'll get it from you.

379
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,130
And when we both have kids,

380
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,050
we can arrange for them
to be childhood sweethearts.

381
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,130
If they're all girls or all boys,
it's fine.

382
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,770
We'll just have them sworn in
as best friends.

383
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,660
It's such a joyful day today.

384
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,260
Let's take a picture together
as a keepsake.

00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,700
Did you take on a side job?

you're even late for the curtain call.

let me have a shot, okay?

469
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,460
Ding Yi,

470
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,970
why add extra lines for yourself again?

471
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,740
Though this time,
it was actually pretty good.

472
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,610
