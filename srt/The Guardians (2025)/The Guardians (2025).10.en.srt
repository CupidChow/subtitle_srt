But I've been behind the scenes
for many years,

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,740
only wanting to focus on
managing my troupe.

6
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,100
That's why Ms. Xian's comeback work

7
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,660
would attract even more attention.

8
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,460
Everyone, let's take a group photo.

9
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,660

would you hesitate?

So, Mr. Takeda,

65
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,340
didn't I handle this beautifully?

66
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,460
You see,

67
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,340
everything you instructed me to do
was done properly.

68
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,460
Can we follow what we agreed before?

00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,250

At present,

71
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,340
there's no suitable position
here for Mr. Liang.

72
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,340
If there's a vacancy, I'll let you know.

00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,900
Rumors of Liang
defecting to Chairman Wang

76
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,900
have already spread.

77

He's currently in Suzhou.

78
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,780
If the Chongqing Bureau finds out,

79
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,340
and you don't arrange a job for him,

80
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,700
Liang will die in Suzhou.

81
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,900
That will depend on
Mr. Liang's own fate.

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,340
Ms. Xian.

83
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,460
There's one more thing I'd like to ask.

84
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,340
How exactly was the code leaked?

85
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,900
I'm afraid only the insiders of MSS

86
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,020
know how this code was designed.

87
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,660
You're just trying to find fish

88
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,780
in a tree, aren't you?

89
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,900
What I'm curious about is

90
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,700
how did the British

91
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,140
find out the code was leaked?

92
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,780
My relationship with the British

93
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,700
is not so good that they'd tell me
the source of their intelligence

94
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,140
in full detail.

95
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,580
Ms. Xian.

96
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,700

101
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,900
They all show you respect.

102
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,140
I suppose

103
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,220
you must have some extraordinary skills.

104
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,460
Today, you took
the initiative to meet me.

105
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,900
You must have come prepared.

106
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,900
You

107
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,580
wouldn't casually reveal

108
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,140
unverified intelligence,

109
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,140
would you?

110
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,580
Wait a moment.

111
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,340
Perhaps you could help us analyze

112
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,540
where exactly the British

113
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,460
got their information from.

115

If you truly wish to investigate,

116
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,380
perhaps you should start from here.

117
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,740
That's all I have to say.

118
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,140
I will carefully read the script.

119
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,140

Biyun, over here.

122
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,890
I treated you as a friend.

123
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,650
What do you mean by this?

124
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,410
Aren't you just acting in one more play?

125
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,890
Why so upset?

126
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,140
What do you take me for?

Xian Biyun!

128
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,650
Now that you have the Japanese
as your backers,

129
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,890
what losses could you possibly suffer?

130
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,620
Today a communist was found
in your troupe.

131
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,340
It's such a serious matter.

132
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,100
If Mr. Takeda hadn't been there,

133
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,620
would you have gotten away so easily?

134
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,220
You're determined
to side with the Japanese?

135
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,380
Right now, I can only side with them.

136
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,500
Good. Very good.

137
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,290
You and Liang can
side with them together.

138
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,890
So it's fine for you to work
with the new government,

139
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,380
but Liang isn't allowed?

140
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,980
All because when he was young,

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,380
he took part in student activities
organized by the communists.

142
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,890
Those jerks in the BIS
give him a hard time every day,

143
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,380
calling him a traitor who defected.

144
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,140
In his whole life, Liang

145
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,740
has never suffered such humiliation.

146
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,530
Don't blame me

147
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,570
about today's matter.

148
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,500
Once I act as a go-between for you
and the new government

149
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,220
and make you the goodwill ambassador,

150
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,690
he promised me

151
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,100
that he'll transfer Liang

152
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,380
back to Shanghai from Suzhou.

153
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,380
But now,

154
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,260
that old jerk has gone back on his word.

155
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,890
He told me

156
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,500
there's no vacancy

157
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,740
and spread rumors about Liang
defecting to Wang.

158
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,740
If the Chongqing Bureau finds out,

159
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,260

haven't you?

163
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,890
You can't stand by and watch him die.

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,740
I was wrong, Biyun.

Please help me, okay?

167
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,740
I was wrong.

Biyun.

169
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,220
Enough.

170
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,460
What's the use of saying this now?

171
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,620
Help us.

172
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,020
Didn't Takeda say

173
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,140
that with no vacancy,

174
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,650
Liang can't return?

175
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,220
If someone is no longer around,

176
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,020
there will be a vacancy.

177
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,290

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,460
Don't ask anything.

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,740
Don't say anything.

183
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,770
Understood.

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,260
I can't take this.

00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,500
Listen to me, take it.

186
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,740
It's a long, dangerous trip.

187
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,740
Let's keep things separate.

188
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,380

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,740
Don't worry.

192
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,140
I'll make sure he arrives safely.

193
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,260
What are you doing?

194
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,380
Stay back!

195
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,740
You're going to hand me over
to the BIS, aren't you?

196
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,860
We're at...

197
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,260
Stay back.

198
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,500
We're at the docks now.

199
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,980
I'm here to get you out.

200
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,980
I'm sending you to China Hong Kong.

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,380
Stop lying to me!

202
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,380
Tell me,

203
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,860
who is that man?

204
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,860
He's the boatman. He's one of us.

205
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,500
Tonight, you'll leave on his boat.

206
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,500
Yeah, you're all "one of us".

207
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,740
None of you are good people!

208
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,500
Dashun traded me for money,

209
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,220
and you're trading me for your future.

210
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,980
You're definitely taking me back

211
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,980
to hand me over to your teacher,

212
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,220
so he can blind me

213
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,380
to complete that so-called

214
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,500
Sword Thrust Operation.

215
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,620
Isn't this what you're afraid of?

216
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,220
If I really wanted to blind you,

217
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,260
could you still be seeing things

218
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,860
when you just opened your eyes?

219
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,260
Come on.

220
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,380
Look.

221
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,380
We truly are at the docks.

222
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,220
Behind that building

223
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,220
is the boat you'll be on tonight.

224
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,500
I promised you.

225
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,290
I will keep my word.

226
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,980
No.

227
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,570
I can't go yet.

228
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,530
We don't know if Ms. Xian

229
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,860
and the troupe members
are alive or dead.

230
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,500
I can't abandon them.

231
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,860
Gu Yangshan,

232
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,220
I want to stay for revenge.

233
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,260
I can't let Hongyu die in vain.

234
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,460
I want to stay by the Japanese

235
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,380
and kill them all!

236
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,380
Calm down. Calm down.

237
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,220
Listen to me, okay?

238
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,530
I know you want revenge.

239
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,140
But think about it.

240
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,980
If you go back now, what can you do?

241
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,500
You can't do anything.

242
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,980
And didn't we agree

243
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,380
you'd go to China Hong Kong

244
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,220
to meet with your mother?

245
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,740
Understand?

246
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,740
I'm not going.

247
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,740
I want revenge.
I want to kill all the Japanese!

248
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,380
You...

249
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,980
Is it here?

250
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,740
Yes.

251
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,140
Our people are watching over there.

252
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,980
Lead the way.

253
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,220
Capture them alive.

254
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,220
Come.

255
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,500
Go.

256
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,380
Go.

257
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,340
Help me!

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,980
Go!

259
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,220
Hurry!

260
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,220
Go, go!

261
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,980
Down here!

262
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:23,940
Go.

263
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,330
Go.

264
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,020
You go first!

265
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,500
Let's go together!

266
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,260
Now!

267
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,900
I'm not leaving!

268
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,740
Go!

269
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,330
Move quickly!

270
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,980
Go!

271
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,530
We should go together.

272
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,740
Are you okay?

273
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,980
Get down, quickly!

274
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,610
Run! Someone's coming!

275
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,420
I'll cover you! Go!

276
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,330
We go together!

277
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,660
This way, quickly!

278
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,570
Go!

279
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,260
Hurry!

280
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,500
Go.

281
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,260
Get on the boat!

282
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,980
Go!

283
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,420
On the boat!

284
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,090
Go!

285
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,020
On the boat!

286
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,180
I'm not going!

287
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,700
Go!

288
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,420
Gu Yangshan!

289
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:47,900
Get on the boat!

290
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,020
I'm not going!

291
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,810
Let go of me!

292
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,570
Get on the boat first!

293
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,500
Gu Yangshan!

294
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,770
Gu Yangshan!

295
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,290
Get on the boat!

296
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,260
Gu Yangshan!

297
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,810
Get on the boat!

298
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,290
Get on first!

299
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,570
Quick!

300
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,460
Why aren't you going?

301
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,700
We should go together!

302
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,500
Go, together!

303
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,940
Gu Yangshan, come up quick! Hurry!

304
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,180
You go first.

305
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,020
There are too many of them.

306
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,420
If we go together, it's suicide.

307
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,940
I'll find you in China Hong Kong later.

308
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,330
No!

309
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,940
Hongyu died before me

310
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,180
so I could leave.

311
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,740
If you don't come, I won't go.

312
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,660
At worst, we die together!

313
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,500
Sir, come with us.

314
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,020
Li, go now!

315
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,460
Get him out of here, protect him well!

316
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,940
If you don't go, I'll shoot!

317
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,810
Go!

318
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,610
Go!

319
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,770
Gu Yangshan!

320
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,740
Hurry, go!

321
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,700
Gu Yangshan!

322
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,810
I lied to you about Baimahu.

323
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,090
Nothing happened to your mother.

324
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,460
I had someone print the newspapers

325
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,330
and record the broadcast.

326
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,020
I'm just a liar.

327
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,020
It is reported that

328
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,900
recently the Japanese army

329
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,770
has launched fierce offensives
in Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui.

330
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,940
Three prongs of their forces
are about to encircle Baimahu.

331
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,290
Baimahu.

332
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,220
Baimahu is in peril.

333
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,090
That's why the priority now

334
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,570
is to replace the enemy's
operational code.

335
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,940
Only then can we

336
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,610
learn their battle plan

337
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,850
and turn things around.

338
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,770
Then you'd be able to save your mother.

339
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,740
I'm not a good man!

340
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,460
Ding Yi!

341
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,330
Live well in China Hong Kong!

342
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,180
I'm sorry!

343
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,570
I surrender.

344
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,810
You jerk!

345
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,460
Quick, surround him!

346
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,420
No, no, no.

347
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,940
Don't shoot.

348
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,570
The man you want has already escaped.

349
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,810
Move aside!

350
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,330
Move!

351
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,330
Where is he?

352
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,420
Where is he?

353
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,700
Gone.

354
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,810
You made me work for nothing.

355
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,330
Li Boyao, this time,

356
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,180
you will regret it.

357
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,460
Trying to play me?

358
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,020
You think I wouldn't dare kill you?

359
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,600
Screw you.

360
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,810
Shoot then.

361
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,660
Do you dare?

362
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,050
You've gotten so arrogant.

363
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,460
Stop!

364
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,660
Let him go.

365
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,530
If you want money, trade me for it.

366
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,570
Right now, in Shanghai,

367
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,570
no one is worth more than me.

368
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,220
Come here.

369
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,090
My money.

370
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,330
So tell me.

371
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,940
What did you come to talk to me about?

372
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,940
I want to talk business with you.

373
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,090
We're going to the military police,

374
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,370
or your brother-in-law's place?

375
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,330
What the Japanese want

376
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,940
is their good friend,

377
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,460
the code expert Joseph Lee.

378
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,130
Look at him now.

379
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,940
This little punk in this state.

380
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,540
Like half-dead.

381
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,330

Right.

570
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,900
Ms. Xian, if there's trouble,
we'll bear it together.

571
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,130
Exactly.

572
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,690
Yes.

573
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,460
Bear it together?

574
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,060
Who's bearing it together with you?

575
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,420
If it wasn't for you,

576
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,380
would I have so much trouble?

577
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,940
From now on, be careful.

578
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,500
Don't be like Zhu Hongyu.

579
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,130
Hongyu, she...

580
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,060
I know you've been saying
I've defected.

581
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,340
So what if I have?

582
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,860
How can you live if you don't?

583
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,690
Without me,

584
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,060
you'd probably already be

585
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,650
shot dead in the streets.

586
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,380
Now that the British are gone,

587
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,170
shouldn't we hurry
to get close to the Japanese

588
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,940
to gain a foothold in the Concession?

589
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,060
What are we?

590
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,380
We're just actors.

591
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,170
An actor's duty is to perform.

592
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,940
The play is fake,

593
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,060
but the ticket money is real.

594
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,250
What does being a traitor or not

595
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,380
have to do with us?

596
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,170
They fight their war,

597
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,860
and we perform our play.

598
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,940
Even virtuous women don't
uphold chastity arches anymore.

599
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,380
Live your lives well when you still can.

600
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,860
Don't be ungrateful.

601
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,210
If Chaosheng Troupe

602
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,460
will have to serve the Japanese,

603
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,610
I'd rather starve to death

604
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,060
than take that job.

605
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,340
Right!

606
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,650
I won't take it either!

607
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,540
You think without you,

608
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,610
Chaosheng Troupe will collapse?

609
00:36:59,360 --> 00:36:59,900
The show can go on

610
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,540
without anyone.

611
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,730
Just remember,

612
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,020
get out if you don't want to stay!

613
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,060
I won't dock your wages by a cent.

614
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,730
Fine.

615
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,130
No wonder before she was all

616
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,730
flirtatious with that Japanese manager.

617
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,460
I knew something was off.

618
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,540
So this is your true face.

619
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,540
We've really been blind

620
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,540
to follow her so long.

621
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,060
Watch your mouth.

622
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,130
She's just a darn traitor!

623
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:27,730
Say that again.

624
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,540
Traitor!

625
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,460
Say that again!

626
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,210
So what if I do?

627
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,940
She's a traitor!

628
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,820
What did you say?

629
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,540
Traitor!

630
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,570
If anyone dares cause trouble again,

631
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,340
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

632
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,090
Get out, all of you!

633
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,130
Mulan Joins the Army.

634
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,170
That show is over!

635
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,340
Go, all of you!

636
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,980
Darn traitor!

637
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,730
Pah.

638
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,610
Traitor!

639
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,610
Pah!

640
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,500
Pah!

641
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,500
This is our home.

642
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,610
Where are we supposed to go?

643
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,690
Ms. Xian.

644
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,610
I know you're inside.

645
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,610
I also know you and the Japanese
are mortal enemies.

646
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,730
You must have

647
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,130
some unspeakable difficulties.

648
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,730
Just tell me one truth.

649
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,060
Are you and Hongyu

650
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,250
communists?

651
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,090
Whether Zhu Hongyu is a communist

652
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,130
has nothing to do with me.

653
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,460
Don't ask me such silly questions again.

654
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,610
Long Er, let's go.

655
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,130
Mr. Wu.

656
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,170
I am a wanderer.

657
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,540
My eyes are sharp.

658
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,650
So

659
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,540
I can tell you have your own plans.

660
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,730
I've

661
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,610
worked hard in the troupe for so long,

662
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,860
hoping to gain your trust.

663
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,420
I've been thinking that one day,

664
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,540
I could earn your approval

665
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,980
and help you with things.

666
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,340
But overnight,

667
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,250
Hongyu is gone,

668
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,820
labelled a communist,

669
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,610
and you suddenly defect to the Japanese,

670
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,770
leaving me like a fool,

671
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,690
knowing nothing.

672
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,170
Long Er,

673
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,090
you must know

674
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,540
the more you know,
the more dangerous it is.

675
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,090
Then why can Ding Yi know?

676
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:42,860
He...

677
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,340
In what way is he
more trustworthy than I am?

678
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,540
Hongyu wasn't afraid of sacrifice,

679
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,650
I am not afraid either.

680
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,130
Long Er, leave.
Everything's been arranged.

681
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:55,540
Go.

682
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,090
I'm not going, Mr. Wu.

683
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,460
This is my home. I'm not leaving.

684
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,940
I'm not.

685
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,250
This troupe

686
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,170
is your life's work.

687
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,020
Would you rather we all scatter,

688
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,170
the troupe disbanded,

689
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,090
and you alone bear an eternal infamy,

690
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,130
than tell me one truth?

691
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,170
You saved my life.

692
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,820
Even if you are a communist,

693
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,130
I wouldn't betray you.

694
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,540
Just tell me one truth,

695
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,540
just one.

696
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,940
If you say it, I'll believe you.

697
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,730
If you want to find communists,
go elsewhere.

698
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,250
Hasn't Zhu Hongyu

699
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,940
already brought us enough misery?

700
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,610
Get out!

701
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,730
I didn't expect

702
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,060
that after all my effort,

703
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,090
I wouldn't even deserve one answer.

704
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:22,730
Long Er.

705
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,060
What are you doing?

706
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,130
These three bows

707
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,060
are to return your favor

708
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,090
for saving my life.

709
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,980
As for the answer,

710
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,170
I'll find it myself.

711
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,340
