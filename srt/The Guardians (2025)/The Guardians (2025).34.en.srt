[The Guardians]

00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,920
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,020
Come in.

4
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,260
Who are you?

5
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,260
Mr. Cao,

6
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,460
it's me.

7
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,380
Yangshan.

8
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,410
Mr. Cao.

9
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,100
Deputy Chief Luo.

10
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,540
I come to assume the post
as the Chief of the Cipher Division.

11
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,260
Why is Gu Yangshan back?

12
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,940
What about the former Division Chief Wu?

13
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,500
Division Chief Wu has defected,

14
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,540
so Chief Cao is very anxious

15
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,780
to replace all ciphers.

16
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,500
He's grasping at straws!

17
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,260
Contact all field agents immediately

18
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,540
and tell them face to face

19
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,150
the original frequency band,

20
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,100
ciphers,

21
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,820
and all previous schedules are scrapped.

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,130
We'll set up a brand-new contact plan.

23
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,980
I'll never use a set of cipher

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,540
that's been handled
by the Communist Party.

25
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,260
But our operatives

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,780
are scattered all over the city.

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,060
Meeting each one face-to-face

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,180
will take two or three days.

29
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,540
Then get moving!

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,660
Yes, sir.

31
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,500
Leader Xian isn't here.

32
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,780
Please go in and wait a moment.

33
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,940
Instructor Ding.

34
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,870
What are you sniffing around for?

35
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,020
The Joseph Lee cipher

36
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,360
is far more intricate

37
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,840
than a typical monoalphabetic cipher.

38
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,340
If it weren't
for the most critical secrets,

39
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,730
they certainly wouldn't attempt

40
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,180
such a troublesome encryption method.

41
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,700
So cracking it

42
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,340
has become our top priority.

43
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,380
The central directive states

44
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,590
Shanghai, as the largest industrial
and commercial city in the Far East,

45
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,780
must be returned intact to the people

46
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,780
as a world-renowned city.

47
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,780
Last time I met Gu Yangshan.

48
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,460
He told me

49
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,830
he was still studying
the Joseph Lee cipher.

50
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,460
Now this cipher system

51
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,340
has been put into use so quickly.

52
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,700
It must be the result of his research.

53
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,660
The Joseph Lee cipher,

54
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,100
you know,

55
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,980
is impossible to crack in a short time.

56
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,100
So the only option now

57
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,140
is to try to contact Gu Yangshan.

58
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,330
He's been out of touch with us
for four years.

59
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,460
All these years

60
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,140
he has been stuck in Nanjing,

61
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,770
conducting research behind closed doors.

62
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,860
How will you get in touch?

63
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,850
However, I do not believe

64
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,140
that without Gu Yangshan's guidance,

65
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,100
cipher officers
from the KMT Secrets Bureau

66
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,100
could crack Joseph Lee cipher.

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,100
He must be back.

68
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,120
Division Chief Gu,

69
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,220
Deputy Chief Luo said,

70
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,220
in these unusual times,

71
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,750
if you can't find
a suitable housekeeper,

72
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,140
the clothes at the Gu Residence

73
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,100
will have to be sent

74
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,780
to an outside laundry shop instead.

75
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,100
Hope you can understand.

76
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,790
Sorry for that.

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,140
Thank you.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,580
Take care.

79
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,080
[Noodle]

80
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,580
Sir,

81
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,340
one bowl of Plain Noodles, please.

82
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,780
Okay, have a seat.

83
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,780
Let me pour you some tea.

84
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,420
Here's your tea.

85
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,170
Sorry, my bad.

86
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,440
There's a tailor shop across the street.

87
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,580
I know the owner pretty well.

88
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,130
How about I take you to change clothes?

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,490
Sounds good.

90
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,780
Is the opening line still going

91
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,730
to be "long time no see" this time?

92
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,980
This time it's...

93
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,580
Get lost.

94
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,100
Why are you being rude?

95
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,700
We agreed back then

96
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,820
we'd meet in Yan'an.

97
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,820
But when everyone moved to Xibaipo,

98
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,460
you still didn't show up.

99
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,440
Don't you deserve to be scolded?

100
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,010
Meng Jie...

101
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,580
How is she?

102
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,460
She's doing great.

103
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,340
By the time she got to Yan'an,

104
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,820
she was already a chief physician.

105
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,700
Later, she moved to Peiping
with the Central Committee,

106
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,440
looking forward every day to returning

107
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,220
to Shanghai to find you
after the liberation.

108
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,580
Biyun said

109
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,580
that the letters from Miss Meng to her

110
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,580
were even more frequent than mine.

111
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Every month she'd ask

112
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,090
how things were going in Shanghai,

113
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,460
and if there was any news from you.

114
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,100
If you don't bring her to Shanghai soon,

115
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,100
I'm afraid my wife will be
driven crazy by her.

116
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,700
Once peace comes,

117
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,820
I can go to Peiping instead.

118
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,340
Then we'll find a courtyard,

119
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,460
and our families can live together
there.

120
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,130
Still playing the trick of pouring water
to change clothes?

121
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,340
That was a trick I played

122
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,580
back at Yuyin Pavilion.

123
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,820
Looks like over the years,

124
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,580
he hasn't made much progress.

125
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,820
Should we arrest the noodle stall owner

126
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,060
and the tailor shop owner

127
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,460
for questioning?

128
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,460
Are we tipping them off too soon?

129
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,940
If so,

130
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,280
no one will walk into the trap I set.

131
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,700
When I first arrived in Nanjing,

132
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,820
Comrade Xiao reached out to me.

133
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,480
He arranged for me to join the Party.

134
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,390
But not long after,

135
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,580
I lost contact with the organization.

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,370
Here.

137
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,580
I've been trying to reach you
for four years.

138
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
But I was kept under close watch
in Nanjing,

139
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,340
completely out of options.

140
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,220
It was not until Cao Yuanzhong

141
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,000
wanted to use the Joseph Lee cipher

142
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,040
that I found the opportunity
to return to Shanghai.

143
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,680
I've never wanted to side
with the wrong people.

144
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,100
So all these years,

145
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,080
I've only been focusing on one thing.

146
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,530
Studying the Joseph Lee cipher.

147
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,940
Well?

148
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,700
Can I help you this time?

149
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,820
Help a lot.

150
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,340
After liberation,

151
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,100
I will apply to the higher authorities

152
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,690
to set up a special class for you,

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,460
so that you can teach everyone

154
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,600
the principles of this cipher system
in full.

155
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,940
How did you know

156
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,420
that I want to teach
after achieving peace?

157
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,220
Because I'm already teaching now.

158
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,580
Whenever my students stump me,

159
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,820
I always think to myself,

160
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,580
if only Gu Yangshan were here.

161
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,220
Because

162
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,980
he really loves doing this.

163
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,580
Alright, alright.

164
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,770
Let's get serious.

165
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,940
Do you know where this cipher is used?

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,580
I only know this cipher

167
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,890
is used in a secret operation
by Luo Han.

168
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,980
But he's only using people
from outside the unit.

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,220
As for the mission details,

170
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,220
only Cao Yuanzhong and he know.

171
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,340
I haven't found out anything else yet.

172
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,490
That's fine.

173
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,940
We've been tracking his radio
for a long time.

174
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,000
Biyun

175
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,030
has his transmission logs
from the past two months.

176
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,940
With this info,

177
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,980
we'll soon know exactly what he's up to.

178
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,300
In that call just now,

179
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,940
Commander Tang's exact words were,

180
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,610
to make Shanghai

181
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,820
into Verdun in the First World War,

182
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,020
Stalingrad in the Second World War.

183
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,740
If we can't hold Shanghai,

184
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,460
we'll have to clear it out,

185
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,460
smash it,

186
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,170
blow it up...

187
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,720
Scorched earth.

188
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,620
Explosives.

189
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,340
Shanghai.

190
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,340
Our Scorched Earth Plan

191
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,740
is to carry out Commander Tang's orders.

192
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,220
This is the initial setup for the plan.

193
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,460
Each of you is an outstanding talent

194
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,020
personally selected by Director Mao.

195
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,620
At Shanghai's power plant...

196
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,980
Power plant...

197
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,570
the docks, train stations and so on,

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,860
I've already arranged
the explosion plans.

199
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,340
TNT.

200
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,140
The first batch of explosives
weighs 100,000 jin,

201
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,460
with TNT making up one-fifth of that.

202
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,260
Explosion.

203
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,460
I'm going to bomb Shanghai to pieces.

204
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,170
He's planning to bomb Shanghai.

205
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,220
That Luo Han

206
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,740
is completely out of his mind.

207
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,290
Blow it up the moment we enter.

208
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,500
Since he dared to say that,

209
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,930
that means everything's already set up.

210
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,860
It means

211
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,340
half of Shanghai's public facilities

212
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,690
are tied to a powder keg by this maniac.

213
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,320
Now we simply don't have time

214
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,990
to track down those explosives
one by one.

215
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,460
Besides, Luo Han's using

216
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,340
only the agents Mao Renfeng

217
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,100
placed personally in deep cover,

218
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,340
all seasoned old hands.

219
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,430
They're hard to track down.

220
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,980
We have no time left.

221
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,020
The first phase of the Wusong Campaign

222
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,100
is almost over.

223
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,340
The final assault

224
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,050
is at the breaking point.

225
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,170
We don't know how many agents they have.

226
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,930
Even if we get the full list,

227
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,290
there's no way in such a short time

228
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,170
to track each of them down

229
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,130
and bring them in.

230
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,810
I have an idea.

231
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,690
Back when I was studying in Yan'an,

232
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,890
our instructor told us a story.

233
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,330
After the Four Crossings
of the Chishui River,

234
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,890
the central leadership
approved Zeng Xisheng's proposal

235
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,990
to impersonate Chiang Kai-shek
over the radio,

236
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,140
that bought time to cross the Wu River

237
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,740
and helped the Red Army
shake off the KMT Army's pursuit.

238
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,930
You mean

239
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,260
we could use Joseph Lee cipher
to pose as Luo Han

240
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,600
and send messages to his people?

241
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,220
Liu.

242
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,260
Come here. Come on.

243
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,650
Listen.

244
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,500
At this time, on this frequency,

245
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,410
why would someone be sending telegrams?

246
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,520
This is the new radio

247
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,670
that Deputy Chief Luo just applied for
a few days ago.

248
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,380
He asked us not
to run any detection on it.

249
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,570
A new radio?

250
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,860
Didn't we already give him

251
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,500
a special radio?

252
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,260
I have no idea.

253
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,500
He applied for a new one
the day you arrived.

254
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,200
And he said he'd send messages himself,

255
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,600
and doesn't need us to get involved.

256
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,570
Deputy Chief Luo is so ignorant
of the rules now.

257
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,520
If he doesn't want us to get involved,

258
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,660
then what cipher is he using?

259
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,260
Could he be using an official radio

260
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,740
with his own private cipher?

261
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,620
Don't get him wrong.

262
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,380
Deputy Chief Luo is not
that kind of person.

263
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,260
The ciphers he uses are all filed

264
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,160
with the Confidential Office,

265
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,500
and follow every proper procedure.

266
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,140
Alright.

267
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,860
I don't mean that.

268
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,760
I don't get him wrong.

269
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,500
Relax.

270
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,740
Deputy Chief Luo and I have been friends

271
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,140
for over a decade.

272
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,620
Alright.

273
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,860
Go get some sleep.

274
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,500
Yes, sir.

275
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,380
Hello?

276
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,380
Get me the Communications Officer.

277
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,890
Don't move.

278
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,500
Division Chief Gu,
what are you doing here?

279
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,740
I heard that Deputy Chief Luo

280
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,500
applied for a new radio,

281
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,020
but the corresponding codebook

282
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,020
was not archived at our Cipher Division.

283
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,150
Instead, a copy was kept
in the Confidential Office.

284
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,740
Is that true?

285
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,020
Yes.

286
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,290
It's true.

287
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,700
Alright.

288
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,020
He's really getting out of line.

289
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,020
He ignored the bureau's
radio and cipher,

290
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,020
and actually used
his own private cipher instead.

291
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,790
Let me tell you something.

292
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,810
This is a serious breach of discipline.

293
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,050
I suspect he's secretly in contact
with the enemy.

294
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,050
Tell me where the codebook is.

295
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,020
Hand it over.

296
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,660
I need to take it back
to the Cipher Division for backup.

297
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,530
Division Chief Gu,

298
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,770
my job is to keep the codebook safe

299
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,180
and then send it to China Taiwan
for record-keeping.

300
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,690
Everything else is none of my concern.

301
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,290
But you

302
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,500
call me out in the middle of the night
for classified info,

303
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,500
that's probably a serious breach
of disciplines,

304
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,460
right?

305
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,370
How about this?

306
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,660
Tomorrow,

307
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,020
we'll go to the Chief together
to report it.

308
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,290
What do you think?

309
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,770
Alright.

310
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,990
At least you still know the rules.

311
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,460
In that case,

312
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,500
I'll wait for you

313
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,500
at the door of the Chief's office

314
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,890
tomorrow morning.

315
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,020
Head back.

316
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,260
Get rest early.

317
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,440
I'm going, Division Chief Gu.

318
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,850
Thanks.

319
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,020
Thanks.

320
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,740
Hello?

321
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,740
Is this Xikang Clinic?

322
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,740
The prescription you gave me last time,

323
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,980
I've finished it.

324
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,770
But my heart

325
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,740
still feels uneasy.

326
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,570
How about I go to see you

327
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,090
tomorrow morning,

328
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,370
and you examine me?

329
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,050
Something happened.

330
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,700
Luo Han uses a new frequency
and ciphers.

331
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,660
No way.

332
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,700
On the original frequency,

333
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,890
he's still sending messages
with the Joseph Lee cipher.

334
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,740
His sending style is very distinctive,

335
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,660
long high notes and short low notes.

336
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,290
I couldn't mishear it.

337
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,700
A new radio.

338
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,740
Our comrades in Shanghai
have already noticed it.

339
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,330
The new radio has sent several messages.

340
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,550
We've kept records of them all.

341
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,700
Now, this Joseph Lee cipher

342
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,020
is probably left on purpose

343
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,100
by Luo Han to throw us off.

344
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,420
Gu Yangshan said

345
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,740
he's got the codebook
for Luo Han's new radio.

346
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,740
I'll go find him right now.

347
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,020
That fast?

348
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,980
You know his abilities well.

349
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,900
Every morning at six,

350
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,810
Luo Han sends messages
using the Joseph Lee cipher.

351
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,220
You should stay here

352
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,740
and observe his transmissions.

353
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,020
I can go alone.

354
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,460
Once I get the new codebook,

355
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,050
we'll stick to the original plan.

356
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,290
No mistakes allowed.

357
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,740
Alright, we'll do it your way.

358
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,980
Why?

359
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,300
Why didn't Luo Han send anything today?

360
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,570
Unless…

361
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,660
Dr. Li,

362
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,770
the prescription you gave me last time

363
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,330
didn't work after I finished taking it.

364
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,900
Go check it.

365
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,290
Hurry up! Search.

366
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,180
Report.

367
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,660
He is gone.

368
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,160
Only this piece of clothing is left.

369
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,290
Over there is an abandoned
chemical plant.

370
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,980
Get in the car!

371
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,700
Comrade Biyun.

372
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,660
What's wrong?

373
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,980
Someone was tailing me just now.

374
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,500
But I set up a diversion.

375
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,290
Quick, take a look.

376
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,500
This is the codebook.

377
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,260
Check it.

378
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,530
Well?

379
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,770
It doesn't match the cipher
we intercepted.

380
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,980
It's fake.

381
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,500
It's fake?

382
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,020
How could it be possible?

383
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,770
That jerk!

384
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,530
He put a fake one
in the Confidential Office

385
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,810
just to lure me out.

386
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,120
He is no longer acting
for official business.

387
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,390
He's taking personal revenge.

388
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,360
Let's do this way.

389
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,500
Comrade Biyun,

390
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,440
I'll find another way
to get the real codebook.

391
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,290
We need to leave now.

392
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,770
Let's go.

393
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,530
They're here.

394
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,740
Secretary Liu,

395
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,020
have someone to follow you.

396
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,120
Find a high vantage point.

397
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,020
Once they step out,
take photos as evidence.

398
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,530
You.

399
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,290
Call Chief Cao

400
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,740
and tell him

401
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,980
the communist and the mole
have been found.

402
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,280
Ask Chief Cao to bring his team here.

403
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,570
Got it.

404
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:39,980
Yangshan.

405
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,770
Go up.

406
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:08,900
Yangshan.

407
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,770
This way.

408
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,290
Let's go.

409
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,740
Hurry.

410
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,570
We can't leave together.

411
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,390
What are you saying?

412
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,430
Luo Han just suspects you.

413
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,960
As long as he doesn't catch us meeting,

414
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,740
you're not exposed.

415
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,810
Go down from here.

416
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,180
Head back to Shanghai Bureau

417
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,500
to find the real codebook.

418
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,290
I'll take the stairs.

419
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,810
No way.

420
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,740
You can't take the stairs.

421
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,150
He has already lost control.

422
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,260
He doesn't care if we're actually
meeting or not.

423
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,260
If he finds us here,

424
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,290
none of us will get out.

425
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,290
Don't you get it yet?

426
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,740
Stay undercover,

427
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,220
disrupt the Scorched Earth Plan,

428
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,560
and peacefully liberate Shanghai.

429
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,570
That's your real mission.

430
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,020
I'll finish my mission,

431
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,700
but first,

432
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,460
I need to get you out safe.

433
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,290
For duty's sake, I can't
leave you here alone,

434
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,320
and personally, I can't let anything
happen to you.

435
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,530
Or Ding Yi will not forgive me.

436
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,090
He won't!

437
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,810
Understand?

438
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,770
He won't.

439
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,500
He is a mature Communist Party member.

440
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,330
He knows the mission's importance.

441
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,330
Shanghai is about to be liberated.

442
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,530
A city of six million people

443
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,100
can't be ruined by a bunch of lunatics.

444
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,260
Six million lives.

445
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,020
I understand what you're saying.

446
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,420
I will find the real codebook.

447
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,150
But the condition

448
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,020
is not at the cost of anyone's life.

449
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,120
Think about Comrade Bai Ye.

450
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,180
Think about your Uncle Gu.

451
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,630
How did they complete their missions?

452
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,380
Have you forgotten?

453
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,790
I haven't.

454
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,700
I haven't.

455
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,700
It's because I still remember them,

456
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,180
that's why I'm determined

457
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,610
to join the Communist Party.

458
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,940
I'm now
a Communist Party member too.

459
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,460
I've read the Admission Oath aloud.

460
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,290
I won't abandon my comrades.

461
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,700
Comrade Gu Yangshan,

462
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,370
since you've taken the oath,

463
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,460
you need to follow the Party's rules.

464
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,610
I'm your superior,

465
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,850
so follow my orders.

466
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,460
Hand me the gun.

467
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,940
There's no time left.

468
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,370
Follow the order.

469
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,700
I firmly...

470
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,700
Firmly obey orders.

471
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,180
We can split up.

472
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,180
But remember,

473
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,460
stay alive.

474
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,890
Take care.

475
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,460
Take care.

476
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,980
Take care.

477
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,570
Xian Biyun,

478
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,330
just surrender.

479
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,130
There's no way out.

480
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,300
If you surrender now,

481
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,850
I'll guarantee you'll live.

482
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,650
No one else is going to die today.

483
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,090
I'm not like you.

484
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,650
I'm not afraid of dying.

485
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,410
If I were afraid of dying,

486
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,820
I would've run away long ago!

487
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,040
Would I still be standing here?

488
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,450
What nonsense are you talking about?

489
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,810
Superstar,

490
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,370
you've got nowhere left to run, right?

491
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,500
That Canadian gun in your hand

492
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,370
only holds 13 bullets.

493
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,130
Now you're down to just one.

494
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,260
And you don't have another magazine.

495
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,810
Am I right?

496
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,540
Xian Biyun,

497
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,300
aren't you good at counting?

498
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,940
Then count carefully.

499
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,410
I just switched to a new magazine.

500
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,610
Now I've got 13 bullets ready.

501
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,940
You're down to your last bullet.

502
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,610
If we have to go head-to-head,

503
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,080
who do you think has the better odds?

504
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,570
Me.

505
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,020
Luo Han!

506
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,980
Luo Han, I'm right here!

507
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,020
Stop trying to act tough.

508
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,300
You're holding Gu Yangshan's gun, right?

509
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,890
Look.

510
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,650
See that?

511
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,850
Do you really think by doing this,

512
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,890
you can keep Gu Yangshan safe?

513
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,020
Let me tell you this,

514
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,460
I marked the bullets issued to him

515
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,020
a long time ago.

516
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,060
Even if you kill me,

517
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,460
Gu Yangshan won't get away clean.

518
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,020
Can your belief save you now,
Xian Biyun?

519
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,420
Stand up.

520
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,790
Stand up and I won't pull the trigger.

521
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,170
I marked the bullets issued to him

522
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,730
a long time ago.

523
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,770
Even if you kill me,

524
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,170
Gu Yangshan won't get away clean.

525
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,500
Luo Han!

526
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,650
Put the gun down.

527
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,820
I can keep you alive.

528
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,130
Drop it.

529
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,690
I've figured it out.

530
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,130
We both

531
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,900
will die under Gu Yangshan's gun.

532
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,720
What are you doing, Xian Biyun?

533
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,540
You'll never

534
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,570
get the real codebook.

535
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,690
Biyun.

536
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,460
Comrade Biyun,

537
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,770
about what I mentioned
in my letter before,

538
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,130
what's your take?

539
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,290
Didn't I write you a letter

540
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,820
saying that I want us

541
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,540
to return to the troupe

542
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,290
to hold our wedding later?

543
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,340
I've already asked Mr. Wu
to get in touch

544
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,290
with Zhao Fu,

545
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,500
Aunt Sufen,

546
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,500
Long Er and the others.

547
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,540
Are you okay with that?

548
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,980
That letter?

549
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,340
I got it.

550
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,640
I tried a few times to reply,

551
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,340
but never knew how to start.

552
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,650
Kept overthinking it
until I missed the chance.

553
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,020
You...

554
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,020
Don't want it?

555
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,130
No, I was just so happy

556
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,860
that I didn't know what to write.

557
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,290
We haven't seen them in years.

558
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,460
I really miss them.

559
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,590
I heard Long Er has his own
theatre troupe now.

560
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,860
We should call him Leader Long.

561
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,500
And Zhao Fu is writing a serial novel,

562
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,190
single-handedly supporting
two newspapers.

563

565
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,290

574
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,290
a woman who seems to step
out of a magazine.

575
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,500
One glance at her,

for the rest of your life.

577
