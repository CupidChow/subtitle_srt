00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,760
[Maxin Theatre]

4
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,740
The code of Joseph Lee

5
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,460
is extremely difficult to decipher

6
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,380
because he used a set

7
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,540
of extremely complex

8
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,260
functions

9
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,980
to encrypt the information.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,740
Even if the plaintext is the same,

11
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,020
the encrypted ciphertext

12
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,020
would still be different.

13
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,410
Therefore,

14
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,900
just by intercepting

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,260
the existing ciphertext

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,100
is simply not enough

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,820
to figure out his encryption pattern.

18
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,540
We call this model "one-time pad".

19
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,820
I know that.

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,900
One-time pad.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,980
So that means

22
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,850
we have to calculate every day?

23
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,260
Yes.

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,660
The computation load
for one-time pad is huge.

25
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,380
So he needs to train a large number of

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,500
cipher specialists

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,660
and send them to various units

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,380
that use this cipher system.

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,100
This is also what you

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,980
are helping Joseph Lee with.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,100
However,

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,980
Manager, don't worry.

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,260
I have already learned

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,220
the core algorithm

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,540
of his cipher system.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,380
The key is also

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,260
in our own hands.

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,780
Even if he's gone,

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,220
I can still guarantee this cipher system

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,220
will run smoothly.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,540
So what do you want me to do?

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,980
Next time you go to the MSS for class,

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,540
tell Takeda

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,780
you want to bid him farewell.

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,540
Farewell?

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,380
Yes.

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,820
Tell Takeda

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,660
you heard from the British

49
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,380
that the code you designed for him
has been leaked

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,540
and thus you don't want to work
for the Japanese anymore.

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,540
Also, suggest that he replace
this cipher with a new one.

52
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,380
That's it?

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,780
Just with a few words?

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,660
The Japanese aren't fools.

55
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,780
I say a few sentences

56
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,980
and they'll believe and replace it?

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,820
Don't worry, we're not fools either.

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,220
I'll arrange an operation

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,660
to make the Japanese believe you.

60
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,820
Wait a second.

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,940
If Joseph Lee is cooperating
with the enemy forces,

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,780
can you ensure the absolute
security of the cipher?

63
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,780
Well...

64
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,500
But if he is an enemy spy,

65
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,380
then why would he give us

66
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,340
a brand-new encryption system?

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,780
This algorithm

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,540
allowed us to immediately escape
enemy reconnaissance

69
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,940
and be invincible in
the northern Jiangsu battlefield

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,500
I need to find out
what exactly happened to him

71
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,300
in the past few days.

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,170
Search his room
at the Metropolitan Hotel

73
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,100
secretly and thoroughly.

74
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,980
Leave no trace.

75
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,020
Also, assign more personnel

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,260
to keep a close watch
on William's Residence.

77
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,700
But inside William's Residence...

78
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,580
It's true that you can't get in

79
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,620
the British director's territory
and search it.

80
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,740
But I

81
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,380
might have a way
to get you in to take a look.

82
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,260
Answer me a question.

83
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,380
How did you remember the things

84
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,260
Joseph Lee taught you so perfectly?

85
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,380
Is it that hard?

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,580
What learning steps
did Joseph Lee teach you?

87
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,740
What steps?

88
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,620
None at all.

89
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,380
Every time he just gave me a problem,

90
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,940
then told me the correct solution.

91
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,380
I memorized it, that's all.

92
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,820
And you memorized them all?

93
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,940
Didn't I tell you before?

94
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,620
I, Ding Yi,

95
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,820
people skills, mimicry,

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,700
and great memory.

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,580
You forgot that?

98
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,380
These here

99
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,580
are all the questions
for your next class at the MSS.

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,620
How long will you need?

101
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,620
If I have to both memorize
and write it down,

102
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,620
a few hours, I guess.

103
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,940
Memorizing is easy.

104
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,940
The hard part is writing.

105
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,580
Alright.

106
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,820
Then we start the timer now.

107
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,320
[A few hours later]

108
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,260
The end.

109
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,250
Wake up, class is over.

110
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,940
So, what do you think?

111
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,820
Are you satisfied with this grand show?

112
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,500
I finally understand

113
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,940
why Joseph Lee chose you.

114
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,380
Looks like we bet on the right horse.

115
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,820
What do you think, Commissioner Luo?

116
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,820
This time you should be
willing to serve him, right?

117
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,940
When you write things, don't be so...

118
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,140
Fast.

119
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,940
Got it?

120
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,820
There needs to be a process of thinking.

121
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,500
Otherwise, without thinking,

122
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,500
it just looks like rote memorization.

123
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,820
Do you know what a genius is?

124
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,820
A genius doesn't need to think.

125
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,380
You still have...

126
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,940
Young Master.

127
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,740
Uncle Gu.

128
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,940
Ms. Xian from Chaosheng Troupe is here.

129
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,180
She specifically asked to see you.

130
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,260
See me?

131
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,580
Welcome, Ms. Xian.

132
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,740
What brings you to me?

133
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,500
Back then, the place
I originally wanted to rent

134
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,380
was this Maxin Theatre.

135
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,180
Unfortunately, my purse was light

136
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,820
and I couldn't fulfill my wish.

137
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,820
Such twists of fate.

138
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,140
Last time, I wanted
to repay your kindness

139
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,820
but you didn't accept it.

140
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,060
How did you know I was here?

141
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,620
I guessed.

142
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,820
Nowadays, in the Bund of Shanghai,

143
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,060
Ding Yi is like a ticking time bomb.

144
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,940
You wouldn't take him to your workplace,

145
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,620
nor would you bring him home.

146
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,380
So I guessed that this place,
close and safe,

147
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,820
must be the one.

148
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,380
Ms. Xian truly

149
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,260
is smart and quick-witted.

150
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,380
Listen.

151
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,260
Give me three days.

152
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,770
After three days,

153
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,500
Maxin Theatre will be at your disposal.

154
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,860
The wife of Director William

155
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,140
has invited me to William's Residence
at 7 PM tonight

156
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,980
to attend their farewell banquet.

157
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,860
And what does that have to do with me?

158
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,020
The Japanese spies

159
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,260
have already spotted
Joseph Lee's car at William's Residence.

160
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,860
I see.

161
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,620
Thank you for the notice, Ms. Xian.

162
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,380
Rest assured.

163
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,860
Joseph Lee

164
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,260
will definitely appear
at the banquet tonight.

165
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,860
But I'd like to ask you for a favor.

166
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,380
Talk to Mrs. William a bit

167
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,020
and make sure she sticks to the story

168
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,740
that Joseph Lee has been
staying at their house.

169
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,740
I've already informed you,

170
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,740
which is kind enough.

171
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,020
Well then.

172
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,260
May I ask what I can do for you?

173
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,620
Take good care of Ding Yi.

174
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,460
Tonight at six,

175
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,620
I'll drive over to pick you up.

176
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,140
What's the use of your good memory

177
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,500
if you don't understand
the meaning behind them?

178
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,620
Don't you not understand either?

179
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,620
What I understand, you can't.

180
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,620
What I know, you may
not necessarily know.

181
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,020
I don't need to know.

182
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,260
I just need to memorize.

183
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,500
Just memorizing
is definitely not enough.

184
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,500
The plan has changed.

185
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,340
Takeda found Joseph Lee's car

186
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,340
inside William's Residence.

187
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,380
So tonight he will send Japanese

188
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,100
to William's Residence

189
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,140
to attend Mrs. William's banquet.

190
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,740
The goal is to see
whether Joseph Lee is there.

191
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,100
So you must attend

192
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,380
tonight's banquet.

193
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,020
Wait, wait a minute.

194
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,260
Banquet?

195
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,860
Yes, and I can only tell you,

196
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,620
this banquet will be much harder
than the questions you memorized.

197
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,380
Ding Yi.

198
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,340
If you were only

199
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,260
memorizing the lessons
Joseph Lee gave you,

200
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,260
then tonight you can't just imitate him.

201
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,140
You have to truly become Joseph Lee.

202
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,860
The real play is starting
ahead of schedule.

203
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,800
[7 hours before the banquet]

204
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,740
Don't trouble them.

205
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,620
It fits.

206
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,620
Can't we button this?

207
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,380
The front button of a tuxedo
should not be fastened.

208
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,140
It's too big.

209
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,140
You have to fix it.

210
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,260
Alright.

211
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,460
What are you doing?

212
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,380
Besides that,

213
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,860
grooming is also an essential part

214
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,860
of being a true English gentleman
like Joseph Lee.

215
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,260
That's so charming.

216
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,380
After putting on this bespoke suit,

217
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,100
you resemble the Joseph Lee I know

218
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,620
even more.

219
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,380
If you want to be Joseph Lee,

220
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,460
just the outfit

221
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,980
and your acting skills

222
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,100
are not enough.

223
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,380
What are you doing?

224
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,220
Remember, when wearing a tuxedo,

225
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,810
never tuck the vest into the trousers.

226
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,050
And between the vest and trousers,

227
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,570
your shirt must never show.

228
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,690
If tailoring a suit is like

229
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,220
building a skyscraper
from the ground up,

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,460
then the crowning touch

231
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,690
is the cufflinks.

232
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,220
Joseph Lee

233
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,810
always wanted to join the International
Mathematicians Association,

234
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,340
so he had a pair of cufflinks
made in imitation.

235
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,690
As it happens,

236
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,810
I received an invitation
from this association.

237
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,500
So my cufflinks are genuine.

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,810
Great.

239
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,220
I care for them intimately.

240
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,810
But today I'll let you use them.

241
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,100
Take a look.

242
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,930
So that's it.

243
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,980
Joseph Lee's were fakes.

244
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,220
Didn't expect you intellectuals
to be this vain.

245
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,340
You're no better than me.

246
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,570
What do you mean "you intellectuals"?

247
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,570
Take it.

248
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,220
Fine.

249
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,340
Us intellectuals.

250
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,480
[Less than 3 hours before the banquet]

251
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,690
I must say,

252
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,570
you do pull off the blind act
quite convincingly.

253
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,530
Charlie.

254
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,500
You flatter me.

255
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,410
Alright, alright.

256
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,340
Stop acting now.

257
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,930
Save your performance for tonight.

258
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,570
Yes, it is quite tiring.

259
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,570
I'll do it myself, Uncle Gu.

260
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,290
No need to be so polite.

261
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,690
Hold on.

262
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,220
This is a napkin, not a bib.

263
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,460
The proper way to use a napkin

264
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,810
is to fold it in half

265
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,570
and lay it flat across your laps.

266
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,690
Enjoy your meal.

267
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,500
Enjoy your meal.

268
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,100
Wait a minute.

269
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,100
Dining etiquette.

270
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,290
Never do things

271
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,860
you shouldn't do yourself.

272
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,100
Sit properly.

273
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,460
Angus ribeye.

274
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,930
Joseph Lee had this dining habit.

275
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,980
Each time, he has exactly 150 grams.

276
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,100
Not a gram more, not a gram less.

277
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,220
150 grams of beef every meal?

278
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,340
That's extravagant.

279
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,930
Excuse me,

280
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,570
but look at all that blood.

281
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,050
This isn't cooked, right?

282
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,050
How do you eat it raw like this?

283
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,340
I'm not eating this.

284
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,690
I'll get diarrhea afterwards.

285
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,810
I'll have yours instead.

286
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,810
I'll take yours.

287
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,810
Snails?

288
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,810
French escargot.

289
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,170
Mine doesn't have blood,
want to try it?

290
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,080
[Less than 30 minutes
before the banquet]

291
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,050
Let's drink somewhere else.

292
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,100
Let's drink somewhere else.

293
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,620
Where's Mr. Gu?

294
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,340
Let's drink elsewhere.

295
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,170
Mr. Gu, didn't know

296
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,930
you're so careless about rules.

297
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,050
We're about to start the operation,

298
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,860
and you're so drunk like this?

299
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,200
[Half an hour earlier]

300
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,690
It's about time.

301
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,930
Is it done?

302
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,410
Almost.

303
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,460
I really can't bring myself to eat this.

304
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,500
Put it down.

305
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,570
If you really can't stand Western food,

306
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,740
then when we get to the banquet,

307
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,410
stay a little further away
from the buffet area.

308
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,930
I'll find a quiet spot for you

309
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,690
to sit down.

310
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,810
Alright, I got it.

311
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,810
Buffet.

312
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,690
Buffet, buffet area.

313
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,050
Oh, and

314
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,290
speaking of language,

315
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,170
you must be careful.

316
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,740
Once we get there,
there will definitely be

317
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,570
a lot of foreigners.

318
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,410
Try your best not to speak.

319
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,290
If you want to say something,

320
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,410
I'll speak on your behalf.

321
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,050
It's fine.

322
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,170
I can speak, I can.

323
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,460
You forgot? I'm an actor.

324
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,690
I've performed every one
of Shakespeare's plays.

325
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,690
I know them all by heart.

326
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,810
Plus, Joseph Lee taught me
a few lines before.

327
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,170
That's enough to handle them.

328
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,410
Are you sure you've actually
acted in Shakespeare,

329
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,570
and not just peeked at the script?

330
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:55,570
You...

331
00:16:59,190 --> 00:16:59,620
Don't worry about it.

332
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,220
Anyway, I can speak.

333
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,930
Ignore him, let's talk business.

334
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,180
So, I won't eat anything at all,

335
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,940
and just watch others eat?

336
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,850
Mr. Lee,

337
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,420
you can't see.

338
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,940
How's your drinking capacity?

339
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,700
At the banquet,
I'll get you a glass of wine,

340
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,180
so you don't feel awkward.

341
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,850
Now that's an awkward question.

342
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,700
Don't be fooled by my small frame,

343
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,940
I'm basically a walking wine cellar.

344
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,180
A pound or two is just rinsing my mouth,

345
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,980
three or four pound
don't even count as drinking.

346
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,260
But the way you poured this wine
is all wrong.

347
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,420
It's insulting to fill a teacup

348
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,940
to the brim.

349
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,260
But wine should be poured full
to show respect.

350
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,900
Got it?

351
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:43,940
Let me taste it.

352
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,770
No.

353
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,180
You absolutely can't drink this way.

354
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,130
You'll get drunk easily.

355
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,420
Let him drink it.

356
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,180
It's sweet and sour.

357
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,130
Maybe he'll knock out a few Japanese.

358
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,940
That'd be a gain for us.

359
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,130
Now that

360
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,460
hits me right in the heart.

361
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,420
Come on, bro.

362
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,900
Just for those words,

363
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,460
I'll drink them under the table!

364
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,460
Alright, alright.

365
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,370
I know you can drink, okay?

366
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,180
But can you save your capacity

367
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,180
for tonight?

368
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,900
That's not even close yet.

369
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,660
Don't worry, I can drink.

370
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,850
If friends and family ask about me,

371
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,370
I'll

372
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,660
finish this bottle before we talk!

373
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,610
Young Master.

374
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,260
Ms. Xian's car has arrived.

375
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,420
It's waiting at the back door.

376
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,090
Alright.

377
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,900
Mr. Gu.

378
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,460
Sit.

379
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,260
Why didn't you keep an eye on him?

380
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,770
How about we cancel the operation?

381
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,660
He's this drunk.

382
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,090
He'd confess everything to the Japanese.

383
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,660
At this point,
it's impossible to cancel.

384
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,900
When we get there,

385
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,180
if he's still like this,

386
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,420
I'll pour him a few more drinks first.

387
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,090
No way.

388
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,370
Your wine won't stop my mouth.

389
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,370
What I should say, I'll say it all.

390
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,850
Mrs. William finally agreed to help.

391
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,020
If we betray her trust this time,

392
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,420
it'll be even harder in the future.

393
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,330
Too hard.

394
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,370
Ding Yi.

395
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,570
Isn't this

396
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,900
Juliet?

397
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,180
Is this...

398
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,660
I'm telling you, Juliet.

399
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,460
You'd better keep

400
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,260
the rose I gave you safe, you hear?

401
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,700
Ms. Xian, you've finally came.

402
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,020
Mrs. William is waiting for you.

403
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,770
Please tell Mrs. William

404
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,130
I'll be there right away.

405
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,700
Ding Yi, we're here. Wake up.

406
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,610
That startled me awake.

407
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,700
Feeling any better?

408
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,940
Just a bit nauseous,

409
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,130
but not too dizzy anymore.

410
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,180
How about you?

411
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,420
Not too dizzy, just a bit nauseous.

412
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,420
It's about time.

413
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,330
We should head in.

414
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,580
I'll go find Mrs. William.
You watch him.

415
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:30,890
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

416
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,420
Don't worry, I've got this.

417
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:33,900
Let's go.

418
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,370
Wait a sec.

419
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,370
Where are the glasses?

420
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,420
Didn't I give them to you?

421
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,130
When did you give them to me?

422
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,610
When we were drinking.

423
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,540
These aren't mine, right?

424
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,300
They're mine.

425
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,300
Wear them.

426
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:58,740
Let's go.

427
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,170
Hello.

428
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,370
Long time no see.
You've become prettier.

429
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,650
You look beautiful tonight as well.

430
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,740
Thank you.

431
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,540
Hi.

432
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,260
Hi, Ms. Xian, long time no see.

433
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,940
Mr. Zhang, long time no see.

434
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,460
Hello.

435
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:37,980
Hello.

436
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,700
You've become prettier.

437
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,300
They're here.

438
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,370
Biyun's here.

439
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,300
Biyun.

440
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,810
Coming right away.

441
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,460
Hurry up here.

442
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,060
Peter!

443
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,170
Ms. Xian.

444
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,370
You're abandoning me so soon?

445
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,460
Hi, Cindy.

446
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,220
Hi, Biyun.

447
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,980
Madam been waiting for you.

448
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,370
Sorry.

449
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,130
Sorry.

450
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,740
Madam William.

451
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,540
I apologize for not being able to attend
the opening of the banquet today.

452
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,410
It's okay.

453
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,370
Where's Mr. William?

454
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,980
His eye disease has occurred,

455
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,890
so he went back to rest.

456
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,220
I'm so sorry to hear that.

457
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,370
Thank you.

458
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,300
You're welcome.

459
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,460
Can I have some water?

460
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,460
My chest feels hot.

461
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,700
I'll find you a place to sit first,

462
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,700
then get you some water.

463
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,300
Have a seat, Mr. Lee.

464
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,130
Alright.

465
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,460
I'll get you some water.

466
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,170
Okay.

467
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,700
A little slower. Play along.

468
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,740
Why is she here?

469
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,220
Aren't they supposed to be here?

470
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,460
Otherwise, why would we be here?

471
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,460
Didn't you see there were three of them?

472
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,300
That girl is Meng Jie.

473
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,980
Her father is Meng Mingyi,
Deputy Director of the Health Agency.

474
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,220
He's had dealings with my father.

475
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,700
Meng Jie and I...

476
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,980
I get it, I get it.

477
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,650
But she should be in Chongqing.

478
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,500
Why would she be here?

479
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,060
Looks like Meng Mingyi

480
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,170
has become a collaborator with Japan.

481
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,460
Just cooperate a little longer.

482
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,610
I'm really tired today,

483
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,370
I've been acting with you all the time.

484
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,300
Just hold on.

485
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,610
But Meng Jie looks really nervous.

486
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,980
It's like Kobayashi and Kondo

487
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,940
forced her to come.

488
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,060
Can we not study others for now?

489
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,370
Can you pay attention to me instead?

490
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,500
I'm about to throw up here.

491
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,890
Bear with it a little longer.

492
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,740
Once Kondo and Kobayashi

493
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,500
confirm Joseph Lee is at this banquet,

494
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,980
our act will be over.

495
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,220
How about we go over first

496
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,810
and greet them ourselves?

497
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,700
In your state? How?

498
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,220
Don't look around.

499
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,700
You're blind.

500
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,740
You want?

501
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,740
No, thanks.

502
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,220
Mr. Kondo, let's head back.

503
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,940
Wait a moment.

504
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,740
I feel like something is off.

505
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,700
Go to the restroom.

506
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,740
Stop staring. To the restroom.

507
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,700
Shixian, Shixian.

508
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,890
Shixian.

509
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:57,890
Shixian.

510
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,500
Sorry, Miss.

511
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,460
Sorry.

512
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,500
Are you alright?

513
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,460
Apologies.

514
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,220
Sorry for spilling on you.

515
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,740
Mr. Lee, I knocked a young lady down.

516
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,410
Alright, quickly go help her.

517
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,460
Are you alright?

518
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,260
I'll help.

519
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,980
Here, get up.

520
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:14,980
Come.

521
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:15,980
Shixian.

522
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,460
Yes.

523
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,260
It's really my fault.

524
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,460
Sorry, Miss.

525
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,220
Mr. Lee.

526
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,740
You are...

527
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,220
Kondo Saburo.

528
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,700
You're here too.

529
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,130
Here.

530
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,940
Did you sprain your ankle?

531
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:37,700
I didn't...

532
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,460
Mr. Lee, this young lady
sprained her ankle.

533
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,460
I'll escort her out and be right back.

534
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,130
Go ahead.

535
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,170
I can manage here by myself.

536
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,170
Alright.

537
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,940
This is so romantic.

538
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,940
Yellow River's water
flows toward the east.

539
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,810
A daughter in Luoyang
was named Mochou.

540
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,940
At age 13, Mochou could weave brocade.

541
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,940
By 14, she picked mulberry
at south path.

542
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,700
When 15, she was housewife of Lu family.

543
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,540
Shixian.

544
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,460
Mrs. William, take a look.

545
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,170
They're dancing so happily.

546
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,220
I think you should also
go down and join them.

547
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,700
Excuse me.

548
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,170
Biyun.

549
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,700
Ye Yin.

550
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:09,940
Mr. Lee.

551
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,370
Mr. Takeda has been looking for you.

552
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:14,740
These days...

553
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,700
Are you alright?

554
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,460
I'm fine.

555
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,740
Let's go to the restroom.

556
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,220
Miss.

557
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,610
Miss.

558
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,650
Which car is yours?

559
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,410
That one.

560
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,980
Alright.

561
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,650
Mr. Takeda has arrived.

562
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,410
I always think back to

563
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,810
the days we filmed movies together.

564
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,060
So many years have passed,

565
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,700
and you're still so beautiful.

566
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,060
I'm nothing like Mrs. Liang,

567
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,460
with such good fortune

568
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,220
to have married a fine man.

569
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,700
How are things with Liang?

570
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,650
Well, for him,

571
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,460
I have nothing to complain about.

572
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,890
It's just those jerks
from the BIS

573
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,170
sent Liang to Suzhou as a section chief

574
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,060
with their sweet talk,

575
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,980
but gave him a cold shoulder.

576
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,260
How could that happen?

577
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,220
Then Mr. Liang...

578
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,460
Forget it, let's drop it.

579
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,170
You know what he's like.

580
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,170
He's not one for fighting and killing.

581
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,130
And now,

582
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,940
isn't Chairman Wang promoting
the peace movement in Shanghai?

583
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,650
It's just what Liang wanted.

584
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,170
Since he can't come himself,

585
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,460
I went on his behalf.

586
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,220
Yes.

587
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,130
If we can have peace,
who would want war?

588
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,460
Exactly.

589
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,170
Just now,

590
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,890
I heard something from Director William.

591
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,940
Maybe Chairman Wang
might be interested in it.

592
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,170
Biyun, come here.

593
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,740
We'll talk later.

594
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,220
Is Mr. Kondo still here?

595
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,940
I'm right behind you.

596
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,130
I'm sorry

597
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,700
for today.

598
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,650
It's fine.

599
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,890
Tonight,

600
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,300
I have no other work arrangements.

601
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,220
Do you have a towel?

602
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,700
Right in front of you.

603
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,220
I forgot.

604
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,130
You can't see things.

605
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,130
Mr. Lee.

606
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,740
Do you like

607
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,610
eating snails?

608
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,650
Don't mention snails to me again.

609
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,940
I hate them.

610
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,940
Miss, I'm truly sorry for today.

611
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,890
My master is still inside
waiting for me.

612
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,060
I'll excuse myself first.

613
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,940
Miss, is there anything else?

614
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,890
Name card.

615
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,480
[Dr. Meng Jie, Praxis Dr. Schwarz]

616
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,020
This is where I work.

617
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,890
I'm there during the day.

618
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,020
You can come find me anytime.

619
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:58,020
Alright then, Miss Meng.

620
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:02,020
I'm sure fate will let us meet again.

621
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:04,940
Goodbye.

622
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,420
Mr. Lee, where are you going?

623
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,290
I'm going to find Mrs. William.

624
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,650
We didn't finish our conversation
from yesterday.

625
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,250
Mr. Lee, are you alright?

626
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,860
Mr. Lee.

627
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,900
Let me go!

628
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,060
I can't see. Can't you see either?

629
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,060
There's something on the floor.

630
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,060
Why didn't you warn me?

631
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,380
I'm truly sorry.

632
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,540
Mr. Lee.

633
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,730
Stop following me.

634
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,900
Get out! Get out!

635
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:34,820
Yes.

636
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,420
Mr. Lee, your suit.

637
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,250
Wait.

638
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,210
Stop pretending.

639
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,130
You can see.

640
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,020
What are you talking about?

641
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,060
I hate it the most

642
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,770
when people joke about
my eye condition!

643
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,090
Just now, to test you,

644
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,060
I deliberately dropped a cake
in front of you.

645
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,860
And you

646
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,060
deliberately tripped over the cake

647
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,290
to keep up your blind act.

648
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,130
But what you didn't know

649
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,210
that my real test was

650
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,250
this.

651
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,060
I purposely placed my suit

652
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,020
on top of yours.

653
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,130
If you were blind,

654
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,860
you would take the top one,

655
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,130
or at least start feeling

656
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,340
from the top.

657
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,250
But what did you do?

658
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,570
To get out of my sight
as quickly as possible,

659
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,420
you picked out yours,
the one underneath,

660
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,420
quickly and accurately.

661
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,570
You can't fool me.

662
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,420
How dare you bring a gun to my party!

663
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,650
Sir, put down your gun, please.

664
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,420
Stay back! Stay back!

665
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,730
Mr. Lee is Mr. Takeda's guest.

666
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,130
Is it appropriate to point a gun

667
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,540
at Mr. Lee?

668
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,730
No.

669
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,210
He is our enemy.

670
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:55,940
Charlie.

671
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,130
Mr. Lee.

672
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,290
No need to get upset.

673
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,860
Hold my suit for me first.

674
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,650
Yes, Mr. Lee.

675
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:13,940
Thanks.

676
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,940
Mr. Kondo,

677
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,090
you would kill me just because

678
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:25,860
I picked the right suit?

679
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,250
Barbarians are always barbarians.

680
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,820
It's simply hilarious.

681
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,340
Do you think

682
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,250
I wouldn't dare kill you?

683
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,210
Calm down, calm down.

684
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,290
I just want to tell you, Mr. Kondo,

685
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,250
you don't need eyes to instantly

686
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,770
tell two suits apart.

687
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,940
I believe every gentleman
here could do it,

688
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,730
except

689
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,380
you.

690
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,130
Mr. Kondo,

691
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,500
may I borrow your suit?

692
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,570
What are you doing?

693
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,900
Give me your suit.

694
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,650
And I'll give you a satisfying answer.

695
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,340
Mr. Lee, the suit is here.

696
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,770
Every gentleman here knows

697
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,380
the fabric and weave
matter most to a suit.

698
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,340
The fabric and weave
matter most to a suit.

699
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,500
No matter whether the lines of the suit

700
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,770
are sharp or delicate,

701
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,940
it all depends on this fabric.

702
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,900
A bespoke suit

703
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,250
is almost always lined
with full canvas.

704
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,650
Full canvas is the middle layer.

705
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,730
But my suit here

706
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,540
is lined with wool.

707
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,210
Mine is different. It's lined with wool

708
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,340
and entirely hand-stitched.

709
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,420
In Shanghai, there are only
a few days a year...

710
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,380
There are only a few days
a year in Shanghai

711
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,420
with weather perfect for wearing it.

712
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,380
So just by touch, I can recognize

713
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,540
my own suit.

714
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,610
As for yours,

715
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,610
it has no lining.

716
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,570
Shut up!

717
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,420
Don't try to explain.

718
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,730
Just now, you took the suit

719
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,210
straight out of my hands.

720
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,570
There was no feeling process at all.

721
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,210
Looks like you are observant, Mr. Kondo.

722
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,820
Yes, I didn't exactly feel it carefully,

723
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,130
because

724
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,820
my hand touched this

725
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:36,730
immediately.

726
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,290
Well, excuse me.

727
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,250
I noticed this just now.

728
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,650
Look here.

729
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,090
There's a hole.

730
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,770
I can tell

731
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,900
it's been mended.

732
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,060
But I can still feel it distinctly.

733
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,210
To be Joseph Lee,

734
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,900
you need more than a bespoke suit.

735
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,130
You need to understand its details.

736
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,770
This is called a boutonnière.

737
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,540
In olden times, European nobles
would use it at ceremonies

738
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,500
to insert flowers for decoration.

739
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,540
Soldiers would often
unfasten the top button

740
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,900
and turn down the collar two folds.

741
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,770
This style then passed
into civilian dress.

742
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,210
In civilian wear,

743
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,130
it evolved into the suit lapel

744
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,500
and retained this buttonhole.

745
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,730
Tailors in Shanghai
make normal buttonholes.

746
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,730
But those on Savile Row

747
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,210
prefer to make
Milanese-style boutonnières.

748
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,730
My tailor is even more distinct.

749
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,250
He has his own unique way

750
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,210
of stitching a boutonnière,

751
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,540
making it one of a kind in the world.

752
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,770
So just now,
once I touched this boutonnière,

753
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,420
I naturally took the suit right away.

754
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,730
But I must apologize, Mr. Kondo.

755
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,940
I was careless

756
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,130
and didn't consider the possibility

757
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,900
that your suit might also have been made

758
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,770
by my tailor.

759
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,770
I really should have spent more time

760
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,940
to feel carefully

761
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,860
whether your suit

762
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,130
had a boutonnière.

763
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,770
Mr. Lee, sorry.

764
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,210
There is no boutonnière
on the lapel of this suit.

765
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,060
That's unfortunate.

766
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:19,730
Jerk!

767
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,860
What are you doing?

768
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,020
Who's this Japanese?

769
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,380
Who allowed the Japanese in?

770
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,380
Get out.

771
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,650
Get out!

772
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:34,610
Madam is here.

773
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,610
Mr. Lee,

774
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,340
I am very sorry.

775
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,730
But Mr. Takeda wants to see you.
