[Episode 23]

3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,100
Ding Yi, Ding Yi!

4
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,900
What on earth are you trying to do?

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,740
The frequency of the quartz crystal
in this radio

6
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,100
matches the one used
by the Communist Party.

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,820
Whoever has this radio
is a Communist spy.

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,620
What are you really after?

9
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,180
Who is it?

10
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,850
Lee...

11
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,340
Director Lee.

12
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,940
Director Lee.

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,410
Your eyes...

14
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,380
I'm an agent
of the Shanghai Underground Communist Party.

15
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,690
I'm assigned to get you out.

16
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,100
This morning, Comrade Biyun
didn't contact you

17
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,100
because we had to report
to our superiors first.

18
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,100
Now Comrade Biyun has been attacked,

19
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,220
which means both your identities

20
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,410
have already been exposed.

21
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,410
The next target in danger

22
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,820
could very well be you.

23
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,100
So the Organization ordered me
to meet you

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,380
and get you out of here.

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,980
Your ride will be here any moment,

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,260
waiting on Robison Road.

27
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,850
This is your only shot to leave.

28
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,100
Come with me.

29
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,260
In a moment, the vehicle picking you up

30
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,220
will take you to the intel post

31
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,260
of Shanghai Underground Communist Party.

32
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,820
Inside this bag are files

33
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,980
I smuggled out of
the Cryptography Institute,

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,450
classified and highly sensitive.

35
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,850
You must get them into their hands.

36
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,940
Our leaders

37
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,980
will be there waiting for you.

38
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,780
Comrade Bai Ye,

39
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,730
we can't waste another second.

40
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,500
Move.

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,660
Hold on a second.

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,380
This way.

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,100
Hurry.

00:03:50,560 --> 00:04:00,760
[Robison Rd]

45
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,540
This is Robison Road.

46
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,340
The car will be here any moment.

47
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,380
Once it arrives, you go right away.

48
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,370
Don't worry about us.

49
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,100
Got your gun with you?

50
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,780
Aren't you coming with me?

51
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,020
We still have an important mission.

52
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,220
Here comes the car.

53
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,140
Comrade.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,980
See you in Yan'an.

55
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,540
Yan'an?

56
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,250
Don't look back.

57
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,700
Let's go.

58
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,460
Gu Yangshan.

59
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,810
You don't need to say anything.

60
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,540
I know what you're doing.

61
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,850
You only have one goal.

62
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,780
To protect Shen Wanqing's identity
as a Communist.

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,730
But do you really think
Liang Jingyuan will believe you?

64
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,580
Yi Aida works for him.

65
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,050
Now the radio's in Yi Aida's hands.

66
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,170
That proves she's a Communist spy.

67
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,050
It's solid evidence.

68
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,290
Even if Yi Aida was just bait
set by Liang Jingyuan,

69
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,460
she's dead now,

70
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,220
which means there's no way to testify.

71
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,810
If next,

72
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,700
we get the chance to meet Sasaki,

73
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,900
we can prove to him

74
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,580
that Liang Jingyuan runs a loose ship.

75
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,850
Because there's a Communist spy
in his team.

76
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,340
You're being too naive.

77
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,900
Why would he even let you meet Sasaki?

78
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,540
He'll never let you see Sasaki.

79
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,050
Aida… Aida…

80
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,020
Aida.

81
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,370
Liang Jingyuan!

82
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,700
You jerk!

83
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,050
Now,

84
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,460
lock down Sanyangli.

85
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,610
It's going to be a battle of minds.

86
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,020
Sasaki won't give Liang Jingyuan
much time.

87
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,290
As long as we endure
Liang Jingyuan's questioning,

88
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,730
and he can't find evidence from us,

89
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,250
he will have to swallow the bitter end.

90
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,340
One night.

91
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,250
I'm giving you just one night.

92
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,780
Sanyangli has already been locked down.

93
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,580
I'm requesting permission
to use force on Joseph Lee.

94
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,340
What are

95
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,580
the consequences?

96
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,730
The consequence is

97
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,900
that I can help you

98
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,460
wipe out the Tonoji family's influence

99
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,890
from the New Government's
intelligence network.

100
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,220
Good.

101
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,220
You have my permission to interrogate.

102
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,340
But if you haven't found the enemy spy
by sunrise,

103
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,580
everyone in the Cryptography Institute

104
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,220
will be gone.

105
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,220
That includes you.

106
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,680
Fine.

107
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,580
Since you have such a flawless plan,

108
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,220
you won't be needing me anymore.

109
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,300
You've already made the choice
you wanted to make.

110
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,850
Don't worry.

111
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,340
I didn't kill Shen Wanqing.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,340
And I'll never betray him.

113
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,770
What I owe you,

114
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,460
I'll return to you.

115
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,250
Mr. Shen.

116
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,460
Mr. Shen.

117
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,850
Mr. Shen.

118
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,730
Mr. Shen.

119
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,700
Mr. Shen.

120
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,180
Slow down.

121
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,340
Mr. Shen.

122
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,580
Mr. Shen, listen to me.

123
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,820
I've already taken care of your radio.

124
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,490
I had Yi Aida carry your radio,

125
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,730
and she was killed by the Japanese.

126
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,340
That confirmed her as a Communist.

127
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,300
But Yi Aida worked for Liang Jingyuan.

128
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,980
He'll lock down Sanyangli at once

129
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,340
and conduct a full investigation.

130
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,850
As long as we can endure the questioning

131
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,180
and reveal no flaws,

132
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,220
we still have a chance
to turn things around.

133
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,980
Then we can get your intel out.

134
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,420
Mr. Shen,

135
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,490
I'm not Joseph Lee at all.

136
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,730
My name is Ding Yi,

137
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,220
an actor from the Chaosheng Troupe.

138
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,370
Ms. Xian, Xian Biyun,

139
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,940
was the one who recommended me to join.

140
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,850
Sanyangli goes into lockdown.
And shut the gates.

141
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,340
No one is allowed to leave.

142
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,940
Comrade Bai Ye.

143
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,850
Don't hesitate.

144
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,850
I've already

145
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,180
laid all my cards on the table.

146
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,130
Now,

147
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,100
you have to trust me.

148
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,580
Steps, steps, steps.

149
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,460
Director Lee.

150
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,850
Director Lee.

151
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,820
Mr. Shen, you're here too.

152
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,300
What's going on here?

153
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,700
Director Liang.

154
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,820
Interesting.

155
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,700
Searching for the radio
led right to my own place.

156
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,530
The Institute has been compromised.

157
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,580
Japan Army in Shanghai.
New Government.

158
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,100
How many people will lose sleep tonight?

159
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,300
My life

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,580
and yours

161
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,300
all depend on tonight's investigation.

162
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,180
Come on.

163
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,980
I'd like to hear your suggestions.

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,100
So who exactly is this mole?

165
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,300
Whoever has the radio is the mole.

166
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,580
Go check the radio.

167
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,220
You're not wrong.

168
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,420
The radio was with Miss Yi Aida.

169
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,820
But she was not the one.

170
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,180
Someone tricked her into trusting them.

171
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,100
They had her take the radio
out of Sanyangli.

172
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,820
This enemy spy is cunning.

173
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,730
Director Liang, do you have proof?

174
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,180
To prove that she's not the enemy spy?

175
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,100
Because I trust her.

176
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,700
It's that simple.

177
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,100
Today, only you guys were in Sanyangli.

178
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,180
The signal detected
by the direction finder

179
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,820
was at 6:03 p.m.

180
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,300
I just want to ask

181
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,180
what were you doing at that time?

182
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,340
Director Liang,

183
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,420
are you interrogating me now?

184
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,820
I'm just asking a question.

185
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,130
If you refuse to cooperate,

186
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,100
you could take it as an interrogation.

187
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,300
I was at home

188
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,650
going through today's work notes

189
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,650
and I dozed off reading them.

190
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,980
Li Huan and I were home resting too.

191
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,300
I came back from the hospital,

192
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,420
helping Charlie pack clothes for Biyun,

193
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,700
getting them ready for the hospital.

194
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,580
And then you showed up, Director Liang.

195
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,650
And you?

196
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,460
Director Liang,

197
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,580
I asked Mr. Lee for leave
early this morning.

198
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,580
I caught a cold,

199
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,460
so I requested to rest at home.

200
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,420
I was lying in bed

201
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,700
when Mr. Lee suddenly came back.

202
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,460
He said his wife has been shot.

203
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,820
I rushed to help Mr. Lee pack things.

204
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,420
And that's it.

205
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,770
Director Liang.

206
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,220
Could you please hurry?

207
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,300
My wife's still in surgery
at the hospital.

208
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,100
Alright.

209
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,850
So you're all saying
you're in the clear.

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,100
I'm afraid you'll have to bear with us.

211
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,700
Wait here for a moment.

212
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,490
Once we have the results,

213
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,460
I'll update you right away.

214
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,420
Amu, take Li Yu over there first.

215
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,100
What's going on?

216
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,700
Why are you taking me?

217
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,100
No.

218
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,580
What are you doing?

219
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,460
Why are you targeting me?

220
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,300
Yu, Yu...

221
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,300
I'm not a mole!

222
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,940
I'm not a mole.

223
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,340
Master.

224
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,580
Huan, come back! Huan!

225
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,940
Why are you arresting me?

226
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,100
Let go!

227
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,700
Huan, come back!

228
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,100
Let go!

229
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,940
Why are you taking me in?

230
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,100
Director Liang.

231
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,220
No need to rush.

232
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,300
There's an order. Everyone gets a turn.

233
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,940
Of course.

234
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,650
I also welcome you

235
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,300
to knock on that door and report it.

236
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,980
I'll be inside waiting anytime.

237
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,100
This is pure nonsense!

238
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,580
I'm going to the hospital
to see my wife now.

239
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,580
Charlie, let's go.

240
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,940
If you're that anxious,

241
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,980
I can send someone
to bring her here right now.

242
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,980
Do you think that's okay?

243
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,220
Director Liang!

244
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,330
Director Liang...

245
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,620
You know me well.

246
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,860
Li Huan and I were home all night.

247
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,050
Master can vouch for me.

248
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,940
I...

249
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,460
The whole night I...

250
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,980
Never left my table.

251
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,290
Sit there.

252
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,660
Want some coffee?

253
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,530
Let's begin.

254
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,730
What do you mean?

255
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,980
What do you mean?

256
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,860
Huan.

257
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,730
Yu!

258
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,660
Yu!

259
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,810
Huan.

260
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,900
Help!

261
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,620
Yu!

262
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,220
Huan.

263
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,730
Yu!

264
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,620
Huan.

265
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,460
Director Liang!

266
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,220
Director Liang!

267
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,220
Please, don't hurt him.

268
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,730
He doesn't know anything.

269
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,660
Yu!

270
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,460
Huan.

271
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,220
Director Liang, Director Liang,
Director Liang.

272
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,290
Please don't hurt my brother.

273
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,530
My brother really knows nothing.

274
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,250
He's not the enemy spy.

275
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,220
I beg you, stop.

276
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,980
Yu!

277
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,460
Yu!

278
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,980
Director Liang, he's just a kid.

279
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,900
Director Liang.

280
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,980
Director Liang.

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,050
I'm not a mole!

282
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,220
Director Liang.

283
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,530
Stop hitting him.

284
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,660
Don't hurt him anymore!

285
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,900
You can't do this, Director Liang.

286
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,460
Director Liang.

287
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,140
Yu.

288
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,460
You can't do this, Director Liang!

289
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,290
Director Liang.

290
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,900
Yu.

291
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,660
Yu.

292
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,180
Master.

293
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,010
Master.

294
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:37,980
Huan.

295
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,660
Huan.

296
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,490
Huan.

297
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,460
Yu.

298
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,180
What happened?

299
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,940
Yu.

300
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,530
Yu.

301
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,460
Yu!

302
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,980
Yu!

303
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,900
Let me through!

304
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,900
Yu!

305
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,980
Let me pass!

306
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,940
Yu!

307
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,050
Yu.

308
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,050
Let me through!

309
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,090
Yu!

310
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,220
Huan.

311
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,530
Liang Jingyuan!
You're playing with lives here.

312
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,900
I'm going to report you to the Colonel.

313
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,290
Director Lee, please don't rush.

314
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,250
It's cleaned up inside.

315
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,980
Your turn now.

316
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,530
Do you know when I first

317
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,050
started suspecting you?

318
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,900
It was when we first met

319
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,460
and you said "to snap up a bargain".

320
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,570
I honestly never expected

321
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,730
that Takeda and I
would fight to the bitter end.

322
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,770
In the end,

323
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,660
you managed to snap up a bargain.

324
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,980
Snap up a bargain?

325
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,460
I didn't expect you to be so familiar

326
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,290
with local antique trade slang

327
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,250
after living overseas for so many years.

328
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,660
Are you originally from the north?

329
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:04,980
Also,

330
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,980
when Xian Biyun first arrived
in Sanyangli...

331
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,730
Joseph Lee.

332
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,620
Joseph.

333
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,900
I know this woman well.

334
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,980
She would never marry you for money.

335
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,730
So I'm really curious.

336
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,380
What exactly did she see in you?

337
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,420
Don't tell me
it's because you can't see.

338
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,250
You brought me here,

339
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,900
just so you could listen to

340
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,620
my love story?

341
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,420
Let me be very clear with you.

342
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,050
My love story

343
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,730
is nothing short of tragic

344
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,620
because my fiance

345
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,420
is fighting for her life

346
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,730
in the hospital.

347
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,770
Yet here you are, refusing to let me go.

348
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,620
Liang Jingyuan.

349
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,420
I am the sworn son of the Grand Duke

350
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,530
and you still suspect me
of being an enemy spy.

351
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,330
This is a grave insult

352
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,770
to the Tonoji family!

353
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,530
Let me tell you,

354
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,700
I will never cooperate with you.

355
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,460
I want to see the Colonel right now.

356
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,730
No problem.

357
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,770
But until you give your statement,

358
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,290
you won't be seeing the Colonel.

359
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,860
Because those are the Colonel's orders.

360
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,250
What is it you really want?

361
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,140
You already said it.

362
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,810
The Grand Duke's sworn son.

363
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,940
As long as you cooperate,

364
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,460
I won't make things hard for you.

365
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,660
But honestly,

366
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,460
I'd love to see you refuse.

367
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,490
Back to the point.

368
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,530
Now then,

369
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,660
let me share my theory.

370
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,460
If anything sounds off,

371
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,810
please correct me.

372
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,250
The Colonel got word

373
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,420
that the enemy spy, Bai Ye,
would meet at the Exchange.

374
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,250
But when I got there,

375
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,460
I saw Xian Biyun and you.

376
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,770
But that's fine.

377
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,940
Whether it was back at the Exchange

378
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,980
or later at the checkup,

379
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,980
they were part of my secret search
for Bai Ye.

380
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,460
Just didn't expect

381
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,940
that Bai Ye would be so cunning.

382
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,810
He must know I'm looking for him.

383
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,330
So he hid his stomach problem.

384
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,530
But I believe,

385
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,420
a fellow comrade

386
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,730
would never abandon another comrade.

387
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,620
Even though I haven't found Bai Ye,

388
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,810
it's still good to find his contact.

389
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,290
So,

390
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,660
I had Yi Aida pose as Bai Ye.

391
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,050
She showed up
in front of you a few times

392
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,700
to lure you into making contact.

393
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,730
But I didn't expect

394
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,770
that tonight in Sanyangli,

395
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,900
a radio actually appeared.

396
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,940
Turns out, Bai Ye really

397
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,900
is right here in our institute.

398
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,620
He must've gotten anxious
waiting for his contact.

399
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,660
Couldn't hold it any longer.

400
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,460
And Director Lee,

401
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,730
you're likely covering for him.

402
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,940
Then may I ask you something.

403
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,490
The person, Bai Ye, you just mentioned.

404
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,330
When he was sending the signal,

405
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,900
my fiance was on emergency treatment.

406
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,250
And I am blind.

407
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,530
I can't see a thing.

408
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,660
So how could I possibly cover for him?

409
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,460
You're not wrong.

410
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,460
You can't see anything.

411
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,980
But you have Charlie.

412
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,290
If we go by your logic,

413
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,290
the whole Tonoji family is enemy spies.

414
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,460
It's hard to say they're all family.

415
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:30,980
Yes.

416
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,700
Biyun is still my fiance.

417
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,250
That doesn't exactly make us family.

418
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,900
You know that's not what I meant.

419
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,530
I think Xian Biyun is using
Mrs. Lee's name

420
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,530
to carry out enemy spy activities.

421
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,460
Pure nonsense.

422
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,730
Director Lee,

423
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,700
feel what's under your seat right now.

424
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,380
When I was at your place,

425
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,730
I stumbled upon something interesting.

426
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,530
If you two are really a married couple

427
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,380
and share the same bed every night,

428
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,530
why is only one side
of the mattress sunken in,

429
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,730
while the other side looks brand new,

430
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,530
like no one's ever slept on it?

431
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,290
Did you two sleep stacked
on top of each other?

432
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,620
You've got a dirty mind!

433
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,050
Mind giving me a reasonable explanation?

434
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,940
What they really want

435
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,980
is nothing but what's mine.

436
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,730
I'm going to become

437
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,700
your worst nightmare

438
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,730
for the rest of your life.

439
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,220
As expected, you see every detail.

440
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,980
Biyun and I

441
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,420
haven't actually shared the same bed.

442
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,380
Because I'm a devoted Christian.

443
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,770
Before marriage,

444
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,220
we can't cross the line.

445
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:33,530
Christian? No problem.

446
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,420
Then why make it look like

447
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,380
you were living together?

448
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,700
The bathroom had items for both of you,

449
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,220
stuff you clearly shared.

450
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,770
Was it Mrs. Lee,
with her eye for detail,

451
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,900
who taught you that?

452
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,140
At first, I did share a bed with Biyun.

453
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,860
You know how men are.

454
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,090
We all have moments
when our minds wander.

455
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,980
To keep my boundaries,

456
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,140
I moved to Charlie's room within days.

457
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,980
As for you saying just now

458
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,420
that her bathroom had traces of my life,

459
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,220
that's pretty normal.

460
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,980
Charlie's room does too.

461
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,420
His cabinet even has my towel in it.

462
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,700
You've really thought this through.

463
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,490
But that's alright.

464
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,250
The night is still long.

465
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,900
We can take our time.

466
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,980
I've got all the time I need.

467
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,900
Mr. Lee.

468
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,900
Mr. Lee, are you alright?

469
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,050
My turn now?

470
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,290
Just be honest, and God will bless you.

471
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,660
Director Liang.

472
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:43,980
Have a seat.

473
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,770
You look unwell. Have something warm.

474
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,860
Sit, sit.

475
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,610
I'll get straight to the point.

476
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,740
How much does Director Lee
pay you each month?

477
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,380
Why are you asking that, Director Liang?

478
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,300
I'm just curious.

479
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,380
What's the price tag to

480
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,260
buy loyalty from someone like you?

481
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,740
I need to avenge my brother.

482
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,980
Huan, Huan.

483
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,420
Your brother is gone.

484
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,130
You have to keep living well.

485
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,490
You must survive, no matter what.

486
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,940
Do you remember

487
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,170
what I once said to you?

488
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,530
You have to listen to me.

489
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,170
Put it on.

490
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,530
I've been watching you for a while.

491
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,570
Some of Director Lee's work

492
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,340
was actually done by you.

493
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,860
Yes, that's true.

494
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,380
To be honest, your skills

495
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,340
are no worse than the experts out there.

496
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,340
But here's the thing.

497
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,530
If evidence confirms

498
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,260
Director Lee's betrayal,

499
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,490
that's on him, not you.

500
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,130
The position of director
of the Institute

501
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,530
will be kept open for you.

502
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,300
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Liang.

503
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,940
In chaotic times like these,

504
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,530
who would want to be the hunted deer?

505
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,650
Everyone's chasing an official title,

506
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,740
trying to be a predator instead.

507
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,570
Sit.

508
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,980
Please, have a seat.

509
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,940
To be honest with you, Mr. Liang,

510
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,530
I've wanted the director's job
for a while.

511
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,130
But...

512
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,530
that doesn't mean

513
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,530
we can accuse Mr. Lee
of being an enemy spy.

514
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,340
He can't even see.

515
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,050
How could he possibly send a telegram?

516
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,090
And what about Xian Biyun?

517
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,460
Those two share a lot of secrets.

518
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,340
If those secrets ever came to light,

519
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,530
you'd be dragged into it too.

520
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,460
They're a couple
talking behind closed doors.

521
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,300
Why shouldn't I be told those secrets?

522
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,780
I'm just an outsider, right?

523
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,820
Have you noticed

524
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,490
any unusual details about their life?

525
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,380
Mr. Liang, what would you call

526
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,780
an unusual detail?

527
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,780
Are they close in daily life?

528
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,460
Close? Of course they're close.

529
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,650
Yes.

530
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,530
Before his wife came,

531
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,170
Mr. Lee's meals, sleep,
even bathroom visits,

532
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,530
were all taken care of by me, right?

533
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,380
I was with him all the time.

534
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,610
Then things changed.

535
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,570
Once his wife arrived,
I was like furniture.

536
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,130
Do they argue often?

537
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,300
Argue? Of course they do.

538
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,460
One's from here, one's from abroad.

539
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,130
Their values are just different.

540
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,570
What time do they usually
sleep and wake?

541
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,380
That's not very consistent.

542
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,530
Usually, Mrs. Lee goes to bed
and gets up early.

543
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,860
While Mr. Lee works,

544
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,260
I follow his schedule,
staying up and sleeping in.

545
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,090
Director Lee has a brain condition.

546
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,530
When his illness flares up,

547
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,050
does it disturb Mrs. Lee's rest?

548
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,820
Mr. Liang,

549
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,740
the things you're asking me about

550
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,490
are all what happens
behind closed doors.

551
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,090
How would I know, right?

552
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,980
What if I really need to know?

553
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,820
Mr. Liang, let me think a bit more.

554
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,530
Let me think again.

555
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,260
Just be honest

556
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,420
and God will bless you.

557
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,530
Fine, I'll tell you the truth.

558
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,570
They never lived under the same roof.

559
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,050
How do you know that?

560
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,380
Mr. Lee is a Christian.

561
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,820
Before marriage,
he'd never slept with his wife.

562
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,610
He's always sharing a room with me.

563
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,460
But you know, stuff like this…

564
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,610
You can't really tell anyone.

565
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,980
I mean, all the neighbors think

566
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,380
they're madly in love.

567
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,740
So why don't they live together?

568
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,820
Is there something wrong with that part?

569
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,980
How would he save his face?

570
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,570
That's why... I kept quiet about it.

571
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,900
But Mr. Liang,

572
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,460
to help you catch that enemy spy,

573
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,820
I've told you everything I know.

574
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,530
Just don't say it came from me,

575
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,900
or my life would be over.

576
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,610
Mr. Liang.

577
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,300
Not sure if this counts

578
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,570
as an unusual detail.

579
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,380
Mr. Lee.

580
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,460
Charlie.

581
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:44,820
I'm back.

582
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,980
Slow down.

583
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:57,980
Master.

584
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,820
I'll be straight with you.

585
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,380
The enemy spy now comes down to

586
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,820
you or Joseph Lee.

587
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:16,610
Tell me.

588
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,780
Is it him, or is it you?

589
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,780
Director Liang.

590
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,610
I don't know what method you used,

591
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,090
but somehow you narrowed the suspect

592
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,740
down to just me and Director Lee.

593
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,740
But I can say with certainty,

594
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,260
that person is definitely not me.

595
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,820
You know,

596
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,780
I'm a conflict-avoiding kind of guy,

597
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,380
and honestly, I lack ambition.

598
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,050
My hobbies outside of work

599
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,130
are all trivial and harmless.

600
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,820
Making it to this position today,

601
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,530
I'm already more than content.

602
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,530
I just want to work here,

603
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,820
steadily until I retire,

604
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,900
asking for nothing else.

605
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,900
Being called an enemy spy

606
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,260
is too much for me.

607
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,610
When the enemy spy was meeting someone,

608
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,300
you just happened to be out.

609
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,530
When the telegram was sent,

610
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,860
you happened to be in Sanyangli.

611
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,460
Why do all the coincidences involve you?

612
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,820
You were gone
from the Institute all day.

613
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,610
Don't tell me

614
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,530
you were out somewhere wasting the day.

615
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:30,980
I do have reasons I can't speak of.
