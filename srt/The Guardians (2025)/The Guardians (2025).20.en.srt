[General Affairs Office]

4
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,290
Right now only my department
is short-staffed.

5
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,290
If you still want this job,

6
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,260
do your work properly.

7
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,180
Stop thinking about going back
to the Decryption Section.

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,020
Otherwise, just quit.

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,100
I won't stop you.

10
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,380
Mr. Lee.

11
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,660
Do you need something from me?

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,740
Ms. Ye.

13
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,380
Charlie went to get my medicine,

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,890
so I had to personally
bring you these receipts.

15
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,060
You could've just called me

16
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,260
and I'd have come up for you.

17
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,380
You don't have to come in person.

18
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,500
Director Lee, just give them to me.

19
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,100
Alright, thank you.

20
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,100
I'm heading to Renji Hospital now.

21
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,100
Tomorrow we're doing
a physical check-up.

22
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,820
Liang gave me very short notice.

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,940
I must hurry.

24
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,220
Take care.

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,820
Since you can't do it well,

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,500
why force yourself?

27
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,570
With Mr. Yi's salary,

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,100
it should be enough
to support one daughter.

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,820
Work shouldn't be only for a salary.

30
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,980
Man is a working animal.

31
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,780
What distinguishes humans from animals

32
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,380
should be labor.

33
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,940
If you put it that way,

34
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,380
then all those young ladies
and wives who stay home

35
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,980
aren't human?

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,820
Wives staying home

37
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,660
are their husband's private property.

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,820
And women who marry for a living

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,060
are essentially selling
themselves into marriage.

40
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,660
That's not the life I want.

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,130
Miss Yi.

42
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,100
I personally appreciate
independent modern women.

43
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,260
But a person

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,220
shouldn't mistreat their own health.

45
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,660
You vomited so badly just now.

46
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,260
Is your stomach unwell?

47
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,850
Charlie's back.

48
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:24,980
I'll take my leave.

49
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,850
Open the door.

50
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,050
Wait a moment.

51
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,610
Open up.

52
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,170
Thank you.

53
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,290
Mr. Shen.

55
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,980
It's already afternoon.

56
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,850
I overslept.

57
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,610
Don't tell Director Liang.

58
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,730
Charlie.

59
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,290
Mr. Lee.

60
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,850
What are you doing here?

61
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,170
I came down to submit
receipts for reimbursement.

62
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,410
You can just leave such things to me.

63
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,050
You don't need to come yourself.

64
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,290
Thank you, Miss Yi.

65
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,170
You're welcome.

66
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,090
Much appreciated, Miss Yi.

67
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,850
That Amu

68
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,970
is like a ghost,

69
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,140
appearing from nowhere.

70
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,890
He walks without making a sound.

71
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,650
I was scared.

72
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,890
I'm telling you, Ding Yi.

73
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,410
No matter what,

74
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,020
I won't let you act alone.

75
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,890
Understand?

76
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,090
You're not yet capable
of acting independently.

77
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,650
You're not mature enough.

78
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,530
What are you talking about?

79
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,890
Look at you.

80
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,210
Getting sensitive again, aren't you?

[Principles of Cryptography]

82
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,140
Ms. Xian asks me to perform a task,

83
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,970
and I'm immature?

84
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,740
When you asked me to help you before,

85
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,890
you thought
I could handle things on my own.

86
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,140
Mr. Shen.

87
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,210
Charlie.

88
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,580
I have read your work before.

89
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,290
It was very enlightening.

90
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,890
I have a small request.

91
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,970
Could I trouble you for an autograph?

92
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,020
There's no problem with that.

93
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,970
But I don't deserve your admiration.

94
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,740
Mr. Lee is the real master here.

95
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,140
What I know is just superficial.

96
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,140
Superficial.

97
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,180
That's a nice pen you have.

98
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,180
Where did you buy it?

99
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,890
Master.

100
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,210
I've been looking for you everywhere.

101
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,770
The meeting has been waiting for you
to start.

102
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,140
Sorry, Charlie.

103
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,740
I'll sign it later, okay?

104
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,170
How is it?

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,740
Chongqing's

106
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,530
investigation results
on Yi Xiuyuan have arrived.

107
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,170
Your suspicions were correct.

108
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,980
The Japanese helped
Liang Jingyuan rise to power,

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,980
and in exchange,

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,170
Liang Jingyuan would persuade

111
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,380
Yi Xiuyuan and other cryptography
experts to defect to Japan.

112
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,740
Among these experts,

113
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,220
many have received training
from American experts.

114
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,380
More or less, they all know some secrets

115
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,220
about the U.S. military to help our army

116
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,460
establish the Xige Code system.

117
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,930
Chongqing also suspects

118
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,570
that the materials Yi Xiuyuan took away

119
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,100
likely included

120
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,460
discarded drafts from
the design of the Xige Code.

121
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,930
If that's true,

122
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,220
their decryption time
would be greatly reduced.

123
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,170
Since its launch,

124
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,980
the Xige Code has consistently won.

125
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,170
It's our strongest fortress

126
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,570
in the code war,

127
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,220
so it must not be cracked
by the Japanese.

128
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,460
Chongqing

129
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,620
is eager to know

130
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,770
their decryption progress,

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,810
preferably in real-time.

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,980
But Liang Jingyuan
doesn't trust Joseph Lee.

133
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,740
Ding Yi can't get involved.

134
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,860
I can only wait until

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,100
tomorrow, and think of a plan

136
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,980
when Liang Jingyuan organizes everyone

137
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,220
for physical check-ups.

138
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,050
Help me investigate someone.

139
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,930
Who?

140
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,220
Forget it.

141
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,380
Is the food bad?

142
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,100
Too much vinegar?

143
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,930
Is it sour?

144
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,170
Just right.

145
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,980
Just right.

146
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,860
I'm done eating.

147
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,570
Ms. Xian,

148
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,260
Yi Aida does have a stomach disease.

149
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:44,860
Well,

150
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,620
I heard her vomiting in the institute.

151
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,980
And she actually knows code-breaking.

152
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,740
How do you know she knows code-breaking?

153
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,980
I overheard it.

154
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,980
In the office,

155
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,740
Ye Yin gave Yi Aida a scolding.

156
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,980
And then she said,

157
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,260
she's actually best at code-breaking.

158
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,690
So she wants to work with
Yi Xiuyuan like before.

159
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,980
So I think

160
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,220
Yi Aida

161
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,220
is very likely
the one we're looking for.

162
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,460
Think about it,
she's been to the Stock Exchange,

163
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,810
has a stomach disease,
and knows code-breaking.

164
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,930
Did you say anything you shouldn't have?

165
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,100
Of course not, I'm not stupid.

166
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,860
Oh right,
there's another very important thing.

167
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,980
That jerk Liang Jingyuan

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,620
is organizing everyone

169
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,620
to go to Renji Hospital
for checkups tomorrow.

170
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,100
So I think,

171
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,100
he may have also gotten some intel.

172
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,530
He's trying to find out
who has stomach trouble.

173
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,260
I'm going out.

174
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,460
Alright.

175
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,570
Ms. Xian.

176
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,290
I...

177
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,020
You two talk.

178
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,570
I...

179
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,690
I'll just sit here for a bit of tea.

180
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,530
You go upstairs first.

181
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,170
I have something
to talk over with Ms. Xian.

182
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,530
Then I'll go upstairs for tea.

183
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,690
Get in.

184
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,690
Ms. Xian.

185
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,050
I need the keys for Yi Xiuyuan

186
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,930
and Shen Wanqing's offices.

187
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,170
What does that have to do with me?

188
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,810
Ye Yin is the head of
General Affairs Office.

189
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,530
I know she has keys

When do you need them?

195
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,890
The sooner the better.

196
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,170
I must have the keys
before tomorrow's physical check-ups.

197
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,340
I'll just use them once.

198
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,410
No one will find out.

199
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,690
You're asking for them too urgently.

200

Now Liang Jingyuan already
has his eyes on me.

Any unnecessary move

202
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,410

Don't worry, Ms. Xian.

204
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,930
I won't leave any trace,

to investigate on Lin Changying.

00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,740
we'll arrange
a childhood betrothal for them.

If they're of the same gender,
it's no problem.

00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,330
Because sometimes,

My cooperation with Ms. Xian

00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,290
is just expedient.

Because you're in the middle of it.

375
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,370
This is Charlie speaking.

376
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,810
Alright, thank you, Secretary Jiang.

377
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,770
I'll pass it on to Mr. Lee.

378
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,740
Goodbye.

379
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,770
The check-up is canceled.

380
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,290
The check-up location has been changed.

381
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,850
It's been moved to the Army Hospital.

382
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,050
Wait.

383
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,370
Where are you going?

384
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,260
I'm going to get your documents.

385
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,090
Don't slip up.

386
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,370
What do we do now?

387
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,500
Get in the car.

388
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,290
Director Lee, Mrs. Lee.

389
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,050
Going for the check-up?

390
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,260
Mr. Shen, is there anything?

391
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,020
Where's Charlie?

392
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,090
Charlie went to get something for me.

393
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,260
Do you need him, Mr. Shen?

394
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,330
Here is the thing,

395
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,330
as you both know,

396
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,850
we weren't at the institute
the day before yesterday,

397
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,330
but that communist

398
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,770
just happened to act that day.

399
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,740
We were caught off guard.

400
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,850
I was hurriedly called back.

401
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,500
My car is still there.

402
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,980
I originally wanted to
go get it back today,

403
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,610
but then a physical check-up
was suddenly arranged.

404
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,050
You see,

405
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,020
how can I go for
the check-up without a car?

406
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,570
I don't quite understand what you mean.

407
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,810
Do you want a ride in my car

408
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,740
to the hospital for the check-up?

409
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,090
But sorry,

410
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,290
I...

411
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,370
Director Lee is truly brilliant.

412
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,890
Me, and my two apprentices,

413
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,060
Li Huan and Li Yu.

414
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,570
Mr. Shen, why don't you

415
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,610
ask your two beloved apprentices

416
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,300
to help you retrieve the car?

417
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,650
They're just my apprentices.

418
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,780
There are some things a master

419
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,130
cannot let his apprentices know.

420
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,540
I promised Director Liang

421
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,610
I would never go to that place again.

422
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,330
It's only been two days, and if I go,

423
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,300
wouldn't that be bad?

424
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,300
If Charlie could incidentally help me

425
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,060
retrieve the car,

426
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,090
that would be wonderful.

427
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,130
My car is parked at No. 37 Lvban Road.

428
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,130
The keys are with Miss Huang Susu.

429
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,850
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

430
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,570
As you can see,

431
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,020
my wife is driving today.

432
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,330
I cannot allow my wife

433
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,850
to be a driver for other men.

434
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,090
Director Lee.

435
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,810
My apologies, Mr. Shen.

436
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,890
It's fine that they don't want us
hitch a ride,

437
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,370
but why did they get angry?

438
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,570
I didn't expect Liang Jingyuan
to have a backup plan.

439
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,780
Now, it's definitely too late

440
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,890
to stop the check-ups.

441
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,300
When we get to the hospital later,

442
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,890
I'll watch Yi Aida.

443
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,020
You watch Dong Jinbo, Liu Fangbai,

444
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,090
and Shen Wanqing.

445
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,300
Alright.

Everyone's here.

Mrs. Lee.

You can sit here.

00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,260
It's fine, there are seats inside.

454
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,130
Hello, Mrs. Lee.

455
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,740
Miss Yi.

456
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,890
Ms. Xian.

457
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,130
Come sit down.

458
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,740
Are you feeling better?

459
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,500
After taking the medicine you sent,

460
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,500
I'm really much better.

461
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,700
Good that it worked.

462
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,740
Only women understand best

463
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,060
how bad this pain feels.

464
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,090
I'll give you
the prescription another day.

465
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,500
Next time your period comes,

466
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,740
you'll be prepared in advance.

467
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,810
Ms. Xian, you are really kind.

468
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,650
Now I know

469
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,330
why Director Lee
cares about you so much.

470
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,130
Does he?

471
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,890
I once read a book,

472
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,610
advocating for women's liberation.

473
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,410
The book said

474
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,740
the only reason for
men and women to unite

475
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,300
should be mutual admiration.

476
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,540
That is true monogamy.

477
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,460
I seem to see
what marriage should be like

478
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,820
from you and Director Lee.

479
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,940
What's the name of the book?
I'd like to read it too.

480
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,170
Sorry, I can't recall it at the moment.

481
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,770
Next.

482
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,570
I'll go in first.

483
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,250
Inhale.

484
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,460
Exhale.

485
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,650
Inhale.

486
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,650
Exhale.

487
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,540
Now, let's check your stomach.

488
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,650
Do you feel any discomfort
when I press here?

489
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:07,820
Relax.

490
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,210
Miss Yi.

491
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,690
Your stomach might have a problem.

492
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,940
I recommend further examination.

493
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,420
Hello, Director.

494
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,250
Director.

495
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,860
I've got a family to support.

496
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,210
Director.

497
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,060
How is it?

498
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,650
How is it?

499
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,380
Nothing serious.

500
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,460
Just a minor stomach problem.

501
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,860
It's common in our line of work.

502
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,460
You're right.

503
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,340
When it gets busy, you forget to eat.

504
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,130
Nobody's stomach can take it.

505
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,380
Isn't this perfect?

506
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,650
While the institute
is paying for check-ups,

507
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,860
we can get a thorough check.

508
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,020
To be honest with you two,

509
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,460
I thought that
I'd definitely see Japanese doctors

510
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,460
at a Japanese hospital.

511
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,130
For easier communication,

512
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,820
I even learned a few Japanese phrases.

513
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,420
Thank you.

514
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,170
But it's still a Chinese doctor.

515
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,730
Look at you.

516
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,820
Dong Jinbo.

517
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,290
Goodbye.

518
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:06,900
Director Lee.

519
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,060
You're here.

520
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,730
There's no waiting area outside.

521
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,170
How about I take you inside first?

522
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,650
Thank you.

523
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,540
This way.

524
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,380
Doctor.

525
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,420
This is our director.

526
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,210
His eyes are not good,

527
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,980
and there's no place to rest outside.

528
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,650
How about letting him get checked first?

529
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,170
Okay.

530
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,860
No need, rules are rules.

531
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,170
I don't mind waiting.

532
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,820
Please sit and rest for a while.

533
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,420
Thank you.

534
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,170
Careful.

535
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,380
Director Lee, then I'll go before you.

536
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,090
This way.

537
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,250
Take off your coat.

538
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:44,820
Okay.

539
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,340
Miss Yi.

540
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,340
You should pay attention to your diet.

541
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,980
Don't eat raw, cold, spicy food anymore.

542
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,820
Okay.

543
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,650
It's alright, I'll pick it up.

544
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,460
Sorry.

545
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,130
Thank you, doctor.

546
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,860
Alright, pay attention to rest and diet.

547
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,380
Okay.

548
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,540
Next.

549
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,940
Ms. Xian.

550
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,210
I'm going to the next check-up.

551
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,060
Doctor.

552
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,380
Anything wrong with my stomach?

553
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,020
Just a minor stomach ulcer.

554
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,380
But you must be careful.

555
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,460
If you continue to eat irregularly,

556
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,460
it's very likely to get worse

557
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,730
and develop into stomach cancer.

558
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,090
That serious?

559
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,460
Could you prescribe
some medicine for my stomach?

560
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,170
Sorry.

561
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,650
We are only responsible
for physical examinations here.

562
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,020
Thank you.

563
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,340
Next.

564
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,820
I'm heading back then.

565
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,130
Mr. Shen, you go first.

566
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,250
Take care of yourself.

567
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,690
Mr. Shen.

568
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,690
Director Lee.

569
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,340
I thought it was my turn.

570
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,570
Shen Wanqing, right?

571
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:20,820
It is your turn.

572
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,380
Come, this way.

573
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,210
Please.

574
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,460
Bend your legs.

575
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,250
Tell me if you feel any discomfort.

576
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:44,900
Okay.

577
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,210
Deep breath.

578
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,170
Exhale.

579
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,420
Does it hurt here?

580
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,250
No.

581
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,090
Here?

582
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,210
No.

583
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,500
And here?

584
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:02,610
No.

585
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,060
How does it feel here?

586
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,340
No pain, it's fine.

587
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,650
And here?

588
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,290
No.

589
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,770
Does it hurt here?

590
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,020
Director Lee.

591
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,130
It's really not easy for you

592
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,860
code researchers.

593
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:25,500
See?

594
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,860
He just fell asleep.

595
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,340
Must have worked hard.

596
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:30,730
Done.

597
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,380
Did I fall asleep?

598
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,130
Sorry.

599
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,250
Is there anything wrong with me?

600
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,540
Everything's fine.

601
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,690
Go to the next check-up.

602
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,900
Okay.

603
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,340
Thank you.

604
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,500
Director Lee, I'll head out first.

605
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,380
Master.

606
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,420
Mr. Shen, are you alright?

607
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,340
I'm fine.

608
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,060
That's good.

609
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,860
You all keep queuing.

610
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,980
Goodbye, Mr. Shen.

611
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,460
Charlie.

612
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,650
So you're saying

613
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,980
it's most likely that Bai Ye is Yi Aida?

614
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,420
No, that's not right.

615
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,730
Dong Jinbo and Liu Fangbai
could also be Bai Ye.

616
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,420
Comrade Bai Ye has always been
very cautious.

617
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,820
When he was undercover
in the Northeast before,

618
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,860
he always relied on his handler, Hei,

619
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,460
to help him procure stomach medicine.

620
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,820
So he absolutely didn't want

621
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,210
anyone else to know
he had a stomach disease.

622
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,860
According to your description just now,

623
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,820
these two people

624
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,340
had no intention of hiding
their stomach diseases at all.

625
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,730
In contrast, Yi Aida

626
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,170
secretly swapped her examination report.

627
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,380
She also didn't want anyone
to know she had a stomach disease.

628
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:26,250
Yes.

629
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,020
Last time at the Stock Exchange,

630
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,540
when Bai Ye discovered the ambush,

631
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,980
he must have realized

632
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,860
he had attracted
Liang Jingyuan's attention.

633
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,170
And this time,
Liang Jingyuan inexplicably

634
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,290
organized everyone
for a physical check-up.

635
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,540
Bai Ye probably guessed

636
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,130
Liang Jingyuan also got wind
of his stomach disease.

637
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,380
So he would definitely
hide his condition.

638
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,420
Right?

639
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,400
Right.

640
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,900
Are there any problems
with Shen Wanqing's calculation drafts?

641
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,460
His calculation drafts
are filled with solution approaches.

642
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,060
But every single one is wrong.

643
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,540
Some are wrong in the formulas,

644
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,020
some are wrong in the substitutions.

645
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,900
Isn't that a good thing?

646
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,130
To crack a code

647
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,650
is like walking in the dark.

648
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,380
But there are traps everywhere.

649
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,060
With Yi Xiuyuan's ability,

650
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,380
he only wrote two or three methods
in his drafts

651
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,770
and he's still stuck in the traps.

652
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,420
But as for Shen Wanqing,

653
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,130
in his calculation drafts,

654
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,650
there are at least
20 solution approaches.

655
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,170
But just as each approach
reaches success,

656
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,460
it's cleverly steered away by him.

657
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,420
It's as if he already knows
the correct answer,

658
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,170
but is deliberately taking detours

659
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,500
to avoid the correct answer.

660
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,420
Are you saying Shen Wanqing's already...

661
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,290
That's right.

662
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,860
I suspect Shen Wanqing

663
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,340
has already cracked the Xige Code

664
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,650
but he hasn't reported it yet.

665
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,210
Not only hasn't he reported it,

666
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,540
he submits a different

667
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,060
incorrect answer every day

668
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,340
to conceal the fact that
he has already cracked it.

669
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,020
Good, I'll send these photos

670
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,860
back to Chongqing soon.

671
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,020
Okay.

672
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,380
These crumpled ones are Shen Wanqing's.

673
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:12,860
