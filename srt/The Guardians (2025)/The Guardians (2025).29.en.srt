Has the decoding result

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,460
of Sasaki's private radio come out?

5
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,540
Lock down top floor; Target the doctor.

6
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,660
I'm truly sorry.

7
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,380
The surgery dragged on for too long.

8
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,460
The patient's brain vessels
were already too strained.

9
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,660
We had to perform cranial surgery,

10
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,450
but the Grand Duke
didn't make it through.

11
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,940
What did you just say?

12
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,940
If it had been Dr. Edward performing it,

13
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,100
there might have been a chance.

14
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,340
Please accept my condolences.

15
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,130
Everyone, get out!

16
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,820
Sasaki must be taken down.

Young Master.

18
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,380
How's the Master doing?

19
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,820
Master is still
the same as always.

20
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,820
Have you checked out the location yet?

21
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,660
Already checked.

22
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,540

23
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,780

26
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,980
The military police
will investigate tomorrow.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,380
So we need to act fast.

28
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,100
Here, these are
Liang Jingyuan's letters.

29
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,540
They'll help you
copy his handwriting.

30
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,820
Got it, young master.

31
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,660
Wait.

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,380

34

Keep the rest for yourself.

35

Thank you, young master.

36
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,980
Didn't you want to get back at Sasaki?

37
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,940
I'll make it happen for you now.

38
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,340
Once the job's done,

39
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,100
I can spare your wife's life.

40
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,700
Can we really trust this guy?

41
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,340
Will he really go along with our plan?

42
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,340
What other choice does he have?

43
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,340
Either way,

44
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,540
we can't let him go in alone.

45
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,700
I'll escort him inside.

46
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,700
When the moment comes,

47
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,220
I'll make sure he fulfills

48
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,980
his promise to the Tonoji family.

49
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,100
There's no turning back from this.

50
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,700
Since the Shogunate Era,

51
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,660
my ancestors have served your family.

52
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,580
We've been your vassals for generations.

53
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,780
It's my duty to sacrifice
for the Tonoji family.

54
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,100
Miss Megumi,

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,780
to avenge the Grand Duke is my honor.

56
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,460
Please grant me this.

57
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,700
Thank you.

58
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,340
Everyone,

59
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,220
tonight,

60
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,460
we're walking into a war.

61
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,140
The outcome of this war

62
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,900
is the pride and honor
of the Tonoji family.

63
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,980
Now,

64
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,580
the Sasaki family is coming to

65
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,100
take it all right out of your hands.

66
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,580
Doesn't that make you angry?

67
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,980
Yes!

68
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,900
Then stand with me, fight with me.

69
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,700
Let's move!

70
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,020
In the book of fate,

71
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,140
our names are written side by side.

72
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,420
Did you handle Liang Jingyuan?

73
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,500
Liang Jingyuan divulged
a list of secret agents

74
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,420
the Wang Government planted
inside the Public Concession.

75
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,740
Cao Yuanzhong still needs to verify it.

76
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,380
Once confirmed, he'll make his move.

77
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,180
You still trust Cao Yuanzhong?

78
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,180
I don't.

79
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,490
But to Cao Yuanzhong, Liang Jingyuan

80
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,100
is a sworn enemy.

81
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,770
That's the first reason.

82
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,010
And the second one.

83
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,580
This is a huge win handed to him.

84
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,940
Cao Yuanzhong won't pass this up.

85
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,580
What's wrong with the radio?

86
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,460
The radio's just too big.

87
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,820
Carrying it out like this

88
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,730
is way too conspicuous.

89
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,940
It could easily draw unwanted attention.

90
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,580
Hold on.

91
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,700
This is the radio
for the Sword Thrust Operation.

92
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,850
Where exactly are you taking it?

93
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,300
Do you still want to carry out
that doomed plan?

94
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,220
You'll get yourself killed, Gu Yangshan.

95
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,580
Luo Han, I didn't get a chance
to explain.

96
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,770
Next, I'm going to fake evidence

97
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,770
that Liang Jingyuan
went to Yuyin Pavilion.

98
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,890
So Sasaki will think
he's the one working with you.

99
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,300
As long as Cao Yuanzhong takes him out

100
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,650
and cleans up the body.

101
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,010
Then...

102
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,460
he'll be the BIS officer who rescues you

103
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,770
and the one who killed Sasaki's son.

104
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,820
And no one would ever suspect me.

105
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,180
I can keep carrying out the operation.

106
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,820
And then?

107
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,580
Then you can stay here,

108
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,610
and work with Ding Yi and the others.

109
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,460
What?

110
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,730
You still don't get it?

111
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,010
The problem isn't Sasaki anymore,

112
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,820
the Cryptography Institute
is crawling with red bandits.

113
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,650
They dared snatch the codebook from me.

114
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,340
That means we've completely fallen out.

115
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,180
They'll never let you stay here again.

116
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,580
Come back to Chongqing with me.

117
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,700
I'm not going back to Chongqing.

118
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,940
Until the Sword Thrust Operation
is done,

119
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,890
I'm not going anywhere.

120
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,770
No matter what's going on

121
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,770
at the Cryptography Institute,

122
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,610
I'm with the Pacification Committee now.

123
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,060
I still have a chance.

124
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,730
In that case,

125
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,770
why am I the one who has to leave?

126
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,100
That's exactly what I want to ask you.

127
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,100
Why do I have to be the one to go?

128
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,580
Luo Han.

129
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,980
Since you came back from Yuyin Pavilion,

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,610
you've been talking to me in an odd way.

131
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,420
What exactly are you trying to say?

132
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,890
Alright.

133
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,650
Here's the deal.

134
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,650
Give me a little more time.

135
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,420
I'll drive Ding Yi out of the picture.

136
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,100
But let me tell you this,

137
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,580
the Sword Thrust Operation

138
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,820
must go on.

139
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,100
If you insist on staying,

140
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,220
I'll report it
when I get back to Chongqing.

141
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,220
Secretary Mao will send someone
to deal with them.

142
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,610
It won't affect your operation.

143
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,460
My operation?

144
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,180
Is this my operation?

145
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,220
Stop using

146
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,300
your usual excuses to handle things

147

to persuade or brush me off.

148
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,180
Collaborating with the Communists
is a severe crime.

149
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,220
I must report it

150
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,700
to prevent it from blowing up later.

151
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,820
Deputy Commander Gu will protect you,

152
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,460
and I'll be the scapegoat.

I don't know why you're staying.

156
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,460
It isn't to execute the operation.

157
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,180

the Communist Party

158

161
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,460

162
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:06,820

163
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,580

168

one by one, we drifted apart.

169

No, we didn't drift apart.

170
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,580
We were never truly on the same path.

171
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,770
I shouldn't have joined you
in that madness from the start.

172
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,100

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,650
Understood.

188
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,010
Go now.

189
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,890
Yes, sir.

190
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,770
Report, Major General.

191
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,610
Joseph Lee is here to pay his respects.

192
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,890
Perfect timing.

193
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,890
Major General invites Mr. Lee inside.

194
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,300
Thank you.

195
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,130
I see.

196
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,490
Miss Megumi.

197
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,490
What?

198
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,060
You're going to die.

199
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,980
Major General.

200
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,850
The Tonoji family plans to kill you.

201
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,220
Don't you care about your wife's life?

202
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,570
Get ready to move.

203
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,570
Yes.

204
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,570
Mr. Lee.

205
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,250
What on earth is going on here?

206
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,250
Major General.

207
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,460
Grand Duke Tonoji has passed away.

208
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,900
Right now, everyone in the Tonoji family

209
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,460
believes that you caused his death.

210
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,700
So they sent me to take revenge for him.

211
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,180
But deep down, I know

212
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,940
this is all part of Lin Megumi's scheme.

213
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,700
She wants me to die together with you.

214
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,090
But I don't want to die.

215
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,250
I want to make a deal with you.

216
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,220
I was the one who killed the Grand Duke.

217
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

218
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,900
You ruined my son's
Spirit Transfer Ritual.

219
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,940
You startled his spirit,
leaving him with no peace.

220
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,620
I can't let you walk out of here alive.

221
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,980
What else do you want to trade with me?

222
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,460
We can talk now.

223
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,380
A bomb.

224
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,220
Everyone, stop!

225
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,090
Nobody move.

226
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,460
There's an ambush outside.

227
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,700
Step out and you're done for.

228
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,980
Take them to the back hall.

229
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,940
Take them to the back hall.

230
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,050
Mr. Lee.

231
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,700
What tricks
does your Tonoji family still have?

232
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,180
I'm genuinely curious.

233
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,730
Lin Megumi wants you dead

234
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,700
to avenge the Grand Duke.

235
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,940
But she knows this place
is heavily guarded.

236
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,460
A direct assault
from outside wouldn't work.

237
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,620
So...

238
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,730
she threatened me with my wife's life,

239
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,460
forced me to strap on a bomb
to blow you up.

240
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,180
Just now, this person...

241
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,900
The moment he pulls the fuse on me,

242
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,730
no one here will walk out alive.

243
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,940
Once the people outside hear the blast,

244
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,940
they'll rush in
and wipe out the survivors.

245
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,730
Why does Lin Megumi suspect me?

246
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,460
Major General,

247
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,900
you have a private radio.

248
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,140
A few days ago,
you sent a coded message.

249
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,660
The content of that message was,

250
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,460
"Lock down top floor;
Target the doctor."

251
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,860
Am I right?

252
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,140
Now Dr. Edward has been poisoned

253
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,730
and can't operate on the Grand Duke,

254
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,220
which led to the Grand Duke's death.

255
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,220
And Lin Megumi has already found

256
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,660
that private radio of yours.

257
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,180
So,

258
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,250
as things stand,

259
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,250
Lin Megumi is convinced

260
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,180
that you're the one who did it.

261
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,980
You can't deny it anymore.

262
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,220
My men at the hospital
haven't made a move.

263
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,180
This has nothing to do with me.

264
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,220
But now even your radio operator

265
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,700
has been captured by Lin Megumi.

266
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,250
If that operator reveals your name,

267
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,700
do you think

268
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,620
the leadership will still believe

269
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,620
the Duke's death is unrelated to you?

270
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,940
Mr. Lee,

271
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,090
let's hear your terms.

272
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,900
My wife

273
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,700
is being held hostage
at the Army Hospital

274
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,460
by Lin Megumi.

275
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,700
You need to notify your people right now

276
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,980
to rescue my wife.

277
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,770
My wife knows

278
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,980
where Megumi is keeping

279
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,980
your radio operator.

280
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,940
And she can help you
wipe out the evidence.

281
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,700
You're the sworn son
of the Tonoji family,

282
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,460
yet you come here telling me this.

283
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,980
How can I not be suspicious?

284
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,460
That this is the Tonoji family

285
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,900
setting yet another trap for me.

286
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,980
This is me showing my good faith.

287
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,420
From this moment on,

288
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,700
I, Joseph Lee, and the Tonoji family

289
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,620
are completely done with each other.

290
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,220
Still no movement?

291
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,220
Not at all.

292
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,570
Things are getting more interesting.

293
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,460
Joseph Lee.

294
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,260
My people will soon get your wife out.

295
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,330
But right now,

296
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,050
if you don't tell me everything

297
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,770
exactly as you know it,

298
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,770
I can still have her killed.

299
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,260
Bring Xian Biyun here.

300
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,770
Yes, sir.

301
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,220
You,

302
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,500
bring Xian Biyun here.

303
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,570
Yes.

304
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,500
Major General.

305
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,940
There's no time left.

306
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,330
Lin Megumi and the Tonoji family

307
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,500
are lying in wait outside.

308
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,770
I've been in here for so long.

309
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,180
With no explosion,

310
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,530
she's going to get suspicious.

311
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,980
They'll storm in any minute.

312
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,020
It'll lead to
a destructive fight with you.

313
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,810
She sent you as a sacrificial pawn

314
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,020
because she's too afraid

315
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,020
to charge in and go down with me.

316
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,740
You can keep talking without worry.

317
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,530
Major General Sasaki

318
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,660
let me ask you

319
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,460
where our radio operator is being held.

320
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,370
Lin Megumi said,

321
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,370
it was my son who poisoned Dr. Edward.

322
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,290
That's right.

323
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,260
Now she's still spreading it everywhere.

324
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,420
The night before Dr. Edward fell ill,

325
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,700
she saw a man with a scar on his palm

326
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,050
dressed as a doctor,

327
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,260
handing Dr. Edward a poisoned folder.

328
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,740
That's ridiculous.

329
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,420
Taro is a mathematician.

330
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,660
He's never even killed a chicken,

331
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,260
let alone poisoned anyone.

332
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,700
But with just that scar on the palm

333
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,530
and your secret telegram,

334
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,260
it's enough for her to accuse you

335
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,700
before the Japanese military leadership.

336
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,740
As long as Taro is still alive,

337
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,810
her lie falls apart instantly.

338
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,420
How could the Tonoji family

339
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,460
be so foolish?

340
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,570
Major General,

341
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,220
you can't believe that Taro was killed

342
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,700
by an anti-Japanese operative, right?

343
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,740
Lin Megumi.

344
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,420
Major General,

345
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,180
right now the Tonoji family members

346
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,220
are lying in wait outside.

347
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,740
With your skills,

348
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,260
you could launch a surprise attack

349
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,220
and wipe them out completely.

350
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,740
If the leadership asks later,

351
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,770
everyone here tonight

352
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,220
can testify for you

353
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,770
that it was them who struck first,

354
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,220
and you were only defending yourself.

355
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,740
Miss Megumi, please show up.

356
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,980
Miss Megumi, please show up.

357
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,660
Miss Megumi, please show up.

358
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,810
Miss Megumi.

359
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,900
Miss Megumi.

360
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,260
Miss Megumi.

361
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,260
Should we go in now?

362
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,980
Hold on.

363
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,020
It's a trap.

364
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,180
A message just came from the hospital.

365
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,290
Xian Biyun helped us find our radio

366
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,290
and the operator.

367
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,770
But the operator already confessed.

368
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,460
Lin Megumi got our transmission records.

369
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,260
It's likely reported to the leadership.

370
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,980
Tell him to deal with the traitor.

371
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,500
Then bring Xian Biyun here.

372
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,770
I have questions for her.

373
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,020
Understood.

374
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,180
Understood.

375
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,940
What do you think, Major General?

376
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,180
I wasn't lying, was I?

377
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,290
I'll wait for her to show up.

378
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,020
Let her explain herself.

379
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,770
You want to confront Lin Megumi?

380
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,980
But she seems to be hiding something.

381
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,660
She thinks it's just a trap in there.

382
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,260
She's not coming in at all.

383
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,740
What if I have a way

384
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,740
to get her inside?

385
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,900
How's that?

386
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,020
Hurry!

387
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,020
Hurry!

388
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,180
Hurry!

389
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,020
It's time.

390
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,220
Go in with me!

391
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,980
Yes.

392
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,420
It's a trap. Get out.

393
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,180
Yes.

394
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,220
Lin Megumi.

395
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,500
So you really do want me dead.

396
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,420
You framed me for plotting
against the Duke.

397
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,420
I've informed General Yasui.

398
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,740
He's on his way now.

399
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,660
As long as you face the trial calmly

400
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,090
and tell everything truthfully,

401
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,330
the Tonoji family can still survive.

402
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,740
Otherwise, stirring up infighting

403
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,220
is enough to get your family wiped out.

404
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,130
You need to think this through.

405
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,900
Your son poisoned Dr. Edward.

406
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,940
I saw it with my own eyes.

407
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,090
Is that what you call framing too?

408
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,050
And that con man?

409
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,180
You mean Joseph Lee?

410
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,940
He's an imposter.

411
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,740
His real name is Ding Yi.

412
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,260
He's a true anti-Japanese operative.

413
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,530
He murdered Joseph Lee,

414
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,260
then took over his identity.

415
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,700
Major General.

416
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,090
Isn't that exactly what I just said?

417
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,850
She'll accuse me
of being an anti-Japanese operative.

418
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,420
She might even claim I'm not Joseph Lee.

419
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,740
If I guessed right,

420
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,740
next...

421
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,420
she'll say right away,

422
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,090
I'm just

423
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,370
an actress in my wife's troupe.

424
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,460
She might even insult me,

425
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,460
claiming I'm not really blind.

426
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,610
Major General,

427
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,460
she's completely lost it.

428
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,850
This woman

429
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,660
is desperate
to inherit the Tonoji family.

430
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,090
She'll say anything to get it.

431
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,500
But Miss Megumi,

432
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,740
you should know,

433
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,260
I've worked with the Major General

434
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,700
for a full year.

435
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,090
If I weren't Joseph Lee,

436
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,740
how would I know how to design a cipher?

437
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,130
How could I help the Major General solve

438
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,940
one tricky problem after another?

439
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,900
Are Dr. Miyamoto,

440
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,850
Lieutenant Colonel Takeda,
Liang Jingyuan,

441
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,130
and even Major General all fools?

442
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,610
Yes, they are.

443
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,130
Of course, they are.

444
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,850
The cipher intelligence system
of the China Expeditionary Army in Shanghai,

445
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,090
from top to bottom,

446
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:39,130
has been spun around
by a small-time actor.

447
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,940
If that's not foolish, what is?

448
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,500
Lin Megumi,

449
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,220
you're nothing but a nobody.

450
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,850
You have no right
to insult the Imperial Army.

451
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,940
I'll ask you one last time.

452
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,610
Was Taro's death

453
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,740
connected to you?

454
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,500
Sadly, no.

455
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,370
But I can promise you this.

456
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,660
Your death will definitely be
linked to me.

457
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,740
You little brat, go to hell.

458
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,940
Or maybe you should go first.

459
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,730
So you could see all along.

460
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,780
Knew you were a liar.

461
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,860
Joseph.

462
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,380
Joseph.

463
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,300
Joseph.

464
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,820
A bomb, it's a bomb!

465
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,690
Joseph.

466
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,730
Stay back.

467
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,980
Don't come any closer.

468
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,570
The grip's already loose.

469
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,500
I can't hold on much longer.

470
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,130
I'm about to lose my grip.

471
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,500
Don't panic.

472
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,500
Let me help you.

473
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,130
Stay back!

474
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:03,820
Shut up!

475
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,690
I saw them put that vest on you.

476
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,130
I know how to disarm it.

477
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,820
Can you still hold on?

478
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,500
Alright.

479
00:37:59,150 --> 00:37:59,730
Hold on.

480
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,690
Hold the grenade.

481
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,210
Lieutenant General,

482
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,300
don't go in.

483
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,210
There's a bomb inside.

484
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,500
A bomb!

485
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,900
We can't go in.

486
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,380
There's a well on your right.

487
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,820
I'll walk there with you.

488
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,460
Let's slow down.

489
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,570
I've imagined it more than once.

490
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,130
One day,

491
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,980
I'll hold your hand tight

492
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,820
in the morning sun.

493
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,460
But I never expected

494
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,340
it would be under these circumstances.

495
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,690
The night is almost over.

496
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,340
Dawn is just ahead.

497
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,250
Comrade Ding Yi.

498
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,610
We will see the sunrise.

499
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,610
I'll count to three.

500
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,900
We let go together.

501
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,860
I'll follow your lead.

502
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,940
One.

503
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,940
Two.

504
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,090
