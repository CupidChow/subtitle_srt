he immediately agreed to attend.

On top of that,

your ambiguous relationship
with Joseph Lee

180
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,180

181
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,060
it's hard for me not to suspect

182
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,220
that the code was leaked

183
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,220
from you, Ms. Xian.

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,940
If it was just that,

185
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,500
I would only suspect you
of being an intelligence dealer.

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,140
set off air-raid sirens simultaneously.

189
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,260
That has to make me doubt

190
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,860
your identity, Ms. Xian.

191
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,460
Tell me,

192
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,140
are you with the Nationalists

193
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,220
or the Communists?

194
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,620
Mr. Takeda.

195
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,090
It's really a pity
you aren't a playwright

196
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,460
in our troupe.

197
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:17,980
What?

198
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,460
Does this mean

199
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,900
you want to restrict my freedom?

200
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,220
Tell me,

201
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,460
does Colonel Sasaki know
you're doing this?

202
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,700
Whether you can see the Colonel

203
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,180
depends on whether
you choose to cooperate.

204
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,290
I know there's a storm of change now.

205
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,740
The British can't shield us anymore.

206
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,940
But these two accusations

207
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,940
are far too heavy

208
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,900
for me to carry, Mr. Takeda.

209
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,460
Bring the tea.

210
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,330
Yes.

211
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,980
Zhu Hongyu

212
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,050
has been captured.

213
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,050
She has confessed.

214
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,740
On the surface, you are a movie star.

215
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,900
But in fact, you are a communist.

216
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,460
The so-called Chaosheng Troupe

217
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,460
is nothing more

218
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,220
than a cover for your true identity.

219
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,290
Hongyu is a communist?

220
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,260
Impossible.

221
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,460
Hongyu has always been timid.

222
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,660
Maybe you tortured
a confession out of her.

223
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,980
She's young and can't take the pain,

224
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,220
so she bites others at random.

225
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,370
Mr. Takeda,

226
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,370
this trick

227
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,260
is far too childish.

228
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,370
But Zhu Hongyu said

229
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,220
you have a handler

230
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,740
who is very mysterious,

231
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,460
and has only been
to the troupe once or twice.

232
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,290
You are the only one
in direct contact with him.

233
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:29,940
Is that true?

234
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,700
Nonsense.

235
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,700
People only come to the troupe
to see me for business.

236
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,900
What do you mean "a handler"?

237
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,130
Ms. Xian, you should be aware

238
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,660
that now is the critical period
for Sino-Japanese peace talks.

239
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,420
For a movie star as influential as you,

240
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,370
we wouldn't act rashly

241
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,660
without solid evidence.

242
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,980
This could be your last chance.

243
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,420
If we wait until we have real evidence,

244
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,180
there will be no room for negotiation.

245
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,460
Ms. Xian,

246
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,460
don't let this cup of tea become

247
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,020
the last one you ever drink here.

248
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,740
Where is Hongyu?

249
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,980
Where is Hongyu?

250
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,740
Where is Hongyu?

251
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,770
Speak up!

252
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,660
Where is Hongyu?

253
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,260
Say something!

254
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,770
Run! Don't worry about me!

255
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,770
Ding Yi, go!

256
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,740
Let go of me!

257
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,500
Let go!

258
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,740
Ding Yi!

259
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,530
Are you even human?

260
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,900
I trusted you so much,

261
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,660
and you betrayed us!

262
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,330
You scum!

263
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,180
You beast!

264
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,980
I didn't mean to betray you.

265
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,810
Ding Yi.

266
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,050
I didn't mean to betray you.

267
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,260
I didn't mean to.

268
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,810
Jerk!

269
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,460
Jerk!

270
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,740
Beast!

271
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,220
I didn't mean to.

272
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,180
Hongyu.

273
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,740
Hongyu!

274
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,660
Ding Yi, I really didn't mean to.

275
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,090
I've been poor for too long.

276
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,420
I just wanted to make some money

277
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,700
and settle down in Shanghai.

278
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,220
Hongyu!

279
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,740
I just wanted to live well.

280
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,900
You became a traitor for the Japanese.

281
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,260
That's living well?

282
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,100
You wanted to live well,

283
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,220
so you could harm your own friend

284
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,020
and betray your own people?

285
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,970
No, no.

286
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,930
If everyone

287
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,980
was a coward like you,

288
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,740
then we'd be

289
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,810
not far from seeing our country fall

290
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,940
and our homes destroyed.

291
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,420
No, that's not it.

292
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,980
I'll make sure you remember

293
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,290
that Hongyu

294
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,500
wasn't killed by the Japanese.

295
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,660
She was killed by you.

296
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,260
It's raining.

297
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,660
This tea is quite nice.

298
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,810
May I have another cup?

299
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,090
Seems you won't give up
till disaster hits.

300
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,940
You're still in the mood for tea?

301
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,680
[Melody of Spring]

302
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,500
Don't worry.

303
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,220
Do you think you can just grab any book

304
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,740
and use it to convict me?

305
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,180
Hongyu's Party membership application

306
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,220
can be put on the agenda.

307
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,600
[Applicant: Zhu Hongyu]

308
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,640
[Zhu Hongyu]

309
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:14,020
It is my will to join
the Communist Party of China,

310
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,260
strictly observe the Party's discipline,

311
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,050
be ready at all times
to sacrifice my all,

312
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:28,330
and fight for communism until the end.

313
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,740
Ms. Xian.

314
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,330
Why are you so nervous?

315
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,770
Mr. Takeda,

316
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,330
this joke has gone too far.

317
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,290
Do you know what you're doing?

318
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,260
Don't you think this looks familiar?

319
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,810
How would I know?

320
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,980
I've never seen it before.

321
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,460
Bring him up.

322
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,050
Yes.

323
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,050
Hongyu.

324
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,180
Hongyu.

325
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,050
Hongyu.

326
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,530
Hongyu.

327
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,660
Hongyu.

328
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,500
Hongyu.

329
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,020
It's time to go.

330
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,770
Get lost!

331
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,660
I can't leave Hongyu here alone.

332
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,900
It's too cold, too cold.

333
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,220
Come back here.

334
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,740
It's too cold!

335
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,460
Listen to me!

336
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,900
I'm telling you,

337
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,980
she doesn't feel cold.

338
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,180
She's dead!

339
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,290
Dead, do you understand? Dead!

340
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,290
She's not dead!

341
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,220
Hongyu.

342
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,980
Hongyu!

343
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,740
Hongyu.

344
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,570
Hongyu!

345
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,740
Come here.

346
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,740
Go.

347
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,290
It seems unless we use our trump card,

348
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,260
you will not admit it.

349
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,330
Zhao Fu.

350
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,570
Ms. Xian.

351
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,290
Leader Xian.

352
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,900
You'd better confess.

353
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,020
Repeat what you just said.

354
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,290
Zhu Hongyu

355
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,090
is a communist.

356
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,660
Back when we were in the troupe,

357
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,180
she often made extreme
anti-Japanese remarks.

358
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,330
Ms. Xian,

359
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,460
in the whole troupe,

360
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,420
you and Hongyu were the closest.

361
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,460
She told you everything.

362
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,770
You must know all about her.

363
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,940
Just confess!

364
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,060
Don't blame me.

365
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,700
Hongyu...

366
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,370
She

367
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,330
deserves to die.

368
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,090
Xian Biyun's enjoying VIP treatment
with the Japanese.

369
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,300
She makes me do
all kinds of disgusting jobs!

370
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,220
Stop.

371
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,090
Go collect the body of that
female communist Zhu Hongyu.

372
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,570
No. 64 Jiaxing Road.

373
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,370
Yes.

374
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,810
Hurry, hurry.

375
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,980
There's really no need

376
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,300
to drag down the whole troupe for her.

377
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,540
Ms. Xian, just admit it.

378
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,650
But, but...

379
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,850
But I'm really not a communist.

380
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,090
You said you're not a communist,

381
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,740
yet first there's Joseph Lee's code
being leaked,

382
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,410
and then Zhu Hongyu being a communist.

383
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,330
Both are closely connected to you.

384
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,980
What else can you say now?

385
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,540
Hongyu...

386
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,220
She

387
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,220
deserves to die.

388
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,500
So it seems Zhu Hongyu
really is a communist.

389
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,780
If that's the case,

390
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,610
fine.

391
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,540
Bring that little girl out to me.

392
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,220
I will confront her face to face.

393
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,130
I want to see how this ungrateful wretch

dares to throw mud on me!

395
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,130
Hongyu came here as a refugee.

396
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,060
She didn't have
many friends in Shanghai.

397
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,540
But now that you mention it,

398
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,090
I do remember

399
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,380
she seemed to have a cousin.

400
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,460
I only remember

401
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,610
she called her cousin

402
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,690
Ruan Qing.

403
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,900
Have you seen her?

404
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,460
No.

405
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,460
Every time Zhu Hongyu went to see her,
she was very secretive.

406
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,210
She never came to the troupe.

407
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,820
None of us have ever seen her.

408
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,900
It's me.

409
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,380
Have you investigated that woman
named Ruan Qing?

410
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,420

411
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,650
Yes, I have.

412

She really exists.

413

But she's a death row prisoner.

414
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,900
When the National Revolutionary Army
attacked Sun Chuanfang,

415
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,690
the prison holding her was shelled.

416
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,650
The prisoners took the chance to riot,

417
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,380
allowing her to escape.

418
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,650
