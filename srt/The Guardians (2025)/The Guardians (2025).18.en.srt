Can you take responsibility
for your decryption?

00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,740
I can take responsibility
for my decryption results,

5
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,570
but can you

6
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,130
take responsibility for your doubts?

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,330
Report it.

8
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,460
Minister Chen, there's an emergency.

9
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,660
This place has already been sealed off.

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,100
Director Liang has arrived.

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,010

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,570
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

13
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,060
Thanks to the great assistance
of the three experts,

14
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,100
we were able to

15
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,540
avoid a disaster.

and successfully stopped
the BIS terrorists' operation.

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,100

deserve plenty of credit.

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,380
the situation at the Shanghai Bureau
to Secretary Mao.

29
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,060
However, Cao Yuanzhong

30
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,540
is somewhat closely connected
to the Chairman's wife.

31
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,340
Even Mr. Dai can't touch him.

32
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,100
But my senior brother said,

33
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,380
from now on, our actions

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,380
must be completely independent
from the Shanghai Bureau.

35
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,890
You must not take part in

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,980

37
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,340
Everything should prioritize
the Sword Thrust Operation.

00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,660
Even if he wants me
to manage it, I won't.

39
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,570
Why did Xian Biyun

40
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,100

The people in the concession
hated her extremely.

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,260

Since her debut at 16,

52
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,690
her experiences every year
have been very clear.

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,900
he must know a lot of things.

00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,900

not here?

115
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,340
Mr. Shen and Mr. Yi

116
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,700
were called by Director Liang
to a meeting

117
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,340
because of the Xige Code.

118
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,900
Xige Code?

119
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,980
Why wasn't Director Lee
informed about this?

120
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,460
Director Liang said

121
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,460
that Director Lee should
focus his efforts

122
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,460
on cipher design,

123
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,660

Please go upstairs.

131
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,460
This is Director Liang's office.

132
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,020
Since you are both directors,

133
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,650
your offices are on the second floor.

In order not to disturb your work,

136
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,650
we specially arranged your office

How do you know there's nothing?

This is the intelligence hub
of the puppet government.

Confidential documents from
all countries converge here.

152

An extra pair of ears
means an extra risk of leaks.

153
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,010
No matter how suspicious
Liang Jingyuan is,

154
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,770
he wouldn't install listening devices

155
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,730
in the Cryptography Institute's offices.

156
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,610
Makes sense.

157
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,850
Not bad at all.

Yes, yes, yes.

So pretty.

So envious.

162

Look at those big eyes
and the high bridge nose.

163

So nice.

164

So beautiful.

She's simply Venus.

166
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,730
I don't intend to lose an arm.

167
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,610
Don't be so modest.

168
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,060
You can manage both
the living room and the kitchen.

169
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,980
These skills

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,220
are remarkable.

171
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,730
If I were a man,

172
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,580
I would have married her long ago.

173
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,340
I wouldn't let Joseph Lee have a chance,

174
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,980
right?

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,980
Of course.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,820
Yes.

177
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,220
Who would disagree?

178
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,820
Look,

179
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,700
this once dazzling movie star

180
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,100
can still make

181
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,340
so many things at home.

182
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,730
Exactly.

183
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,580
If the old experts in our institute

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,980
ate the dumplings made
by Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Liang,

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,220
wouldn't they be able

186
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,420
to crack a few more codes?

187
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,340
Precisely.

188
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,300
Exactly.

189
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,060
I'm just an actress.

190
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,730
I should know a bit more.

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,460
These are just modest skills

192
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,730
not worth much on the stage.

193
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,220
Today,

194
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,850
I simply made some home cooking.

195
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,820
Just pork and cabbage fillings,

196
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,180
and pork with shepherd's purse.

197
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,980
I don't know what flavors

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,820
you all prefer.

199
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,460
I hope you won't mind.

200
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,820
We don't mind.

201
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,980
We'll eat whatever you make.

202
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,060
It's hard to suit all tastes anyway.

203
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,580
These are already served.

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,820
Mrs. Lee,

205
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,940
let me tell you,

206
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,220
my husband Dong and I

207
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,220
are native Northeasterners.

208
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,420
We never moved away.

209
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,420
Next time,

210
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,460
we'll treat you to authentic

211
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,730
sauerkraut dumplings.

212
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,460
That taste

213
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,460
is absolutely delicious.

214
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,850
We Shandong people also love dumplings.

215
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,420
We Henan people mainly eat noodles.

216
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,700
I'll treat you to Henan
stewed noodles then.

217
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,850
Good.

218
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,460
What about you, Mrs. Liu?

219
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,490
Me?

220
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,220
I love beef with scallions
and lamb with zucchini.

221
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,850
Judging by your accent,

222
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,580
you're a southerner, Mrs. Liu?

223
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,220
Why do you prefer northern tastes?

224
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,820
You don't know,

225
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,820
my husband

226
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,340
was transferred for work
to the Northeast.

227
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,300
I lived with him there for eight years

228
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,580
in the SMR.

229
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,980
I got used to the taste long ago.

230
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,460
Oh right,

231
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,220
Mrs. Wang moved there

232
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,580
around the same time we did.

233
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,300
Her tastes are similar too.

234
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,530
Right, Mrs. Wang?

235
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,340
Yes, yes.

236
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,340
Come, give me a hand.

237
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,020
What's wrong with you?

238
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,220
Why the long face?

239
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,890
Right now we're on the second floor,

240
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,650
on equal footing with Liang Jingyuan,

241
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,100
with everyone else beneath our feet.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,340
Isn't that great?

243
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,860
In this Cryptography Institute,

244
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,500
Shen Wanqing is in charge of encryption.

245
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,260
That means

246
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,770
he'll handle many pieces of intelligence
from the Special Agent Headquarters.

247
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,650
And Yi Xiuyuan is
in charge of decryption.

248
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,740
That means

249
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,220
he will know exactly
which enemy intelligence

250
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,140
the Special Agent Headquarters
has obtained.

251
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,020
It seems

252
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,500
Liang Jingyuan has put you

253
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,500
in a very prominent position

254
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,460
as a deputy director,

255
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,530
but we are only responsible

256
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,770
for providing cipher design plans

257
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,740
and training students,

258
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,740
without accessing any core secrets.

259
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,740
But I think

260
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,340
not having access to core secrets

261
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,020
might actually be a good thing.

262
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,650
Think about it.

263
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,980
I don't know anything.

264
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,740
If I'm exposed to too much,

265
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,380
and later can't answer questions,

266
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,620
it's easy to blow my cover.

267
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,770
But our purpose in coming here

268
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,380
is precisely to get access
to core intelligence.

269
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,980
Just now Jiang mentioned

270
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,340
they're having a meeting

271
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,500
about decrypting the Xige Code.

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,620
The Xige Code is extremely
important to us.

273
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,500
It's the strongest fortress

274
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,770
on our cryptographic battlefield.

275
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,460
The only reason the Third
War Zone can hold out

276
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,100
is entirely because of the Xige Code.

277
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,340
It's about the lives of hundreds
of thousands of soldiers

278
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,890
in the Third War Zone's
five army groups.

279
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,500
It absolutely must not be
cracked by the Japanese.

280
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,860
What we need to know now

281
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,140
is how far they've gotten

282
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,770
in decrypting the Xige Code.

283
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,020
Don't worry,

284
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,380
leave this to me.

285
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,380
I'm the deputy director now,

286
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,260
I'll ask around for you.

287
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,140
It's too dangerous for you.

288
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,650
They didn't invite us to the meeting,

289
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,460
which means Liang Jingyuan
doesn't trust you at all.

290
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,020
If you ask about it rashly,

291
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,020
you'll only make him more suspicious.

292
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,340
I'll handle

293
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,140
the Xige Code myself.

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,980
I'll find a way on my own.

295
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,620
Thanks.

296
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,860
You're welcome.

297
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,860
Then what should I do?

298
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,020
Train the students.

299
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,980
Although they are called students,

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,980
they are all talents
in the field of cryptography.

301
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,140
In case they suddenly
ask you a question,

302
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,500
and you can't answer...

303
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,740
How about this.

304
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,020
Tomorrow I'll bring

305
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,740
all the books and materials
on cryptography from home

306
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,140
here to you,

307
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,140
so you can memorize them here.

308
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,860
Again?

309
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,050
Today, the emergency
contact plan is activated.

310
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,460
[Three Heroes and Five Gallants]
There is an important operation.

311
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,770
Take a look at this.

312
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,930
Bai Ye has

313
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,100
requested to make contact with us.

314
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,530
He used the contact method

315
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,380
that Hei once reported
to the organization

316
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,100
to inform us

317
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,460
that tomorrow at 3 PM,

318
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,260
each of us will carry a magnolia

319
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,220
to meet at the Stock Exchange.

320
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,340
The current situation is urgent.

321
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,860
The organization believes that

322
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,100
among the comrades
who can now operate freely

323
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,100
in the Japanese-occupied areas,

324
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,500
you're the most

325
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,740
suitable for going
to the Stock Exchange.

326
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,020
It's just...

327
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,770
It's just

328
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,500
the organization is worried

329
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,260
that the enemy might also know

330
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,980
about this set of
emergency contact methods.

331
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,860
So,

332
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,860
the person meeting you tomorrow

333
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,220
might very well be

334
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,530
the real Bai Ye.

335
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,260
Of course,

336
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,140
it might be a trap set by the enemy.

337
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,530
Mr. Liang,

338
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,140
the communists hide codes
in chess records,

339
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,260
and use novels as codebooks.

340
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,980
This move is indeed rather ingenious.

341
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,530
No matter how great
China's chess sage Wu Qingyuan is,

342
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,220
he still became naturalized in Japan.

343
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,740
No matter how ingenious the code is,

344
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,530
it still ended up being cracked by you.

345
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,360
[Three Heroes and Five Gallants]

346
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,180
Through my recent interactions,

347
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,660
I've already narrowed it down
to a general range.

348
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,090
Based on what we know,

349
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,660
Bai Ye

350
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,460
joined the South Manchuria Railway

351
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,500
before 1935.

352
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,050
At present, Bai Ye is most likely with

353
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,260
Dong Jinbo,

354
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,090
Liu Fangbai,

355
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,740
Wang Zukai, and Shen Wanqing.

356
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,700
So for tomorrow's contact,

357
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,940
we'll see who shows up
at the Stock Exchange.

358
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,610
Even if the contact fails,

359
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,130
I'll roughly know the next direction
for the investigation.

360
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,460
On this trip to catch Bai Ye,

361
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,700
you must maintain

362
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,260
a humble attitude.

363
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,220
You might learn quite a lot.

364
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,130
Thank you for your trust

365
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,330
and for giving me this opportunity.

366
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,260
Rest assured,

367
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,500
tomorrow afternoon
I will personally lead the team

368
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,810
to Yongchang Stock Exchange

369
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,220
and bring this magnolia back for you.

370
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,050
You must be extra cautious.

371
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,260
Don't worry.

372
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,500
If I don't see anyone tomorrow,

373
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,090
I won't reveal the magnolia.

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,740
Hello, Director Liang.

377
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,420
Hello.

378
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,050
You're back.

379
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,740
Close the door.

380
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,530
What is it?

381
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,940
Liang, what are you doing?

382
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,810
Are you crazy?

383
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,770
Liang,

384
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,900
this clivia has been grown
for three years,

385
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,660
and it's about to bloom.

386
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,290
Does it look good?

387
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,050
What is this thing?

388
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,980
Take care of it from now on.

389
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,330
Don't you like clivia the most?

390
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,570
What I like isn't important.

391
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,260
What's important is who gave it.

392
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,260
It was given by the Colonel?

393
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,020
Then there's no need
to throw away the clivia.

394
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,700
Why not keep them both?

395
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:17,980
Come.

396
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,260
Come.

397
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,220
Do you remember
when we were exiled in England,

398
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,050
I was so bored

399
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,530
that I read through
the Twenty-Four Histories?

400
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,740
Between the lines, I saw three words.

401
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,940
Do you remember what they were?

402
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,530
Be an official.

403
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,260
That's right.

404
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,660
Be an official.

405
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,500
Serve whoever gives us
the bigger position.

406
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,660
If we want to climb up the ladder,

407
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,330
we must show absolute loyalty.

408
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,290
Do you know what absolute loyalty is?

409
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,130
It means there can only be
one pot of flowers on a desk,

410
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,090
the flower that the superior
likes the most.

411
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,850
Why isn't Ms. Xian here yet?

412
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,060
After mahjong,
I still want to go swimming.

413
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,610
It's rare for us to get together.

414
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,020
Don't be so impatient.

415
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,610
Sorry to keep you waiting.

416
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,020
What's good to eat?

417
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,700
Dumplings.

418
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,570
Dumplings.

419
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,850
You two didn't get any

420
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,330
hot food at work today,

421
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,740
so I saved some specially for you.

422
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,810
I'm just not sure

423
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,540
what fillings you like.

424
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,090
What fillings are there?

425
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,740
This one is pork and cabbage,

426
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,650
and this one is pork
and shepherd's purse.

427
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,940
Shepherd's purse?

428
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,220
I've never tried it.

429
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,330
You have to use chopsticks.

430
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,890
I'll get them.

431
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,370
Alright.

432
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,300
Stop eating.

433
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,220
Let's play mahjong.

434
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,940
It's getting dark.

435
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,650
Come on, come on.

436
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,300
You two are the lucky ones,

437
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,330
free and easy,

438
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,370
unlike me,

439
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,780
I'm so busy right now.

440
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,060
Liang doesn't trust

441
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,980
handing over the finances
of the institute

442
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,060
to outsiders,

443
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,330
so he insisted I take the position
of Head of General Affairs Office.

444
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,020
I thought

445
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,330
it was going to be an easy job,

446
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,090
but it turned out to be a pile of work.

447
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,850
I don't even have time
to play mahjong now.

448
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,130
Don't complain.

449
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,170
The General Affairs Office
is a cushy post anywhere.

450
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,650
You can play mahjong anytime,

451
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,220
but money isn't always so easy to earn.

452
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,540
Cushy job?

453
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,700
What cushy job?

454
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,300
Liang doesn't think like that.

455
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,370
On my very first day at work,

456
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,410
he personally wrote three words

457
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,060
and hung them behind my desk.

458
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,780
Guess what they were?

459
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,740
Serve with integrity.

460
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,610
How did you know?

461
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,890
My master was just saying

462
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,540
Director Liang is incorruptible.

463
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,540
What's the use of being incorruptible?

464
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,610
Other people's husbands
help their wives make money,

465
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,220
but him?

466
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,170
He only causes me trouble.

467
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,330
The other day I fancied
a pair of gold bracelets.

468
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,170
He's a director after all,

469
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,610
yet he refused to buy them for me.

470
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,460
What's the point?

471
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,780
You mean the new bracelets

472
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,220
just released by Jincai Jewelry?

473
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,890
You saw them too?

474
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,170
I knew you'd like them.

475
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,130
I've already told the shop owner

476
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,330
to make two extra pairs.

477
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,060
I wanted to surprise you.

478

You're going to spoil me.

481
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,740
Li Huan, Miss Yi,

482
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,370
take a good look at
what it means to marry well.

483
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,170
Marry well?

484
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,850
These days,

485
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,570
we buy flowers for ourselves.

486
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,370
I buy them with the money I earn.

487
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,330
You spent your own money?

488
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,410
That won't do.

489
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,170
I don't want that.

490

Pay up, pay up.

493

This is all Ms. Xian's fault.

494
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,330
She had to pick this prodigy

495
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,260
as our mahjong partner.

496
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,130
Return it tomorrow.

497
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,850
I don't want it.

498
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,020

Biyun, you know how to trade stocks?

will it still be in time?

I just got the news,

517
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,980
so it's not necessarily accurate.

518
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,650

563
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,370
Eat your food.

564
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,060
Great,

565
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,130
I even wasted some.

566
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,090
This is perfume,

567
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,020
not toilet water,

568
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,090
you're not supposed
to spray it like that.

569
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,650
I know.

570
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,020
Got it.

571
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,300
Got it.

572
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,060
I won't spray anymore.

573
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,020
Pincher.

574
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,610
Eat.

575
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,540
What's the name of this perfume?

576
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,570
Cologne.

577
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,410
Cologne.

578
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:16,940
Nice name.

579
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,370
Wasted.

580
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,700
Hello, Director Lee.

581
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,890
Secretary Jiang.

582
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,650
Why such a big scene today?

583
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,700
We have a task today.

584
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,130
Hello, Director Lee.

585
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:10,540
Hello, Director Lee.

586
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,300
Hello, everyone.

587
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,060
Hello, Director Lee.

588
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,540
Good morning.

589
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,500
Hello, Director Lee.

590
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,330
Hello, everyone.

591
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,650
Wait for me a moment.

592
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,410
Director Lee.

593
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,170
Let me assist you.

594
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,330
Charlie, sorry,

595
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,780
I need a word with Director Lee.

596
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,500
Li Huan.

597
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,130
You have sharp ears.

598
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,020
Here's the thing,

599
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,260
yesterday I heard Mrs. Lee say

600
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,780
she was going to
the Stock Exchange today

601
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,780
to buy a stock.

602
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,780
When she told me yesterday,

603
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,980
I didn't dare agree.

604
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,740
So I wanted to trouble you,

605
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,060
could you help me buy one?

606
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,220
It's Nanyang Rubber.

607
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,940
No problem.

608
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,460
Really?

609
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,020
Thank you.

610
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,060
Please don't tell my master.

611
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,980
Remember, it's Nanyang Rubber.

612
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,090
Rest assured.

613
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,940
The perfume really smells nice.

614
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,740
Charlie, you go ahead.

615
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,330
Director Lee, I'll be going.

616
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,610
What did she just say to you?

617
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,610
She said I smell good.

618
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,060
Don't pry into kids' matters.

619
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,780
Let's go.

620
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,060
When you are teaching them,

621
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,020
pay attention to one thing.

622
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,540
The essence of Joseph Lee's code is

623
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,300
[VIP Room]
a one-time pad encryption algorithm.

624
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,370
Its core lies in the ability
to continuously

625
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,300
generate a key stream
via a key derivation function,

626
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,460
and in the seed key used to initiate

627
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,460
the key derivation function.

628
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,460
So this is by no means
an ordinary codebook.

629
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,090
Understand?

630
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,410
Yesterday I heard Mrs. Lee say

631
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,780
she was going to
the Stock Exchange today

632
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,850
to buy a stock.

633
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,570
It's Nanyang Rubber.

634
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,850
Alright.

635
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,410
No problem.

636
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,170
Really?

637
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,260
Thank you.

638
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,220
Oh right,

639
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,330
please don't tell my master.

640
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,540
Remember, it's Nanyang Rubber.

641
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,780
Rest assured.

642
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,810
What are you doing?

643
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,260
Repeat it.

644
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,740
I'm hungry.

645
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,370
I've memorized until I'm starving.

646
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,300
Look at you guys,

647
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,060
tea here, cigarettes there,

648
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,060
and I've got nothing.

649
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,410
And at this hour,

650
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,650
it should be time

651
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,020
for afternoon tea.

652
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,610
How about this,

653
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,300
go to Lao Da Chang

654
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,890
and get me some Napoleon cake.

655
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,060
I want something sweet.

656
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,780
After eating sweets,

657
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,130
I can focus better,

658
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,170
and memorize more.

659
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,330
Before I come back,

660
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,330
memorize all of this.

661
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,650
Still a bit off.

662
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,810
If only this could go up a bit more.

663
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,610
Ms. Xian.

664
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,460
Interesting.

665
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,330
Ms. Xian, you're here.

666
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,700
Help me buy Nanyang Rubber.

667
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,460
Alright.

668
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,410
By the way,

669
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,420
is your VIP room upstairs

670
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,980
booked out yet?

671
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,130
I'm really sorry,

672
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,650
it was booked this morning.

673
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,900
Do you know who booked it?

674
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,290
I'm not sure about that.

675
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,020
Go on then.

676
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,860
Nobody move!

677
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,210
Don't move!

678
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,570
Nobody move!

679
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:27,880
Be honest!

680
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,610
Stand to the side!

681
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,500
Stand over there!

682
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,940
All of you, over there!

683
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,940
You, over there!

684
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,980
Under the orders from
the Special Agent Headquarters,

685
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,650
we are here to search for communists.

686
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,170
Please cooperate.

687
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,650
No need to panic.

688
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,130
Do you think by
throwing away the flower,

689
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,170
you can get away?

690
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,730
Move aside.

691
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:00,940
Move.

692
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,090
So scary.

693
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,570
Captain Amu,

694
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,250
aren't you going to control your dog?

695
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,770
Isn't this Mrs. Lee?

696
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,610
Mrs. Lee,

697
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,020
you're here too?

698
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,610
Director Liang.

699
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,820
Director Liang.

700
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,730
Why are you here?

701
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,290
Buying stocks.

702
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,290
You trade stocks too?

703
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,060
Just for fun.

704
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,900
I happened to get
some insider information.

705
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,690
I even bought two lots for your wife.

706
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,340
Really?

707
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,060
Buying stocks for Yin?

708
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,250
How come I didn't know?

709
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,610
Mrs. Lee,

710
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,380
just now from my spot upstairs,

711
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,340
I saw someone downstairs
who looked like you,

712
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,380
running around,

713
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,380
flustered.

714
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,820
I don't think you came here
to buy stocks.

715
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,290
Are you here to meet someone?

716
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,770
Make it stop barking.

717
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,770
Mrs. Lee,

718
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,210
you still haven't told me

719
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,940
whether you came to buy stocks

720
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,460
or to meet someone.

721
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,020
Hold your dog back.

722
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,290
Who are you suspecting here?

723
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,690
Are you suspecting me?

724
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:44,860
Biyun.

725
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,210
Biyun.

726
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,420
Joseph.

727
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,900
Why is there a dog here?

728
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,820
It didn't bite you, did it?

729
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,650
Joseph.

730
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,900
What is this?

731
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,210
Joseph.

732
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,730
Is this a dog?

733
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,020
Are you alright?

734
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,130
It's fine.

735
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,130
Director Lee.

736
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,820
Director Liang.

737
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,250
Thank you.

738
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,210
Why are you here?

739
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,060
It's because of Mr. Shen's
beloved student, Li Huan.

740
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,250
Today at the institute, she ran into me

741
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,380
and told me

742
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,770
that while playing mahjong
with Biyun yesterday,

743
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,340
she heard that Biyun
was coming here today

744
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,900
to buy a stock.

745
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,380
Since there were many people then,

746
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,690
she didn't feel comfortable asking,

747
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,540
so today she asked me

748
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,420
to tell Biyun for her

749
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,860
to buy her a lot too.

750
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,940
I thought we've always
had good relations,

751
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,380
and this young lady

752
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,770
is quite nice,

753
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,610
so

754
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,940
I came.

755
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,540
By the way,

756
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,380
Director Liang,

757
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,460
are you here to buy stocks too?

758
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,210
On official business.

759
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,540
Didn't I tell you to wait in the lounge?

760
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,940
I waited in the lounge for so long,

761
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,060
and you never came back.

762
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,690
I was worried something
might have happened to you.

763
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,940
I went looking for you.

764
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,650
And then got misunderstood
by Director Liang,

765
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,170
saying I was running around in a panic.

766
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,380
Could it be that I'm carrying

767
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,250
contraband on me, Director Liang?

768
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,420
Director Lee, if your eyesight
isn't good, don't run around.

769
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,460
Look how worried you made Mrs. Lee.

770
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,460
What stock are you buying?

771
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,770
Nanyang Rubber.

772
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,170
Director Liang, it's here.

773
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,170
This is the stock Ms. Xian

774
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,060
has just asked me to buy.

775
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,610
Are you sure?

776
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:03,900
Yes.

777
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:13,860
It's all your fault.

778
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,060
If it weren't for having to find you,

779
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,770
we would've been home a long time ago.

780
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,380
Sorry, Biyun.

781
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,770
I was just anxious.

782
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:24,380
Director Liang's dog even pounced on me.

783
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,420
Captain Amu let this dog

784
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,860
bite and sniff

785
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,860
everywhere.

786
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,060
Director Liang,

787
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,170
I understand you have official duties,

788
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,380
but if today Biyun

789
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,690
had been hurt because of this,

790
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,770
do I blame you

791
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,340
or the dog?

792
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,770
This is a serious matter.

793
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,380
I am also on duty.

794
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,380
If this mission cannot be completed,

795
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,460
will the responsibility lie with you

796
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,860
or with Mrs. Lee?

797
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,460
Fine.

798
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,770
Today I'll cooperate with you

799
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,980
and finish this task.

800
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,060
Come on, come on.

801
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,650
Smell me.

802
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,340
Smell now.

803
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,210
Come!

804
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,860
Smell!

805
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,650
Amu.

806
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,940
How much longer do you have to smell?

807
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,900
I still have to return to the institute

808
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,460
to work for you.

809
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,770
Guard.

810
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,460
Escort Director Lee and Mrs. Lee back.

811
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:52,940
Yes, sir.

812
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,770
This way, please.

813
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,060
No need.

814
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,340
We'll walk ourselves.

815
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,460
Take

816
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,130
everyone all back!

817
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,540
Yes, sir.

818
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:19,860
Move.
