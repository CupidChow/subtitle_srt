What an innocent young man.

378
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,900
When you're my age, you'll understand

379
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,700
social connections are more
important than getting things done.

380
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,360
[The Prophecy of Fool]

381
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,370
Mr. Gu, sorry.

382
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,740
Tonight's show ends here.

383
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,810
Cut the useless talk.

384
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,370
I'm telling you,

385
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,290
no amount of persuasion will work on me.

386
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,220
And don't try that

387
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,460
carrot-and-stick routine on me.

388
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,530
It won't work here.

389
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:40,850
Got it?

390
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,940
Forget six hours.

391
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,420
Even six days, six months, or six years,

392
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:46,900
I still won't do it.

393
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,420
I've always been this stubborn.

394
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,660
So I think you

395
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,940
shouldn't waste your time on me.

396
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,180
Just send me back straightaway.

397
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,330
The audience is still waiting
for me on stage.

398
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,940
Do you really think

399
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,420
you can return to the stage,

400
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,700
living freely like before?

401
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,130
I hear you're from the Northeast.

402
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,530
You came to Shanghai
after the September 18th Incident.

403
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,770
Yeah.

404
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,500
So what?

405
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,660
My mother risked her life

406
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,660
to escape with me.

407
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,940
So,

408
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,940
if I lose my life here with you,

409
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,370
how could I face her?

410
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,700
After the September 18th Incident,

411
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,660
you escaped from the Northeast
to Shanghai.

412
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,900
But now, the Northeast
and North China have fallen,

413
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,900
Central China is in bitter war,

414
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,940
Shanghai has become a quagmire,

415
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,660
and the Concessions
are isolated islands.

416
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,940
Sooner or later,

417
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,090
the Japanese will march
into the Concession.

418
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,330
Where will you run then?

419
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,700
Stop right there.

420
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,130
Don't talk to me about this.

421
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,940
Do you really think we common folks,

422
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,090
who barely went to school,

423
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,130
understand nothing?

424
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,610
Why did we run after
the September 18th Incident?

425
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,940
Because those officers
of the Northeastern Army

426
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,260
gave up resistance,

427
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,260
throwing us civilians
into the line of fire.

428
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,180
I'm telling you,

429
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,180
if not for sheer luck,

430
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,660
we wouldn't be alive now.

431
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,940
Isn't it the same now?

432
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,260
The Japanese come,

433
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,740
guns firing.

434
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,700
But where's Chairman Chiang?

435
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,610
Where is he?

436
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,090
Gone, disappeared.

437
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,130
He hid himself in Chongqing.

438
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,370
What now?

439
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,850
You want us common folks

440
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,090
to take the bullets for him again?

441
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,420
I'm telling you, I've figured it out.

442
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,530
The higher the official,

443
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,660
the faster they run.

444
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,570
You're not wrong.

445
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,130
But if everyone thinks this way,

446
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,130
then our country and homes

447
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,330
will be destroyed before long.

448
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,180
Don't try labels on me.

449
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,700
We are civilians.

450
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,420
What does war have to do with us?

451
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,130
Back when the Eight-Nation Alliance
invaded Beijing,

452
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,130
18,000 troops

453
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,900
easily captured Beijing,

454
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,130
which had over a hundred
thousand defenders.

455
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,260
Besides the authorities'

456
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,290
inaction and incompetence,

457
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,530
there were those who led the enemy in,

458
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,900
opening the gates for them.

459
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,420
Now the Japanese invaded Nanjing,

460
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,180
slaughtering 300,000 of our compatriots!

461
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,900
They're at our doorstep.

462
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,940
And you want to be the one

463
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,500
to lead them through the gate?

464
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,500
When did I lead anyone?

465
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,500
When did I open the gate?

466
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,020
Don't slander me!

467
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,700
By teaching the Japanese as Joseph Lee,

468
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,940
you've opened the gates for them.

469
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,180
You've turned your blade
against your own people.

470
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,180
How can you say you haven't?

471
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,940
I haven't!

472
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,420
I'm just a commoner.

473
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,180
I'm just an actor.

474
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,940
A mere walk-on!

475
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,420
What's wrong with me making some money?

476
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,420
I want to eat, I need to survive!

477
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,420
Is that wrong?

478
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,740
My mother is still back home,

479
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,700
waiting for me to return to Baimahu
and care for her!

480
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,700
But the Chinese civilians
on the Northern Jiangsu battlefield

481
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,570
are bleeding and dying
because of the code

482
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,570
you taught them for Joseph Lee.

483
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,940
And you feel nothing?

484
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,980
You're noble, you're so capable!

485
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,940
With your privileged background,
you never worry about food or clothing.

486
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,420
Of course you can feel sad
for the country and the people.

487
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,940
But us? Can we?

488
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,420
If you were like us,

489
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,940
digging in the dirt every day,

490
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,180
and rolling in the mud,

491
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,940
you are barely able to survive!

492
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,610
Then you wouldn't think this way!

493
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,180
Ding Yi, you're right.

494
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,700
I am exactly what you said,

495
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,330
living in luxury

496
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,420
without worries.

497
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,130
My father

498
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,850
is the deputy commander
of Chongqing Garrison Command.

499
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,330
He is someone who can sit

500
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,130
with Chairman Chiang,

501
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,050
drinking tea and watching plays.

502
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,420
I don't want to hear it!

503
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,180
I didn't hear anything.

504
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,180
I don't want to be silenced.

505
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,660
What I want to say is

506
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,370
we truly can't

507
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,660
choose our own birth.

508
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,460
But we can decide

509
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,460
what kind of things we want to do.

510
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,420
In our family, there's a motto.

511
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,740
Since I was young,

512
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,700
my father has been teaching me it.

513
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,700
Want to know what it is?

514
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,090
Serve the country with utmost loyalty?

515
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,740
Take the lead in battle.

516
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,900
So Ding Yi,

517
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,370
no matter what trouble

518
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,810
or danger you face in the future,

519
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,180
I will always

520
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,740
stand in front of you.

521
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,180
Take a look at this,

522
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,740
and then decide.

523
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,980
Who doesn't have a family motto?

524
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,090
I have a family motto too.

525
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,460
Of the 36 Stratagems,

526
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,570
running is the best.

527
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,180
Excuse me.

528
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,330
You're here.

529
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,700
I found it.

530
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,940
Joseph Lee's assistant,

531
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,700
Charlie Gu,

532
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,180
holds a British passport.

533
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,420
He entered four days ago.

534
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,090
This is his entry record.

535
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,180
Is it genuine?

536
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,420
Not falsified?

537
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,180
Unless Joseph Lee's influence

538
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,610
is powerful enough to control
border and customs officers,

539
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,940
it can't be falsified.

540
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,180
The military police

541
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,940
still haven't found
Joseph Lee's whereabouts?

542
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,180
No.

543
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,940
We found his car parked
at William's Residence

544
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,180
of the Municipal Council.

545
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,420
We can't search British territory,

546
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,940
so we sent people

547
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,940
to watch it around the clock.

548
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,050
No sign of Joseph Lee going in or out.

549
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,180
We've watched him nearly two months.

550
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,420
Apart from work,

551
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,610
he never leaves his room.

552
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,180
So why suddenly go to

553
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,610
William's Residence?

554
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,180
Won't let me leave?

555
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,940
Fine.

556
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,610
I'll just going to deal with it.

557
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,940
See who can outlast the other.

558
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,180
I'll drink your liquor up first.

559
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,610
Mr. Takeda.

560
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,130
I think Mr. Joseph Lee's been acting

561
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,370

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,570
The Japanese army
is at Baimahu right now.

623
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,170
We have no idea

about their operational plans.

625
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,090
Even if reinforcements go,
it's just sending them to die.

626

00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,690

I can't just leave my mother to die!

630
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,570
That's why the priority now

631
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,300
is to replace the enemy's
operational code.

632
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,690
Only then can we

633
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,170
learn their battle plan

634

that this codebook

00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,650
is intel more valuable than life.

730

00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,650
You're much smarter than I thought.

750
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,570
Kondo,

751
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,420
you're our best codebreaker

752
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,420
at the MSS.

753
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,820
From a professional perspective,

754
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,860
you also think

755
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,050
he's suspicious?

756
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,130
In these past two months,

757
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,860
I've attended Mr. Lee's lectures
every week.

758
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,820
I noticed that every time,

759
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,420
he never does calculations on site.

760
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,340
He just uses his eye condition
as an excuse

761
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,900
to take it back to the hotel to work on.

762
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,900
But why

763
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,570
are the coefficients
of the key derivation function

764
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,020
always the same numbers?

765
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,340
You're asking too many questions.

766
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,130
So you mean,

767
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,570
you suspect

768
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:46,530
the eye condition is just his excuse.

769
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,380
Yes.

770
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,570
I suspect the eye condition
might be his cover.

771
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,090
There must be some secret

772
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,460
unknown to others

773
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,090
