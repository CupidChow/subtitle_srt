00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,980
How did you know I was here?

5
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,820
Here's the thing.

6
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,100
This morning,

7
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,900
when I arrived at
the Cryptography Institute,

8
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,100
I saw a whole bunch of people
heading out on a mission.

9
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,060
The target was

10
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,540
the VIP Room.

12
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,170
Then Li Huan told me

13
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,380
you were also coming
to the Stock Exchange today.

14
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,820
So I thought I'd come by
to check on you,

15
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,940
make sure nothing goes wrong.

16
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,980
Of course, I know

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,660
that even if I didn't come,

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,940
you could handle things yourself.

19
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,380
What did you

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,380
let the dog smell?

21
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,450
It's Charlie's.

22
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,500
Smells strong, huh?

23
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,690
Smells pretty good.

24
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,940
Then I'll carry it with me every day.

25
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,940
Ms. Xian.

26
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,380
Were you looking for someone?

27
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,380
I want to help you.

28
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,940
Ding Yi.

29
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,380
Thank you for today.

30
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,380
You're welcome.

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,220
But sorry,

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,660
I can't tell you

33
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,060

Ms. Xian.

38
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,410
I know you have your reasons
for not telling me.

39
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,220
But I want to tell you

40
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,410
I'm really ready to join you now.

41
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,060
As long as you give me a chance,

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,220
I will never let you down.

You came today just to
accompany me to buy stocks.

47
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,170
Of course.

48
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,290
Don't tell Gu Yangshan

49
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,020
a single word about other things.

50
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,460
Yi Xiuyuan is now leading people

51
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,900
in cracking the Xige Code.

52
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,020
Why's that?

53
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,900
From what I know,

54
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,140
Yi Xiuyuan was once

55
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,340
one of the top cryptographers
in Chongqing.

56
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,460
But ever since the American experts

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,980
established the black chamber,

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,460
he's been sidelined,

59
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,140
so he retired in anger.

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,460
I don't know how Liang Jingyuan

61
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,900
managed to win him over,

62
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,140
and he even brought a batch
of materials from Chongqing.

63
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,170
And this batch of materials

64
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,220
is now in
the Cryptography Institute's archive.

65
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,370
So we must find out how far

66
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,460
they've gotten in decrypting
the Xige Code.

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,020
Understood.

68
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,900
I'll report to Chongqing immediately.

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,780
Wait for my message.

70
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,900
Alright.

71
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,340
I have intel as well.

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,460
List of dead armed worker rioters.

73
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,460
You said there was nothing
wrong with Xian Biyun.

74
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,900
But I still didn't feel at ease,

75
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,660
so I used all the intelligence

76
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,460
resources at my disposal
to investigate her.

77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,900
On the surface,

78
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,900
she's just a big movie star.

79
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,780
But there's one thing

80
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,850
I feel tricky about.

81
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,250
Lin Changying?

82
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,900
I just investigated this person.

83
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,020
Lin Changying

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,700
was an actor with Huaxia Film.

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,340
The year of the purge,

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,020
he died during organizing
the labor movement.

87
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,700
All related interrogation records
indicate

88
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,220
he was most likely a communist.

89
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,810
So what's his connection to Xian Biyun?

90
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,220
That's the key.

91
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,660
Being in the same troupe,

92
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,780
how could they have
no connection at all?

93
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,460
It's just like the communist Hongyu

94
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,020
who infiltrated the troupe.

95
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,340
Xian Biyun said
she didn't know about it at all.

96
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,460
If Xian Biyun

97
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,780
were merely an actress

98
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,220
without other identity,

99
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,460
how could she have managed

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,410
to make it all look so seamless?

101
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,170
I must remind you

102
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,460
that for the BIS,

103
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,540
communists are far more
dangerous than traitors.

104
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,580
Alright, I got it.

105
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,900
But right now
the priority is the Xige Code.

106
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,540
I have to go buy a cake for Ding Yi.

107
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,170
If Xian Biyun is a communist,

108
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,930
and you're so close to her,

109
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,660
your father won't be able to protect you

110
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,020
and will be implicated as well.

111
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,730
Moreover, the first one to die

112
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,170
will surely be Ding Yi.

113
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,020
Comrade Bai Ye has rich experience.

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,220
He probably realized before me
that there was a spy,

115
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,340
so he threw away the magnolia

116
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,340
and evacuated in time.

117
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,220
But this also means

118
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,780
his only means of
contacting the organization

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,340
was exposed.

120
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,020
He won't try to
reestablish contact easily again.

121
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,700
The Party Committee of
the Anti-Japanese United Army

122
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,460
has informed us
of some information about Bai Ye.

123
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,850
He once worked for
the puppet army in the Northeast.

124
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,220
And there is another important
piece of information.

125
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,020
He has a serious stomach illness.

126
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,220
Hei once applied to the Party Committee

127
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,140
for medicine to treat stomach ulcers.

128
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,540
I'll try to find a way

129
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,020
to search for related medical records.

130
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,580
Director Liang.

131
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,660
The Colonel said

132
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,460
he is already aware of
what happened at the stock exchange.

133
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,660
As for how you plan to
investigate further,

134
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,250
that's your job.

135
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,290
You don't have to report every detail.

136
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,260
The Colonel only
wants to hear the result.

137
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,180
Yes.

138
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,620
But Tonoji...

139
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,500
That's your trouble,

140
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,690
not the Colonel's.

141
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,500
Alright, Liang.

142
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,650
If you didn't catch the person,

143
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,570
just catch him next time.

144
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,170
If you ruin your health with anger,

145
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,020
I'll feel terrible.

146
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,140
I'm fine.

147
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,460
It's alright, it's fine.

148
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,890
Do you know who I ran into

149
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,570
at the stock exchange today?

150
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,460
Who?

151
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,220
Xian Biyun and Director Lee.

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,380
Tell me,

153
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,050
they just happened to appear

154
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,410
right where I was capturing Bai Ye.

155
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,260
I can't help but suspect them.

156
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,810
Aren't you overthinking it?

157
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,980
I sent Biyun to buy stocks for me.

158
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,810
You're still too naive.

159
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,810
You still need to improve
your judgment of people.

160
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,170
You didn't complete the task this time.

161
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,810
Will Sasaki give you a hard time?

162
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,290
He probably won't.

163
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,570
I know what that old man really wants.

164
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,290
Today at the arrest scene,

165
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,140
I discovered something interesting.

166
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,290
Do you want to hear it?

167
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,050
What is it?

168
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,170
I found Bai Ye

169
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,170
was like a kite
whose string had been cut.

170
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,570
His value is limited.

171
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,980
But the contact behind him is important.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,170
I can play a long con
to catch a big fish.

173
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,810
If I catch it,

174
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,770
many other ones from the CPC
Shanghai underground will emerge.

175
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,770
You know that?

176
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,570
I don't.

177
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,050
I have to find Bai Ye

178
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,290
and also his contact.

179
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,770
I remember Beethoven once said,

180
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,050
"A major advantage

181
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,220
of the remarkable people is

182
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,570
perseverance in the adverse

183
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,170
and difficult encounters."

184
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,290
Madam, you're back.

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,810
What's wrong, Madam?

186
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,890
You just got back too?

187
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,050
You're back.

188
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,810
Where did you go this afternoon?

189
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,050
Right after you left this afternoon,

190
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,810
my stomach started to hurt badly.

191
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,650
So I came back first,

192
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,050
thought I'd make myself some porridge.

193
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,410
I'm feeling better now.

194
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,410
You came back alone?

195
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,050
Ding Yi.

196
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,170
Come upstairs with me.

197
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,890
Still not feeling quite right.

198
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,460
Come in.

199
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,050
Sit.

200
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,650
Thank you for today.

201
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,290
Ms. Xian, don't say thank you to me.

202
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,460
I did it of my own will.

203
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,290
Sit.

204
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,410
Ding Yi.

205
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,770
I want to seriously talk to you
about something.

206
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,980
I've officially introduced you
to my family.

207
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,100
What?

208
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,890
Are you surprised?

209
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,380
Ms. Xian,

210
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,220
your family

211
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,260
agreed with what you've just told me.

212
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,290
Does that mean

213
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,050
there's a chance

214
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,650
that I can join you?

215
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,570
So I'd like to ask about

216
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,170
the application I made for him
to join the Party organization.

217
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,860
The organization has agreed
to his application in principle,

218
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,340
but he still needs further testing.

219
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,050
I understand what you mean.

220
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,890
After all that's happened lately,

221
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,810
my family feels

222
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,410
we very much want you to
become one of us.

223
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,770
But this

224
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,930
is not a simple matter.

225
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,530
Do I need to go through any procedures?

226
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,170
For example, write an application?

227
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,570
I can write it right now.

228
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,170
Sit down.

229
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,410
Ding Yi.

230
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,410
What do you think

231
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,020
our family is?

232
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,530
Just like our troupe,

233
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,530
a group of like-minded people

234
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,980
living together like family.

235
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,460
It has the warmth of home,

236
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,050
and also iron discipline.

237
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,890
In my view,

238
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,500
our family

239
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,530
is a solid fortress.

240
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,980
Every family member is
a brick or stone of the fortress.

241
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,770
We cover each other
and are closely connected,

242
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,690
together forming
a solid line of defense.

243
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,930
And behind that line of defense

244
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,460
is the masses.

245
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,260
Ding Yi,

246
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,930
joining our family

247
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,650
is not only a commitment to yourself,

248
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,290
but also a solemn commitment
to the motherland and the masses.

249
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,860
Are you truly ready

250
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,620
to become part of this fortress?

251
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,290
I'm ready.

252
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,860
Good.

253
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,170
In this particular situation,

254
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,770
you joined in a critical situation.

255
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,500
I can be your recommender.

256
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,500
As for the application,

257
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,180
I still need to report to the family.

258
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,500
After all, this is a serious matter.

259
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,220
Once the family formally approves it,

260
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,370
I'll prepare a new outfit for you

261
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,180
and let you take a solemn oath.

262
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,530
Okay.

263
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,740
Ms. Xian,

264
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,370
can you now tell me

265
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,740
your real mission here?

266
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,660
We have a family member,

267
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,660
codenamed Bai Ye.

268
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,130
He infiltrated
the Cryptography Institute,

269
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,180
but his handler
in the Northeast was exposed.

270
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,940
The family has now lost contact
with him.

271
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,980
I entered the Cryptography Institute

272
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,260
to find him

273
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,260
and make contact with him.

274
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,700
So today you went to the Stock Exchange

275
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,260
to meet with him?

276
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,770
Yes.

277
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,260
But today's operation was exposed.

278
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,940
We didn't expect

279
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,530
that Liang Jingyuan
had so much information.

280
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,940
Fortunately, the family

281
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,740
has already given us a new lead.

282
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,980
We've learned that Comrade Bai Ye
has a stomach condition.

283
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,460
So I hope that you can

284
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,980
help me closely observe

285
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,740
Shen Wanqing, Wang Zukai, Dong Jinbo,

286
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,610
and Liu Fangbai, see if
any of them have stomach problems.

287
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,020
Don't worry.

288
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,700
This is the first task

289
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,770
that the family
has officially assigned to me.

290
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,260
I will not let the family down.

291
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,770
Any other questions?

292
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,900
It's just that from now on,

293
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,260
if there's no one else around,

294
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,330
just the two of us,

295
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,180
can I call you "comrade"?

296
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,260
Approved.

297
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,090
Comrade Ding Yi.

298
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,660
Who is it?

299
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,740
Secretary Jiang.

300
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,370
What is it?

301
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,180
Director Lee has already gone to bed.

302
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,810
If there's anything, you can tell me.

303
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,020
The new government's intelligence system
has received orders

304
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,260
to investigate a communist spy.

305
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,660
This afternoon, those who were off duty

306
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,940
and those who left Sanyangli

307
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,020
will all be investigated.

308
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,770
Please go to
Director Liang's residence now.

309
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,770
Alright.

310
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,940
Captain Amu.

311
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,020
I've already told Director Liang
everything I should have said.

312
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,980
Can you let me go now?

313
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,020
Yes, yes.

314
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,090
Mr. Lee.

315
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,090
Darling, be careful.

316
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,130
Director Lee.

317
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,770
Director Lee.

318
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,770
Mr. Lee.

319
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,940
Mr. Dong and Mr. Liu are here.

320
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,980
You two

321
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,090
were not in
the institute this afternoon?

322
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,940
It's just my bad luck.

323
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,530
While I was out eating noodles nearby,

324
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,370
my wallet was stolen,
so I went to the police station.

325
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,530
Who would've thought a communist spy
would act at that time?

326
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,700
Exactly.

327
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,530
When I went out this afternoon,

328
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,940
my wife called to tell me

329
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,940
she wasn't feeling well.

330
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,770
I went to the hospital
to get her medicine.

331
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,770
Don't push me.

332
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,940
I can walk myself.

333
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,370
Mr. Lee.

334
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,290
Mr. Shen is here.

335
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,980
Director Lee, Mrs. Lee.

336
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,020
You're here too?

337
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,260
Mr. Shen,

338
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,020
you also went out this afternoon?

339
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,980
It was a momentary slip.

340
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,260
Miss Yi.

341
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,610
Miss Yi appeared
together with Director Liang.

342
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,370
Once I've verified the details,

343
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,900
I'll come to you again.

344
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,660
Director Liang.

345
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,330
Director Liang.

346
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:08,940
Director Liang.

347
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,330
Sorry to disturb your rest.

348
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,020
I apologize.

349
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,020
Those already questioned may leave.

350
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,330
Pass the word

351
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,180
that from today on,

352
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,330
everyone's entry and exit from Sanyangli
must be reported.

353
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,330
Okay.

354
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,020
Okay.

355
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,940
Mr. Shen, wait a moment.

356
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,330
Director Lee, Mrs. Lee,

357
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,260
please.

358
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,330
Director Liang,

359
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,130
this afternoon,

360
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,370
you should know very well

361
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,020
where I was and what I did.

362
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,290
Why waste time

363
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,370
asking us again?

364
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,500
I need to prepare

365
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,700
a formal inquiry report

366
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,770
for the new government.

367
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,530
Please cooperate with Captain Amu.

368
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,660
Rest assured, Director Liang.

369
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,260
We will cooperate fully
with Captain Amu's work.

370
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,940
Thank you.

371
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,260
Charlie.

372
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,020
Come upstairs with me.

373
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:19,980
Alright.

374
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,610
Darling.

375
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,500
Let's go.

376
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,850
Director Lee, Mrs. Lee.

377
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,610
Take care.

378
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,770
Close the door.

379
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,770
Director Liang, have a cigarette.

380
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,700
Where did you go this afternoon?

381
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,370
Mr. Lee said

382
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,020
he wanted to eat Napoleon cake
from Lao Da Chang,

383
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,260
so I went to buy it.

384
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,770
Director Lee wasn't
at the institute this afternoon.

385
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,020
Do you know where he went?

386
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,700
Director Liang, I really don't know.

387
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,700
I'm just his assistant.

388
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,940
He doesn't have to report to me
where he goes, right?

389
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,940
But I do know one thing.

390
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,020
When I got back to the institute,

391
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,330
he was already gone.

392
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,130
What's Director Lee's relationship
with Li Huan normally?

393
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,610
They're just colleagues.

394
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,770
Don't usually have much contact.

395
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,530
That's strange then.

396
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,610
This afternoon,
Director Lee skipped work

397
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,940
to help her buy stocks.

398
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,130
Director Liang.

399
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,090
Could it be

400
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,770
because of Mrs. Lee?

401
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,330
They always play mahjong together.

402
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,260
You should know

403
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,940
the place Mrs. Lee holds
in Mr. Lee's heart.

404
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,130
Alright, you can go.

405
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,180
So I can leave now?

406
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,020
Good night.

407
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,330
Goodbye, Director Liang.

408
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,020
You usually wear cologne, right?

409
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,940
Mr. Lee usually likes to use cologne,

410
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,530
so I just use a little from him.

411
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,090
Good night.

412
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,660
Good night, Director Liang.

413
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,940
Mr. Shen, have a seat.

414
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,220
Slow down, will you?

415
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,530
It hurts.

416
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,220
My shoulder's about to be torn off.

417
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,530
Don't be anxious.

418
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,770
Listen, let me explain.

419
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,940
When we went to the institute today,

420
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,020
weren't you on my right side?

421
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,980
Suddenly Li Huan appeared from my left,

422
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,940
and took me away.
Actually, she wanted to...

423
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,740
Ding Yi.

424
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,530
It's one thing to send me away,

425
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,940
but when something this big
happened today,

426
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,020
you didn't even tell me.

427
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,090
I wasn't prepared at all

428
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,940
for Liang Jingyuan's questioning!

429
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,180
You really aren't afraid
I'd say something wrong

430
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,530
and arouse Liang Jingyuan's suspicion?

431
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,090
I didn't even have time
to explain to you

432
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,220
before they just...

433
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,330
I'm sorry.

434
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,940
Let me ask you.

435
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,940
What exactly was Xian Biyun's purpose

436
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,530
going to the Stock Exchange?

437
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,660
Speak!

438
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,020
I don't know.

439
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,850
You're still hiding from me.

440
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,220
I really don't know.

441
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,260
Ding Yi, you must understand

442
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,770
that between me and Ms. Xian,

443
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,090
there is conditional trust.

444
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,220
You are like a balance scale.

445
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,740
If you lean even slightly to her side,

446
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,740
this delicate balance will be broken,

447
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,810
and we will all fall into
an endless abyss,

448
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,090
shattered to pieces.

449
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,050
So, how you act

450
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,570
is up to you to decide.

451
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,500
I understand.

452
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,050
Biyun.

453
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,220
Liang didn't do it on purpose.

454
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,220
A couple of days ago he got word

455
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,180
that a communist spy would make contact
at the Stock Exchange.

456
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,700
And he happened to
run into you and Mr. Lee.

457
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,900
You know what Liang's like.

458
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,500
His mind's full of schemes.

459
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,900
I explained to him.

460
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,500
I told him
you were buying stocks for me.

461
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,610
You can't be upset with me over this.

462
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,900
Nanyang Rubber really went up.

463
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,180
How do you always
get the news so accurately?

464
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,810
I don't care.

465
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,130
If there's good news like that again,

466
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,660
you have to think of me first.

467
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,980
Forget it.

468
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,290
I just helped you buy stocks once,

469
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,500
and almost got taken
as a communist spy by Liang.

470
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,180
I got questioned for no reason.

471
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,980
I'm not doing it again.

472
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,980
Mrs. Liang.

473
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,290
Miss Yi said she's on her period,

474
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,420
so she won't be coming today.

475
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,740
She's such a buzzkill.

476
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,500
We finally have a day off,

477
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,290
now we'll be one short for mahjong.

478
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,180
Is Miss Yi alright?

479
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,980
I have some painkillers
from an old Chinese doctor.

480
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,050
They work wonders.

481
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,900
I'll take some to her.

482
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,050
Why worry yourself?

483
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,500
Mrs. Dong should be free today.

484
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,290
Li Huan, please go invite her.

485
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,810
Alright, I'll go get her.

486
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,500
We'll be waiting.

487
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,290
Stay away from Yi Aida.

488
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,610
Why?

489
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,530
I think she's pretty nice.

490
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,740
Nice? What's nice?

491
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,530
Let me tell you.

492
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,940
That woman definitely has issues.

493
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,050
Yesterday afternoon,

494
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,940
Liang spoke to her alone again.

495
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,370
That day at the Stock Exchange,

496
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,530
she was there too.

497
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,090
What was she doing there?

498
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,610
Buying stocks.

499
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,050
And last time when we played mahjong,

500
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,020
she acted like she didn't care at all.

501
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,740
Yet she just wanted to make money.

502
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,500
She could just explain

503
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,130
this kind of thing clearly.

504
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,700
What's there to hide?

505
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,700
You don't know.

506
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,660
She has a Belarusian boyfriend

507
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,900
who is deep in gambling debt.

508
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,180
Belarusians have sensitive identities.

509
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,940
Could Mr. Yi approve it?

510
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,290
Besides,

511
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,050
why would she want a man

512
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,500
who lets a woman help
pay off his gambling debt?

513
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,900
You're not mad anymore?

514
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,220
Don't be mad anymore.

515
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,180
Tastes good?

516
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,500
No.

517
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,130
You're so picky.

518
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,900
Miss Yi.

519
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,570
Is your face...

520
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,180
alright?

521
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,660
Ms. Xian, what can I do for you?

522
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,660
I heard you got your period

523
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,420
and your stomach hurt badly.

524
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,810
This medicine I have is
very effective for pain.

525
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,050
I especially brought it to you.

526
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,660
Thank you.

527
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,900
Could I come in and sit for a bit?

528
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,500
Ms. Xian.

529
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,330
Ms. Xian.

530
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,170
Oh right,

531
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,330
I have a foundation

532
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,810
that has excellent coverage.

533
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,330
I'll bring it to you later.

534
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,500
This little bruise

535
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,130
is nothing.

536
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,570
When I worked in the Northeast before,

537
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,940
my face and hands

538
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,300
often got frostbite.

539
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,740
It's nothing serious.

540
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,940
You worked in the Northeast before?

541
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,850
Yes.

542
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,260
After graduating from a university
in the Soviet Union,

543
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,850
I went to work in Hsinking.

544
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,820
This time I came to Shanghai

545
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,210
mainly to reunite with my father.

546
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,090
Thank you.

547
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,290
You have quite seniority.

548
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,900
In that case,

549
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,860
Director Liang was really out of line.

550
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,940
Two days ago
I went to the Stock Exchange

551
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,380
to buy stocks for Mrs. Liang,

552
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,570
and he thought I was a communist spy.

553
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,090
But why he's targeting you too?

554
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,500
Sorry.

555
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,210
I spoke out of turn, Miss Yi.

556
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,730
Since you're not feeling well,

557
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,090
I won't disturb you.

558
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,060
I feel a connection with you.

559
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,650
From now on, we should keep in touch.

560
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,020
Sure.

561
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,940
Look, it's connected.

562
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,940
This dead stone
has been brought back to life.

563
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,420
Darling.

564
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,650
Biyun.

565
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,730
You're going out
without tying your tie properly.

566
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,290
Aren't you embarrassed?

567
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,770
Madam, I'll be careful next time.

568
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,540
Observe whether Yi Aida
has stomach problems.

569
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:27,940
Alright.

570
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,460
Thank you.

571
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,940
Don't overwork yourself.

572
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,540
Remember to eat on time

573
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,380
and

574
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,250
take your medicine on time.

575
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,940
I will strictly follow your words.

576
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,940
Alright.

577
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,210
So many people are here.

578
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,770
Don't say that in here.

579
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,540
Alright, get to work.

580
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,250
Careful.

581
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,940
Safe drive.

582
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,420
You're back.

583
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:41,020
What's making you so happy?

584
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,540
I just came back from
the Special Agent Headquarters.

585
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,730
Mr. Li approved

586
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,460
my plan to lure Bai Ye,

587
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,060
letting me secretly investigate.

588
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,820
What's there to be happy about?

589
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,770
If Bai Ye

590
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,570
gets caught,

591
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,170
I'll be immediately promoted
to the Head of Operations there.

592
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,130
You should hurry up and catch him.

593
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,980
What's the rush?

594
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,570
Don't you remember what I told you?

595
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,820
Play a long con to catch a big fish.

596
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,290
Bai Ye will definitely meet

597
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,500
his contact again.

598
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,060
When we catch Bai Ye then

599
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,900
and the contact too,

600
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,980
we can also take down

601
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,170
the CPC Shanghai underground behind him.

602
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,170
Not to mention the promotion,

603
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,060
it'd be possible that I get transfered

604
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,210
to the military leadership.

605
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,690
Tell me,

606
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,570
what's the plan?

607
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,570
Calm down.

608
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,210
Sit there.

609
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,770
News came from Hsinking

610
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,210
that Hei regularly buys a batch of

611
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,210
special medicine for stomach ulcers.

612
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,500
But he doesn't have stomach problems.

613
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,290
What does that mean?

614
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,900
It means that medicine is for Bai Ye.

615
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,540
So

616
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,770
get your General Affairs Office
to spend some money

617
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,060
and arrange a physical checkup
at our institute.

618
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,770
Check who has stomach problems.

619
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,500
That way,

620
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,500
we can narrow down who Bai Ye is.

621
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,090
It's that simple?

622
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,090
Bai Ye is from Hsinking,

623
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,290
absent from the institute on that day,

624
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,610
and has stomach disease.

625
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,770
With all these clues in my hand,

626
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,460
if I still can't catch Bai Ye,

627
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,650
then your husband would be a total fool.

628
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,130
A new announcement.

629
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,020
Let's go take a look.

630
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,130
Tomorrow at 9 AM,

631
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,770
physical checkup at Renji Hospital.

632
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,170
All institute members and families
must participate.

633
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,290
Director Lee.

634
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,130
Miss Yi.

635
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,500
You're not feeling well?

636
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,770
I'm fine.

637
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,020
Thank you for your concern.

638
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,540
Miss Yi, what are you doing?

639
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,900
Sorry, Ms. Ye.

640
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,980
Why so clumsy?

641
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,900
Sorry.

642
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,210
Come in.

643
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,520
[General Affairs Office]

644
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,940
What's wrong with you these days?

645
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,980
You seem distracted.

646
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,340
You're still angry that
Director Liang hit you?

647
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,500
He hit you because you were wrong.

648
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,170
That's separate.

649
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,290
Don't bring your emotions into work.

650
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,210
If you really don't want to work,
then quit.

651
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,210
Ms. Ye, you misunderstand.

652
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,020
That matter was my fault.

653
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,900
I don't blame anyone.

654
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,020
And I have been doing my work properly.

655
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,900
It's just
that I'm really not good at it.

656
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,500
What I'm truly good at is codebreaking.

657
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,650
Could you speak to Director Liang

658
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,290
and let me return to assist my father?

659
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,210
I understand you, Miss Yi.

660
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,090
But you must think for me.

661
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,770
Right now only my department
is short-staffed.

662
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:38,770
If you still want this job,

663
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,650
do your work properly.

664
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,610
Stop thinking about going back
to the Decryption Section.

665
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,570
Otherwise, just quit.

666
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,210
I won't stop you.
