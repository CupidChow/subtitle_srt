[Episode 16]

3
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,930
Liang.

4
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,930
It's Ms. Xian Biyun.

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,210
Don't be afraid.

6
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,380
Joseph.

7
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,380
It's all my fault.

8
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,850
It's all my fault.

9
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,380
It's all my fault, Biyun.

10
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,740
It's my fault

11
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,690
for not staying by your side

12
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,980
and letting you suffer such grievance.

13
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,770
When I proposed,

14
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,450
I promised to protect you well

15
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,260
and not let you suffer
even the slightest harm.

16
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,570
I never thought

17
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,660
I'd break my word so soon.

18
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,690
You already proposed?

19
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,060
Biyun, did you say yes?

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,260
I said yes.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,540
Joseph is already my fiance.

22
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,540
That's wonderful.

23
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,100
Biyun, don't be afraid.

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,500
From now on,
Sanyangli will be your home.

25
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,500
I'll arrange for you to move in.

26
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,780
Mrs. Liang, isn't that inappropriate?

27
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,660
Mr. Lee, you really don't know
how to care for girls.

28
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,500
All the other experts' wives

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,940
live in Sanyangli.

30
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,410
That's right.

31
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,660
She is now your fiancee.

32
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,060
Biyun, if you move in,

33
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,220
I'll have a mahjong partner.

34
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,500
Well...

35
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,730
That's not a problem.

36
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,060
Come on, everyone.

37
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,220
Let's raise our glasses together

38
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,850
to congratulate Director Le

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,780
on tying the knot.

40
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,340
Congratulations.

41
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,730
Come, cheers.

42
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,060
Cheers.

43
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,890
Bravo!

44
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,780
Director Lee.

45
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,220
Come.

46
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,060
Sit down.

47
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,220
What's going on?

48
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,810
What do you mean?

49
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,340
Your engagement.

50
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,340
I was just about to explain to you.

51
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,460
It's fake. Don't take it to heart.

52
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,340
We were acting.

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,020
Acting?

54
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,580
Was it you wanting to act with her

55
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,020
or did she pull you into acting?

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,460
I pulled her.

57
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,810
Let me ask you.

58
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,020
What exactly is her purpose here?

59
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,220
To protect me.

60
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,580
And at the same time
cover for the two of us.

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,020
One more person means more strength.

62
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,020
Why did you make
this decision on your own?

63
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,460
Do you know

64
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,580
why Liang Jingyuan

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,460
brought us here?

66
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,580
On the surface, for work convenience.

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,020
But in fact, to control us.

68
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,580
Do you know

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,580
how dangerous our current situation is?

70
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,370
And what exactly can she assist us with?

71
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,340
Do you know that she is...

72
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,660
Do you know who she is?

73
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,020
Ms. Xian.

74
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,340
Alright.

75
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,460
Ms. Xian is indeed a fine actress.

76
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,700
So next,

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,140
what play will you have Ding Yi
play in with you?

78
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

79
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,460
Let me put it this way,

80
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,810
did you promise Ding Yi something

81
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,050
so that he would help you like this?

82
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,900
This was Ding Yi's own decision.

83
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,410
Ms. Xian.

84
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,540
It's not like you don't know
how Ding Yi feels about you.

85
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,700
Gu Yangshan.

86
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,020
Is that how you judge people?

87
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,340
Ding Yi's no longer what he used to be.

88
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,660
Neither you nor I can control his mind.

89
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,170
Ms. Xian.

90
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,580
Ding Yi

91
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,220
is my brother.

92
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,900
I know he's no longer what he once was.

93
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,370
But I also won't allow him

94
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,140
to be used by anyone.

95
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,490
Ms. Xian.

96
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,700
Director Liang.

97
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,370
Charlie is being derelict in his duty.

98
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,700
He's not even helping you
with your luggage.

99
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,020
Charlie is Mr. Lee's personal assistant,

100
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,340
not mine.

101
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,900
That's not part of his job.

102
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,580
I'll help you.

103
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,930
Thank you, Director Liang.

104
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,370
You're too polite, Ms. Xian.

105
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,810
If we're talking about thanks,

106
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,660
it should be me thanking you.

107
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,410
Yin told me

108
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,220
that my smooth return
to Shanghai this time

109
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,580
was all thanks to Mr. Lee's
and your help.

110
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,980
You flatter me, Director Liang.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,900
It was because of Yin
pulling connections.

112
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,540
I didn't do much to help.

113
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,370
No need to take it to heart.

114
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,660
I'm very clear about

115
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,780
who can do what kind of thing

116
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,140
and who can give what kind of help.

117
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,580
This favor

118
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,250
should still be credited

119
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,650
to you and Director Lee.

120
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,460
Rest assured.

121
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,890
I will absolutely know my limits,

122
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,220
unlike Mr. Takeda.

123
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,700
I won't end up like him.

124
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,770
That was his work matter.

125
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,370
I wouldn't know about it.

126
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,700
Director Liang.

127
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,890
We're old acquaintances now.

128
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,010
I hope that in the future,

129
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,650
you'll take good care of Mr. Lee.

130
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,180
You already said
we're old acquaintances.

131
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,890
Saying such things is silly.

132
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,980
Director Lee is Grand Duke
Tonoji's adopted son.

133
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,850
I must rely on him.

134
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,650
Ms. Xian,

135
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,060
if there's a chance in the future,

136
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,370
please put in a good word for me
with Director Lee.

137
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,890
Director Liang,

138
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,130
you think too highly of me.

139
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,250
I have no say over Mr. Lee.

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,010
I'm just a washed-up actress,

141
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,340
unable to make it out there anymore.

142
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,850
It's only because of a bit of kindness
from Mr. Lee toward me

143
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,730
that I came to seek refuge with him.

144
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,010
Ms. Xian, you're far too modest.

145
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,730
I remember back then,

146
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,530
you managed to send
those rioting students

147
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,010
out of Shanghai at such a young age.

148
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,700
I've always kept that in mind.

149
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,130
Who hasn't done foolish things
in their youth?

150
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,250
Haven't you, Director Liang?

151
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,610
I was at the height of my fame.

152
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,250
Everyone would show me some respect.

153
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,700
Was it really just showing respect?

154
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,370
What do you mean?

155
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,530
Biyun.

156
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,010
Biyun.

157
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,420
Biyun.

158
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,580
Be careful.

159
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,890
Joseph.

160
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,420
Are you alright?

161
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,420
I'm here.

162
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,180
Biyun.

163
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,130
Is that you?

164
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,340
It's me.

165
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,180
I'm right here.

166
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,300
Then...

167
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,700
This is...

168
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,650
Liang Jingyuan.

169
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,690
Pardon me, Director Liang.

170
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,460
But,

171
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,690
Director Liang,

172
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,980
why are you here as well?

173
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,220
Why did you come out alone?

174
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,890
I noticed you hadn't been home.

175
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,620
I was worried.

176
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,890
So,

177
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,050
I had to come look for you.

178
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,410
Just now, Director Liang

179
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,650
helped me carry my luggage,

180
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,570
and we chatted briefly at the door.

181
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,460
I must say,
Director Liang is thoughtful.

182
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,100
Thank you.

183
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,980
You're welcome.

184
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,690
But,

185
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,100
I'm to blame.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,930
I was careless.

187
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,930
Charlie.

188
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,100
Charlie.

189
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,170
Charlie.

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,810
Charlie!

191
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,100
Aren't I just fine?

192
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,220
Director Liang.

193
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,570
My apologies.

194
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,690
Where did you go?

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,340
Mr. Lee,

196
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,930
I was tidying up Ms. Xian's room.

197
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,570
Ms. Xian, I'm really sorry.

198
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,220
In the future, leave
this sort of thing to me.

199
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,570
It's alright.

200
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,980
From now on,

201
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,220
you don't need to bother with me.

202
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,500
Just take good care of Mr. Lee.

203
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,570
Don't let it happen again.

204
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,930
Yes, Mr. Lee.

205
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,810
Everyone,

206
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,220
you've all worked hard today.

207
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,570
It's getting late.

208
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,690
Rest early.

209
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,570
I'll take my leave now.

210
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,930
Director Lee.

211
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,860
The roads in Sanyangli are tricky.

212
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,860
Don't come out alone at night

213
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,690
lest you fall into my arms again.

214
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,980
See you.

215
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,570
Careful, the step.

216
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,220
What did Liang Jingyuan mean just now?

217
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,690
You fell into his arms?

218
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,570
I didn't mean to.

219
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,650
I really tripped.

220
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,340
Now he's already

221
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,500
starting to suspect the three of us,

222
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,100
you understand?

223
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,220
This is the result of you
acting on your own.

224
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,460
Before you do anything,

225
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,340
can you tell me first

226
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,570
and discuss it with me?

227
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,460
In other people's eyes, I'm your eyes.

228
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,460
I have to be by your side, understood?

229
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,170
Ms. Xian.

230
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,170
Let me take you up to see your room.

231
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,170
Let's go.

232
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,570
Let's go.

233
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,290
Take care, Ms. Xian.

234
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,570
This room, here.

235
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,340
I'll put your luggage here for you.

236
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,930
Oh right, Ms. Xian,

237
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,620
see if there's anything you need.

238
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,740
Just tell me.

239
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,100
I'll have them get it ready.

240
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,220
Ms. Xian,

241
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,460
you came looking for me so urgently.

242
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,220
Did you run into some trouble?

243
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,340
I can help you.

244
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,050
You were too impulsive just now.

245
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,460
I saw him pestering you non-stop,

246
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,740
so I thought I'd help you out.

247
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,050
A blind man

248
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,860
going out alone at night
to find someone.

249
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,860
Wouldn't he find it suspicious?

250
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,220
The two of us are an engaged couple.

251
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,570
So it's only natural
that I'd be worried about you.

252
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,980
I was wrong.

253
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,460
I'll be more careful next time.

254
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,930
It's late.

255
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,740
Get some rest early.

256
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,980
Alright, you rest early too.

257
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,050
I'll head off.

258
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,650
Ding Yi.

259
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,690
Ms. Xian.

260
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,460
Tomorrow, after I enter Sanyangli,

261
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,100
it's very likely I'll lose my freedom

262
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,100
and be unable to contact you.

263
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,690
If you have something urgent

264
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,570
that needs my help,

265
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,980
I've thought of a way.

266
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,100
Thank you.

267
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,220
You're welcome.

268
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,100
Good night.

269
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,980
Good night.

270
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,370
So where will I be staying?

271
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,700
Guess you do have some conscience left.

272
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,090
What are you thinking?

273
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,330
These few people

274
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,260
all gave flawless answers
to every question.

275
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,770
Everything seemed just right.

276
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,090
You've been around Xian Biyun so long.

277
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,370
Has she ever mentioned
the proposal to you?

278
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,610
No.

279
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,260
I only found out today myself.

280
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,850
Do you believe today's proposal?

281
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,900
I think

282
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,770
it's believable.

283
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,090
Think about it.

284
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,500
Mr. Lee is British

285
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,090
and wealthy.

286
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,290
If in a couple of years,
he kicks the bucket,

287
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,660
the all his money will be Biyun's.

288
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,180
So what if he's blind?

289
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,660
He's still a strong backer.

290
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,130
Before, Biyun relied on the British.

291
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,740
After the British left,

292
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,330
she had to cozy up to the Japanese.

293
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,370
Biyun has helped us.

294
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,570
If it weren't for her,

295
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,740
would you have been transferred
back to Shanghai so smoothly?

296
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,660
Everything you've analyzed makes sense.

297
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,660
But the simpler something seems,

298
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,850
the deeper it's likely
hidden underneath.

299
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,020
At 9 AM,

300
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,530
BIS's radio station
sends its routine telegram.

301
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,570
The cipher we intercepted is here.

302
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,050
In the coming days,

303
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,290
the Telecommunications Section
will regularly

304
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,050
send over the intercepted ciphers.

305
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,020
I'll copy and pass them on to you all.

306
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,700
Of course,

307
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,980
for Director Lee, it will be in Braille.

308
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,290
Everyone,

309
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,610
this is a codebook intercepted

310
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,050
from Shanghai BIS.

311
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,220
Though it's only half a volume,

312
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,940
I believe with this,

313
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,220
your work efficiency
will be greatly improved.

314
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,050
With this,

315
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,180
there shouldn't be much problem.

316
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,290
Gentlemen,

317
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,770
the sooner we decipher their code,

318
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,130
the sooner we can
grasp their intelligence.

319
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,900
Therefore,

320
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,370
the time given to you is limited.

321
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,050
At most seven days.

322
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,180
Director Liang,

323
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,370
seven days?

324
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,980
Isn't that too short?

325
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,260
Seven days. That's too much to ask.

326
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,530
Exactly.

327
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,260
Mr. Lee, do you want the manuscript?

328
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,180
The Japanese mean that

329
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,500
if we can't decipher

330
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,530
this set of codes within the set time,

331
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,220
all of us

332
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,330
will be eliminated.

333
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,260
Eliminated?

334
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,290
What does that mean?

335
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,020
The Japanese military leadership means

336
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,980
if it's not deciphered
within seven days,

337
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,290
then there's no need to keep you around.

338
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,290
The elimination

339
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,260
means removing everyone here
from the world of the living.

340
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,330
I can crack it in six days.

341
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,660
Five days should do it.

342
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,050
Three days.

343
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,900
I think

344
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,050
three days is enough.

345
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,130
Alright, three days it is.

346
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,850
Within three days,

347
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,570
Sanyangli will be on lockdown.

348
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,370
I'll be waiting for your good news.

349
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,980
Farewell.

350
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,220
Only three days.

351
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,740
Ms. Xian, would you say
these people are crazy?

352
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,900
I've seen people rushing to find a wife,

353
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,370
never ones rushing to find death.

354
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,460
Yi Xiuyuan isn't rushing to die.

355
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,700
He's rushing to send you to your grave.

356
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,330
Why?

357
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,090
We didn't know each other before.

358
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,260
And I've never offended him.

359
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,170
Think about it this way.

360
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,500
If there were a role

361
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,850
that could bring you both fame
and fortune if played well,

362
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,780
and you were originally cast
as the male lead,

363
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,300
but suddenly from nowhere,

364
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,890
a blind man jumped out,

365
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,850
claiming to be from the investors

366
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,650
and insisting on taking your lead role.

367
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,810
What would you do?

368
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,940
I'd kill him.

369
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,890
So you mean

370
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,460
that everyone here now

371
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,220
wants to kill me?

372
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,460
Then we'd better hurry up and crack it.

373
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,700
The Shanghai Bureau
is still using this code system.

374
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,570
If I decipher it,

375
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,500
I'll be a traitor to my country.

376
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,130
That won't do.

377
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,610
You can't crack it.

378
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,260
But if you don't crack it,

379
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,890
we'll just be waiting here to die.

380
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,780
I'll find a way to contact Luo Han

381
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,260
and have the Shanghai Bureau
stop sending messages.

382
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,540
Once we confirm the code
has been abandoned,

383
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,810
we can decipher it.

384
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,330
Can't believe it.

385
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,130
What are you doing?

386
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,740
Mr. Lee is having a headache attack.

387
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,060
I need to go out and buy him medicine.

388
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,940
No way.

389
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,330
Director Liang has ordered

390
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,570
no one can get out
from Sanyangli from today.

391
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,570
Captain Amu.

392
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,940
Mr. Lee is having a headache attack.

393
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,410
I need to go out to buy medicine.

394
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,410
Mr. Lee's head condition
can't be delayed.

395
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,410
Captain Amu,

396
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,740
if something really happens to Mr. Lee,

397
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,170
none of us can
afford the responsibility.

398
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,330
Hey, Captain Amu,

399
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,980
say something.

400
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,980
Yes or no?

401
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,740
If you don't speak,
I'll take it as your consent.

402
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,850
No.

403
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,740
From today, no one
can get out from Sanyangli.

404
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,500
Captain Amu,

405
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,220
I'm truly sorry.

406
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,330
I didn't know you...

407
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,410
Here.

408
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,260
Have a cigarette to calm down.

409
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,740
We're just working for people, right?

410
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,980
How about this?

411
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,780
Give me a piece of paper and a pen.

412
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,090
I'll write down
the name of the medicine

413
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,570
and trouble you to buy it for me.

414
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,940
Alright?

415
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,410
Here.

416
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,940
Thank you, Captain Amu.

417
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,650
What are you doing?

418
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,780
Delivering newspapers.

419
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,850
Go away.

420
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,890
Sanyangli is on lockdown.

421
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,570
Unrelated personnel are
not allowed to enter.

422
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,130
Who am I supposed
to deliver these papers to?

423
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,020
Deliver them to
whoever you want, just leave.

424
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,640
[Sanyangli]

425
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,610
Chief Cao, are you still going
to send messages?

426
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,500
You cannot send it.

427
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,650
Commissioner Luo,
what do you mean by this?

428
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,940
Here.

429
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,980
Commissioner Luo, you don't have
to look at me like that.

430
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,170
When you look at me like that,

431
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,170
it makes me sweat.

432
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,890
Chongqing's intention is

433
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,940
Liang Jingyuan wants
to decipher our Hearts Code.

434
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,170
That's why we decided to use it

435
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,170
to tie up the attention
of Wang's Special Agent Headquarters.

436
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,780
My mission is to send telegrams.

437
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,940
Why must you
make things difficult for me?

438
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,170
I'm not making things difficult for you.

439
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,850
We now know about this mission,

440
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,220
but Gu Yangshan doesn't.

441
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,410
If you continue sending telegrams,

442
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,780
Wang Jingwei's cipher experts

443
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,700
will continue to obtain our data,

444
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,460
and will be able to
decipher it at any time.

445
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,610
Before our orders are issued,

446
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,810
Gu Yangshan will
definitely not hand over

447
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,700
the decryption method
for the Hearts radio station.

448
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,850
Given their understanding
of Joseph Lee's abilities,

449
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,850
they will definitely suspect
Joseph Lee's stance,

450
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,130
especially Liang Jingyuan will.

451
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,300
He's very suspicious.

452
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:46,940
If you do this,

453
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,060
you're sending them to their deaths.

454
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,410
Chief Cao,

455
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,170
I beg you.

456
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,890
Please find a way

457
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,850
and give me a little more time.

458
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,890
After I establish contact
with Gu Yangshan,

459
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,540
it won't be too late
to send the telegrams then.

460
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,170
Commissioner Luo.

461
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,610
You were the one who insisted on
making Sword Thrust Operation

462
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:39,300
independent from the Shanghai Bureau.

463
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,500
Now,

464
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,740
you are Gu Yangshan's liaison.

465
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,610
As for how you re-establish contact,

466
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,610
that's your business.

467
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,940
You cannot disrupt my work here.

468
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,500
You can't

469
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,940
get all the credit

470
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,170
and I'll take the responsibility

471
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,130
for delaying the telegrams, right?

472
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,850
Chief Cao,

473
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,330
are you resisting Japan

474
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,850
or just trying to climb the ranks?

475
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,370
Well,

476
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,330
are those two conflicting?

477
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:13,650
You!

478
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,610
Is anyone there?

479
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,570
Brother-in-law.

480
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,170
Busy with national affairs?

481
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,410
What are you doing here?

482
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,610
I don't have spare money for you.

483
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,940
Listen to what you're saying.

484
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,850
I'm just visiting my own brother-in-law.

485
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,650
You act as if it's all about money.

486
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,890
Am I that kind of person?

487
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,500
It's cold.

488
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,260
Your sister says drinking cold tea
gives a stomachache.

489
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,410
Brother-in-law.

490
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,370
Do you know who I saw in Sanyangli

491
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,410
a few days ago?

492
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,810
That pair of jokers of yours.

493
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,260
Didn't expect those two fakes
to be quite capable.

494
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,300
As soon as Takeda died,

495
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,500
they immediately ran to Liang's place.

496
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,890
Good, brother-in-law.

497
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,850
You...

498
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,740
Why are you hitting me?

499
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,610
Just like your sister.

500
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,300
Why does it sound like

501
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,940
you came here to me

502
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,540
to extort hush money?

503
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,980
Listen to what you're saying.

504
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,980
I was just thinking that if
there's any important info,

505
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,090
I should report it to you, right?

506
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,410
This matter is no longer
under my jurisdiction.

507
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,020
Let me be clear.

508
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,940
Here,

509
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,610
I don't have a single penny.

510
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,330
You can't say that, brother-in-law.

511
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,650
Think about it.

512
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,170
Those two are from your bureau.

513
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,570
You know I can't keep my mouth shut.

514
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,020
If I accidentally tell
Liang Jingyuan everything,

515
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,460
wouldn't they be finished?

516
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,890
They all say it's glorious
to die for the country.

517
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,650
Why should I bother?

518
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,570
No.

519
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,780
If you have nothing else,
get out of here now.

520
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,700
Brother-in-law.

521
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,130
You're really something.

522
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,690
These stray cats in the yard
are really annoying.

523
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,770
Day after day,

524
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,250
they make it impossible for me to sleep.

525
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,380
Captain Amu.

526
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,210
Ms. Xian.

527
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,940
Is there anything?

528
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,770
What exactly is going on?

529
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,170
Probably the stray cats nearby
are in heat again.

530
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,770
I'm just telling you

531
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,770
to handle it.

532
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,210
Alright, Ms. Xian.

533
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,900
Tell him to send more men.

534
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,570
I'm not the only one
who can't sleep at night.

535
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,770
Alright, Ms. Xian.

536
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,420
This is the consequence of you
acting on your own.

537
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,060
If there's anything,

538
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,250
can you discuss it with me beforehand?

539
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,420
We're now grasshoppers on the same rope.

540
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,170
You just climbed onto the roof yourself.

541
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,340
If you fall, what am I supposed to do?

542
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,420
Besides,

543
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,170
Liang Jingyuan already said

544
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,170
to close here for three days.

545
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,940
He always keeps his word.

546
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,610
Isn't this just running
into the line of fire?

547
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,420
If it weren't for Ms. Xian,

548
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,060
could you have gotten out?

549
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,540
I'm furious.

550
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,420
I'll think of another way.

551
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,940
I have a plan.

552
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,170
50 cases of whiskey

553
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,540
and 100 cases of cigarettes
have arrived.

554
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,170
Then we will...

555
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,250
Split it fifty-fifty.

556
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,650
Liang.

557
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,020
Mr. Liang.

558
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,730
Director Liang.

559
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,420
Liang, Liang.

560
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,610
Where are you going so late?

561
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,130
Director Lee is having a headache.

562
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,540
He asked me to come
and check on him.

563
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,730
I said Sanyangli is on lockdown,

564
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,060
no one's allowed to enter or exit.

565
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,500
Why did you still let him come?

566
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,380
I have business to do.

567
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,250
He's not an outsider.

568
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,980
What's there to be afraid of?

569
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,020
You just

570
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,060
always cause trouble for me.

571
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,090
Hurry up and deal with it.

572
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,170
Mrs. Liang.

573
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,380
Inspector Li, wait for me.

574
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,210
Mr. Lee.

575
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,940
Mr. Lee, what's wrong?

576
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,250
Coming.

577
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,650
Director Liang, please come in.

578
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,210
Sir, Madam.

579
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,340
Director Liang is here.

580
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,650
Please have a look.

581
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,460
Please...

582
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,170
Yin.

583
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,610
Biyun.

584
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,170
You finally came.

585
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,020
Did Mr. Lee take his medicine?

586
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,690
Yes, yes, the medicine is all here.

587
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,540
Look, he vomited it all out here.

588
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:30,860
Then...

589
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,170
Send him to the hospital.

590
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,060
Director Lee.

591
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,860
Director Lee.

592
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,770
Director Lee.

593
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,210
It's all my fault.

594
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,610
It's not that I don't want
to send you to the hospital.

595
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,610
It's just that the rules
were just set yesterday.

596
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,610
I can't break the rules
in less than one night.

597
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,020
I'm truly in a difficult position.

598
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,290
Very difficult.

599
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,340
Mr. Lee.

600
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,020
Director Lee.

601
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,250
Director Liang.

602
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,690
Look at his condition now.

603
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,610
If something really happens,

604
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,420
who will be responsible?

605
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,900
You or the military leadership?

606
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,460
Liang.

607
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,610
Liang.

608
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,730
Madam.

609
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,570
If you ask me,

610
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,340
let's not make things hard
for Director Liang.

611
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,250
Director Liang has his duties.

612
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,900
It's indeed hard for him
to go back on his word.

613
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,900
I can propose a compromise.

614
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,980
What do you think?

615
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,730
Let's invite Dr. Meng Jie over.

616
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:32,900
Wait a minute.

617
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,610
Who is Meng Jie?

618
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,090
Dr. Meng Jie has accompanied
Dr. Schwarz

619
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,380
and Dr. Miyamoto

620
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,210
to treat Mr. Lee before.

621
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,940
It would be best if she came.

622
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,500
Right?

623
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,460
Right, right, right.

624
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,210
It would be safer
to invite a doctor here.

625
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,250
Liang.

626
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,820
Liang!

627
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,610
Amu.

628
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,020
Go and invite Dr. Meng here for me.

629
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,940
Mr. Lee,

630
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,250
Dr. Meng will be here shortly.

631
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,380
Please bear with it a little longer.

632
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,020
Charlie.

633
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,130
Hurry up.

634
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,820
Help Director Lee upstairs to rest.

635
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,090
Mr. Lee.

636
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,500
Help Mr. Lee up.

637
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,090
Sir, I'll help you upstairs.

638
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:36,820
Sir.

639
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,060
Mr. Lee.

640
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,980
Thank you, Director Liang.

641
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,690
Thank you, Mrs. Liang.

642
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,020
Don't cry.

643
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,570
The doctor will be here soon.

644
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,210
