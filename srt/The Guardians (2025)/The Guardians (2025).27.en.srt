00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,540
This is the second time
you've used my mom to threaten me.

8
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,690
In a moment, a car will pull up outside.

9
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,540
You'll leave in that car.

10
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,260
I called the shots to start this play.

11
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,820
And I'll be the one to end it.

12
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,980
Don't forget, you're just an extra.

13
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,100

00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,170

The one who killed Mr. Hashimoto

19
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,130
has already been caught.

20
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,940
Now the Major General suspects
he's linked to Director Lee.

21
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,570
Director Lee needs to
head to Yuyin Pavilion

Why don't I hear his voice anywhere?

27
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,140

30

The man on stage has confessed.

31
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,980
He says you're with the Communist Party

32
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,540

33
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,660

Let's end the storm

42
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,220
I'm a member of the Communist Party

43

and an agent

I never meant to betray anyone.

I just can't hold on any longer.

55
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,020
You can't see what I've become now.

56

Living feels worse than dying.

57
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,660
But I don't want to die.

58
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,900
It's absurd.

59
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,900
A meeting spot? What's the point?

60
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,370
We met at Yuyin Pavilion six months ago.

61
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,020
Later, you told me
things were getting risky,

62
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,580
and that we should change the spot.

63
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,460
So we went to the backstage
at the Chaosheng Troupe.

64
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,900
The Chaosheng Troupe?

65
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,220
Did Xian Biyun know about it?

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,180
I have no idea.
We only had one-way contact.

67
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,490
My only contact was Joseph Lee.

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,730
I really don't know anything else.

69
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,420
What about Charlie Gu?

70
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,100
Charlie Gu was a known traitor.

71
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,650
I told you that long ago,

72
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,420
stop letting him be around you
all the time.

73
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,940
I said he might be

74
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,180
a spy placed next to you
by the Japanese.

75
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,460
I really don't know.

76
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,420
What scene are you playing at now?

77
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,340
Can I sit
and wait for the Major General?

78
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,060
Hey.

79
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,580
Yes.

80
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,700
Get him a chair.

81
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,460
Yes.

82
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,460
Bring a chair over.

83
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,300
Yes.

84
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,850
How did the Major General know
he was anti-Japanese?

85
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,610
To steal the codebook
for the secure radio

86
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,340
of the Pacification Committee,

87
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,340
he killed the Major General's only son.

88
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,100
That makes it even more absurd.

89
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,580
All of you know

90
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,180
I was never involved

91
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,850
in the Pacification Committee's work.

92
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,490
So how could I possibly know

93
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,940
about this so-called codebook

94
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,490
and whose hands it's in?

95
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,340
Luo, my friend,

96
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,490
making up stories takes skill.

97
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,420
Captain Lee,

98
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,820
our organization has strict rules.

99
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,220
I'm not allowed to ask how you knew

100
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,580
the codebook was with Hashimoto.

101
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,580
You told me to take out Hashimoto.

102
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,730
But he was Sasaki's son.

103
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,180
Sasaki would rather
kill a thousand by mistake

104
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,820
than let one target slip away.

105
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,610
Let's just...admit it.

106
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,100
Once we do, each of us
will have a way to survive.

107
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,980
Alright?

108
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,610
Hashimoto...

109
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,730
The Major General has a son?

110
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,340
Coming.

111
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,820
Coming.

112
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,460
All the noise.

113
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,820
Like the sound's chasing your life away.

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,980
Commissioner Gu, what's going on?

115
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,980
Is Mr. Liang in? I need to see him.

116
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,300
He's been busy all night
and just fell asleep.

117
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,490
What's so urgent?
I can pass the message.

118
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,300
I have to tell him face to face.

119
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,300
Why are you being like this?

120
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,850
Let Commissioner Gu come up.

121
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,700
You sure Ding Yi was taken
to Yuyin Pavilion?

122
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,610
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

123
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,580
Looks like in the end,

124
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,730
we're getting blamed
for Sasaki's son's death.

125
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,820
We just meant to throw the heat
on someone else,

126
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,580
but ended up lighting the whole armory.

127
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,460
Liang, Liang.

128
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,220
Sorry to interrupt your rest.

129
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,980
Make yourself comfortable.

130
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,060
If I remember correctly,

131
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,890
this foreign-owned radio station
was listed

132
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,580
as one of the enemy stations.

133
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,060
Ain't it weird listening to it
so loud in public?

134
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,580
You're my friend and I trust you.

135
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,300
Liang, I don't see it that way.

136
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,700
Contacting Chongqing is a big deal.

137
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,490
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

138
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,610
Miss Megumi.

139
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,700
May I have a word with you in private?

140
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,340
Your leg's healed?

141
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,490
Looks like we've met before.

142
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,580
That's good, saves us the introductions.

143
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,300
Miss Megumi.

144
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,980
I'd like to ask you to help Joseph.

145
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,940
Since the war began,

146
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,340
the sugar price in Chongqing

147
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,460
has soared over three hundred times.

148
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,700
But just a few months ago,

149
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,700
the Sugar Procurement Committee
in Chongqing

150
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,980
received a donation,

151
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,100
a batch of imported
sugar production machinery.

152
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,700
Really?

153
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,700
Of course.

154
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,940
It instantly solved the technical issues

155
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,180
for all sugar mills
near Sichuan and Guizhou.

156
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,580
But according to insider news,

157
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,420
the donor is from Shunde,
Guangdong province, surname Ye.

158
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,700
If I'm not mistaken,

159
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,100
isn't that your in-law's family?

160
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,700
The Ye Family from Shunde, Guangdong.

161
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,060
That's right.

162
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,340
But there are many people
named Ye in Shunde.

163
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,580
You're not suspecting my wife, are you?

164
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,460
Liang, you still don't see me
as a real friend.

165
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,610
Not telling me the truth.

166
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,220
Why would people
from the Ministry of Economy

167
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,980
and the Finance Committee

168
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,940
return to Chongqing
and privately lobby for you?

169
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,980
And there's one more thing.

170
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,940
Only the BIS refuses to back down,

171
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,580
because you blew up
a liaison point of Shanghai BIS.

172
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,300
I'm a member
of the Pacification Committee.

173
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,340
Let's not bring up the past.

174
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,100
But Liang,

175
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,220
you should think about
your wife's family.

176
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,980
The Ye Family spent a fortune

177
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,220
for you to get this seat.

178
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,420
It was a hefty amount.

179
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,730
If you plan to keep climbing higher,

180
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,700
can the Ye Family afford it again?

181
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,060
Let's drop this topic.

182
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,060
But Chongqing
is a whole different story.

183
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,700
The frontlines keep falling back.

184
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,220
Supplies in the rear are running low.

185
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,610
If the Ye Family donates a few machines,

186
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,060
it's like rain after a drought
for the rear.

187
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,700
People will be eager to owe you a favor.

188
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,100
Liang.

189
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,820
The Nationalist-controlled Areas
are where you can spread your wings.

190
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,340
Gu, you just said it yourself,

191
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,340
the battlefront is losing ground.

192
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,820
So if I go there,

193
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,100
what kind of hero could I still be?

194
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,060
Liang, you're playing dumb.

195
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,220
The United States.

196
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,850
The US is preparing to enter the war.

197
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,250
1941, March,

198
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,820
Congress passed the Lend-Lease Law

199
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,580
and allocated $7 billion
for implementation.

200
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,250
This law was, in fact, designed to...

201
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,700
Liang, you've already heard the news.

202
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,860
The entire United States

203
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,460
is now under emergency status.

204
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,180
You've lived abroad
and seen the world,

205
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,140
so you understand
the strength of the US.

206
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,530
Take energy alone as an example,

207
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,010
eighty percent of Japan's oil

208
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,530
comes from US imports.

209
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,380
If the US enters the war,

210
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,700
the whole situation will change.

211
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,900
By then, even the Wang Government

212
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,220
won't be able to hold its local power.

213
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,420
What can a small Pacification Committee

214
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,180
possibly do then?

215
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,660
I've already changed the dressing.

216
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,730
You said the review Sasaki initiated

217
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,290
is aimed at our Tonoji Family.

218
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,900
Yes, this is already the second time.

219
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,860
Major General Sasaki
isn't targeting Joseph Lee.

220
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,660
He's going after
the entire Tonoji family.

221
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,660
Miss Megumi,
we can't let him keep going.

222
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,050
You've been flaunting the title
of the Duke's sworn son,

223
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,490
and running scams all over Shanghai.

224
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,660
I haven't settled the score with you,

225
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,700
so where did you get the nerve

226
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,700
to come ask me to save some fraud?

227
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,660
Why would he use

228
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,900
the name of the Duke's sworn son?

229
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,660
Joseph will explain it to you,

230
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,730
but he's definitely not a fraud.

231
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,730
He's been doing everything he can

232
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,220
to protect
the Tonoji family's interests.

233
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,490
Without him,

234
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,860
in the New Government
and even the East Asia Development Board,

235
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,860
the Tonoji family

236
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,860
would have lost its place long ago.

237
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,730
Absurd.

238
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,490
The Tonoji family is close to
the Emperor of Japan.

239
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,490
Our position

240
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,420
doesn't need some outsider to defend.

241
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,900
The Grand Duke is gravely ill

242
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,250
and you stay out of political affairs.

243
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,250
You likely haven't kept up
with the situation.

244
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,660
The Tōjō faction is eager to

245
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,050
declare war on Britain and the US.

246
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,980
The Japanese military leadership
is targeting

247
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,010
those linked to British
or American forces.

248
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,900
The Tonoji family is the primary target.

249
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,180
If it weren't for Joseph,

250
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,980
holding off the pressure on the family,

251
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,490
the Grand Duke's sickbed by now

252
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,220
would probably have been moved into

253
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,220
the interrogation room.

254
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,490
Mrs. Lee,

255
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,220
are you trying to stir up discord

256
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,420
within the Imperial Army of Japan?

257
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,220
You'll know

258
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,700
when you read the interrogation records.

259
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,530
I see.

260
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,220
You came here to ease my worries.

261
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,770
Liang, I'm not just here
to ease your worries.

262
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,050
I'm also thinking about this matter.

263
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,460
The Tonojis have already arrived.

264
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,490
Which means the supporter
behind Joseph Lee

265
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,380
has shown up too.

266
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,140
Even if you become the Chairman,

267
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,530
do you think you can personally

268
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,530
break Joseph Lee's leg?

269
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,900
No, that's impossible.

270
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,220
Only by returning to Chongqing

271
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,860
can you use the name of resist japan

272
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,900
to openly take revenge on Joseph Lee.

273
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,980
Now that's hitting the point.

274
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,980
It was your BIS that killed Sasaki Taro.

275
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,380
Liang, not "your".

276
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,220
It was done by our people.

277
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,380
You get our man out safely.

278
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:37,900
And I'll call
the Confidential Office of BIS

279
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,730
to put in a word for you.

280
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,250
That explains it.

281
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,860
No wonder...

282
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,290
No wonder when I reported to Chongqing,

283
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,460
I never got a reply.

284
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,250
Turns out this was the problem.

285
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,250
Liang,

286
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,900
the Daruma Doll at home
can't keep wobbling.

287
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,730
We're out of time.

288
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,980
Charlie.

289
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,220
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

290
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,380
You know what?

291
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,730
When I first saw you,

292
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,460
I found you very intriguing.

293
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,980
I didn't expect someone so young

294
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,460
to have such deep roots
in Chongqing authority.

295
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,010
The Ministry of Economy,
the Finance Committee, the BIS...

296
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,420
You always get first-hand information.

297
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,250
So, I want to ask,

298
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,420
who exactly is backing you?

299
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,980
Does it really matter?

300
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,860
It does.

301
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,420
We're all in this together.

302
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,220
Doesn't matter who earns more or less.

303
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,140
What matters is who I work with.

304
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,220
No.154 Nanyang Road, Gu Residence.

305
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,460
I'll say it again.

306
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,140
The wise adapt to the times.

307
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,730
Young Master Gu, to a great partnership.

308
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,010
To a great partnership.

309
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,010
To a great partnership.

310
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,700
I understand, Miss Megumi.

311
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,940
But the interrogation record
is classified.

312
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,660
It can't be shared outside.

313
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,460
I have zero interest
in your affairs in China.

314
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,460
Nor do I care

315
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,180
what you're planning for Joseph Lee.

316
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,460
All I want to know

317
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,770
is your move against the Tonoji family.

318
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,620
If the Lieutenant General wants answers,

319
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,330
why not just ask me directly?

320
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,010
Why ask an outsider like Joseph Lee?

321
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,380
What's that supposed to mean?

322
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,460
Miss Megumi, you've got it wrong.

323
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,980
The reason we asked about Joseph Lee

324
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,860
is because we also received a letter

325
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,250
reporting the Tonoji family.

326
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,250
The claims in it were not entirely true.

327
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,220
That's why we didn't alarm you.

328
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,220
Since there was such a letter,

329
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,050
why didn't you come verify with us?

330
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,380
General Yasui,
you're the Duke's old friend.

331
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,980
Once the Grand Duke wakes up,

332
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,900
[Interrogation Record]
and hears what you did today,

333
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,530
he's going to be disappointed.

334
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,940
A report said you're trying

335
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,700
to monopolize the cipher design work
of the New Government.

336
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,980
Was it instructed by the Tonoji family?

337
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,770
Your father was the math tutor

338
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,220
of the Grand Duke Tonoji in Britain.

339
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,700
He was often seen
at the Tonoji Residence.

340
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,290
In the Grand Duke's residence,

341
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,290
which British nationals have you met?

342
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,220
Mr. Lee,

343
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,460
every word you say here

344
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,460
will be recorded.

345
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,420
If proven false, it's an offense
against the Japanese army.

346
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,460
Under Japan's wartime laws,
that's punishable by death.

347
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,770
Don't worry.

348
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,010
I stand by every word I say.

349
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,420
I'm even willing to stake my own life

350
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,900
to guarantee to the Japanese army

351
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,010
that the Tonoji family's loyalty
is unwavering.

352
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,700
You can doubt me,

353
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,180
but you should never doubt
the Grand Duke.

354
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,660
General Yasui is in the neutral camp,

355
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,770
so Joseph could still hold his ground.

356
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,460
But Miss Megumi,

357
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,620
today he's being questioned by Sasaki.

358
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,220
If he says one wrong thing,

359
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,220
Sasaki will accuse the Tonoji family

360
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,290
of colluding with the enemy.

361
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,050
By then, it'll be too late for anything.

362
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,980
Where did they take Joseph Lee?

363
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,530
Yuyin Pavilion.

364
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,700
You said I ordered you to take him out?

365
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,010
Stop pretending.

366
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,290
There was a line of bodies
at your feet just now.

367
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,220
All were killed for angering Sasaki.

368
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,460
Stop covering for the Organization.

369
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,250
And stop dragging innocent people in.

370
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,770
The next one lying at your feet

371
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,460
might just be Mrs. Lee.

372
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,700
Enough!

373
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,460
Luo Han.

374
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,980
Quit making things up.

375
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,250
Your name is Luo Han.

376
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,220
You quit the math program
at the University of Shanghai,

377
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,770
then followed your senior Mao Renfeng

378
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,380
and went to Whampoa Military Academy.

379
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,110
After graduation, you joined

380
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,220
the Telecommunications Section of BIS.

381
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,250
In 1940,

382
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,050
you were reassigned
from Chongqing to Shanghai

383
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,860
on a covert mission.

384
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,770
Am I right?

385
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:05,660
Your senior really counts on you.

386
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,620
He just called from Chongqing

387
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,980
and offered me a pretty good deal.

388
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,010
But I turned it down.

389
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,770
Soon after, I made him an offer instead.

390
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,010
I told him,

391
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,700
this Luo Han is just a pawn.

392
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:30,220
But his partner is something else.

393
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:35,620
They've been deep undercover
in the New Government.

394
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,290
They know our intel inside out,

395
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,140
even capable of directly calling

396
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,860
the Confidential Office
of BIS in Chongqing.

397
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,860
That rank must be pretty high.

398
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,980
I want this person's name.

399
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,770
If you're willing to tell me,

400
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,010
I can let Luo Han live.

401
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,250
Guess what they said.

402
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,980
He said,

403
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,770
eve if

404
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,700
I execute you a thousand times,

405
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,460
he still wouldn't spill

406
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,250
a single word of info about that person.

407
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,220
Mr. Luo, isn't that ironic?

408
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,980
Here you are, risking your life,

409
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,220
fighting for your party and country,

410
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,730
shielding your comrades,

411
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,700
yet your own country

412
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,250
tossed you aside

413
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,140
like a rag

414
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,250
to protect that person.

415
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,220
So in your country,

416
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,290
even lives don't weigh the same.

417
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,460
Now I'm even more curious,

418
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,220
Mao Renfeng…

419
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,860
Who is this person?

420
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,860
He's worth abandoning
such a trusted junior.

421
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,050
Mao Renfeng

422
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,530
doesn't want to make a deal with me.

423
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,220
You should be willing to deal with me.

424
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,460
Tell me his name.

425
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,460
And I'll spare your life.

426
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,980
Hey, my plate!

427
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,620
Alright.

428
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,290
This way, boss.

429
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,290
Breaking Sword Thrust Operation

430
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,490
away from Cao Yuanzhong is hard.

431
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,620
So if today's mission fails,

432
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,770
can you take the heat for it?

433
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,700
Gun.

434
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,010
Yes.

435
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,290
You're a hero.

436
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,420
You once dreamed of going out in glory.

437
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,660
It was fate
that never gave you that chance.

438
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:18,460
But I'm giving you a chance to live.

439
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,220
Are you really going to risk it all

440
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,940
for a party and a country

441
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,530
that don't value your life?

442
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,180
Is it really worth it?

443
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,860
My partner is

444
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,340
Joseph Lee.

445
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:31,420
Major General,
this man has lost his mind.

446
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,900
Mr. Lee, he framed you.

447
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,380
Mr. Lee.

448
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,820
Care to join in

449
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,420
for a quick round

450
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,530
just to blow off steam?

451
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,740
I'd like to as well, Major General.

452
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,900
But I'm blind, I can't see anything.

453
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,570
If I end up killing him,

454
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,570
wouldn't that cut off your lead

455
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,900
right here and now?

456
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,420
That would ruin everything.

457
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,780
You don't need to worry about that.

458
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,420
This guy's had incredible luck.

459
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,610
He's taken out many of our people,

460
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,130
yet the last bullet

461
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,900
kept for himself got jammed.

462
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,170
You might not even hit him.

463
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,740
But I just want to see this time,

464
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,530
if he can still face death
so fearlessly.

465
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:24,530
I'll talk, I'll talk... It's Gu...

466
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,900
Major General, what's wrong?

467
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,650
Did I kill him?

468
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,530
Mr. Lee, your shooting skills

469
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,610
are much better than you said.

470
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,420
You almost took his life.

471
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,530
You nearly killed him.

472
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,900
He almost spilled everything.

473
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,570
Major General, he's passed out.

474
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,610
Let's stop the questioning.

475
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,420
Then let's question Mr. Lee instead.

476
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,090
Who was he trying to protect?

477
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,420
Major General Sasaki.

478
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,610
Joseph! Joseph!

479
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,780
Biyun! Biyun!

480
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,340
Thank goodness, you're alright.

481
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,570
Take Mr. Lee back.

482
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,050
Yes.

483
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,570
Megumi.

484
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,490
Right now, he...

485
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,260
He's suspected of resisting Japan

486
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,010
and of murdering a Japanese officer.

487
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,780
We can't let him go.

488
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,820
Megumi.

489
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,570
Don't worry about me.

490
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,420
I can't let my matters
drag down the Tonoji family.

491
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,570
You're only a Major General.

492
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,570
People from the Tonoji family

493
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,050
are not at your disposal to interrogate.

494
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,050
So now you're covering for him

495
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,610
and standing
against the Japanese military?

496
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,490
Miss Lin.

497
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,490
Can you truly speak
for the Tonoji family?

498
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,460
I can speak for the Tonoji family.

499
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,050
But can you speak
for the Japanese military?

500
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,460
You're nothing but a dog,

501
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,010
wagging its tail for Tōjō.

502
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,860
Don't think too highly of yourself.

503
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,460
Take them away.

504
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,530
No way.

505
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:26,820
Major General.

506
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,650
Major General.

507
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,130
Major General.

508
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,820
Major General.

509
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,980
Taro's funeral is already prepared.

510
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,980
Would you like to take a look?

511
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,610
Miss Megumi, you should leave.

512
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,610
But remember what you just said.

513
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,900
The Tonoji family will definitely pay

514
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,420
for what happened today.

515
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,530
Go.

516
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,460
Once the Spirit Transfer Ritual
is set up,

517
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,610
take them there
and question them one by one.

518
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,300
Yes.

519
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,340
Why did you pretend
to be the Duke's sworn son?

520
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,900
Miss Megumi.

521
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,570
Once we're back

522
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,860
at the hospital,

523
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,530
we'll apologize to
the Grand Duke in person.

524
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,340
You'd better.

525
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,050
If you can't give me a good reason,

526
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,090
I'll be right there at the Duke's side

527
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,300
and handle this for the Tonoji family

528
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,090
to clean up our own.

529
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,820
How's the person doing?

530
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,300
Still alive.

531
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,300
Locked up in the Military Police HQ.

532
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,300
Get him out no matter the cost.

533
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,460
At any cost?

534
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,460
No problem.

535
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,170
But Young Master,

536
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,090
if I pull this off for you,

537
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,050
my standing with the Japanese...

538
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,090
Get the him out.

539
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,460
Either today or tomorrow,

540
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,860
I'll arrange for you and Luo Han
to evacuate.

541
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:14,900
