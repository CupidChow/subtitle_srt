00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,720
[Gu Yangshan, agent,
Shanghai BIS]

193
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,220
Old friend,

194
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,700
long time no see.

195
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,360
[Japanese-Occupied Zone,
Public Concession]

196
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,180
Did you design MSS's new cipher?

197
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,980
What makes you think it was me?

198
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,180
The new cipher uses a stream cipher,

199
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,940
and only a handful of people

200
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,460
can handle that.

201
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,820
And back in college,

202
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,940
you focused on the XOR operation.

203
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,820
My sources told me

204
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,060
that MSS's new cipher

205
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,820
was designed by

206
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,820
a brilliant British-Chinese mathematician
from Oxford.

207
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,980
I figured it had to be you.

208
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,730
That's right.

209
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,610
You never let me down.

210
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,130
So,

211
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,420
can't crack it, can you?

212
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,820
How far have you got?

213
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,010
Tell me

214
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,370
the details.

215
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,570
Do you know how many people died

216
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,330
at the Northern Jiangsu Front

217
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,860
just because of your cipher?

218
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,490
Just tell me,

219
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,010
how far you've cracked it now.

220
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,810
So you think math is more important

221
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,140
than anyone's life, right?

222
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,620
It's about the math problem.

223
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,900
You should look for answers in math,

224
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,180
instead of coming here

225
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,290
to threaten me by dragging

226
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,660
unrelated individuals in.

227
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,570
You owe me all of this.

228
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,050
This is our own battlefield.

229
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,570
I want to see you with no way out,

230
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,570
watch your reputation crash.

231
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,810
For every life lost here,

232
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,620
I'll put the blame on you, Gu Yangshan.

233
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,050
Alright.

234
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,140
Then let's keep things professional.

235
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,660
Back to the BIS.

236
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,380
I have a hundred ways to make you talk.

237
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,810
Gu Yangshan,

238
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,530
you've changed.

239
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,140
Don't forget,

240
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,900
you're still a mathematician.

241
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,860
Now you're using

242
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,980
BIS tricks on me.

243
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,290
Come on, old friend.

244
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,050
Let's keep some dignity here

245
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,860
and just walk out together.

246
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:18,900
Alright.

247
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,050
Mr. Lee.

248
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,660
Mr...

249
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,330
Is this necessary?

250
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,330
Let me break it down.

251
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,810
Before, I took one piece from one pile.

252
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,660
But today, they gave two piles.

253
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,620
Shouldn't I take two pieces?

254
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,730
I'll pay you.

255
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,610
Hey, man,

256
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,050
I'm just a bystander.

257
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,530
But now, you're in this too.

258
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,020
Come on, get up.

259
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:11,850
Say it standing.

260
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,370
No, it's comfier on my knees.

261
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,610
Interesting.

262
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,260
Who are you?

263
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,700
I'm not Joseph Lee.

264
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,370
Of course I know.

265
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,850
I'm asking about you.

266
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,940
Who are you?

267
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,330
My name's Ding Yi.

268
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,420
I'm an actor.

269
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,850
Hey, man.

270
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,370
Are you
from the Anti-Traitor Squad?

271
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,770
Yeah, that's right.

272
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,850
Come on, get up.

273
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,850
Thanks, man.

274
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,850
What's this?

275
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,610
Don't move.

276
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,530
The faster you move,
the faster you die.

277
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,610
It's a neurotoxin.

278
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,770
If you don't get the antidote
in six hours,

279
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,090
you're done for.

280
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,610
Central nervous paralysis.

281
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,330
You'll be suffocated to death.

282
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,260
Sir.

283
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,050
Sir.

284
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,940
Don't kneel.

285
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,420
My legs are giving out.

286
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,810
Sir,

287
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,940
aren't you with the Squad?

288
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,460
Doesn't the Squad spare good people?

289
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,130
Yeah, we don't hurt the innocent.

290
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,570
But right now, I can't tell if you are.

291
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,290
Help me out first,

292
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,610
then I'll know if you're good.

293
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,020
You don't even have a first aid kit.

294
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,770
Come with me.

295
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,900
Close the door.

296
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,770
Manager, almost there.

297
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,810
Alright.

298
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,900
Taking me where?

299
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,660
Why are they here?

300
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,850
When class ended just now,

301
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,530
Takeda told me

302
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,090
he'd bring Kondo

303
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,290
to apologize to me personally.

304
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,570
Didn't expect he'd come so fast.

305
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,940
If you want to live, play along.

306
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,090
Feels like I'm in a movie today.

307
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,660
Way too intense.

308
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,370
My head's still spinning.

309
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,090
Keep acting as Joseph Lee.

310
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,290
We need to shake them off.

311
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,050
No tricks.

312
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,530
Or neither of us will leave alive.

313
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,370
Mr. Lee.

314
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,330
Mr. Takeda?

315
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,020
Where are you headed?

316
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,660
Mr. Takeda, why are you here?

317
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,460
I just said earlier

318
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,330
Kondo needs to apologize to you.

319
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,050
Did you forget?

320
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,530
I'm sorry

321
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,420
for what happened in class earlier.

322
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,610
I acted out of line.

323
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,050
I'm really sorry for that.

324
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,700
Young people, you know.

325
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,460
It's understandable.

326
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,050
But keep this in mind,

327
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,740
if you don't get something,

328
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,090
keep it to yourself.

329
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,050
That way,

330
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,130
no one will think less of you.

331
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,290
Are you heading out?

332
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,290
What is it?

333
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,460
Mr. Takeda,

334
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,460
do I have to report

335
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,090
my whereabouts to you now?

336
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,940
Mr. Lee,

337
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,500
I'm just concerned

338
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,500
it might be hard for you to get around.

339
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,980
Where are you going?

340
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,260
Let me arrange a ride for you.

341
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,180
No need.

342
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,530
We have our own car.

343
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,610
Hold on a sec.

344
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,660
Let me help with your bags.

345
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,610
Why are you all standing there?

346
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,370
Help Mr. Lee with his luggage.

347
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,090
Got it.

348
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,050
Charlie.

349
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,610
We shouldn't let others carry our bags.

350
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,370
Don't you know your place?

351
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,290
Can't you use your own hands?

352
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,850
Sorry, Mr. Takeda.

353
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,770
Sorry for the awkward moment.

354
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,940
My assistant just got back from the UK.

355
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,850
He might still be jet-lagged.

356
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,810
So his mind

357
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,370
might be a bit fuzzy.

358
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,100
Sorry, sir.

359
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,610
Hello.

360
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,370
I'm Charlie.

361
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,610
Nice to meet you.

362
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,130
Your Japanese is pretty good.

363
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,130
Impressive.

364
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,650
Don't just stand there.

365
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,130
We're in a hurry.

366
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,580
Mr. Lee.

367
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,380
Mr. Lee!

368
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,620
Hey man, slow down.

369
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,100
Joseph Lee can't see a thing.

370
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,100
Did you forget?

371
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,890
Sorry.

372
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,570
Blue car on your right.

373
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,100
Bro,

374
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,850
that's as far as I can go.

375
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:25,940
Already a big help.

376
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,940
Hand me the antidote.

377
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,620
Drop me off somewhere quiet later.

378
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,130
Just,

379
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:30,850
get yourself out.

380
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,380
I can handle it.

00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,820
you...

572
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,980
for the rest

573
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,250
of your life.

574
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,340
Mr. Takeda,

575
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,940
this way.

576
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:25,560
[Chaosheng Theatre]

577
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,690
[Wu, Manager, Chaosheng Troupe]
Ms. Xian.

578
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,860
Ding Yi.

579
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,860
Ding Yi, what the hell are you doing?

580
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,380
Ms. Xian, they're...

581
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,980
Ms. Xian.

582
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,690
A group showed up outside.

583
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,170
I think they're the Japanese.

584
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,020
They've already come into the theatre.

585
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,500
How's it looking at the front?

586
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,380
The first scene is nearly done.

587
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,500
What about them?

588
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:05,860
This...

589
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,900
I don't know who you are,

590
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,820
but I won't let

591
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,980
a few uninvited guests like you

592
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,340
mess up the Chaosheng Troupe.

593
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,020
Hurry up.

594
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:49,690
Next scene.

595
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:50,940
Come on.

596
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,380
Hurry up.

597
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,820
Stay busy but don't panic.

598
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:57,860
Watch yourselves.

599
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,020
Hi,

600
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,780
this is backstage.

601
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,900
You can't come in.

602
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,730
What are you doing here?

603
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,690
I told you already, no entry.

604
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,940
Ms. Xian Biyun.

605
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,420
I'm Takeda.

606
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,090
I work for the Empire of Japan.

607
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,980
I just arrived in Shanghai.

608
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,340
I've already heard your name, Ms. Xian.

609
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,610
Mr. Takeda.

610
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,060
You're in the wrong place.

611
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,420
If you want to watch,
go to the audience.

612
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,060
Your presence here

613
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,210
disrupts our work.

614
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,690
Why do you think I'm here for a show?

615
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,130
I'm actually looking for someone.

616
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,610
Looking for someone?

617
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,420
I just spoke to Director William

618
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,420
from the Municipal Council.

619
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,540
This is the Public Concession.

620
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,770
He knows a lot of people here.

621
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,020
Want me to ask him for you?

622
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,380
It's alright.

623
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,820
Before Director William arrives,

624
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,170
I'll find who I wanted.

625
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,610
Slow down.

626
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,420
Be careful.

627
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,290
Come on, make some space.

628
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,820
Watch out, Mr. Takeda.

629
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,380
Careful.

630
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,130
Mr. Takeda.

631
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,540
The show's about to start.

632
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,610
Let's go.

633
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,210
Ms. Xian, aren't you on stage tonight?

634
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,210
I need to stay with you.

635
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,250
Please, this way.

636
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,170
Kondo, check over here.

637
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:30,770
Alright.

638
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,940
We'll look over there.

639
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,380
Yes.

640
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,250
Sir, the show's in the front.

641
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,940
Move aside!

642
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,060
Where are we even going?

643
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,570
We're on the stage.

644
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,250
Nothing here.

645
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,690
Let's check over there.

646
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,250
Alright.

647
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,210
Hold on tight.

648
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,420
Take it slow.

649
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,020
Be careful.

650
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,420
Mr. Takeda.

651
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,610
This way, please.

652
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,570
