00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,920
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,380
Dr. Miyamoto.

4
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,540
This is the patient's
previous medical record.

5
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,660
I've never seen

6
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,460
a patient with
such high intraocular pressure.

7
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,020
If it were just a tumor problem,

8
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,460
it wouldn't be this severe.

9
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,380
Mr. Lee.

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,260
Could you please tell us

11
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,500
about your previous symptoms?

12
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,380
Start from the very beginning.

13
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,100
No need for that.

14
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,500
If my eyes cannot be cured,

15
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,820
just tell me directly.

16
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,260
No.

17
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,540
Your condition is very special.

18
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,980
It's very helpful to me.

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,500
No, that's not it.

20
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,980
Mr. Lee.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,500
Because your case is very special,

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,660
this must be explained.

23
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,660
It will be of great help
to Dr. Miyamoto.

24
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,780
Please.

25
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,730
It was from that day on

26
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,820
that I went completely blind.

27
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,660
But after that,

28
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,500
I still worked day and night.

29
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,980
It's obvious Mr. Lee is very exhausted.

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,500
No.

31
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,780
I'm not tired.

32
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,380
I still have to design

33
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,500
the most advanced code
for the Empire of Japan.

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,940
Dr. Miyamoto, what's the result?

35
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,820
Mr. Lee's intraocular pressure is
already so high.

36
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,060
It indicates
his pituitary tumor is very severe.

37
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,060
The intracranial pressure
is also very high.

38
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,940
It should be treated
by a specialist neurologist.

39
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,220
Even I can do nothing.

40
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,140
But

41
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,660
under such heavy work pressure,

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,900
the fact that he lasted until now

43
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,020
is already a miracle.

44
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,540
He's the most determined person
I've ever seen.

45
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,660
But...

46
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,780
If you still want him to work
for the Imperial Army,

47
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,140
don't agitate him too much.

48
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,660
Let him be in good spirits,

49
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,660
so he can work a few more days for you.

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,020
Thank you, Dr. Miyamoto.

51
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,780
After taking such a high dosage,

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,540
how did he stay conscious
the whole time?

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,140
Gu Yangshan, get him onto the bed.

54
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,220
Hold him down, Gu Yangshan.

55
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,020
Okay.

56
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,580
Ms. Xian.

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,900
Remove the thumbtack,
and clean the wound.

58
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,100
Okay.

59
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,700
I'm going to insert the gastric tube.

60
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,780
Hold him.

61
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,780
Bear with it.

62
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,900
Bear with it.

63
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,580
Hang in there.

64
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,220
There's gastric juice.

65
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,700
Prepare 20 milliliters of air.

66
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,340
Inject, quickly.

67
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,100
How is it?

68
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,340
Sound of air and water.
It's in the stomach.

69
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,340
Hang in there.

70
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,140
Okay.

71
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,580
Okay.

72
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,220
Now.

73
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,580
Until the water runs clear.

74
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,900
We'll need to do this a few more times.

75
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,700
Press.

76
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,220
Hang in there.

77
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,580
Hold on.

78
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,340
Quick.

79
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,220
The water is clear, do it once more.

80
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,340
Endure it. It's the last time.

81
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,700
Hold on, Ding Yi.

82
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,900
Gu Yangshan.

83
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,460
Gu Yangshan.

84
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,700
Gu Yangshan.

85
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,580
What's wrong?

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,460
I can't see.

87
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,340
Why can't I see anything?

88
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,100
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,900
One pair of eyes
in exchange for two lives.

90
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,900
It's worth it.

91
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,900
As long as

92
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,340
you are by my side to take care of me,

93
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,700
that's enough.

94
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,900
Ding Yi.

95
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,460
Even if I lose everything,

96
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,100
I'll definitely find a way
to cure your eyes.

97
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,220
What if they can't be cured?

98
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,900
If they really can't be cured,

99
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,340
then I'll always stand
on your right side

100
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,020
and be your eyes.

101
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,260
Oh my, that's too cheesy.

102
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,260
No.

103
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,020
Just looking at your eyes makes me sick.

104
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,140
Too cheesy.

105
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,140
Give me some water, I'm a bit thirsty.

106
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,500
Bro.

107
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,260
You've suffered.

108
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,260
Thanks.

109
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,650
What are you thanking me for?

110
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,620
I took the medicine myself.
No one forced me.

111
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,980
Hurry, give me some water.

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,140
Here.

113
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,650
Slow down, slow down.

114
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,650
Slow down, slow down.

115
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,020
Where's Ms. Xian?

116
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,260
Ms. Xian stayed with you all night too.

117
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,220
After Meng Jie said you were fine,

118
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,740
Ms. Xian said she had something
and left first.

119
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,020
Look.

120
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,500
This.

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,500
Ms. Xian said she found it for you
at the dock.

122
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,340
She fixed it for you.

123
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,860
Being able to see the world again

124
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,380
feels wonderful.

125
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,720
[Two months later]

126
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,860
Ms. Xian.

127
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,020
What are you doing?

128
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,100
You've recovered well.

129
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,140
The doctor said
you can be discharged tomorrow.

130
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,530
After being discharged,

131
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,620
go to the Metropolitan Hotel first.

132
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,220
Wu will meet you there.

133
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,170
He has a ticket for a ship
to China Hong Kong.

134
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,740
You should go first.

135
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,020
About your mother,

136
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,100
I'll go negotiate with Gu Yangshan.

137
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,140
If things go smoothly,

138
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,860
you and your mother

139
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,620
will soon be able to
meet in China Hong Kong.

140
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,220
I know what you're thinking.

141
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,980
The Japanese military leadership
has already dismissed Takeda.

142
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,170
Tomorrow,

143
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,260
he will board a ship back to his country

144
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,740
to face a military investigation.

145
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,860
If he cannot explain clearly

146
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,380
that intelligence leak,

147
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,260
he will be executed.

148
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,860
What are you thinking?

149
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,140
Nothing.

150
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,380
I was just thinking

151
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,860
once I leave,

152
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,020
will I ever

153
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,620
see you again?

154
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,980
As long as we walk the same path,

155
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,860
we will definitely meet again.

156
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,620
You're back.

157
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,460
Ms. Xian.

158
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,620
Ding Yi.

159
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,340
I bought the Lao Da Chang you wanted.

160
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,140
Ding Yi.

161
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,620
Ding Yi.

162
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,500
Where is he?

163
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,620
Mr. Lee,

164
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,410
I was surprised

165
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,740
to get your call.

166
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:17,860
Whisky.

167
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,620
A farewell drink for you.

168
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,140
Why are you alone?

169
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,460
Where's Charlie?

170
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,860
It's such good liquor.

171
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,380
Letting him have a sip

172
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,620
feels like a waste.

173
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,500
That's perfect then.

174
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,860
Come in.

175
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,740
Careful.

176
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,340
It's fine.

177
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,860
This way, go inside.

178
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,260
The painting you just touched

179
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,500
was specially brought by me from Osaka.

180
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,140
This way, this way.

181
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,740
Please sit.

182
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,860
If you could see,

183
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,500
you'd know

184
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,460
it depicts the scenery of
the Seto Inland Sea.

185
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,740
My home is right by that sea.

186
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,340
Open the door
and you can smell the sea breeze.

187
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,740
I was just thinking,

188
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,740
after I return,

189
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,410
I want to buy a deck chair

190
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,930
to lie by the seaside
at sunset every day

191
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,930
and grow old in leisure.

192
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,860
I truly admire your courage.

193
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,020
After going to war

194
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,340
and killing so many people,

195
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,860
you can still enjoy the sea breeze.

196
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,740
It's just a job.

197
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,810
Mr. Lee,

198
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,260
you came to see me today,

199
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,050
is it really just to say farewell?

200
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,500
It's only the two of us here.

201
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,740
Be honest.

202
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,290
We Chinese have a rule.

203
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,260
After three rounds of drinks,

204
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,770
you can speak the truth.

205
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,980
Indeed.

206
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,500
One can only say

207
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,330
some words

208
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,460
after drinking alcohol.

209
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,900
Tastes good.

210
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,220
One drink, one question.

211
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,530
You ask first.

212
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,940
Alright.

213
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,700
Did you leak

214
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,530
the code to the British?

215
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,290
No.

216
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,530
Then was it Charlie or Xian Biyun?

217
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,180
That's already the second question.

218
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,530
Neither.

219
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,530
Then how was it leaked?

220
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,020
Actually, the Joseph Lee Code

221
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,740
was never leaked at all.

222
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,460
What really happened?

223
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,290
The Joseph Lee Code

224
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,050
is the most advanced code in the world.

225
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,050
Because the BIS couldn't break it,

226
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,220
we deliberately set a trap for you

227
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,660
to make you
voluntarily replace this code.

228
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,900
We thought that would end the matter,

229
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,770
but unexpectedly you kept pressing me.

230
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,220
I was almost forced into
a corner by you.

231
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,050
Fortunately, I discovered

232
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,770
your private connections with the Navy.

233
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,220
Mr. Takeda has already gone
to deal with it.

234
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,770
The Navy's also intervened
in the investigation.

235
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,500
I believe there will be results soon.

236
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,460
Mr. Takeda has already gone
to deal with it,

237
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,420
and the Navy too.

238
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,050
Coincidentally,

239
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,530
Sasaki knew nothing about it.

240
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,460
So we deliberately made you think

241
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,700
I was going to escape
on a British merchant ship,

242
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,420
forcing you to rely on the Navy.

243
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,220
This way,

244
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,020
Sasaki confirmed

245
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,530
your collusion with the Navy.

246
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,500
Very good.

247
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,530
I like this wine very much,

248
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,220
but I like what you just said even more.

249
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,260
I will pass on those words

250
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,050
to the military leadership.

251
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,770
I believe very soon,

252
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:21,770
they will launch
an investigation into you.

253
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,770
Unfortunately,
you won't have the chance.

254
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,770
What?

255
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,020
Impossible.

256
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,530
You drank this wine too, didn't you?

257
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,770
Thanks to you,

258
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,260
I just learned

259
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,850
that a large dose of chlorpheniramine

260
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,770
makes people feel drowsy and weak,

261
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,290
even causing death.

262
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,700
But I only had one glass.

263
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,770
You asked too many questions,

264
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,290
so you must have drunk quite a lot.

265
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,020
You've already completely defeated me.

266
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,770
Why do you still want to kill me?

267
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,220
Because I never intended to defeat you.

268
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,900
I only wanted to kill you!

269
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,290
You think drugging me

270
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,180
means you can kill me?

271
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,770
This is for Hongyu.

272
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,770
You killed so many people in China,

273
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,420
and still wanted to go home

274
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,770
to bask in the sun
and feel the sea breeze?

275
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,020
Let me tell you,

276
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,740
the Chinese people

277
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,900
can never be exterminated!

278
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,220
This is for Gu!

279
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,290
Tonight you'll
obediently board the ship,

280
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,050
or I'll throw you onto it.

281
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,050
Gu Yangshan is here.

282
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,940
Take him back.

283
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,130
I still have things to handle.

284
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,810
Rickshaw.

285
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,940
I killed Takeda.

286
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:36,940
I know.

287
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,700
I've been trained in graphology.

288
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,810
I imitated Takeda's handwriting

289
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,700
and left a suicide note at the scene.

290
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,220
Then I pulled the plug
from outside with fishing line

291
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,260
and slowly drew it into the keyhole

292
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,170
to fake a locked-room
with no outside entry.

293
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,940
What did Ms. Xian give me?

294
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,260
I don't know.

295
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,330
When I was talking to Takeda,

296
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,500
I saw he kept

297
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,260
staring at that box,

298
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,650
so I felt there must be
something wrong inside.

299
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,940
So I took it out.

300
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,810
No wonder Takeda agreed to
meet you so easily.

301
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,610
He wanted to use this recorder

302
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,810
to record every word you said

303
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,260
as proof to clear his name.

304
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,370
But he never expected
a blind man like you

305
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,810
would kill him instead.

306
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,410
Ding Yi.

307
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,650
Actually today,

308
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,700
you should've discussed it with us.

309
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,810
Uncle Gu died at their hands.

310
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,700
My hatred for him

311
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,540
is no less than yours.

312
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,810
Maybe I had a better plan,

313
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,330
so you wouldn't have had to
risk it alone.

314
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,410
Ding Yi.

315
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,410
On behalf of Uncle Gu,

316
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,260
I thank you.

317
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,890
Actually the one
who should say thank you is me.

318
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,890
If you hadn't deceived me back then,

319
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,610
I might never have experienced
all this in my life,

320
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,700
nor would I have seen

321
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,890
this real and cruel world.

322
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,410
The blood on me

323
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,410
will never be wiped clean, will it?

324
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,090
I'm sorry.

325
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:09,980
It's over.

326
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,980
It's all over.

327
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,940
Colonel.

328
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,220
Preliminary estimation of time of death

329
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,570
was between 3 and 5 PM yesterday.

330
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,220
The abdominal wound runs left to right,

331
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,570
a straight cut,

332
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,650
matching the samurai sword at the scene.

333
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,650
Therefore,

334
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,130
all evidence at the scene indicates

335
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,650
Takeda likely committed seppuku.

336
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,610
This is Takeda's suicide note.

337
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,940
Our brothers all serve in the army.

338
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,220
I cannot be the disgrace of the family.

339
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,610
In that case,

340
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,020
report it to the military leadership

341
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,410
that Takeda leaked the Joseph Lee Code,

342
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,060
attempting to escape
a military tribunal verdict.

343
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,610
He has committed suicide out of guilt.

344
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,060
Yes.

345
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,800
[Letter of Appointment]

346
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,890
Deputy Director of
the Cryptography Institute.

347
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,610
Right.

348
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,890
My visit this time

349
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,410
is to convey an invitation to Mr. Lee

350
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,740
on behalf of the General Staff.

351
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,850
The military leadership has instructed

352
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,500
to build a perfect intelligence system

353
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,850
to support
Chairman Wang's new government

354
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,780
and to widely promote
Sino-Japanese friendship.

355
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,300
A Cryptography Institute
has been established,

356
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,850
reporting directly to the new gov's
Special Agent Headquarters.

357
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,890
Mr. Lee,

358
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,980
you are

359
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,860
the most outstanding

360
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,610
cryptography expert in Shanghai,

361
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,500
so the work of the Institute

362
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,210
will rely greatly on you.

363
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,650
I believe,

364
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,860
I haven't accepted

365
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,980
this offer yet, have I?

366
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,460
As for the specific terms,

367
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,500
Director Liang will discuss them
with you in detail

368
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,500
when he picks you up
from the hospital later.

369
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,500
Mr. Lee,

370
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,500
please remember the great expectations
Grand Duke Tonoji placed on you.

371
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,980
Excuse me, I shall take my leave.

372
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,420
Director Liang?

373
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,770
What should we do now?

374
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,980
We have no idea what's inside

375
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,980
this Cryptography Institute.

376
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,340
You must leave.

377
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,570
We can't take tonight's ship.

378
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,420
I'll find tickets for the next one.

379
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,770
Pack up and leave quickly.

380
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,900
You are?

381
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,170
I am Liang Jingyuan,

382
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,900
entrusted by Colonel Sasaki

383
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,290
to escort Mr. Lee upon discharge.

384
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,290
Mr. Lee, my apologies.

385
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,420
Something just came up and delayed me.

386
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,770
I hope you understand.

387
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,240
[Two hours earlier]

388
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,020
I carried out an official duty

389
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,730
and took down a flour mill.

390
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,900
Mr. Lee's injury this time

391
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,770
was entirely Takeda's fault.

392
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,900
But please rest assured.

393
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,730
With me around from now on,

394
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,900
you will never be put in danger again.

395
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,980
Then I'll be counting on you,
Director Liang.

396
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,820
You're too kind.

397
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,060
But actually,

398
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,770
I should be thanking you, Mr. Lee.

399
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,690
If not for your report of
Takeda's collusion with the Navy,

400
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,690
I wouldn't have risen so quickly.

401
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,940
I truly didn't expect

402
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,020
with such a frail body,

403
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,730
you could kill without a trace.

404
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,610
I truly admire you.

405
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,090
You flatter me, Director Liang.

406
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,860
I really didn't expect

407
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,860
that after my deadly struggle
with Takeda,

408
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,170
in the end,

409
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,540
you would be the one to benefit.

410
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,380
Benefit?

411
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,420
I didn't expect that after living abroad

412
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,540
for so many years,

413
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,940
you would even know the jargon
of the antiques world.

414
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,820
Are you from the North?

415
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,460
Director Liang,

416
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,940
Mr. Lee's wet nurse was from the north,

417
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,060
so Mr. Lee learned Chinese

418
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,420
from his nurse.

419
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,570
Did you

420
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,420
notice his northern accent?

421
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,460
Not really.

422
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,980
I know you, Charlie.

423
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,940
Charlie Gu.

424
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,460
You truly have a keen eye.

425
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,380
Even Mr. Takeda

426
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,420
never noticed such details before.

427
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,380
That's why he's out, and I'm here.

428
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,380
Mr. Lee, please get in the car.

429

[Shanghai Army No. 2 Hospital]

430
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,020
Comrade Xiao, what happened?

431
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,610
In order to support
Wang Jingwei's puppet government,

432
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,060
the Japanese have gathered
many cryptography experts

433
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,060
to establish
a new Cryptography Institute.

434
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,820
We have a comrade undercover
in Manchukuo,

435
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,730
codenamed Bai Ye,

436
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,460
who received a secret order
from the Central Committee

437
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,980
and has infiltrated this institute

438
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,900
to carry out a plan of deception.

439
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,570
But we've just received news

440
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,940
that due to a traitor's betrayal,

441
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,860
an underground contact line
in the northeast

442
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,250
was dismantled by
the Manchukuo police last month.

443
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,500
His contact, Hei,
was exposed and killed.

444
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,460
Now the Organization
has lost contact with him.

445
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,610
Our situation is very passive.

446
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,250
Do we know his identity?

447
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,860
How can we restore contact?

448
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,500
He has worked for us
since the CSOD period,

449
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,940
and made outstanding achievements.

450
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,940
To protect him,

451
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,860
the Organization always
maintained one-line contact with him.

452
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,210
Apart from Hei, no one

453
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,500
knows his identity.

454
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,770
We have no photos, no files,

455
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,900
only a codename,

00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,900
Bai Ye.

457
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,420
What does the Organization
want me to do?

458
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,460
The director of Cryptography Institute
is Liang Jingyuan.

459
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,770
You have a good relationship
with his wife, Ye Yin.

460
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,380
After research,

461
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,980
the Organization believes your identity

462
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,940
is best suited to get close to them.

463
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,980
You must find out
the identities of the people

464
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,380
inside this Cryptography Institute,

465
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,020
and locate Comrade Bai Ye
as soon as possible.

466
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:30,610
Okay.

467
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,060
Once there's any progress,

468
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,900
I will report to
the Organization immediately.

Mr. Lee.

471
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,860
Mr. Lee, I've arranged guards
inside and outside

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,420
the entire hotel
to keep you safe.

473
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,900
I've also stationed two at the entrance.

474
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,090
They're skilled fighters.
Please rest assured.

475
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,420
It seems with Director Liang here,

476
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,770
I'll be quite safe from now on.

477
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,290
Well, how should I put it?

478
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,500
After all, this concession
is not really our place.

479
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,420
Once I've sorted out my place tomorrow,

480
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,940
we won't need such trouble.

481
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,940
Director Liang,

482
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,500
what do you mean?

483
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,610
Mr. Lee's injury this time

484
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,570
has really worried the Colonel.

485
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,980
So he thought

486
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,420
before the Cryptography
Institute is established,

487
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,940
we'd gather the cryptography experts
close to the new government

488
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,290
and protect them together.

489
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,500
I've found a place in Sanyangli.

490
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,420
Once it's ready tomorrow,
I'll come pick you up.

491

That won't be necessary.

492
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,770
I've already gotten used to living here.

493
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,290
