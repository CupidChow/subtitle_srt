[Episode 15]

3
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,770
No need.

4
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,130
I'm already quite used to living here.

5
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,690
And just like you said,

6
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,690
it's all your people out there.

7
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,570
I told you,

8
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,850
it's safer at my place.

9
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,020
Besides,

10
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,690
as the deputy director
of the Cryptography Institute,

11
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,410
you should set an example for others.

12
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,490
Am I right?

13
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,060
You're thoughtful, Director Liang.

14
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,290
Then I'll trouble you with this.

15
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,010
Tomorrow at noon,

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,890
we'll be waiting on time.

17
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,690
I'll take my leave.

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,980
Gu Yangshan.

19
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,130
Who is Liang Jingyuan

20
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,130
exactly?

21
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,410
He used to work at the Suzhou Bureau,

22
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,820
but he often has contact
with the Shanghai Bureau.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,410
I suspect he must have defected.

24
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,820
Looks like the Shanghai Bureau
has all gone rogue.

25
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,290
Fortunately, he hasn't seen me before.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,570
Gu Yangshan.

27
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,220
Now your Shanghai Bureau

28
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,820
has been taken down.

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,850
Doesn't that mean
you're the only one left?

30
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,980
What do you plan to do?

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,540
I still think I should find a way

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,100
to get you out as soon as possible.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,980
I'll go check the back.

34
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,380
No one's here. Hurry.

35
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,170
I'm not going.

36
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,130
What did you say?

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,820
I said I'm not going.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,690
This is our land, our home.

39
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,690
Why should we

40
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,380
be chased everywhere by the Japanese?

41
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,610
Back then I fled
from the Northeast to Baimahu,

42
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,610
then from Baimahu to Shanghai.

43
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,730
Haven't I run far enough?

44
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,500
And what happened?

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,730
Now the streets
are still full of Japanese.

46
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,610
I don't agree!

47
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,060
Aren't you being unreasonable?

48
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,610
Acting on impulse like this,

49
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,610
do you have a death wish?

50
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,500
I'm not being unreasonable.

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,890
Everything I said is from the heart.

52
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,380
And you've also said before

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,820
that if everyone runs away,

54
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,780
then we won't be far
from losing our country.

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,500
Now you're the only one left
in the Shanghai Bureau.

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,610
Without me,

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,340
it's simply impossible

58
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,540
to complete the Sword Thrust Operation.

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,380
If I run now,

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,610
wouldn't all the effort
you've put into me

61
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,780
be wasted?

62
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,780
Joseph Lee's code
has already been replaced.

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,290
And you personally killed Takeda.

64
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,410
You've already done enough.

65
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,540
I'm very grateful to you.

66
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,730
Neither of us knows

67
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,980
what exactly is happening

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,490
inside the Cryptography Institute.

69
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,290
Now Liang Jingyuan is not only
making you deputy director,

70
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,100
he's also moving you into Sanyangli.

71
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,100
Do you know what that means?

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,980
It means every day
you'll be dealing with cipher experts

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,850
and codebreaking specialists.

74
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,730
You're not a soldier, nor an agent.

75
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,100
But Liang Jingyuan is different.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,980
He is extremely suspicious.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,980
If he could notice
your accent was off today,

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,850
tomorrow he would definitely
find more issues

79
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,730
on Joseph Lee that shouldn't exist.

80
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,980
Once there's any slip-up,

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,730
there's no way we could salvage it.

82
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,980
You know how quick I can learn.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,980
And my performance before wasn't bad.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,100
You can teach me
whatever I don't understand.

85
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,290
I won't. You must leave today.

86
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,850
The day Uncle Gu sacrificed himself,

87
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,660
it wasn't just you who felt sorrow.

88
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,410
I stayed alone,

89
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,730
thinking in my room all night.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,850
Lead by example.

91
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,540
These three words

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,170
are your family motto.

93
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,290
Uncle Gu, and even your younger sister

94
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,170
could give away their own lives

95
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,660
to defend these three words.

96
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,410
But shouldn't these three words

97
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,410
also be the responsibility

98
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,170
that we ordinary people

99
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,980

In my heart,

103
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,490
you're a friend
I can trust with my life.

104
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,850
Actually, I have only one goal for you.

105
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,730
It's to keep you safe.

106
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,410
But after all you just said,

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,730
I understand too

108
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,930
that you're no longer
what you used to be.

109
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,850
But if you stay,

110
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,730
we will be facing

111
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,410
unprecedented difficulties.

112
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,050
Have you really thought this through?

113
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,580
Do you really want to do this?

114
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,170
I'm an actor.

115
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,490
This is my most desired role.

116
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,980
As long as you can help set my stage,

117
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,900
I'll definitely be able
to play this part well.

118
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,660
Alright.

119
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,140

Are you okay?

154
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,820
It's fine, go ahead.

Wang Jingwei's men

156

157
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,060
Cao Yuanzhong and some others
have been safely evacuated.

158
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,890
But all the brothers
on the perimeter died.

159
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,570
It was Liang Jingyuan who blew up
the Shanghai Bureau.

160
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,500
We already met him
at the hospital just now.

161
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,690
He once served in the Suzhou Bureau.

162
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,570
But he's always been in contact
with the Shanghai Bureau.

163
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,410
I had long sent a report
to the superiors.

164
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,690
Between local bureaus,

165
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,930
strict confidentiality
must be maintained.

166
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,930
They didn't listen.

167
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,220
Just when our work was seeing progress,

168
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,770
the Shanghai Bureau was wiped out.

169
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,500
Luo Han, calm down first.

170
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,020
We should've long stopped

171
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,140
having any hope in the BIS.

172
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,260
Why are you saying
such taboo words again?

173
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,410
If you break away from the BIS,
your family will be finished.

174
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,340
Besides, revolutions always
have a mix of good and bad.

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,570
The BIS isn't as bad as you think.

176
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,890
Alright, enough of that.

177
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,770
Tonight, you must leave Shanghai.

178
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,500
They're waiting for you
to report work in Chongqing.

179
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,530
But you must bring back the information

180
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,860
about Liang Jingyuan establishing
the Cryptography Institute.

181
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,140
Since we can't break away,

182
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,050
I will try to find Cao Yuanzhong
as soon as possible

183
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,810
to restore the Shanghai Bureau
and communications with Chongqing.

184
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,770
It's not good.

185
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,690
We are not sure how much influence

186
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,770
Liang has infiltrated Shanghai Bureau.

187
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,410
You can't just contact people
in the bureau rashly.

188
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,930
How about this,

189
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,050
they're unfamiliar with me.

190
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,650
I can act as your liaison

191
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,050
and help you continue with
the Sword Thrust Operation.

192
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,860
Luo Han.

193
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,860
The Sword Thrust Operation
is not your mission.

194
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,500
No matter what,
you shouldn't be left behind

195
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,140
to carry out the plan in the hide.

196
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,650
Gu Yangshan,

197
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,050
the person I respected most before

198
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,290
was my senior brother.

199
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,170
After coming to Shanghai,

200
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,170
you are the comrade I admire the most.

201
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,460
If you're carrying out the plan,

202
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,500
I'm willing to stay.

203
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,410
Besides, I said before,

204
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,690
if you and this little punk

205
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,410
could make Takeda willingly
replace Joseph Lee's code,

206
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,170
I would be at your disposal.

207
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,410
It's time for me to keep my word.

208
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,930
Can you cut it out?

209
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,890
You're the little punk.

210
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,170
Your whole family are little punks.

211
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,100
I'll tell you one last time.

212
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,690
I'm an actor.

213
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,930
In this operation, I'm the leading role.

214
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,570
I am the sword.

215
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,690
Ding Yi, don't be mad.

216
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,690
It's true that
I looked down on you before.

217
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,930
But I have to admit

218
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,290
that I underestimated you.

219
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,890
I'm willing to admit defeat.

220
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,170
From now on,

221
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,340
I'll work for you two tirelessly

222
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,290
without any complaint.

223
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,690
For the Party-State...

224
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,380
No.

225
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,290
For resisting Japan.

226
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,620
And for the common people.

227
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,570
Go on stage.

228
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,340
Dress up in costume.

229
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,380
From today on,

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,500
Luo Han will be our liaison.

231
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,260
Yuyin Pavilion has a mixed crowd.

232
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,220
It's the hardest to monitor.

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,530
We'll meet here from now on.

234
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,380
After we enter Sanyangli,

235
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,140
if Luo Han encounters an emergency,

236
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,260
dress up as a newsboy
delivering papers to Sanyangli.

237
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,770
If we see the message, we'll know

238
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,890
you want to contact us.

239
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,260
We will find a way to meet in time.

240
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,020
With lofty ambitions aiming
for the clouds,

241
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,140
the treasured sword at the waist
shining a rainbow's gleam.

242
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,140
The state of Yan is in peril.

243
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,140
The state of Qin seeks our destruction.

244
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,930
The rivers and mountains
are about to fall.

245
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,020
No warriors rise to sweep away the foe.

246
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,650
Thankfully there is Jing Ke

247
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,650
to try to turn the tide.

248
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,930
I admire the bravery

249
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,020
to break into the tiger's lair.

250
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,860
Entrusted with the fate of the state,
guided by loyalty and courage!

251
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,930
Mr. Lee, we've arrived.

252
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,890
Have them wait outside for me.

253
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:51,620
Alright.

254
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,020
Mr. Wu.

255
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,740
Mr. Lee.

256
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,020
There are guests upstairs.

257
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,410
I never noticed before.

258
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,260
Look, when placed side by side,

259
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,260
yours still looks more delicate.

260
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,890
Really?

261
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,890
It's yours.

262
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,290
I can't accept that.

263
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,930
We're such good friends.

264
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,650
Whatever mine is yours.

265
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:37,930
Don't move.

266
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,530
Biyun, I feel embarrassed

267
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,930
to accept gifts from you.

268
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,410
I should thank you.

269
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,500
You contributed to
Liang's smooth transfer

270
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,650
back to Shanghai.

271
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,020
By the way, what official post

272
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,770
did the Japanese promise him?

273
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,140
A director.

274
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,260
Director of what?

275
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,020
Director of the Cryptography Institute.

276
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,930
Cryptography Institute?

277
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,770
The Japanese

278
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,260
want to support Chairman Wang's
new government,

279
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,020
and establish a complete
intelligence system,

280
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,740
so they specifically set up
a Cryptography Institute

281
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,380
and named Liang as director.

282
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,890
The Japanese value Liang greatly.

283
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,500
Yin, congratulations.

284
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,020
I'll be relying on you in the future.

285
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,770
Sure.

286
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,020
From now on, we're family.

287
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,740
We'll make money together.

288
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,530
Ms. Xian, Mr. Lee has arrived.

289
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,930
Ms. Xian, I didn't disturb you, did I?

290
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,770
Mr. Lee.

291
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,740
Mr. Lee, I've long heard of your name.

292
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,020
Finally I meet you in person today.

293
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,260
I won't bother you, Biyun.

294
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,140
I'll treat you to tea next time.

295
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,740
Alright.

296
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,140
I'm going.

297
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,410
Charlie.

298
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,530
Help me see this lady off.

299
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:09,770
Alright.

300
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,940
Please.

301
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,980
Why are you here?

302
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,370
Why didn't you wait
for Wu to pick you up?

303
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,460
Ms. Xian.

304
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,700
I came to tell you

305
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,700
something very important.

306
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,700
What is it?

307
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,130
I'm not leaving. I've decided to stay.

308
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,980
Mr. Gu.

309
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,220
Would you like some tea?

310
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,180
No need to trouble.

311
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,700
Just now when I came upstairs,

312
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,740
I happened to overhear you

313
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,260
discussing the Cryptography Institute.

314
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,500
Sasaki wants me to join
the Cryptography Institute

315
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,700
as deputy director.

316
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,330
And I agreed.

317
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,610
So I think

318
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,850
I should be able to help you.

319
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,500
I don't need to tell you

320
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,180
how dangerous it'll be for you to stay.

321
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:02,940
Ms. Xian.

322
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,980
I haven't been back for a long time.

323
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,180
When I passed by backstage earlier,

324
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,740
and saw the state of the troupe now,

325
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,500
it made me feel even more

326
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,740
that my dream should come to an end.

327
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,500
Now the enemy
has already entered our home.

328
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,500
None of us can escape.

329
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,700
If I don't charge forward,

330
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,660
someone else will do it in my place.

331
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,660
Before, it was Uncle Gu and Hongyu.

332
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,500
Then who will it be next?

333
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,180
Gu Yangshan? Or you?

334
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,980
Ms. Xian.

335
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,460
I don't want to hide
behind you all forever.

336
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,500
In the book of the destiny,

337
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,220
we together between a row of characters.

338
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,700
I've memorized this line
countless times.

339
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,900
I never thought that today,

340
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,420
I would truly understand its meaning.

341
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,940
So Ms. Xian,

342
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,740
it's precisely for this reason

343
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,850
that I should stay.

344
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,660
I don't want you to always protect me.

345
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,220
I want to protect you too.

346
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,220
And even,

347
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,330
help you solve your troubles.

348
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,330
What trouble could I possibly have?

349
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,700
That bracelet of yours.

350
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,020
Before, during rehearsals,

351
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,740
you'd ache over it for days

352
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,330
if it got slightly bumped.

353
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,500
But today you gave it to that woman

354
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,460
so generously.

355
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,900
You must have had something
to ask her to do.

356
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,700
But now it's fine.

357
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,700
I'm now the deputy director
of the Cryptography Institute.

358
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,500
You'll never have to beg others again.

359
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,980
You have me.

360
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,700
Ms. Xian.

361
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,740
Tomorrow, after I enter Sanyangli,

362
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,500
it's very likely I'll lose my freedom

363
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,460
and be unable to contact you.

364
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,130
If you have something urgent

365
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,980
that needs my help,

366
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,180
I've thought of a way.

367
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,500
There's a step.

368
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,570
What were you talking about?

369
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,420
Ms. Xian said I should
listen to you carefully.

370
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,900
She said something like that?

371

Let's go.

372
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,810

Director Lee, hello.

376
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,660
I've been waiting here for a long time.

377
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,900
Mr. Lee, take care.

378
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,740
Didn't expect we'd meet again so soon.

379
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,500
Mr. Lee, I'll go get the luggage.

380
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,420
This lady's voice

381
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,420
sounds somewhat familiar.

382
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,740
My apologies.

383
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,570
I forgot you can't see.

Last night,

385
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,780
we met at Biyun's Chaosheng Troupe.

386
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,740
Remember?

387
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,940
I remember now.

388
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,940
You're Ms. Xian's friend.

389
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,460
The moment I mentioned Biyun,

390
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,460
you remembered, Director Lee.

391
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,780
It's Deputy Director Lee.

392
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,220
May I ask how to address you?

393
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,260
My name is Ye Yin.

00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,330
I'm the head of

Biyun and I

397
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,850
are even closer than sisters.

398
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,540
How about this?

399
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,650
I'll just call you Mr. Lee, alright?

400
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,220
That way it feels closer.

401
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,780
Mrs. Liang can call me
whatever you wish.

402
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,780
Mr. Lee, the luggage is ready.

403
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,020
Then let's not stand here.

404
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,850
I'll take you inside, come on.

405
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,260
This way, please.

406
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,370
Mr. Lee.

407
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,980
The place you'll stay in
was specially chosen by me.

408
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,540
These two swindlers

409
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,260
really know how to survive.

410
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,700
Come in and have a look.

411
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,850
Mr. Lee, there's a step ahead.

412
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,780
Step down.

413
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,020
Mr. Lee, the door's here.

414
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,700
Mr. Lee, step.

415
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,460
Sorry, Mr. Lee.

416
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,610
Time was too tight.

417
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,540
I haven't prepared enough.

418
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,540
If there's anything you're
not satisfied with, just tell me.

419
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,700
Mrs. Liang, thank you.

420
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,370
In wartime, everything
should be kept simple.

421
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,260
That's understandable.

422
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,540
Anyway, stay here for now.

423
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,540

How far have you and our Biyun gone?

430
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,020
I don't know how Ms. Xian put it.

431
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,020
She's a woman.

432
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,330
How could she say anything?

433
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,890
So I came to ask you.

434
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,460
Things stand between Ms. Xian and me

435
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,460
entirely depends on her own attitude.

436
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,650
Otherwise, Mrs. Liang,

437
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,740
could you ask her for me?

438
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,540
Don't worry.

and the others arriving.

00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,090
I'll punish myself with a drink, okay?

561
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,210
Alright.

562
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,650
In that case,

563
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,060
this glass of wine

564
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,380
will serve as a welcome to everyone.

565
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,210
I hope your work
at the Cryptography Institute

566
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,730
will go smoothly
and achieve great success.

567
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,020
Thank you, Director Liang.

568
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,650
Cheers.

569
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,730
Thank you, Director Liang.

570
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,570
Thank you, Director Liang.

571
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,210
Cheers.

572
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,380
Cheers.

573
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,460
Sit.

574
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,340
Let me say a few more words.

575
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,730
For an institute,

576
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,130
the most important thing is orderliness.

577
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:16,650
Having Director Lee

578
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,650
joining our institute,

579
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,290
it truly brings glory to us.

580
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,730
Director Lee, how about this,

581
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,210
let me introduce to you

582
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,170
a few of the core members
of our institute.

583
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,340
This here is Yi Xiuyuan,

584
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,500
Mr. Yi.

585
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,770
Mr. Yi

586
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,860
is one of the founding members

587
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,690
of Huangpu's cryptography course.

588
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,940
He has trained countless students.

589
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,210
He's indispensable

590
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,380
to China's cryptography field,

591
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,210
and also the treasure of our institute.

592
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,570
This one

593
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,690
is Shen Wanqing, Mr. Shen.

594
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,540
Hello, Director Lee.

595
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,210
This one needs no introduction.

596
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,860
I talked to him earlier.

597
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,730
Perhaps you haven't got
to know him well.

598
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,860
Mr. Shen

599
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,340
is a famous cryptography expert
from South Manchuria Railways Co.

600
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,540
This time, as a gesture of support

601
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,940
for our new government's

602
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,770
intelligence department,

603
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,570
Japan's military leadership
specially transferred Mr. Shen here.

604
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,210
Director Liang, you flatter me.

605
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,340
In mathematics,

606
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,290
I can't even scratch the surface

607
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,770
of Director Lee or Mr. Yi's level.

608
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,540
You're too modest.

609
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,860
And those two.

610
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,210
Come here, young ones.

611
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,770
Li Yu and Li Huan.

612
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,340
They are Mr. Shen's students.

613
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,770
And they're brother and sister.

614
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,340
Hello, Director Lee.

615
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,690
Dong Jinbo.

616
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,770
Liu Fangbai.

617
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,860
Wang Zukai.

618
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,210
They are all members of Mr. Shen's team.

619
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,250
Hello, Director Lee.

620
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:50,980
Teng Chong.

621
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,940
Ma Xiaochuan.

622
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,290
Hello, Director Lee.

623
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,290
Hello, Director Lee.

624
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,860
They are members of Mr. Yi's team

625
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,940
and also the backbone of our institute.

626
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,090
Alright.

627
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,860
To welcome Director Lee's arrival

628
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,770
and our colleagues here
moving into Sanyangli,

629
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,340
let us all raise the glass together.

630
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,770
Come on, cheers.

631
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,940
Thank you.

632
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,250
Director Lee.

633
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,420
Alright.

634
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,690
Thank you.

635
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,770
Come, Director Lee.

636
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,290
Have another one.

637
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,860
It's our honor to consult you

638
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,090
on math problems.

639
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:47,860
Charlie.

640
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,340
Charlie, come.

641
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,540
We truly appreciate you coming here.

642
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,940
I have a bottle of vintage wine here.

643
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,770
It's a gift from a British friend.

644
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,540
I don't know much about it.

645
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,570
Can you take a look for me?

646
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,980
In the future, I'll need your help.

647
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,290
No problem, Director Liang.

648
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,770
Château Cos d'Estournel.

649
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:10,940
Director Liang,

650
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,770
this wine comes from
the Left Bank of Bordeaux, France

651
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,980
in the Médoc region.

652
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,340
It was established
in the early last century

653
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,340
by Louis Gaspard d'Estournel.

654
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,690
And "Cos" in French

655
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,290
means "small hill",

656
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,980
which matches perfectly
with the location

657
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,770
of the vineyard itself.

658
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,340
- From France?
- From France.

659
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,290
Director Liang.

660
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,290
Opening a vintage wine

661
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,980
still requires an old wine opener.

662
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,540
Otherwise the cork
will break inside the bottle.

663
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,940
Charlie, looks like

664
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,090
you really have opened
quite a few vintage bottles.

665
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,090
You flatter me, Director Liang.

666
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,860
My parents

667
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,770
were the Chinese chefs for Mr. Macallan,

668
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,090
the former chief editor
of the North China Daily News.

669
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,090
Mr. Macallan's very particular
about dining etiquette

670
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,380
and they had a great deal
of vintage wine.

671
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,770
It was during that time

672
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,770
that I learned a lot from Mr. Macallan.

673
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,860
So,

674
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,770
precisely because of
that childhood experience,

675
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,770
I can manage to take care of Mr. Lee.

676
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,340
I know this Macallan.

677
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,650
He's a British entertainment journalist.

678
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,540
Director Liang,

679
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,730
if I remember correctly,

680
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,650
Mr. Macallan was a political journalist.

681
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,900
They lived on...

682
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,690
Burton Road,

683
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,210
right across from the Honckem Market.

684
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,170
Since returning with Mr. Lee,

685
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,980
I've had no time to go back.

686
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,290
I wonder if that area has changed much.

687
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,900
Mission accomplished.

688
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,540
Director Liang,

689
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,380
this wine was deeply loved by royalty.

690
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,820
Fortunately, today in front of you,

691
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,860
I didn't embarrass myself.

692
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,540
Charlie.

693
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,690
I didn't think that after being
away from Shanghai so long,

694
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,540
you could still remember
so many old places.

695
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,650
No wonder you were able
to rescue Director Lee

696
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,900
from the hands
of the Anti-Traitor Squad.

697
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,380
Director Liang,

698
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,380
that was just Mr. Lee's good fortune.

699
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,980
Director Liang.

700
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,770
Charlie is just an assistant.

701
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,210
It's not worth you
wasting your time on him.

702
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,690
Director Lee.

703
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,860
Charlie and I

704
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,690
really do get along quite well.

705
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,860
I'm really envious of you.

706
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,380
Tell me, when will I ever

707
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,770
find such a good assistant myself?

708
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,380
Liang.

709
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,860
It's Ms. Xian Biyun.

710
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,690
Biyun.

711
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,210
Don't be afraid.

712
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,060
I'm absolutely furious.

713
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,210
What's wrong, Biyun?

714
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,290
Joseph.

715
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,820
Biyun, don't cry.

716
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,210
Joseph.

717
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,540
What happened?

718
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:41,820
Mr. Lee.

719
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,210
A group of reckless students

720
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,690
ran to the set to cause trouble.

721
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,690
They splashed paint all over Biyun

722
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,770
and called her a traitor.

723
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:49,380
Can you believe it?

724
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,980
How could this happen?

725
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:52,650
Biyun.

726
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,980
They even told me

727
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,980
that if I kept acting,

728
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,980
they would kill me.

729
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,380
The troupe is already surrounded.

730
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,540
I've become the target
of public criticism.

731
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,690
Where is there still

732
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,170
a place for me in Shanghai?

733
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,290
Joseph.

734
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,380
It's all my fault.

735
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,540
It's all my fault.

736
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,170
It's all my fault, Biyun.
