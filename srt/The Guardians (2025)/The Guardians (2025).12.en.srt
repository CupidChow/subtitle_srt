How is it?

5
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,180
Biyun,

6
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,260
the Organization thinks

7
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,380
since the theater's been sealed,

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,820
the Japanese will drop their guard here,

9
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,180
so this place is actually safer now.

10
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,380
We're supposed to stay put for now.

11
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,980
The Organization supports our next plan,

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,660
and thinks we're on the right track.

13
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,980

I'm still unsure about
working with Gu Yangshan.

00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,780
Well, Ms. Xian has told me
so much about you.

Have you ever been to London before?

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,660
Yeah, I studied in London before.

37
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,940
Ah, of course.

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,260
And what did you study there?

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,890
Math.

40
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,100
It's a really difficult subject.

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,940
I know.

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,980
Math was never my strong point.

43

44
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,940
Thank you for coming today.

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,660
Okay, no problem.

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,540
So we're done here?

51

But there's a bigger problem now.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,380
After Takeda left the Naval Club,

53
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,980
he headed to Dr. Schwarz's clinic,

54
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,980
who is a top brain specialist in Europe.

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,380
As far as I know,

56
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,660
he's the only doctor in Shanghai

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,260
who does cerebral angiography now.

58
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,610
I figure Takeda went to see him,

59
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,290
because he must have gotten
the medical records.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,170
Then he teamed up
with the eye specialist,

61
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,420
so they could consult
for Ding Yi together.

62

Joseph Lee lost his vision

63
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,260

on his optic nerve.

64

So Ms. Xian,

65
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,700
if what you said is true

66
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,210
that Dr. Schwarz

67
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,090
is truly skilled at imaging technology,

68
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,210

72
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,700
and use that toxin on him

73
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,820

for Miyamoto to dock early,

between the Navy and the Army.

for your help.

140
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,140
I have a friend,

whose pituitary tumor
is pressing on his optic nerve.

He's suffering from
terrible headaches lately.

143

And his vision's gotten worse too.

Pituitary tumor?

145
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,220
Yeah.

146
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,220
Dr. Schwarz is an expert in this area.

147
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,740
If he doesn't mind,

148
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,860
he could come by the hospital.

149
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,860
But I heard

150
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,620
getting this test done

151
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,020
can be really risky
for one's body, right?

152
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,380
That's true.

153
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,340
Cerebral angiography is invasive.

154
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,100
The doctor's skill really matters here.

155
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,410
The technique
hasn't been perfect yet.

156
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,930
So many patients who get the test

157
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,930
are at risk of developing

158
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,810
permanent neurological deficits.

159
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,140
So, unless it's urgent

160
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,100
and surgery just can't wait,

161
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,380
we usually don't recommend this test.

162
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,140
But you came to the right person.

163
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,740
Dr. Schwarz is the only one in Shanghai,

164
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,260
who can do this test right now.

165
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,020
So,

166
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,220
let's say my friend

167
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,260
doesn't want to take this test,

168
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,260
but he's forced to do it.

169
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,260
Would you go along with that?

170
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,620
Forcing him?

171
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,100
Yes.

172
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,650
Of course not.

173
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,860
We respect the patient's wishes.

174
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,740
If he isn't healthy enough,

175
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,500
we can't run this test.

176
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,260

177
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,020
Still no,

178
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,380
that's just our medical ethics.

to come here to your clinic,

Yes, and his medical records

186
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,020
should've already reached your clinic.

187

188
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,220
did send the records over.

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,810
His name is...

190
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,500
Jo... Joseph Lee.

191
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,020
That's Mr. Lee.

192
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,410
No wonder,

193
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,740
Dr. Schwarz found it odd that night.

194
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,740
The patient already had a successful

195
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,620
cerebral angiography.

196
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,620
Why did Takeda want it done again?

197
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,340
Here's the thing, Meng Jie.

198
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,980
Mr. Lee's current condition,

199
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,260
both physically and mentally,

200
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,260
can't handle that kind of ordeal.

201
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,740
So the favor I want to ask of you is

202
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,890
whether it is possible

203
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,050
to cancel the checkup

204
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,690
for Mr. Lee tomorrow?

205
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,410
If it were up to me,

206
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,890
yeah, I could do it.

207
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,410
But I can't decide for Dr. Schwarz.

208
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,650
Dr. Schwarz

209
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,770
has always avoided
upsetting the Japanese.

210
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,100
I'm just his student.

211
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,220
I probably can't change his mind.

212
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,340
Ding Yi!

213
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,500
Hongyu...

214
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,220
Someone's been killed! Someone's dead!

215
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,740
Give it back to me!

216
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,740
What is it? Are you out of your mind?

217
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,500
So what now?

218
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,220
Tell me, what can we even do now?

219
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,220
So,

220
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,740
now you get it, right?

221
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,530
The top priority

222
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,860
is to run this test for you.

223
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,220
You really should check this out.

224
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,500
So, what did your childhood friend say?

225
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,740
Did she tell you how to

226
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,980
keep them from checking on me?

227
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,500
She did.

228
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,980
Just use this.

229
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:20,960
[Comprehensive Building]

230
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,740
They're here.

231
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,500
Dr. Schwarz has arrived.

232
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,860
Good morning.

233
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,980
Cerebral angiography carries some risks.

234
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,020
We'll need to run a full exam
on the patient.

235
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,100
Please wait outside.

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,500
Mr. Lee, I'll step out for now.

237
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,020
Dr. Meng will get your arm ready
ahead of time.

238
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,740
No matter how they check tomorrow,

239
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,290
they'll find your blood pressure high.

240
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,500
That way, Dr. Schwarz
won't dare to run the test.

241
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,330
Doctor, am I dying?

242
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,770
High blood pressure can
make you dizzy and queasy.

243
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,380
Right now, you're playing

244
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,980
someone who's lost too much blood.

245
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,020
Professor, could you come here?

246
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,370
The patient's blood pressure is off.

247
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,420
Systolic is at 180.

248
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,740
Check it again.

249
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,500
Okay.

250
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,660
Systolic is now 190.

251
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,570
Do you want to take a listen?

252
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,810
Dr. Schwarz.

253
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,290
Is there something wrong here?

254
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,460
Oh my god.

255
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,050
If you want me to examine
in this condition,

256
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,290
you're just wasting my time.

257
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,850
There are still patients
waiting at my clinic.

258
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,290
Today's session ends here.

259
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,460
Dr. Meng, what did Dr. Schwarz just say?

260
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,290
The patient has
ongoing high blood pressure.

261
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,810
Right now, he's not fit
for further exams.

262
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,060
The doctor suggests starting medication

263
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,330
to lower the pressure first.

264
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,810
We'll reassess after that.

265
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,810
So when can we do the next check?

266
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,020
Mr. Takeda,

267
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,290
this exam is invasive and risky.

268
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,290
A small mistake could be fatal.

269
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,940
About the follow-up timing,

270
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,980
I'll inform you when it's set.

271
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,770
Dr. Meng,

272
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,050
Mr. Lee

273
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,570
is a key partner for us.

274
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,290
We're really concerned about him.

275
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,130
How much longer do we have to wait

276
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,330
before checking him again?

277
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,050
We need you to give us

278
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,850
a clear answer right now.

279
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,460
Mr. Takeda,

280
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,810
why put Dr. Meng on the spot?

281
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,050
Honestly, Mr. Lee doesn't even

282
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,530
need more angiography tests.

283
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,050
So why did you invite Dr. Schwarz

284
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,050
and Dr. Meng here today?

285
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,420
Was it to help him,

286
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,290
or was it to hurt him?

287
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,020
Charlie!

288
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,050
Grab my antihypertensive medication.

289
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,460
My head's about to burst!

290
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,050
Yes, Mr. Lee.

291
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,050
Are you alright?

292
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,290
I'm fine.

293
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,460
I just got too scared back there.

294
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,850
Sorry, Shixian.

295
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,660
I've always been like this
since I was a kid.

296
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,050
Way too timid.

297
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,610
I know.

298
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,290
But,

299
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,220
today, you were really brave.

300
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,810
You honestly helped us out,

301
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,850
more than you know.

302
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:36,740
So,

303
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,660
Meng Jie, thank you.

304
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,460
If there's ever anything I can do,

305
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,500
just let me know.

306
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,130
I'm always here to help.

307
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,570
Shixian.

308
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:58,980
Don't worry.

309
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,290
I'm happy to do all this.

310
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,900
I almost forgot.

311
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,610
We're not kids anymore.

312
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,330
I should head back to the hospital.

313
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,570
By the way,

314
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,770
I just thought of something.

315
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,330
There's a medicine called
chlorpheniramine.

316
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,290
If you take a lot of it fast,

317
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,810
your pupils get really big.

318
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,050
It looks a lot like vision loss.

319
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,020
For someone like Mr. Lee,

320
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,290
that'll fool any eye doctor.

321
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,050
You...

322
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,050
Shixian,

323
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,290
don't worry.

324
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,020
I get it.

325
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,330
You have your reasons.

326
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,740
I won't tell anyone.

327
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,050
I've never tried this way before.

328
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,770
So I can't say if it'll work.

329
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,050
You guys should think it over.

330
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,290
Alright.

331
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,090
I'm heading out.

332
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,570
Meng Jie.

333
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,180
Thanks.

334
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,330
Thank you.

335
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,050
What's the name again?

336
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,810
- Chlorpheniramine.
- Chlorpheniramine.

337
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,050
Chlorpheniramine.

338
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,130
Take care.

339
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,050
See you.

340
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,570
"Shixian."

341
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,290
"I get it.

342
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,050
You have your reasons."

343
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,020
"Don't worry.

344
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,900
I won't tell anyone."

345
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,220
Can you please stop messing around?

346
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,570
She's so nervous

347
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,810
just now.

348
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,050
And you're still teasing her.

349
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,420
Seriously, man.

350
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,850
I'm anxious for you, you know.

351
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,570
Miss Meng really does care about you.

352
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,610
Meanwhile, look at you.

353
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,570
You're like a block of wood.

354
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,130
All you ever say is thanks.

355
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,290
Guns and math, is that all you can do?

356
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,940
Right now, with everything happening,

357
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,330
I can't even think about that.

358
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,810
This challenge,

359
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,460
Meng Jie helped us get through it.

360
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,330
But I think Dr. Miyamoto will show up.

361
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,020
We can't just sit back anymore.

362
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,020
We need to start taking control.

363
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,220
I didn't do anything.

364
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,330
Please spare me.

365
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,330
I didn't do anything.

366
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,330
Please spare me.

367
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,290
I swear I'm innocent.

368
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,050
Please spare me.

369
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,090
He helped that Army deserter

370
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,810
to disguise him as a patient

371
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,050
and sneak onto the transport ship,

372
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,500
trying to run back to Japan.

373
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,090
A total disgrace to our Navy.

374
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,570
Colonel,

375
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,850
the Army Hospital called.

376
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,570
Joseph Lee wants a meeting with you.

377
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,980
Colonel,

378
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,260
that Joseph Lee

379
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,290
always speaks with sarcasm

380
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,850
and stirs up trouble for fun.

381
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,500
This kind of request

382
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,850
is jumping the chain of command.

383
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,020
We can't let it slide.

384
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,330
I'll go deal with him.

385
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,050
Colonel,

386
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,020
don't waste your time here.

387
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,050
But honestly, I'm curious.

388
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,330
What kind of person could this

389
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,050
sworn son of Grand Duke Tonoji be?

390
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,980
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

391
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,810
Takeda has arrived.

392
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,850
Mr. Lee, your report is for me.

393
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,810
What made you want to skip over me

394
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,290
and take things straight to the Colonel?

395
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,610
Honestly, some things are pointless

396
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,330
to bring up to you.

397
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:49,980
So,

398
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,810
I have to tell the Colonel myself.

399
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,810
Mr. Lee, maybe explain,

400
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,050
what exactly doesn't help?

401
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:58,710
Okay.

402
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,050
I was very clear with you before,

403
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,850
I don't want to do that examination,

404
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,020
because

405
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,500
it could seriously hurt my brain.

406
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,460
But you keep pushing me to do it.

407
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,850
Do you not trust me at all?

408
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,290
Why would you even say that?

409
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,050
Back at the Metropolitan Hotel,
I was attacked in public.

410
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,850
The Anti-Traitor Squad
kidnapped me after.

411
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,020
Given my current health,

412
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,050
I'm really not able to
handle testing like that.

413
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,610
Yet Mr. Takeda,
you insist I go.

414
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,500
You clearly want me gone for good.

415
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,850
Oh, I get it now.

416
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,770
Are you really just getting back at me,

417
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,290
all because the cipher
was leaked last time

418
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,570
and I made you lose face?

419
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,260
So,

420
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,220
you're just trying to
make me pay for it.

421
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,290
Am I right?

422
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,570
Mr. Lee,

423
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,570
we're all working
for the Empire of Japan.

424
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,500
We shouldn't stress over these things.

425
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,810
If that's what you came to talk about,

426
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,770
there's no need to bother the Colonel.

427
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,980
You could've told me directly.

428
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,570
Besides,

429
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,570
this checkup

430
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,290
is really for your own good.

431
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,700
For my own good?

432
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,050
I honestly don't get it.

433
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,850
Mr. Takeda, if you mean well,

434
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,740
why risk my safety

435
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,500
and make me go through
that invasive test?

436
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,050
But if you don't care,

437
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,050
why mobilize the Navy?

438
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,260
Why call on the Navy,

439
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,500
just to bring Dr. Miyamoto,

440
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,810
so he can treat my eyes?

441
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:37,740
Just to bring Dr. Miyamoto.

442
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,220
I'm not wrong, am I, Charlie?

443
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,570
That's right, Mr. Lee.

444
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,500
Captain Kobayashi said it himself.

445
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,570
Dr. Miyamoto

446
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,570
is quarantined on the ship
for avian influenza.

447
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,050
Takeda, you personally
moved the Navy in.

448
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,850
That's enough!

449
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,330
Mr. Lee.

450
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,850
Don't believe those rumors.

451
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,530
I really had no idea before,

452
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,500
this checkup could actually do harm.

453
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,090
Now I get it.

454
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,740
If you're not up for it,

455
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,530
then let's just skip the exam.

456
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,330
We'll wait for Dr. Miyamoto.

457
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,850
It's not too late to check later.

458
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,290
I can't get through to you.

459
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,850
I need to see the Colonel.

460
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,770
Sorry to interrupt, I'm coming in.

461
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,050
Where's the Colonel?

462
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,260
The Colonel already left.

463
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,050
This isn't over!

464
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,770
I'm sorry.

465
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,260
Completely useless!

466
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,460
Why didn't Sasaki show up at all?

467
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,090
Looks like your cover
won't last long.

468
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,980
Even though Sasaki stayed hidden today,

469
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,020
judging by Takeda's reaction,

470
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,500
we probably made the right bet.

471
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,500
Asking the Navy to step in

472
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,090
was just Takeda's own idea.

473
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,180
Sasaki probably only just found out.

474
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,570
So now, time's running out.

475
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,290
Let's just stick with the original plan.

476
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,810
We need a full-scale search.

477
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,500
Stop right there. Inspection.

478
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,850
What's going on today?

479
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,570
Why do you need to check us?

480
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,220
Ms. Xian.

481
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,020
Captain Kobayashi.

482
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,540
Colonel Sasaki personally promised me

483
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,850
that while Mr. Lee is in the hospital,

484
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,650
I can visit him anytime.

485
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,130
Today's a special day.

486
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,220
Everyone needs to get checked.

487
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,540
It's always better to be careful.

488
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,900
All this is for everyone's safety.

489
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,460
Please.

490
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,610
Hey, what's up with you?

491
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,060
Thanks.

492
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,570
You okay?

493
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,610
After coming back last night,

494
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,980
Takeda sent people

495
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,940
to stick to

496
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,060
me and Gu Yangshan.

497
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,060
Gu Yangshan wanted
to go to the pharmacy

498
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,250
to steal chlorpheniramine
to pass the eye test,

499
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,730
but we never got the chance.

500
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,060
Later, it hit me that

501
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,130
I was allergic to shrimp as a kid,

502
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,940
so I asked them for a plate of shrimp.

503
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,690
After eating it,

504
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,770
sure enough, I broke out in a rash.

505
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,860
The Japanese

506
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,130
were worried about my health,

507
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,690
so they postponed my eye exam

508
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,980
to tomorrow.

509
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,940
They prescribed me
tons of chlorpheniramine.

510
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,770
I haven't taken a single pill.

511
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,420
I'm saving them all.

512
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,460
Even if tonight

513
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,900
our plan doesn't work out,

514
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,090
it's still fine.

515
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,980
With all these chlorpheniramine,

516
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,210
I'll manage that exam tomorrow.

517
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,820
Hopefully you won't need it.

518
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,770
Ms. Xian,

519
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,610
don't just keep staring at me.

520
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,610
I know I look pretty bad right now,

521
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,820
but it's nothing serious,

522
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,980
just a little itchy, really.

523
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,170
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

524
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,610
I won't be an eyesore for long.

525
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,980
Stop scratching it.

526
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,290
Or it could get infected.

527
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,860
You should keep this safe.

528
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,570
See you tonight then.

529
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:55,980
Watch where you're going.

530
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,770
Sorry about that.

531
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,610
Are you blind?

532
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,460
Sorry.

533
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,610
I'm really sorry.

534
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,690
Mr. Lee, are you okay?

535
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,210
I'm truly sorry.

536
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,540
Be careful when you walk.

537
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,860
What took you so long?

538
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,610
Ding Yi and Takeda had a big fight.

539
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,020
There are twice as many guards today.

540
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,340
It'll take time to shake them off.

541
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,860
Everything's ready now.

542
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,020
We're just waiting for tonight.

543
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,340
Let's sync our watches.

544
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,880
[Safety Amulet]

545
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,540
These are photos
Matsumoto took recently.

546
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,980
They meet almost every day.

547
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,420
Unless they're exchanging intel,

548
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,500
there's no other explanation

549
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,770
for why they need to

550
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,250
meet this often.

551
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,090
Mr. Takeda.

552
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,540
KLX83?

553
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,170
That's their British merchant ship.

554
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,130
It's leaving for
China Hong Kong tonight.

555
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,020
The photos and maps

556
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,500
seem to connect all the dots.

557
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,380
Looks like Joseph Lee

558
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,570
really plans to run.

559
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,460
All those so-called attacks
and disappearances

560
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,460
were just excuses for failed escapes.

561
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,610
This Joseph Lee

562
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,610
wants to get away.

563
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,170
First, he linked up with the British,

564
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,020
pretending to train our cipher talent.

565
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,460
Then, he used Xian Biyun

566
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,570
to sell our intel to the British.

567
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,060
Now he's done selling

568
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,170
and planned to sneak away
on a British merchant ship.

569
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,610
It's not that easy.

570
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,250
Alright.

571
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,170
Tonight's the night.

572
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,730
We'll catch them with everything.

573
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,650
Just heard from someone,

574
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,610
Charlie stole a doctor's uniform
from the laundry,

575
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,900
clearly prepping
for the escape tonight.

576
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,090
I've checked myself.

577
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,130
There's loads of alcohol
stored in the pharmacy,

578
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,500
I'll find a way to set it alight.

579
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,020
You run off during the chaos.

580
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,980
I'll meet you at our spot.

581
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,980
Tonight, at the hospital,

582
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,500
only Matsumoto will be on guard.

583
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,980
Let him know,

584
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,980
no matter what excuse
Joseph Lee gives,

585
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,020
don't try to stop him.

586
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,570
Mr. Takeda,

587
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,980
isn't this a bit risky?

588
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,610
I don't have time to waste.

589
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,130
To catch the prey,

590
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,770
we can make the trap inviting

591
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:48,770
and tighten the rope outside.

592
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,090
Set our main team outside the hospital.

593
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,380
Even if Joseph Lee

594
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,380
comes out from the sewer,

595
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,570
someone must be on him right away.

596
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,980
At the same time,

597
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,690
I'll secure the roads
from the hospital to the dock

598
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,250
all covered.

599
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:11,020
Once he boards KLX83,

600
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,900
and when the ship moves,

601
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,090
that's when we move in.

602
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,380
As long as he gets on the ship

603
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,500
and meets up with Frank,

604
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,460
we can hold them right away.

605
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,980
Why wait for the ship to start?

606
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,900
You know exactly what's going on.

607
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:28,610
Joseph Lee is our honored guest.

608
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:33,090
He met a few British friends.

609
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,500
At most, it's a minor procedural slip.

610
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,500
But if we catch him boarding

611
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,610
the British ship,

612
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,610
and the ship sails,
that's trying to run.

613
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,170
Once it moves,

614
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,980
there's no way for us to stop it.

615
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:48,460
Get in the car.

616
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:13,980
Mr. Takeda,

617
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:15,650
look over there.

618
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,170
They're making their move.
