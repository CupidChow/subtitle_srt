[Episode 32]

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,660
Gu Yangshan has been sidelined
at the Sino-US Special Research Institute

4
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,460
in Chongqing all these years.

5
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,100
After coming back to Shanghai,

6
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,540
he never got involved

7
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,100
in the real cleanup of seized assets.

8
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,380
Even the Gu family can barely
hold on now.

9
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,100
And Meng Mingyi is a notorious traitor.

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,100
I doubt the Gu family can do
anything about this.

11
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,100
Let's wait for news
from the organization.

12
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,060
We can't wait any longer.

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,660
The execution will be carried out
tomorrow noon.

14
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,410
And Miss Meng is on the execution list

15
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,540
of this batch.

16
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,690
Right now, apart from Gu Yangshan,

17
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,540
none of us have any way at all

18
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,130
to pull Miss Meng out of their grasp

19
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,100
within just a single day.

20
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,100
Miss Meng saved my life
several times back then.

21
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,820
I can't just watch her
walk to her death.

22
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,100
But back then, Gu Yangshan left
in such disgrace.

23
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,660
Are you sure he'll see you?

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,780
I trust him.

25
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,980
Auntie Wang, how is it?

26
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,540
Young Master, Inspector Liu just called.

27
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,140
He said he went to the Meng's residence.

28
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,130
But there was no one there.

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,100
He's heading
to the Elimination Committee

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,660
to see if Miss Meng has been arrested.

31
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,100
Alright.

32
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,260
Let me know if there's any news.

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,780
One more thing.

34
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,820
There's a man outside in sunglasses
asking for you.

35
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,570
He said his surname is Ding.

36
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,370
After hearing that the Master is ill,

37
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,020
he asked me to give this to you

38
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,340
and then left.

39
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,250
Alright.

40
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,460
I see, Auntie Wang.

41
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,220
You go ahead.

43
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,580
Where's Chief Cao?

44
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,700
He just left.

45
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,700
How's Commander Gu's health?

46
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,700
Pretty good.

47
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,050
Director Dai and Deputy Director Mao

48
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,020
are very concerned about Commander Gu.

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,450
They said they would pay him a visit.

50
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,270
But they're worried it might
disturb him.

51
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,140
So they told me

52
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,660
to call them as soon as I see you.

53
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,730
No, no, no.

54
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,460
No need to trouble them.

55
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,490
I actually want to ask you

56
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,980
[Meng Jie]
about this list.

57
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,610
They're traitors to the nation

58
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,050
and should be dealt with.

59
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,190
Is there a problem with that?

60
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,580
No problem at all.

61
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,700
If they really are traitors,

62
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,220
then they do deserve to be executed.

63
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,370
But Meng Jie was a hero
of the Sword Thrust Operation.

64
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,460
Why would her name be on that list?

65
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,020
Gu Yangshan,

66
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,810
have you forgotten?

67
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,960
The higher-ups made their decision
long ago.

68
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,810
The Sword Thrust Operation

69
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,200
was a complete failure.

70
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,580
In a failed mission,

71
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,020
there can be no heroes.

72
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,340
You're the only son of Commander Gu,

73
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,580
and for years you've always led
from the front.

74
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
But why are you still
just a lieutenant colonel?

75
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,900
Isn't it because
while stationed in Shanghai,

76
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,990
you were suspected
of colluding with the communists?

77
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,700
Now that Commander Gu has retired,

78
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,020
you must be careful
not to make a wrong move

79
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,900
and get yourself linked
with traitors again.

80
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,700
Besides, her father's already fallen
from power.

81
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,460
Then she's of no use to you anymore.

82
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,140
Why would you even

83
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,580
risk your future for her?

84
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,810
One must have value

85
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,220
in order to keep living.

86
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,140
Of course.

87
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,580
Why do you think back then

88
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,460
everyone turned their back on me,

89
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,460

90
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,140
Where did this come from?

91
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,140
Looks like it's from the Tang Yue Kiln.

92
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,020
A newly acquired piece?

93
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,580
You never take my advice, do you?

94
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,700
Things like these antiques
and paintings,

95
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,960
you should be asking Chief Cao.

96
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,410
You know me,

97
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,580
I've never had any interest
in such things.

98
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,140
Long time no see.

99

It's been a while.

100
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,220
The first time I met you
was five years ago.

101
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,700
It was in this very room.

102
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,640
The moment I walked in,

103
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,580
you hit me with a shot right away.

104
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,050
Yeah.

105
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,930
But over these five years,

106
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,290
you've changed a lot.

107
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,140
But you haven't changed at all
in these five years.

108
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,580

115
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,300
Come or not?

116
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,180
Looks like you finally get
what you want.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,850
Congrats.

118
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,490
But before the wedding,

119
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,850
we have to get Miss Meng out first.

120
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,700
To rescue Miss Meng

121
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,200
was from your Party Committee, right?

122
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,610
Not really.

123
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,010
It was my wife's idea.

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,980
She said Miss Meng is our benefactor.

125
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,610
So she has to be there
on our wedding day.

126
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,730
Alright, enough.

127
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,820
Stop trying to fool me.

128
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,490
Your people have been in touch
with me for years.

129
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,010
I can tell right away if you're acting.

130
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,580
Besides, the execution list

131
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,060
is never made public.

132
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,490
So without someone

133
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,730
tipping you off,

134
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,220
how could you know so quickly?

135
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,730
Next, you must not ask me

136
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,340
who provided me with the information.

137
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,500
Even if you cover my head

138
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,660
and drag me to Maxin Theatre,

139
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,460
plus throw in ten gold bars,

140
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,340
I still won't say a single word.

141
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,700
Alright.

142
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,340
But no matter who it is,

143
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,820
thank him for me.

144
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,420
Actually, I know the reason why you went

145
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,820
to the Gu Residence to find me.

146
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,460
But the Gu family now

147
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,670
is nothing like it used to be.

148
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,340
I just went to Shanghai Bureau

149
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,980
and got turned down cold.

150
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,300
So getting Miss Meng out

151
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,980
isn't as easy as I thought.

152
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,820
But you already have a plan, right?

153
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,100
Yeah, but I'll need your help.

154
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,580
Of course.

155
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,100
Today, in Chief Cao's office,

156
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,490
I saw a celadon vase
from the Tang Yue Kiln.

157
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,980
It's worth a fortune.

158
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,980
And years ago,

159
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,100
I saw that very vase
at the Meng's.

160
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,100
Now it suddenly turns up
at Shanghai Bureau.

161
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,060
It must be that Chief Cao

162
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,980
took advantage of clearing seized assets

163
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,440
to fill his own pockets

164
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,720
and embezzle for personal gain.

165
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,300
If there's one piece,
there'll be a second and third.

166
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,220
Chief Cao.

167
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,700
The warehouse security
of the Seized Asset Disposal Committee

168
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,700
is handled
by the Shanghai Garrison Command.

169
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,980
Liu Changdong,
the acting Deputy Commander,

170
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,440
served under my father back in the day.

171
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,060
I'll have him get the evidence.

172
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,220
Then it's your move after that.

173
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,580
What do you need us to do?

174
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,300
Make it public.

175
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,700
I know your Party's publications

176
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,060
have strong influence in Shanghai.

177
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,940
It is now a critical moment

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,850
for negotiations
between the two parties.

179
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,100
The Chairman wants to make an example
of someone,

180
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,430
so once he finds out the evidence
of the Seized Asset Disposal Committee

181
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,210
colluding with the Elimination Committee
in embezzlement.

182
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,720
If it stirs up enough public pressure,

183
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,580
we might be able to halt the execution,

184
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,220
and push for a retrial.

185
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,460
Do you even realize what you're saying?

186
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,580
I do.

187
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,220
We've got 12 hours left.

188
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,220
Inspector Liu should be on the way
to deliver the photos.

189
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,100
Once you get the photos,

190
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,220
I'll need you to hand them
to your superiors,

191
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,850
and ask them to send them
to the newspaper.

192
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,460
So by six in the morning,

193
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,340
I expect these photos will

194
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,580
spread across every corner of Shanghai.

195
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,700
If all goes well,

196
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,580
I guess, by around ten,

197
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,890
someone from Shanghai will

198
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,220
call the Chairman's Huangshan Residence.

199
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,180
I've seen the way

200
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,220
your Party works.

201
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,580
I'm sure you can do this.

202
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,740
If they find it out,

203
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,440
they'll call it betraying the party
and the nation.

204
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,620
But it was clearly they
who first betrayed

205
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,220
the Three Principles of the People.

206
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,220
I misread you just now.

207
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,860
You've changed over these five years,

208
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,620
and changed a lot.

209
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,690
My father is determined to leave.

210
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,720
I have nothing left to hold me back.

211
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,500
At last, I can walk the same path
as you.

212
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,260
I've been on the wrong path
all this time.

213
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,260
If I still don't turn back,

214
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,860
I shall die alone

215
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,020
in the desert of life.

216
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,860
No...

217
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,860
No one would even shed a tear for me.

218
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,620
Father!

219
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,620
Father!

220
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,140
Father!

221
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,020
My sweety...

222
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,260
Father!

223
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,740
Does calling him help now?

224
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,860
Back when you worked for the Japanese,

225
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,260
so many of our fellow countrymen

226
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,500
were separated from their families,

227
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,220
did you ever hold back?

228
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,120
Did you ever feel sympathy?

229
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,500
I never harmed a single Chinese.

230
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,740
I even helped in resisting Japan.

231
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,980
I helped!

232
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,500
If you don't believe me, ask Shixian.

233
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,860
Go find Shixian.

234
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,380
He can vouch for me.

235
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,260
I'm not lying to you.

236
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,380
You helped?

237
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,020
I really did help.

238
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,770
I bled and sacrificed on the frontline,

239
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,260
while you and Shixian

240
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,690
were enjoying love in the large mansion
in Sanyangli.

241
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,980
If that's what you call resisting Japan,

242
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,080
then what does that make me?

243
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,860
No, no, that's not it!

244
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,500
You've got it all wrong!

245
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,380
I really helped them.

246
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,770
I helped a man named Joseph Lee.

247
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,260
I...I covered for him.

248
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,860
He has a wife named Xian Biyun.

249
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,620
They're both fighters resisting Japan.

250
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,650
I'm not lying to you.

251
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,500
I swear, I'm not lying to you.

252
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,140
Please...

253
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,260
Joseph Lee and Xian Biyun
are communists.

254
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,380
If that's really true,

255
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,140
you not only betray the country
but also collude with the enemy.

256
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,140
I'm not.

257
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,860
Sweety...Sweety, stop talking.

258
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,460
It's my fault.

259
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,500
I drag you into this.

260
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,090
Father...

261
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,180
Father!

262
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,500
Father!

263
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,180
Father!

264
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,180
Father!

265
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,700
Father!

266
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,810
Stop!

267
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,700
Father!

268
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,220
Father!

269
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,940
Father!

270
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,500
Father!

271
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,990
What are you doing, Gu Yangshan?

272
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,740
Father!

273
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,020
Father!

274
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,740
Father!

275
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,700
Father!

276
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,570
You killed her father
right in front of her.

277
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,790
Do you still have any conscience?

278
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,180
They're traitors, worse than animals.

279
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,390
Do you even need a special spot
to slaughter them?

280
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,740
Start!

281
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,370
Bro,

282
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,460
don't move, step back.

283
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,180
Don't move.

284
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,740
Gu Yangshan, are you trying
to block the execution?

285
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,020
Let me tell you,

286
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,740
I'm taking Meng Jie with me today.

287
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,420
Then go ahead.

288
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,940
Come on, fire.

289
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,660
You try too.

290
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,810
Deputy Chief Luo,

291
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,660
I just received a special order
from the Chairman,

292
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,810
saying holding an open trial
for these traitors

293
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,420
to prevent any wrongful convictions.

294
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,940
Stop the execution immediately.

295
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,020
It's fine now.

296
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,700
Bear with it for a few days.

297
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,500
I'll help prepare your defense
for the trial.

298
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,020
Get in the car.

299
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,020
You are a liar.

300
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,500
Liar!

301
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,020
Meng Jie.

302
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,740
Meng Jie.

303
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,770
Liar!

304
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,810
Meng Jie.

305
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,260
Let me go.

306
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,260
Meng Jie.

307
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,420
Let me go.

308
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,050
Luo, take a look at this.

309
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,500
Just a couple of days ago,

310
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,660
we confiscated the Meng family's assets.

311
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,980
Now these red publications

312
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,220
are accusing us
of lining our own pockets.

313
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,890
[New Five Scholars Picture,
the Elimination Committee]

314
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,020
They even slam the Elimination Committee

315
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,500
labels loyal people as traitors,

316
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,460
just to seize their property.

317
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,420
Isn't that absurd?

318
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,050
I'll shut down that newspaper.

319
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,700
What's the point of shutting it down?

320
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,740
They already have solid evidence.

321
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,940
Take a good look at that photo.

322
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,050
We just want to show off,

323
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,980
but we end up embarrassing ourselves.

324
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,180
Isn't this humiliating?

325
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,020
How on earth did they

326
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,460
get the photos of the warehouse?

327
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,940
Deputy Chief Luo,

328
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,940
right now in Shanghai,

329
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,810
from when the mayor of Shanghai

330
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,740
takes office,

331
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,320
down to whose hen lays an egg

332
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,780
to make a scrambled eggs with chives.

333
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,700
Don't the communists know all about it?

334
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,940
I really don't understand

335
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,700
how you get into trouble with them.

336
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,420
Report.

337
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,260
Come in.

338
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,530
Chief Cao, Deputy Chief Luo,

339
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,530
the people we sent to tail Meng Jie

340
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,020
actually got photos. Please take a look.

341
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,700
But they're really on high alert.

342
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,330
Our people lost track of them.

343
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,500
So it really is him.

344
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,530
I see.

345
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,460
Yes, sir.

346
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,260
My guess was right.

347
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,500
It's not just the Communist Party
involved in this.

348
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,500
There's also an insider.

349
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,020
How is she?

350
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,530
She just fell asleep
after taking sedatives.

351
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,740
The best psychiatrists
at Puci Sanatorium

352
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,260
are currently at the Chaosheng Troupe.

353
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,180
I bring them over now.

354
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,020
You just showed your face on the street.

355
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,980
Luo Han definitely won't let this go.

356
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,260
And I suspect

357
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,980
the Chaosheng Troupe
may not be safe anymore.

358
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,500
How about this?

359
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,020
You bring Ms. Xian and these doctors

360
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,530
to my place.

361
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,500
At least for now, no one dares
to search the Gu Residence.

362
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,640
No, I can't. The identities

363
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,260
of these doctors are very sensitive now.

364
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,810
We can't let you get into more trouble.

365
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,980
Back when you helped me before,

366
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,180
were you afraid of trouble?

367
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,020
That was different.

368
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,700
Back then, we were

369
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,260
like people with nothing to lose.

370
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,500
But now, you…

371
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,940
This is your home.

372
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,020
We can't put your family at risk.

373
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,700
Yes, it's different.

374
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,460
But now we

375
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,260
are already walking the same path.

376
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,180
Tomorrow, I'll send my father

377
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,420
to London for treatment.

378
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,180
By then,

379
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,050
I won't have

380
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,420
any more worries holding me back.

381
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,660
Alright, we'll go with my plan.

382
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,660
Tonight I will have Inspector Liu

383
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,370
cover your departure from Shanghai.

384
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,130
Alright.

385
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,050
We'll do it your way then.

386
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,260
Once I get Biyun and these doctors

387
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,530
safely out of Shanghai,

388
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,280
I'll rush back right away.

389
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,020

This is my mission.

391
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,570
I have to get every doctor on this list

392
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,180
safely out of Shanghai.

393
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,290
But a few people are still missing.

394
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,330
So I can't leave yet.

395
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,330
But Ding Yi, you have to understand,

396
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,180
you are in a more dangerous situation.

397
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,280
Luo Han is completely
out of control now.

398
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,290
If he finds you,

399
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,020
he won't need to wait at all
if he wants to kill you.

400
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,900
That's exactly why I need your help.

401
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,530
Cover for me when necessary.

402
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,810
Do you have to do this?

403
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,420
Yes, I do.

404
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,290
You're still as stubborn as ever.

405
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,590
You haven't changed in five years.

406
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,900
Back then you kept it from me
to help Ms. Xian.

407
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,900
Now you're hiding it from her,
so I can help you.

408
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,420
Does Ms. Xian know?

409
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,330
I can't let her know.

410
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,290
Seriously, don't tell her.

411
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,460
Otherwise she'll cling on and insist

412
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,550
on rushing back with me.

413
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,570
So annoying!

414
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,180
I do wonder,

415
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,360
once Ms. Xian finds out your plan,

416
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,690
how she's going to deal with you.

417
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,850
Oh right,

418
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,060
do you still remember

419
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,590
when the three of us were in Sanyangli,

420
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,900
and on my birthday

421
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,420
we took a group photo?

422
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,420
Yeah.

423
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,180
On such a joyful day,

424
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,660
let's take a photo for memories.

425
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,330
Yeah. Ms. Xian, step a bit more
to the center.

426
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,570
It's fine, just leave a little space
for me.

427
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm slim.

428

The KMT-Communist Party
tensions flared up again.

429
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,740
On September 30,

430
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:20,500
Han Deqin's unit issued
an eradication order,

431
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,290
vowing to deploy all its elite forces...

432
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,180
But unfortunately,

433
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,180
that photo did not capture

434
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,980
your and Biyun's faces.

435
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,980
But I think today's a great chance.

436
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,900
How about we retake that photo

437
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,530
till Biyun comes later?

438
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,420
Then I'd better
switch off the radio beforehand.

439
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,420
Clear away the coal ash.

440
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,250

someone lived here.

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,530
I've told Auntie Wang everything.
Don't worry.

450
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,420
You really don't want to leave

451
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,660
and go with me?

452
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,420
I still have unfinished business.

453

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,770
is all this because I rescued Miss Meng?

fell during the Great Revolution,

477
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,020
for the dream of a Republic for China.

478

Father,

487
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,940
I think it's time for someone to step up

488
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,260
and establish a new set of rules.

489
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,370
Seems that over the years in Shanghai,

490
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,460
you've truly made some good friends.

491
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,700

is the path I hope you'd follow.

492
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,060
But now it seems

493
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,610
you have a path of your own in mind.

494
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,060
Father, the good friend you mentioned
has arrived.

495
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,020
They're all on high alert.

496
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,060
After getting off the car,

497
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,570
they managed to shake off our lookout.

498
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,700
But looking at the map,

499
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,570
the two stations where they got off

500
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,060
are close to each other.

501
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,740
I've stationed people all around.

502
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,570
They'll definitely show up again.

inside the Gu Residence.

512
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,980
Ask him to issue a search warrant.

513
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,020
But…

514
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,740
No buts.

515
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,940

After your negotiations are done,

527
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,880
you can drive it
out of the city.

530
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,900
Don't mention it.

531
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,940
I should be thanking you.

a huge emotional shock,

as schizophrenia.

537
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,170
But it needs further confirmation.

538
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,570
By the way, I haven't asked you yet.

539
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,820

540
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,550
Liver cancer.

541
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,540
The people around him told me

542
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,820
that my father had shown signs long ago,

543
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,650
but he kept enduring it
without seeing a doctor.

544
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,170
Sorry for that.

545
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,130

to the revolution,

546
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,610
yet in the end,

547
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,570
he has to live far away overseas.

548
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,900
What about you?

549
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,420
Do you have any plans?

550
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,090
Ding Yi has missed you all these years.

551
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,790

studying the Joseph Cipher

552
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,200
since you returned to Chongqing.

553
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,540
He said,

554
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,540
you must be unwilling to give up.

555
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,860
Ms. Xian,

556
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,290
I know what you're trying to tell me.

557
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,210
Honestly, I've envied Ding Yi
all these years,

558
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,210
because he was lucky enough to meet you,

559
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,060
and you led him

560
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,090
onto the right path.

561
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,060
I believe if I were in his shoes
back then,

562
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,420
I would've made the exact same choice.

563
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,170
But sadly...

564
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,090
I fixed that old camera.

565
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,730
Come on.

566
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,210
Let's go.

567
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,420
I think...

568
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:08,820
Sit here.

569
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,250
It's gotta be exactly like before.

570
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,540
Mainly, I have to hold both of you down

571
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,650
and see

572
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,130
which one of you can still run away.

573
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,650
Alright, ready.

574
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,940
You three, look over here.

575
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,540
Give me a smile.

576
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,610
One.

577
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,860
Two.

578
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,730
Three.

579
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,060
This…

580
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,500
What a lousy camera!

581
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,020
I've been fixing it for a long time.

582
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,460
I thought it was fixed.

583
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,820
Why is it...?

584
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,610
Wait, wait.

585
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,650
How do I handle this?

586
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,210
I'm telling you, this camera I have now

587
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,210
is mainly for collection,

588
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,250
not for taking photos.

589
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,130
Don't break it.

590
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,020
Young Master.

591
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,820
Auntie Wang.

592
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,650
Young Master!

593
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,290
What's going on?

594
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,340
Something happened.

595
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,540
Deputy Chief Luo and his people
are here,

596
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,260
saying they want
to search the Gu Residence.

597
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,380
What for?

598
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,170
Don't move.

599
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,500
Who are you?

600
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,170
Stay there!

601
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,570
Auntie Wang,

602
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,340
please take our guests inside.

603
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,090
I'll handle this.

604
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,170
Be careful.

605
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,130
I'll go with you.

606
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,420
You get inside too.

607
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,570
This is my home.
I can't let them walk in.

608
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,540
Biyun,

609
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,650
take them in first.

610
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,340
I'll go...

611
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,420
Since you're already here,

612
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,540
you're my guests.

613
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,880
No matter how bad things gets,

614
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,170
we never turn guests away.

615
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,500
Let my son handle whatever's outside.

616
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,130
Please, follow me.

617
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,170
Luo Han,

618
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,170
why do you bring so many people here?

619
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,860
Sorry for disturbing you.
It's an official duty.

620
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,250
What official duty?

621
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,460
I suspect you're hiding traitors.

622
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,940
Deputy Director Mao has already
obtained permission

623
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,730
from Chairman Chiang

624
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,440
and ordered me to search
all Gu family's properties,

625
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,750
including the Gu Residence.

626
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,980
You're saying our family
harbors traitors.

627
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,250
You even got Chairman Chiang's
permission

628
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,460
to search our home.

629
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,250
Permission, huh?

630
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,540
Where's the search warrant?

631
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:58,860
Luo Han,

632
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,340
I know you're the Deputy Chief now.

633
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,340
It's normal for you
to have official duties.

634
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,440
I can allow you to search our home,

635
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,500
but only you go in alone.

636
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,980
If they all want to go in,

637
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,200
then you'd better think
about the consequences.

638
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,650
I decide what the consequences are.

639
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,170
Fine.

640
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,250
Go.

641
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,350
Yes, sir.

642
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,090
How dare you, Gu Yangshan!

643
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,090
Sorry, my aim was off.

644
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,340
I should kill you.

645
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,500
Come on, who else wants to try?

646
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,840
The moment you fired this shot,

647
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,860
you became a traitor to the Party-State.

648
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,980
There's no reason
we can't search a traitor's house.

649
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,060
Take out your guns.

650
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,570
Listen, if anyone dares to hit you,

651
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,340
you hit them right back!

652
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,060
Yes, sir.

653
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,570
It's just a scratch. Get up yourself.

654
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,500
Try it.

655
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,860
Young Master, Young Master!

656
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,060
Master asks you
to invite Deputy Chief Luo inside.

657
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,340
Master, Master.

658
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,060
Commander Gu, sorry to trouble you.

659
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,650
Yangshan,

660
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,420
since Deputy Chief Luo
is on official duty,

661
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,060
then let him search.

662
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,650
The Gu family has nothing to hide.

663
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,170
There's nothing shameful here.

664
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,060
We welcome the Party-State's inspection!

665
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,340
Yes.

666
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,080
Please pardon the intrusion.

667
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,170
Search.

668
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,340
Yes, sir!

669
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,900
Seal every written document

670
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,210
and take them back for review!

671
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:25,980
Yes, sir!

672
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,290
Yangshan,

673
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,900
we're just in the way here.

674
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,860
Come walk with me in the yard.

675
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,060
