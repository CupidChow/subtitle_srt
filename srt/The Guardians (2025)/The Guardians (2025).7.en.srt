[The Guardians]

00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,920
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,540
Mr. Lee.

4
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,460
I've got the ship ticket
to China Hong Kong

5
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,260
for tomorrow night.

6
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,380
There were too many people
buying.

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,020
Sorry for being late.

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,020
It's okay.

9
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,380
Mr. Lee, you're leaving?

10
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,380
Yes.

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,210
Actually, today

12
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,740
I came to say goodbye to you.

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,020
This last glass of wine...

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,690
Thank you.

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,260
Let it be regarded as

16
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,010
our farewell drink.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,660
Why?

18
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,820
Actually,

19
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,850
I don't want to leave either.

20
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,060
But what's the point of me staying?

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,980
My code has already been leaked.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,570
Mr. Lee!

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,820
Do you know what you just said?

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,500
No one present is allowed to leave.

25
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,060
Mr. Lee, may I ask,

26
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,540
where did you learn
the code had been leaked?

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,850
From the British.

28
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,410
Director William?

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,660
Why would they tell you?

30
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,060
Director William has been
my friend for many years.

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,660
He couldn't bear to see me implicated,

32
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,980
so he told me.

33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,820
Actually, Mr. Takeda,

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,100
I hadn't planned to bring this up today.

35
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,660
But for the sake of our brotherhood,

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,540
I'll give you one piece of advice.

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,260
Replace my code immediately

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,820
to prevent further leaks.

39
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,130
How did they know about it?

40
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,500
There are many people in the MSS.

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,540
It's not impossible
for the code to be leaked.

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,500
Impossible.

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,500
The confidentiality level
of our code is extremely high.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,980
All personnel involved
in classified matters

45
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,340
have never had
any contact with outsiders.

46
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,660
If Mr. Lee is so certain

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,100
that the code has been leaked,

48
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,540
then I can't help but suspect you.

49
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,780
Shut up!

50
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,450
Takeda.

51
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,500
You are blatantly insulting me!

52
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,260
This code set

53
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,570
is my life's work.

54
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,410
Why would I ever leak it

55
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,540
and destroy my own honor?

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,410
Clearly, it's the MSS

57
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,660
that has a mole

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,980
who ruined my work!

59
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,340
We must take responsibility
for your work.

60
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,780
I will have to ask you
and everyone present

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,460
to come back with me to the MSS.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,460
Come in.

63
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,250
Take them all away.

64
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,460
Come in.

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,100
Wait.

66
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,340
If I can accompany her

67
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,170
to London

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,850
in my lifetime,

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,340
it would surely be a wonderful journey.

70
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,490
Your napkin fell.

71
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:57,900
Thank you.

72
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,490
This is to thank Mr. Lee
for his goodwill.

73
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,610
In the name of
my foster father, I swear

74
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,020
I have never done anything

75
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,140
to betray the Empire of Japan.

76
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,370
Grand Duke Tonoji.

77
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,370
Grand Duke Tonoji.

78
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,700
The Tonoji family.

79
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,610
They are close aides to the Emperor.

80
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,580
You never told me you had

81
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,140
such a distinguished background.

82
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,170
But I've never heard

83
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,930
that Grand Duke Tonoji had a foster son.

84
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,580
Mr. Takeda,

85
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,290
do you really think that
without this connection,

86
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,930
I would have traveled
such a long way to Shanghai

87
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,050
to work for you?

88
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,250
With my foster father's status,

89
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,700
would he have to inform you

90
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,930
about adopting a foster son?

91
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,020
I will verify

92
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,610
these words.

93
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,020
Verify?

94
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,810
I bear the expectations and mission

95
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,490
of Grand Duke Tonoji to save East Asia.

96
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,140
I traveled thousands of miles
to work for you.

97
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,050
And now,

98
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,810
you doubt my loyalty?

99
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,490
This is not only an insult to me,

100
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,250
but also to my foster father!

101
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,810
Mr. Lee, I absolutely did not mean

102
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,700
to insult Grand Duke Tonoji.

103
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,810
Fine.

104
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,140
Don't you want to verify?

105
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,490
No problem.

106
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,020
I'll give you the chance to verify.

107
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,170
Now,

108
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,490
send a coded telegram,

109
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,700
pretending to order an air strike
on Chinese forces

110
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,250
around Shanghai.

111
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,020
If the enemy camps

112
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,050
make no response at all,

113
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,290
we'll all be happy.

114
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,050
You'll lose nothing.

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,290
On the contrary,

116
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,020
if it turns out that my code

117
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,050
has been leaked completely,

118
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,140
you'll still have time to remedy it.

119
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,370
Otherwise, all future losses

120
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,810
on the battlefield
for the Empire of Japan

121
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,490
will be your responsibility.

122
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,370
Mr. Lee,

123
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,490
a code leak is not a joke.

124
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,020
Even if Grand Duke Tonoji
came himself today,

125
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,490
I would not conduct
such an absurd test.

126
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,480
[10 minutes until the scheduled time]

127
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,730
Gu Yangshan.

128
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,930
I will keep monitoring Unit 153's radio.

129
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,460
If they still haven't sent

130
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,610
the test coded message
for the air raid at 8,

131
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,610
then the charge of
falsifying military orders

132
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,930
will leave us to
die an ignominious death.

133
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,810
I've said all I could.

134
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,930
I see you as my brother,

135
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,700
yet you treat me as a mole.

136
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,140
Then I can only give you four words.

137
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,460
Act responsibly.

138
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:18,490
Charlie.

139
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,810
Mr. Lee, I'm here.

140
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,370
How can a good actor

141
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,610
make the audience believe

142
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,250
what he plays is real?

143
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,770
By making the fake real.

144
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,850
Mr. Lee!

145
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,130
Be careful, Mr. Takeda.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,340
Mr. Lee, are you alright?

147
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,220
Go now.

148
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,850
Call for reinforcements.

149
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,250
Leave!

150
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,730
Under the window,
our people will be there to assist.

151
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,650
Murder!

152
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,850
What happened?

153
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,250
Sorry, Mr. Lee.

154
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,730
I failed to keep you safe.

155
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,250
Mr. Takeda,

156
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,010
what are you standing there for?

157
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,850
Call an ambulance!

158
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,130
Mr. Takeda.

159
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,490
This is a standard dagger
from the BIS.

160
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:15,850
Also,

161
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,420
we found this.

162
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,130
Mr. Takeda,

163
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,890
we have both witness
and physical evidence.

164
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,420
This waiter

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,010
was sent by the BIS
to kill Mr. Lee.

166
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,730
Mr. Lee has worked wholeheartedly

167
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,130
for the Empire of Japan.

168
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,770
Mr. Takeda,
do you still not believe him?

169
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,250
What a small accident indeed.

170
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,730
Hurry and call an ambulance!

171
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,730
Mr. Takeda,

172
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,610
Mr. Lee is a friend
of the Empire of Japan.

173
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,370
He almost died at the hands
of an anti-Japanese fighter.

174
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,130
If anything happens here today,

175
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,250
who can bear that responsibility?

176
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,490
Mr. Lee.

177
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,490
I will take full responsibility

178
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,220
for everything that happened here.

179
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,340
Wait here for a moment.

180
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,890
Get rid of this guy.

181
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,370
Pass the message to Mr. Aota.

182
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,730
Is that Mr. Aota?

183
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,850
I'd like to ask you a favor.

184
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,130
Appreciated.

185
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,730
This is Takeda.

186
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,700
Mr. Takeda.

187
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,940
We've already sent the air raid order

188
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,940
to the Air Force Unit 153.

189
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,300
Unfortunately,

190
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,220
the Nationalist Army's 405th Battalion

191
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,730
immediately sounded
the air raid alarm at 20:00.

192
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,730
Gu Yangshan, well played!

193
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,850
Thank you.

194
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,580
I traveled all this way to work for you,

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,700
yet you suspected me
over and over again.

196
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,100
Today I've ended up
in such a wretched state.

197
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,460
I was so wrong to trust you.

198
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,580
Mr. Lee is right.

199
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,340
What we did was wrong.

200
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,100
We are left with no choice
but to doubt everyone.

201
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,100
Mr. Lee.

202
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,220
I'll take you to the hospital.

203
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,580
Take Mr. Lee to the hospital.

204
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,940
Yes, this is Kobayashi.

205
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,220
Yes.

206
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,100
Mr. Takeda.

207
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,700
What is it?

208
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,490
The Communist base has also
sounded the air raid alarm.

209
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,460
I said take Mr. Lee
to the hospital first.

210
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,460
Yes.

211
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,980
Mr. Lee, there are steps.

212
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,220
Mr. Lee, I'll leave you to them.

213
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,140
Yes.

214
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,180
Was tonight's event

215
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,940
arranged in advance by you?

216
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,460
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

217
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,940
We were afraid
Takeda wouldn't believe you,

218
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,740
so we arranged the assassination.

219
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,180
If you didn't act real enough,

220
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,660
Takeda wouldn't believe you.

221
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,460
We did this

222
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,740
all for your own good.

223
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,260
For my good?

224
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,180
For my good,

225
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,900
you had Gu killed?

226
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,460
Gu Yangshan, if you don't trust me,

227
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,700
why did you get me
to do this in the first place?

228
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,220
Now look.

229
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,700
Because of your mistrust,

230
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,220
you got Gu killed.

231
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,220
Gu Yangshan, are you even human?

232
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,940
Do you think I would have

233
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,740
sent Gu to his death?

234
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,180
Uncle Gu was a soldier,

235
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,500
but he was more like my family.

236
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,460
I couldn't stop him
from going to the battlefield,

237
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,980
but who would ever
send their own family

238
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,530
to their death?

239
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,290
No, absolutely not.

240
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,050
Uncle Gu, please don't
try to persuade me.

241
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,530
Otherwise...

242
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,570
Young Master, your identity
is not appropriate.

243
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,370
If someone must go, I'll go.

244
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,090
You? With that leg of yours?

245
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,050
Your leg...

246
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,900
Don't hesitate.

247
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,420
This is the best plan.

248
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,940
Don't forget.

249
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,220
I'm not only a servant
of the Gu family,

250
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,220
I'm also a soldier.

251
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,180
If your identity is exposed,

252
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,700
then Ding Yi will be doomed.

253
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,660
He needs you more.

254
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,220
Uncle Gu, how about this.

255
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,570
After we pretend to fight,

256
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,530
I'll knock you to the window,

257
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,180
then push you out.

258
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,700
There'll be our people
below to catch you.

259
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,090
Once they catch you,

260
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,770
they'll take you to the dock.

261
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,980
You get on a ship immediately.

262
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,570
Once things calm down,

263
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,460
I'll come find you.

264
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,220
Tonight's plan was

265
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,700
after Uncle Gu's assassination attempt,
he'd jump from the window.

266
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,610
Then he would be taken to the dock
by the people waiting below,

267
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,460
and immediately leave.

268
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,500
We already agreed on this.

269
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,020
But...

270
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,260
Why didn't he do it?

271
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,090
He promised me.

272
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,610
He promised that.

273
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,260
But Ding Yi,

274
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,980
I'm telling you.

275
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,220
In tonight's plan,

276
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,220
whether it was me or Uncle Gu who died,

277
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,260
we never intended for you to die.

278
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,460
I promised you,

279
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,460
if there's danger,

280
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,700
I'll stand in front of you.

281
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,940
I will never lie about that.

282
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,370
One, two, three, smile.

283
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,530
Take care.

284
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,020
Go.

285
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,350
Hey.

286
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,570
Look at you.

287
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,810
I said take care.

288
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,530
Get up.

289
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,290
Was Gu

290
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,180
our comrade?

291
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,770
Comrade Xiao.

292
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,610
Takeda is naturally suspicious.

293
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,570
Ding Yi's combat experience

294
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,850
is not very rich.

295
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,610
I feared that

296
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,370
Ding Yi couldn't convince Takeda,

297
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,050
so I decided to leave him

298
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,740
a backup plan.

299
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,330
I need to assassinate
Joseph Lee at the banquet,

300
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,370
so that the Japanese
would believe his loyalty.

301
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,530
Only then

302
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,330
could they stop suspecting him.

303
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,290
I know this is a road of no return.

304
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,810
But as long as
Joseph Lee's code remains,

305
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,050
thousands of miles
of territory will be lost.

306
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,530
I've stayed by Gu Zhengze's side,

307
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,980
lying low for many years.

308
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,740
Now it's become a dead game.

309
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,290
If I can make a contribution
at this time of national crisis,

310
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:23,500
then I can die without regret.

311
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,290
Please forgive me
for not informing you earlier.

312
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,940
Ding Yi is a good child.

313
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,530
Let me

314
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,020
see him off one last time.

315
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,570
Dear comrades,

316
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,530
farewell forever.

317
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,760
[Sasaki, Colonel of MSS]

318
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,740
This is

319
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,980
a sakura sapling

320
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,330
I brought from Tokyo.

321
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,220
They all say

322
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,530
that Japanese cherry blossoms

323
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,530
cannot survive

324
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,570
on Chinese soil.

325
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,460
But I don't believe it.

326
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,050
I think

327
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,700
as long as we find the right method,

328
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,980
Japanese cherry blossoms

329
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,290
can also bloom beautifully
on Chinese land.

330
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,050
It's my incompetence.

331
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,330
Before I take my own life,

332
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,050
I have only one request.

333
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,020
Takeda,

334
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,530
what mistake did you make?

335
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,740
It was my negligence at work

336
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,050
that led to Joseph Lee's code
being leaked.

337
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,530
I must take responsibility
for the failure

338
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,980
in the intelligence war.

339
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,500
That's true.

340
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,810
A unit professionally trained
in intelligence

341
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,290
spent a huge amount

342
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,090
to develop a code system.

343
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,770
But in the end,

344
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,090
it came to nothing.

345
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,810
I'm sorry, Colonel.

346
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,330
It's my incompetence.

347
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:11,050
I'm willing to atone with my life.

348
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,740
Takeda.

349
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,330
A samurai's dignity is only for show.

350
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,330
Killing you

351
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,460
will not recover the losses
already caused.

352
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,700
Death is easy,

353
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,530
but what you need to do now

354
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,530
is to make amends.

355
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,290
I've always suspected

356
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,050
that Joseph Lee had a problem.

357
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:09,530
But he claimed to be
the foster son of Grand Duke Tonoji.

358
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:17,740
He has a photo
of the Grand Duke holding him.

359
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,530
Because of this identity,

360
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:25,980
I didn't dare to detain
and interrogate him rashly.

361
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,500
Joseph Lee's father

362
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,530
once served

363
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,220
as Grand Duke Tonoji's math teacher.

364
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,290
I checked it

365
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,980
when Grand Duke

366
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,330
recommended him.

367
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,050
As for the foster son matter...

368
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,940
Colonel, you mean...

369
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,290
If you're concerned about this identity,

370
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,740
then just find someone unaffected by it.

371
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:16,220
China has no emperor.

372
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,770
These people fight their own battles.

373
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,500
Each of them

374
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,330
has their own
little secrets and schemes.

375
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,500
Dealing with them requires skills.

376
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,980
We must learn to use the Chinese ways
to control the Chinese.

377
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:45,220
Make good use of these Chinese friends.

378
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,330
You mean, let the Chinese
investigate the Chinese?

379
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,570
As they themselves say,

380
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,500
"Sit back and watch the tigers fight."

381
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,290
Sit back and watch the tigers fight.

382
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,530
Once the code is changed,

383
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,460
Baimahu will definitely be safe, right?

384
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,290
It will be safe.

385
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,570
Have you eaten?

386
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,420
Shall I get you some breakfast?

387
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,090
Don't bother.

388
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,980
None of us know the true relationship

389
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,330
between Grand Duke Tonoji
and Joseph Lee.

390
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,810
I worry that your bluff

391
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,260
will be exposed before long.

392
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,330
So I arranged tonight's ship

393
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,330
to send you to China Hong Kong.

394
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,290
There will also be people going
to Baimahu to get your mother.

395
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,700
You'll reunite in China Hong Kong.

396
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,980
So it ends here.

397
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,530
The play's over.

398
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,810
The people should be dispersed.

399
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,460
What's wrong? Unhappy?

400
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,090
I'm not unhappy.

401
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,740
I'm happy.

402
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,460
There maybe

403
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,460
an even bigger stage waiting for me.

404
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,770
Here, this is your passport.

405
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,530
Keep it safe.

406
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,260
The money is all in the trunk.

407
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,700
It should be enough for you
to live well for some time.

408
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,770
Also, I wish that on this new stage,

409
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,530
you'll get to play the role you desire.

410
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,330
Where are you going?

411
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,530
Chaosheng Theatre.

412
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,740
To say goodbye to everyone.

413
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,530
The organization has already agreed

414
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,980
to let the troupe members
evacuate first.

415
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,700
Good.

416
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,330
I've already spoken to everyone.

417
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,940
Tomorrow, under the excuse of a tour,

418
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,290
we'll send them
to the countryside to hide for a while.

419
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,940
They'll come back
once the danger has passed.

420
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,050
Where are you going?

421
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,700
To Chaosheng Theatre, to thank Ms. Xian.

422
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,090
This time we made a great success.

423
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,330
Those Japanese

424
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,530
and the BIS

425
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,810
will surely keep an eye on us.

426
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,810
Before trouble comes knocking,

427
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,460
we'll leave right after
tonight's performance.

428
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,730
Biyun.

429
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,860
I understand how you feel.

430
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,690
After all, you founded
this troupe yourself.

431
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,980
You don't want to see it
destroyed in your hands.

432
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,340
But,

433
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,300
ever since we agreed to help Ding Yi,

434
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,050
you should've been prepared for this.

435
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:33,820
Besides,

436
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,570
as long as we protect our members,

437
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,460
one day

438
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,050
we'll form a new troupe.

439
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,730
The foreigners are all evacuating.

440
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,340
The Concession
is getting more dangerous.

441
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,340
We have a base near Kunshan.

442
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,780
It should ensure everyone's safety.

443
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,780
Go pick up Ding Yi.

444
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,380
Have him withdraw with the troupe.

445
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,130
Also,

446
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,340
Hongyu's Party membership application

447
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,340
can be put on the agenda.

448
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,340
Alright.

449
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,340
Biyun.

450
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,730
You are...

451
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,940
Why's it so lively?

452
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,730
Ms. Xian Biyun is here, right?

453
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,780
Who is this woman?

454
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,300
Ye Yin.

455
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,130
Ye Yin?

456
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,380
I know her.

457
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,690
She is the wife of Liang Jingyuan
from Suzhou BIS.

458
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,460
Mr. Takeda.

459
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,530
What did the Colonel say?

460
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,420
Liang Jingyuan's wife, Ye Yin
from Suzhou BIS,

461
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,570
indirectly hinted to us

462
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,610
that the code might have been leaked.

463
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,130
Did you question her
about the source of her information?

464
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,980
It was the same story as Joseph Lee's.

465
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,500
She also heard it from the British.

466
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,570
At Director William's farewell banquet,

467
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,690
I used her

468
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,730
to leak the news to the Japanese

469
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,730
that Joseph Lee's code
had been compromised.

470
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,500
I've heard that

471
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,380
the code Joseph Lee designed
for the Japanese

472
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,980
has already been leaked to the British.

473
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,050
Really?

474
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,340
So I thought,

475
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,820
if you could promptly pass this news

476
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,610
to Chairman Wang,

477
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,690
maybe

478
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,500
Liang will be sent back.

479
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,420
That's a good idea.

480
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,130
Many years ago,
I saved Liang Jingyuan's life,

481
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,860
but he never knew my real identity.

482
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,300
Judging by things now,

483
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,210
it's likely he'll be placed in
the Special Agent Headquarters.

484
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,460
Maybe getting close to Ye Yin

485
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,210
will be a good chance
to get intelligence.

486
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:03,820
Isn't Xian Biyun very close
with the British?

487
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,500
Ever since Joseph Lee
went to Chaosheng Theatre that night,

488
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,690
things started getting strange.

489
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,340
I should have investigated earlier.

490
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,940
But if we investigate her,

491
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,500
will Mr. Lee allow it?

492
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,050
We can have the police station
in the Concession

493
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,820
investigate Chaosheng Troupe.

494
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,610
As for Xian Biyun herself...

495
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,050
Wait.

496
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,610
Hasn't Liang Jingyuan

497
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,130
always wanted a position

498
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,130
in our new government?

499
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,210
Tell his wife that
if this matter is clarified,

500
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,610
I will give him a satisfactory position.

501
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,420
Yes.

502
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,940
Ms. Xian, your guest has arrived.

503
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,500
Biyun.

504
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,420
Take this.

505
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,050
Alright.

506
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,500
Mrs. Liang, you shouldn't have

507
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,570
brought so many gifts.

508
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,050
It's only right.

509
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,650
Such a big movie star like you

510
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,980
is still doing your own bookkeeping?

511
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,980
So many accounts to balance.

512
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,250
If you don't keep
the accounts straight,

513
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,570
who'll feed all these people?

514
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,130
This is my first time
visiting the troupe.

515
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,530
It's quite interesting.

516
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,020
And you really have this place

517
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,460
set up well.

518
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,250
What's got you so happy?

519
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,090
Come inside and talk.

520
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:34,500
Sit.

521
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,650
I came here specifically to thank you.

522
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,090
Remember the Japanese

523
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,250
code leak?

524
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,610
When I told the Japanese,

525
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,860
they didn't believe it.

526
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,610
They said,

527
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,460
"Our code has
the highest level of secrecy,

528
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,690
so it's impossible for it to leak."

529
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,570
They made a fool of themselves.

530
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,460
But,

531
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,940
how did you hear from the British

532
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,380
such confidential information?

533
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,500
Look at the way you're asking.

534
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,460
It's like our two families
both sell medicine,

535
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,530
but you insist on asking
for our secret recipe.

536
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,860
Is that appropriate?

537
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,020
Liang said the same thing.

538
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,420
But we know what to do.

539
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,170
When the Japanese asked,

540
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,900
we just said it came from the British.

541
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,050
Didn't mention you at all.

542
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,900
Oh, there's another reason I came today.

543
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,020
I've been away
from Shanghai for so long,

544
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,570
I don't know what's trending

545
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,860
here now.

546
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,130
Do you have time today?

547
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,380
Come with me for a stroll.

548
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,340
I can't today.

549
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,130
Look at all these accounts
I have to settle.

550
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,130
I can't even finish them.

551
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,090
I do bookkeeping too.

552
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,340
One more day won't hurt.

553
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,020
Stop that.

554
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,530
Next time.

555
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,340
Next time I'll go shopping with you.

556
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,980
There won't be a next time.

557
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,380
Liang is coming back to Shanghai.

558
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,050
