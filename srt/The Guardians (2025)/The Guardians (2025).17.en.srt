3
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,260
Dr. Meng, be careful.

4
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,980
Give me the medicine box.

5
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,820
How is Mr. Lee?

6
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,180
Mr. Lee is not looking optimistic.

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,460
He's taken all the medicine he should,

8
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,740
but is still complaining of a headache.

9
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,660
Please check on him.

10
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,980
Alright.

11
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,100
Here, this way, please.

12
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,980
Please.

13
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,220
She's here.

14
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,100
Dr. Meng.

Yin.

16
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,100
Let's not go upstairs.

17
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,820
Just let Charlie assist Dr. Meng.

18
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,340
Watch your step, slowly.

19
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,540
Right, let's not
disturb their treatment.

20
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,380
Right side, right side.

21
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,500
Let's rest a bit more.

22
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,220
Alright.

23
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,100
Don't worry, the doctor is here.

24
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,980
How could he suddenly
be in so much pain?

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,100
Please examine

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,540
what's going on with Mr. Lee.

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,540
Mr. Lee.

28
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,820
We meet again.

29
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,380
Oh my god!

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,500
Oh my god!

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,980
Meng Jie, I'm sorry

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,260
to call you over so late.

33
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,260
Actually, I need your help.

34
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,940
Why are there so many people here?

35
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,410
What happened?

36
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,380
So many people in this room.

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,340
It's lively.

38
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,570
Director Liang, what's going on?

39
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,380
Inspector Li.

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,100
It's getting late.

41
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,260
Why don't you go back first?

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,260
I still have things to attend to here.

43
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,540
No rush, Mrs. Liang.

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,500
Let me see if I can
help you with anything.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,540

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,820
My lifesaver.

47
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,500
You came without a word.

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,660
I would've prepared
wine and food for you.

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,980
Long time no see,

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,540

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,380
Madam.

52
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,500
Earlier, Mr. Lee and I were taken
by the Anti-Traitor Squad.

53
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,820
It was all thanks to Inspector Li

54
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,380
that we were rescued.

55
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,540
This is

56
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,660
the one Mr. Lee often mentioned to you,

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,980
his lifesaver, Li Boyao,

58
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,980
Inspector Li.

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,580
You flatter me.

60
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,340
So you are Inspector Li.

61
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,220
Joseph mentioned things

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,100
from the past to me.

63
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,020
Thank you for saving his life.

64
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,100
It's rare that Mr. Lee still remembers.

65
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,780
I thought after he became successful,

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,980
he would have forgotten me.

67
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,780
I know you, Ms. Xian.

How is Joseph?

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,780
Madam, please don't worry.

74
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,340
Fortunately,

75
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,340
Dr. Meng arrived in time

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,340
and stabilized Mr. Lee's condition.

77
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,980
I also feared you would
be overly worried,

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,340
so I came downstairs
to tell you the good news.

79
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,100
He's fine now.

80
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,980
Thank goodness.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,980
Thank goodness.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,020
It's good that he's fine.

83
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,460
Biyun, the doctor said he's fine.

84
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,460
Don't worry anymore.

85
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,460
Since Mr. Lee is fine now,

86
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,700
I'm relieved.

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,220
Then we'll head back first.

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,100
All esteemed experts, please stay.

Today,

90
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,460
I specially brought cigarettes

91
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,580
for you to try.

92
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,460
These are London-produced Marlboros.

93

Authentic British goods.

94

these cigarettes in Shanghai

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,340

98
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,780
to get a batch.

99
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,580
Mr. Expert,

100
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,340
please try one.

101
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,980
Try one.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,340
It's not easy to smoke

this kind of cigarette now.

104
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,980
You can't buy it even with money.

105

Come, you all try it.

106

As the saying goes,

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,460
a man who doesn't smoke
lives a pointless life,

108
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,220
and a woman who doesn't smoke
wastes her time on earth.

109

It's alright.

Even if you don't smoke, it's fine.

You could say I have all kinds of stuff.

canned goods, chocolate,

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,980
Mr. Lee's condition
is temporarily under control.

194
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,740
She wants to stay
and monitor him for the night

195
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,860
and leave after his condition
is completely stable.

196
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,020
Dr. Meng is indeed thoughtful.

197
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,340
With her here,

198
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,140
I'm at ease.

199
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,020
Yes.

200
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,140
Since Joseph is fine now,

201
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,620
everyone go back to rest.

202
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,020
I feel bad about

203
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,620
troubling you all so late.

204
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,620
Mrs. Lee, you're too kind.

205
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,140
We are all neighbors.

206
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,740
A close neighbor is better
than a distant relative.

207
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,220
If you need anything, just say the word.

208
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,620
I thank everyone on Joseph's behalf.

209
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,260
Thank you, Director Liang.

210
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,860
Alright, everyone.

211
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,620
Since Director Lee
is no longer in serious condition,

212
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,380
and has Dr. Meng Jie by his side,

213
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,380
you should go back to rest early.

214
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,890
Alright then, farewell for now.

215
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,620
Farewell.

216
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,740
He's fine.

217
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,890
Alright, Biyun.

218
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,620
I'm leaving too.

219
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,260
Alright.

220
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,620
Director Liang, you

221
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,380
have any further instructions?

222
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,140
If Director Lee has any further issues,

223
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,620
you can inform me in advance.

224
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,740
Rules are rigid,

225
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,140
but people are flexible.

226
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,890
Please rest assured, Director Liang.

227
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,380
If Mr. Lee has
any matters in the future,

228
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,890
I will report to you immediately.

229
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,620
Alright, Liang.

230
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,380
Go home now.

231
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,890
Take care, Director Liang.

232
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,740
Take care, Director Liang.

233
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,340
Close the door.

234
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,340
Thank you.

235
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,340
Thanks.

236
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,260
Why is he here?

237
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,340
He came to deliver
a message for Luo Han.

238
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,260
Him?

239
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,140
Yes.

240
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,620
Don't you forget

241
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,740
he knows everything.

242
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,740
He won't betray us, will he?

243
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,020
No, he won't.

244
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,340
If he betrays us,

245
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,260
he won't get a single penny
from the Japanese.

246
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,100
But if he keeps us,

247
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,500
it's like having a cash cow.

248
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,020
I haven't even thanked you
for last time.

249
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,620
And tonight I've troubled you again.

250
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,260
You're welcome.

251
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,140
As long as I can help Shixian,

252
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,380
you can find me anytime.

253
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,380
Hearts

254
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,980
as

255
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,140
bait.

256
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,020
As.

257
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,500
Hearts.

258
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,740
Bait.

259
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,620
Hearts as bait.

260
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,740
Use hearts as bait.

261
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,140
What does that mean?

262
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,100
The bureau decided

263
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,890
to use the Hearts Code as bait

264
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,890
and continue sending messages
to lure the enemy.

265
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,340
So that means

266
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,380
we can decipher it now?

267
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,890
Yes.

268
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,500
That's great.

269
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,500
Meng Jie.

270
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,740
Thank you so much today.

271
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,850
But I have another request.

272
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,900
Shixian,

273
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,500
you don't have to be so formal with me.

274
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,610
Just tell me directly what you need.

275
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:19,900
Alright.

276
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,900
Is it convenient for you

277
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,260
to stay over at our place for the night?

278
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,370
This way Liang Jingyuan
will also believe

279
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,900
that Joseph Lee is truly ill.

280
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,500
You can leave tomorrow morning.

281
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,260
Is that okay?

282
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,610
Alright.

283
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,330
But I need to call home.

284
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,330
Thank you.

285
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,610
One gold bar?

286
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,370
Three

287
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,370
every month.

288
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,770
You'll pay me for a year.

289
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,900
Are you crazy?

290
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,130
What kind of revolution
are you fighting without money?

291
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,900
Get out of the car.

292
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,370
Get out of the car.

293
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,130
What are you doing?

294
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,660
In the 26th year of the ROC,

295
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,420
Director Dai personally
awarded me this medal.

296
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,370
It hasn't left me since then.

297
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,660
It's more important than my life.

298
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,610
You take it.

299
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,290
We can discuss about the money.

300
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,770
Can your useless junk

301
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,370
even melt into an ounce of gold?

302
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,900
What kind of trash it is.

303
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,050
You want me to risk my life
for you for this?

304
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,130
Take it away quickly.

305
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,050
Take it.

306
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,130
As long as you get my message in,

307
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,130
I'll find a way

308
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,130
to gather enough money
as soon as possible

309
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,610
to redeem my medal.

310
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,900
I'll keep my word.

311
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,050
I've noticed that people
in your line of work

312
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,980
are all quite good at acting.

313
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,090
Those two clowns tonight

314
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,220
made quite a ruckus.

315
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,980
My heart was pounding inside.

316
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,090
But Charlie didn't even bat an eyelid.

317
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,290
It was amazing.

318
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,260
More exciting than
"The Emperor and the Assassin".

319
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,290
If you people

320
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,460
use your intelligence

321
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,020
to make money,

322
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,980
you'd be rolling in it.

323
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,570
Why bother with revolution?

324
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,220
What exactly is going on inside?

325
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,610
That little punk

326
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,980
who's pretending to be Joseph Lee

327
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,290
used the excuse of being sick

328
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,570
and threw the entire Sanyangli

329
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,330
into utter chaos.

330
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,050
Liang Jingyuan even invited a doctor

331
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,460
to examine him.

332
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,980
It was at this critical moment

333
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,530
that I successfully passed
the message to Charlie.

334
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,260
Come here.

335
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,530
I need to tell you something.

336
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,530
What surprised me the most tonight

337
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,810
was that this little punk

338
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,220
is actually keeping
a big star, Xian Biyun.

339
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,850
You know Xian Biyun?

340
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,700
The big star.

341
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,460
How does that even make sense?

342
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,900
This is the intelligence
Gu Yangshan asked me to bring to you.

343
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,290
Why did you just take it?

344
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,940
We're doing business here, friend.

345
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,420
You told me before

346
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,660
to send messages inside.

347
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,370
Now I'm bringing intelligence
out for you.

348
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,090
For friendship's sake,

349
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,700
I'll charge you three more
gold bars a month.

350
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,610
That's a total of
six gold bars per month

351
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,940
for one year.

352
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,980
Time was short,
I couldn't gather that much.

353
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,770
I still owe you four gold bars.

354
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,020
Give me a few more days.

355
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,290
I've come to realize

356
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,050
you're really dishonest.

357
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,180
I'm giving you one last chance.

358
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,700
Just three days.

359
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:32,770
Okay.

360
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,810
I promise you.

361
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,700
Working with you

362
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,770
is very unpleasant.

363
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,600
[Enemy wants to break Hearts]

364
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,260
Dr. Meng, thank you for last night.

365
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,460
Once Joseph recovers,

366
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,220
we will definitely visit you
to express our gratitude.

367
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,530
Right.

368
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,940
Great kindness
needs no verbal thanks.

369
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,770
If there's ever a time you need my help,

370
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,530
just tell me.

371
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,940
Mr. Lee, Ms. Xian.

372
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,940
You don't have to be so polite.

373
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,570
Treating patients

374
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,290
is a doctor's duty.

375
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,220
Also,

376
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,290
Mr. Lee's condition is not very stable.

377
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,770
He needs regular check-ups.

378
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,940
If you need anything, just call me.

379
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,770
Alright.

380
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,020
Charlie, this is my home phone number.

381
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,290
If you can't find me at the hospital,

382
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,460
call this number.

383
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,420
Alright.

384
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,420
I'll be going now.

385
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,020
Thank you, Dr. Meng.

386
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:17,770
Thank you.

387
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,740
Let's go.

388
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,500
This day

389
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,020
was so unsettling.

390
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,530
What are you doing?

391
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,530
What's your hurry?

392
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,290
Slow down.

393
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,290
Slow down, slow down.

394
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,460
What's the rush?

395
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,500
Wait for me.

396
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,050
Here.

397
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,500
What's this?

398
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,530
The Hearts Code.

399
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,290
You deciphered it all so quickly?

400
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,940
Actually, after returning
to Shanghai BIS,

401
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,290
I've been using the Hearts Code

402
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,570
to communicate with my superiors.

403
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,940
I also participated
in its latest calculations.

404
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,530
This is all the information I know.

405
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,460
I've already organized it overnight.

406
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,570
But there's still a part

407
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,460
I need to decipher the code
based on the existing intelligence.

408
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,740
I'll give it to you later.

409
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,220
This

410
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,220
is the ten ciphers
Liang Jingyuan gave us last time.

411
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,460
I've deciphered them too.

412
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,770
Tomorrow you just need
to hand this book

413
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,810
to him.

414
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,530
But you still need to remember

415
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,290
every word of the Hearts Code

416
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,020
in case anything happens
tomorrow unexpectedly.

417
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,940
I don't think we need
to wait until tomorrow.

418
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,460
I can memorize it all tonight.

419
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,770
How about this.

420
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,460
Tonight, let's hand over
this deciphered result

421
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,060
to Liang Jingyuan.

422
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,060
No, this won't do.

423
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,980
I don't know Shen Wanqing's background.

424
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,980
But Yi Xiuyuan

425
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,850
is indeed one of the top

426
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,060
cryptography experts in the country.

427
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,330
If I met him before,

428
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,980
I would call him a senior.

429
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,540
But you pretended to be ill last night,

430
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,260
tossing and turning all night,

431
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,850
yet you managed to do

432
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,330
such a massive amount of calculations

433
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,780
and decipher it faster than them.

434
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,980
That's not realistic.

435
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,370
Who am I?

436
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,540
Joseph Lee.

437
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,810
What is Joseph Lee?

438
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,540
A genius.

439
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,300
Sometimes the things a genius does

440
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,570
are just not realistic.

441
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,090
If we actually

442
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,330
hand in the results

443
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,810
on the same day as them,

444
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,570
how would that show our ability?

445
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,330
How would we survive in Sanyangli later?

446
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,570
We need to give them
a display of our power.

447
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,610
Let them see
how formidable Joseph Lee is.

448
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,570
This way,

449
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,500
our sword can penetrate deeper.

450
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,810
But you also need to give me some time

451
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,500
to decipher the remaining parts.

452
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,570
That's true.

453
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,060
You're right.

454
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,850
If we're going to establish authority,

455
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,330
give me nine hours.

456
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,060
I'll decipher the remaining content.

457
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,780
You'll memorize all the content.

458
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,980
No problem.

459
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,610
However,

460
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,610
I still need to remind you.

461
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,060
Never let your guard down.

462
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,570
Do you know why Liang Jingyuan

463
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,810
would invite three groups of experts?

464
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,540
He doesn't understand codes at all.

465
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,810
The reason he invited
three groups of experts

466
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,780
is for balance

467
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,810
and mutual verification.

468
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,330
If one group resorts to deception,

469
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,060
the other two groups
will surely discover the problem.

470
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,330
Liang Jingyuan is a ruthless person.

471
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,980
He cares so much about the Hearts Code,

472
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,540
so when he says kill,

473
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,570
he definitely means
more than just words.

474
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,060
If we make one wrong move,

475
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,850
that will be an eternal damnation.

476
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,060
Don't worry.

477
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,980
Since I promised to help you,

478
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,570
I definitely won't hold you back.

479
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,540
I'm going to memorize it now.

480
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,610
Thank you.

481
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,260
Ms. Xian.

482
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,980
Thank you

483
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,500
for last night.

484
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,060
No need for thanks.

485
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,810
But there are some things

486
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,570
I think it's necessary to clarify.

487
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,330
It's true that I came here
to ensure Ding Yi's safety.

488
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,260
It's also true that
I have things I want to do.

489
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,540
I won't ask a single question

490
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,980
about what you're doing.

491
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,570
Likewise,

492
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,500
you shouldn't inquire about

493
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,500
what I do.

494
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,500
Let's not interfere with each other.

495
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,570
That would be best.

496
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,570
Now the three of us

497
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,370
live under the same roof.

498
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,780
I believe neither of us
wants to see Ding Yi

499
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,780
get harmed because of you or me.

500
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,220
I hope

501
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,540
from now on, before doing anything...

502
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,060
We'll give each other a heads-up.

503
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,370
Yesterday,

504
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,780
you made such a spectacle.

505
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,330
Will I still be able to do business

506
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,330
with Inspector Li?

507
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,220
Business and future,
which is more important?

508
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,300
Don't you know?

509
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,740
You kept checking

510
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,220
that pack of cigarettes yesterday.

511
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,370
Was there a problem?

512
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,500
Yes, there was.

513
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,570
What problem?

514
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,570
It was too strong.

515
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,060
Director Liang.

516
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,220
Has she been dropped off?

517
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,570
Yes, she has.

518
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,020
Didn't expect her home
to be the Meng's Residence.

519
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,020
The home of Meng Mingyi,
Director of the Health Agency?

520
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,500
Yes.

521
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,740
Let's go.

522
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,060
Meng Mingyi

523
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,330
is now a favorite of the Japanese.

524
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,060
Director Liang,

525
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,060
why don't you investigate him too?

526
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,300
9090, this is incorrect.

527
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,740
You need to clarify this.

528
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,060
Calculate it again.

529
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,810
How are you doing?

530
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,570
Mr. Lee, we've arrived.

531
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,810
Director Lee.

532
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,370
Director Lee.

533
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,610
Hello, Director Lee.

534
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,610
Hello, Director Lee.

535
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,810
Hello, everyone.

536
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,810
Please.

537
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,330
Please.

538
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,810
Director Lee, how are you now?

539
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,020
Director Lee.

540
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,330
How is the progress?

541
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,060
Based on the materials
Director Liang provided,

542
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,650
I have already

543
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,810
deciphered everything I could.

544
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,330
Plus that codebook,

545
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,570
I think we should be able to grasp

546
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,740
most of the intelligence
from this radio station.

547
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,060
You've finished such a large

548
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,570
amount of calculation?

549
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,810
It's embarrassing to say it.

550
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,810
If my headache
hadn't recurred last night,

551
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,810
I think I would have been able to

552
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,410
decipher it all

553
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,740
before 9 AM this morning.

554
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,330
I wasted a whole day of my time.

555
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,980
Director Liang.

556
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,570
Hello, Director Liang.

557
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,020
Hello, Director Liang.

558
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,570
Director Lee, why are you here?

559
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,810
Is your health better now?

560
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,570
Thank you for your concern,
Director Liang.

561
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,780
I'm here to submit
the deciphered results to you.

562
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,570
Director Liang, please take a look.

563
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,540
So fast?

564
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,090
As researchers of mathematics,

565
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,500
the most important thing

566
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,570
is rigor.

567
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,690
Of course,

568

Mr. Lee is a member
of the Tonoji family,

it's pretty common to split them
into simpler parts.
