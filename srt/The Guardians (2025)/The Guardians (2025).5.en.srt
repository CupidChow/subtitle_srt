[Episode 5]

3
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,260
Mr. Lee,

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm very sorry.

5
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,460
Mr. Takeda wants to see you.

6
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,620
Mrs,

7
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,380
I apologize for the trouble.

8
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,180
Mr. Lee, can I help you?

9
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,380
No, ma'am. But I appreciate it.

10
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,450
Charlie.

11
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,380
Yes, sir.

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,170
My clothes.

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,100
Yes.

14
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,850
Step back!

15
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,380
Mr. Takeda is waiting for you. Please.

16
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,690
Glad you made it, Mr. Lee.

17
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,410
It's good to see you're safe.

18
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,780
You left Metropolitan Hotel
without notice.

19
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,820
We didn't know
you visited William's Residence.

20
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,540
We worried someone might harm you,

21
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,260
so we've been looking for you.

22
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,780
Sorry about what happened tonight.

23
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,340
I didn't manage my team well.

24
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,540
My apologies, Mr. Lee.

25
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,820
I'll do anything

26
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,540
to fix my mistake.

27
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,340
I never speak with disrespectful people.

28
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,250
Just talking gets us nowhere.

29
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,460
What are you doing?

30
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,730
Are you okay?
You scared me.

31
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,170
Blind eyes can't see,

32
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,140
but their remaining senses:

33
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,580
Sound, smell, taste, and touch,

34
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,250
become sharper than most.

35
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,340
But for sudden attacks,

36
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,340
there's no way to dodge them.

37
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,140
So just now, your reaction

38
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,140
gave away your position.

39
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,250
Takeda never acts
like that with Joseph Lee.

40
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,810
He wouldn't dare.

41
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,540
He didn't dare before.

42
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,100
He'll definitely dare now.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,810
What do you mean?

44
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,780
Counting from Joseph Lee's death,

45
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,340
he's been gone from
Takeda's sight for three days.

46
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,780
Takeda will definitely get suspicious.

47
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,780
He'll try all sorts of ways to test you.

48
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,780
Mr. Lee,

49
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,340
I've apologized to you for Kondo.

50
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,580
But you still won't forgive him.

51
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,220
Are you still willing

52
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,780
to keep working with us?

53
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,460
Excuse me, sir.

54
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,220
The Japanese kidnapped

55
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,340
Mr. William's guest.

56
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,220
Could you stop them

57
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,980
before they leave?

58
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,540
Let me say this again.

59
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,370
I

60
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,100
never talk to people who disrespect me.

61
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,900
Mr. Takeda,

62
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,810
if what you're doing

63
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,340
works on me,

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,020
do you think

65
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,220
I'd still be sitting here?

66
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,930
Guns still have their place.

67
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,580
At least, you're willing to talk now,

68
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,660
right?

69
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,250
If you see the current situation

70
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,540
as some kind of conversation,

71
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,980
then honestly, we really

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,250
have nothing left to discuss.

73
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,340
Thank you, Mr. Takeda.

74
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,900
I think our cooperation

75
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,370
really should end here.

76
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,900
I got it.

77
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,340
This is the Public Concession.

78
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,850
Please hand over Mr. William's guests.

79
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,580
Step aside.

80
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,170
Get out of the way!

81
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,900
Don't worry. Please calm down.

82
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,930
We're friends,

83
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:23,850
okay?

84
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,370
Mr. Lee,

85
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,540
there's no need to be afraid.

86
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,900
I just had Kondo executed.

87
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,370
This is my way of apologizing.

88
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,900
I hope you'll reconsider

89
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,370
working with the MSS.

90
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,730
I did it because he failed his job.

91
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,340
He shamed the Empire of Japan

92
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,610
in front of everyone.

93
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,220
He wasn't fit to be
a Japanese soldier anymore.

94
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,100
Mr. Lee,

95
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,420
I think I've shown my sincerity.

96
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,180
Tomorrow night,

97
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,100
I'll host a dinner
at the Metropolitan Hotel.

98
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,100
I'll give you a formal apology.

99
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,420
Let's start our new partnership.

100
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,730
I'm sure, Mr. Lee,

101
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,100
you won't skip it, right?

102
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,940
Let's go.

103
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,850
Yes.

104
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,180
Tomorrow night,

105
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,180
at the Metropolitan Hotel.

106
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,610
Takeda wants to host a dinner.

107
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,420
Get in the car first.

108
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,300
Biyun?

109
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,980
What are you looking at?

110
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,460
You seem lost in thought.

111
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,730
A life lost.

112
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,580
I'm not that brave.

113
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,980
Don't scare me, alright?

114
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,610
Didn't you just say

115
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,890
you had news for Chairman Wang?

116
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,580
What is it?

117
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,610
Uncle Gu.

118
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,300
Come on.

119
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,610
Mind your step.

120
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,460
Uncle Gu.

121
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,610
Please help him inside first.

122
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,340
Ms. Xian, is something wrong?

123
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,340
He almost got shot
by Takeda in the first mission.

124
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,460
So this was your plan all along?

125
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,700
Ms. Xian, you know exactly

126
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,060
what happened today was an accident.

127
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,460
It's honestly
a miracle Ding Yi survived.

128
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,460
Thanks for your help, Ms. Xian.

129
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,580
But let's be clear about one thing.

130
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,980
Once we leave the Chaosheng Theatre,

131
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,980
it's just

132
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,300
between Ding Yi and me.

133
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,850
So

134
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,180
you're really risking his life on this.

135
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,850
If this is your work plan,

136
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,580
he might as well go home.

137
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,530
Ms. Xian, have you never taken a risk

138
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,460
in your work before?

139
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,820
Ms. Xian,

140
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,580
I can only promise you one thing.

141
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,250
If a gun points at him again,

142
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,770
I'll still step in front of him.

143
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,370
If there's nothing else, Ms. Xian,

144
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,890
you can leave now.

145
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,730
So you're saying Ding Yi really

146
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,820
passed out drunk?

147
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,250
Yeah, totally out of it.

148
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,580
Got it.

149
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,010
Tomorrow's plan
at Takeda's dinner is off.

150
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,850
I can't agree to that.

151
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,850
Me neither.

152
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,100
Ding Yi,

153
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,490
even with his talent,

154
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,180
has never really had

155
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,340
proper training in math.

156
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,850
He'll slip up

157
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,700
someday for sure.

158
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,740
Besides,

159
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,530
he's basically just a street guy,

160
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,530
not cut out to be

161
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,620
an intelligence officer.

162
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,650
Today's events made that clear.

163
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,860
This mission we planned

164
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,890
turned out to be a complete joke.

165
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,620
I think I explained clearly to you both

166
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,100
what happened tonight.

167
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,890
For today's mission,

168
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,100
Ding Yi pulled it off perfectly.

169
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,380
He didn't blow his cover at all,

170
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,530
and even set Takeda up

171
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,860
to take out a Japanese code-breaker.

172
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,650
Young Master,

173
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,650
you've had proper intelligence training,

174
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,890
so you should know

175
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,770
one key rule in intelligence work

176
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,980
is never to count on
luck or coincidence.

177
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,460
But let me tell you something too,

178
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,650
what happened today

179
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,530
once again proves

180
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,100
he has the ability to adapt on the spot,

181
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,170
which is what it takes to be an agent.

182
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,140
Yangshan.

183
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,460
Before this operation began,

184
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,650
what did you promise me?

185
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,380
Back then, I promised you,

186
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,530
we'd use Takeda's trust in Joseph Lee,

187
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,340
then tell him the cipher was leaked

188
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,020
and have it changed.

189
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,340
Tomorrow is the most crucial step.

190
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,620
That's not what I meant.

191
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,380
I meant even if the plan fails,

192
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,100
we'd only lose one person.

193
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,650
Just a background actor in the troupe.

194
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,890
There'd be no real loss for us.

195
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,770
But what about now?

196
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,530
There'd still be no real loss.

197
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,890
The plan won't fail, no one will die.

198
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,220
Plus, he doesn't know who you are

199
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,980
nor who I am,

200
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,890
and has no clue where the stronghold is.

201
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,650
Even if he's interrogated,

202
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,890
what could he possibly reveal?

203
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,650
But let me say this,

204
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,460
you're acting as his assistant,

205
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,860
working with him side by side.

206
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,770
He's so drunk today,

207
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,340
what if something goes wrong?

208
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,100
You could end up dragged in too!

209
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,770
How could I ever face your father?

210
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,220
Yangshan,

211
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,340
Commander Gu was my old boss.

212
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,340
He's always looked out for me.

213
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,890
He trusted me to take care of you.

214
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,100
If something happened to you,

215
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,620
I'd have no way to face your father.

216
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,650
How about this,

217
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,380
I'll file a report with Chongqing.

218
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,890
For all the consequences of
these matters and actions,

219
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,530
I'll take them on alone,

220
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,530
life or death.

221
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,620
If you still don't trust me,

222
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,980
wait till sunrise.

223
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,570
I'll explain to my dad myself, okay?

224
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,450
No need, you don't have to explain.

225
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,860
You're the only heir of the Gu family.

226
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,450
Just you, the single branch.

227
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,300
Your dad won't let you take that risk.

228
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,650
That's between me and my dad.

229
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,890
Please don't worry about it.

230
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,380
Just focus on mending your socks.

231
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,770
Young man, you don't get it.

232
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,900
Big things require breaking rules.

233
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,090
Ding Yi.

234
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:37,940
Ding Yi.

235
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:36,850
What now?

236
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,420
You still think I'll run off?

237
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,020
Sir, two more bowls of noodles.

238
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,220
Got it.

239
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,020
In my whole life,

240
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,940
I've never been that scared before.

241
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,460
I was so scared I nearly wet myself.

242
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,420
About what happened last night,

243
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,810
I kept thinking about my biggest regret.

244
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,700
I should've just eaten

245
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,420
that bowl of Yangchun noodles
you gave me.

246
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,460
Even if it was my last meal,

247
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,330
I'd rather go out with a full stomach.

248
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,260
No matter how big the problem is,

249
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,740
nothing beats having a good meal.

250
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,260
Noodles are here.

251
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,810
Here you go.

252
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,330
Try it.

253
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,900
It's better than that snail you picked.

254
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,050
You know, I've noticed something.

255
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,370
Whenever I'm around you,

256
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,980
nothing ever goes smoothly.

257
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,500
Why are you staring at me like that?

258
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,020
It's not like I'm doing this for you.

259
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,740
I'm doing it for my mom.

260
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,260
Yeah, that's right.

261
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,940
As his teacher,

262
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,500
I really can't handle him.

263
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,220
You're his father.

264
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,940
You should really talk to him.

265
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,940
Yes, yes.

266
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,530
He's here. I'll put him on.

267
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,090
Alright.

268
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,940
Here, your dad wants you.

269
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,090
Dad.

270
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,260
[Gu Zhengze, Deputy Commander of Chongqing Garrison Command]
Yuanzhong told me the plan.

271
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,810
How confident are you in it?

272
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,570
To be honest,

273
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,940
time's tight, so less than ten percent.

274
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,940
Soldiers in battle

275
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,220
can't rely on luck.

276
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,420
But,

277
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,220
are you always certain to win

278
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,740
every time you go to the battlefield?

279
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,980
Honestly, I've thought about this a lot.

280
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,740
This is our only shot

281
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,740
to cracking Joseph Lee's cipher.

282
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,420
If we win,

283
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,090
we can win battles in Northern Jiangsu.

284
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:27,810
If we lose...

285
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,980
If things go wrong,

286
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,570
this might be the last time

287
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,610
I ever get to call you.

288
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,220
Yuanzhong told me

289
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,980
you got hurt.

290
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,940
Dad,

291
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,050
just a small injury. How's your stomach?

292
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,420
It's much better now.

293
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,460
You still need to take your medicine.

294
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,330
You always tough it out when you're ill.

295
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,330
Isn't that just not wanting to age?

296
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,660
Dad,

297
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,460
I'm sorry I haven't been a good son.

298
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,570
I've been back for a while,

299
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,530
but I still haven't visited you.

300
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,850
It's hard to balance duty and family.

301
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,770
Since we were kids, you taught us

302
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,260
to lead by example.

303
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,290
So if I can do something now

304
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,330
to help battles in Northern Jiangsu

305
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,500
and to save thousands of lives,

306
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,260
I think you'll understand my choice.

307
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,940
I do.

308
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,850
When the job is done,

309
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,570
drop by home and see us.

310
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,700
I will.

311
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,980
By then, I believe,

312
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,530
more than just me will come home.

313
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,220
Good.

314
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,500
What does Commander Gu say?

315
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,810
Yangshan, let's hear your plan.

316
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,090
Like I mentioned earlier,

317
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,810
Japan Air Force Unit 153

318
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,980
was among the first

319
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,810
using Joseph's cipher.

320
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,220
We can't break their encrypted messages,

321
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,460
so we have no clue at all

322
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,020
when their next air raid will be

323
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,460
or what the target is.

324
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,940
You want Ding Yi to trick Takeda,

325
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,460
but Ding Yi isn't Joseph Lee.

326
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,940
He doesn't even know the cipher system

327
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,460
or the basic algorithm.

328
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,940
He doesn't need to know any of that,

329
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,020
but I do.

330
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,220
Mr. Cao,

331
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,660
I need your support.

332
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,570
How am I supposed to help?

333
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,700
Tonight, I'll have Ding Yi talk Takeda

334
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,810
into using Joseph's cipher to send

335
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,260
a message to the Japan Air Force.

336
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,420
Saying there's an air raid tonight.

337
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,090
To protect the info, Takeda

338
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,700
will only mobilize Air Force Unit 153

339
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,260
he can coordinate.

340
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,220
And the mission of Unit 153

341
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,500
is bombing Northern Jiangsu.

342
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,940
The one stationed there

343
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,260
is the Nationalist Army 405th Battalion.

344
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,700
So as long as the 405th Battalion

345
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,020
triggers the air raid siren

346
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,940
after the telegram is sent,

347
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,570
then,

348
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,180
to the Japanese,

349
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,220
Joseph Lee's cipher
won't be safe anymore.

350
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,300
It's already nine thirty in the morning.

351
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,780
Even if it's just an emergency report,
I still need to convince

352
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,740
the Commander-in-Chief of
the Lu-Su War Zone.

353
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,780
If we follow the proper process,

354
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,700
there might be issues...

355
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,740
Absolutely not.

356
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,090
Mr. Cao, about this operation's details,

357
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,980
not a word can leak out.

358
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,570
What did you say?

359
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,850
Eleven Shanghai liaison points
were wiped out.

360
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,540
How did our intel get out?

361
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,980
None of us knows anything now.

362
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,780
That's why this time,

363
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,570
we have to keep things quiet inside.

364
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,780
It's absurd.

365
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:53,980
Mr. Cao,

366
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,500
as far as I know,

367
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,500
the Commander-in-Chief
of Su-Lu-Wan Border,

368
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,850
Li Mingyang,

369
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,020
is an old friend of yours.

370
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,500
The 405th Battalion reports
directly to him.

371
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,540
So if you're willing,

372
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,060
no need to report up to Chongqing.

373
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,370
You crafty rascal,

374
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,300
always finding loopholes.

375
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,540
Now you're scheming against me.

376
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,260
Mr. Cao,

377
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,090
for you, it's just a phone call,

378
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,570
but for the people in Northern Jiangsu,

379
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,020
it's a matter of life and death.

380
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,980
Commissioner Luo.

381
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,060
Do you think he's just messing around?

382
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,850
It's worth a try.

383
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,060
It's worth a try.

384
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,740
What?

385
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,130
I agree, no one outside this room

386
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,260
should know.

387
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,540
Commissioner Luo,

388
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,780
did you forget what you said before?

389
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,060
I didn't.

390
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,980
Honestly, I still think this is risky.

391
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,410
But,

392
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,540
if it works,

393
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,980
it could help us win.

394
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,980
I promise to see it through.

395
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,810
I'll back you up, Gu Yangshan,

396
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,940
anything you need.

397
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,890
I just wanted to test your resolve.

398
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,130
Alright, I'm in.

399
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,220
As for Chief Commander Li,

400
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,020
I'll go talk to him myself.

401
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,300
Well,

402
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,740
thank you on behalf of all.

403
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,610
Really, thank you, Mr. Cao.

404
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,610
Is this really your place?

405
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,300
Come on, give me a hand.

406
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,700
Yangshan,

407
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,850
will you be back when the flowers bloom?

408
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,020
Let's go.

409
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,060
Chief Cao,

410
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,540
it's getting late, time to head out.

411
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,020
No rush, it's still early.

412
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,220
Taizhou's pretty far from here.

413
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,940
Even driving fast,
it'll take half a day.

414
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,090
Chief Cao.

415
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,330
Or did you never plan

416
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,370
on going in the first place?

417
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,740
Ding Yi.

418
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,090
What are you doing?

419
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,500
You just barge in without knocking.

420
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,460
You scared me half to death.

421
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,810
Time to get up now.

422
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,130
Young Master is waiting downstairs.

423
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,570
Alright, just give me five more minutes.

424
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,500
No manners, sneaking in while I shower.

425
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,250
Yangshan,

426
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,610
will you be back when the flowers bloom?

427
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,540
Young Master.

428
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,940
Ding Yi has memorized your instructions.

429
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,940
Just waiting for you to check it out.

430
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,250
Thank you, Uncle Gu.

431
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,940
Have you reached out to the Bureau?

432
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,980
I called three times, nobody picked up.

433
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,570
Maybe they're still out.

434
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,210
No answer at all?

435
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,770
If Chief Commander Li does me the favor

436
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,090
and has the air raid siren set off,

437
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,940
or even retreat,

438
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,380
and the Japanese planes don't show up,

439
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,250
the higher-ups will blame someone.

440
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,730
Do you think they'll put the blame

441
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,130
on me or on him?

442
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,820
If you don't want to go, why agree?

443
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,650
Him?

444
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:46,210
He's a spoiled heir from the Gu family.

445
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,690
Really naive.

446
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,860
If I turn him down to his face,

447
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,460
he'll just run off

448
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,730
and complain to his dad about me.

449
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,610
Why make trouble for myself?

450
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,290
If he wants to act, I'll play along.

451
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,690
But if he's heading into danger,

452
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,820
I won't go that far for him.

453
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,060
After all, I have family to care for.

454
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,060
Come in.

455
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,940
Mr. Cao, the car's ready.

456
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,690
Alright, I'm on my way.

457
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,340
If he asks about it later,

458
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,290
just say I've delivered the messages

459
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,020
but the car broke down halfway.

460
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,540
Before eight tonight,

461
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,820
I'll talk Takeda

462
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,340
into using Joseph Lee's cipher

463
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,130
to send a message to
the Japan Air Force.

464
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,130
Tell them to prep for an air raid.

465
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,500
At eight o'clock sharp,

466
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,980
you'll have the nearest 405th Battalion

467
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,290
set off the air raid alarm.

468
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,290
That'll trick Takeda,

469
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,020
making him think the cipher is leaked.

470
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,060
If...

471
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,820
If Takeda asks you,

472
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,290
how was Joseph Lee's cipher leaked,

473
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,940
what will you say?

474
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,170
I'll say Director William told me.

475
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,650
All my hard work went to waste.

476
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,460
So out of frustration,

477
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,420
I want to go back to the UK.

478
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,460
Wait,

479
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,420
what if Takeda checks

480
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,570
with Director William?

481
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,540
Wouldn't that give us away?

482
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:22,820
No, it won't.

483
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,460
Director William isn't well,

484
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,210
so he resigned from his job.

485
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,290
He's heading back to the UK soon.

486
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,570
That dinner is his farewell party.

487
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,460
Hello?

488
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,290
Hello?

489
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,250
Any response yet?

490
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,060
Alright.

491
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,460
Got it.

492
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,650
Did something happen?

493
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,060
Don't worry.

494
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,570
The car broke down. Couldn't reach him.

495
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,210
Really?

496
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:32,460
Wait,

497
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,820
since they lost touch,

498
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,570
how did he know the car broke down?

499
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,500
Gu Yangshan,

500
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,980
it's just two hours left

501
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,250
before we head to meet Takeda.

502
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,170
What if the air raid siren

503
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,860
isn't sounded at eight o'clock sharp?

504
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,460
Are you thinking of calling it off?

505
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,690
Uncle Gu.

506
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:55,900
You and Uncle Gu

507
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,610
go to the restaurant.

508
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,460
I'll head to the Bureau first.

509
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,980
Wait, why are you going there?

510
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,130
Seriously, at this hour?

511
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,700
Before you even arrive there,

512
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,610
Takeda and I might finish dinner.

513
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,500
No, no. Relax, I've got it.

514
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,340
I'll make sure the siren goes off.

515
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,170
Okay?

516
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,250
So what's your plan then?

517
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,250
Come on, tell me.

518
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,290
Gu Yangshan.

519
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,940
Are you going to improvise?

520
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,770
That's not really your style.

521
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,820
I have a plan.

522
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,570
If you do, then tell me.

523
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,420
Is it that hard to say?

524
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,020
I'm the one risking my life now.

525
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,420
Even your teacher ran off.

526
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,730
If the air raid siren

527
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,130
doesn't go off,

528
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,290
Takeda will shoot me first.

529
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,290
Let me tell you.

530
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,570
I'm not

531
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,570
with the Anti-Traitor Squad.

532
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,420
I work for the BIS.

533
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,130
But because of the rules,

534
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,210
I can't tell you more.

535
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,500
But trust me on this,

536
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,730
I can handle it.

537
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,940
Just as I thought.

538
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,380
I knew you weren't that simple.

539
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,130
But Ding Yi, remember this,

540
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,610
no matter what happens today,

541
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,060
you won't be in any real danger.

542
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,650
If Takeda swaps out Joseph Lee's cipher,

543
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,900
then we've pulled it off.

544
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,770
You won't have any trouble.

545
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,170
If we fail...

546
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,210
Just a suppose.

547
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,060
The 405th Battalion
doesn't sound the air raid siren,

548
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,900
it just means your intel was off.

549
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,570
Right?

550
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,340
But Takeda

551
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,940
still needs Joseph Lee's cipher

552
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,820
to send out information.

553
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,250
So they won't lay a finger on you.

554
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,610
But that's Takeda.

555
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,980
When he snaps, he even turns on his own.

556
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,860
You've seen it for yourself.

557
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,980
Well, listen.

558
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,380
No matter what happens,

559
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,020
I'll always stand in front of you,

560
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,540
shielding you from harm.

561
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,610
Alright, we'll split up.

562
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,610
You head to the restaurant,
I'll go to the station.

563
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,210
I promise before eight o'clock,

564
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,820
I'll get that air raid siren up.

565
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,380
Splitting up?

566
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,340
What if something goes wrong?

567
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,290
How will you cover for me?

568
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,940
I'll get to the Normandy Private Room.

569
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,020
Until then, just keep Takeda busy.

570
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,170
Eat, drink, whatever works.

571
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,290
But don't get to the main topic

572
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,060
until I show up.

573
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,250
You're seriously out of your mind.

574
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,420
I really am a little crazy.

575
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,980
But if there are

576
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,020
more crazy people like me,

577
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,460
the invaders would've been gone already.

578
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,610
Uncle Gu,

579
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,730
can Gu Yangshan really pull this off?

580
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,980
If he says so, it'll work.

581
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:03,820
Gu,

582
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,980
you think everything

583
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,610
he does is perfect,, right?

584
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,340
Why are you so sure he can do anything?

585
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,290
Wanna meet the lady of our family?

586
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,210
Maybe that's not a good idea.

587
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,060
Listen, Gu,

588
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,690
you really should work on this habit.

589
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,210
Why do you never knock before entering?

590
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:28,770
It's pretty rude.

591
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,940
What if the lady is showering inside?

592
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,380
Am I right?

593
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,460
Wait, this is...

594
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,130
