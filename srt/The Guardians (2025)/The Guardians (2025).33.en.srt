00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,930
this shelter is extremely well hidden,

6
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,100
even the household staff
don't know about it.

7
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,930
So everyone can relax.

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,900
Please, don't hurt me!

Please!

12

Miss Meng.

13

Please spare me!

14
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,380
Don't be afraid.

15
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,820
I'm not a traitor.

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,820
I swear, I'm not.

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,610
It's over now.

20
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,260
I swear,
I'm not a traitor to the nation.

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,890
Alright.

22
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,130
It's alright now.

23

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,260
I have a younger sister named Hongyu.

29
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,820
She's about your age.

30
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,260
But…

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,220
she's got a lot more courage.

32
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,220
Do you want to hear her story?

33
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,260
In my whole life,

34
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,890
I've only done two things.

35
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,010
I joined the Northern Expedition

36
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,980
and the War of Resistance Against Japan.

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,380
I also raised two wonderful children.

38
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,220
Both are upright and decent kids.

39
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,380
Father,

40
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,940
yet I'm still seen as incapable.

41
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,220
This has nothing to do with you.

42
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,500
I know what kind of temper
Chairman Chiang has.

43
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,130
From the moment
I handed in my resignation,

44
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,100
I knew our family
would face this calamity.

45
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,140
Isn't this exactly why you refused

46
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,460
to step back into the spotlight?

47
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,250
I stayed out of it

48
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,810
because of this very reason.

It looks like Bingqing's handwriting.

52

I knew you'd recognize it.

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:47,930
Then...

54
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,700
what's with the bloodstains on it?

55
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,980
Wasn't it during the march

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,170
that she suddenly had a heart attack?

57
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,660
On March 24, 1936,

58
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,530
the Songhu Garrison Command
ordered the Shanghai police

59
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,300
to deploy 500 military police

60
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,770
to surround Fudan University students
in the dead of night.

61
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,730
Six people were arrested.

62
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,500
The next day, they arrested the head

63
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,210

Salvation Association.

64
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,980
Clashes broke out
between the police and the students.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,660
Over 20 shots were fired on the spot.

66
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,770
More than 20 students were injured.

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,180
died the next day from severe injuries.

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,260

73
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,540
But I never imagined

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,540
that she...

75
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,330
was right there among the students.

From that day on,

77
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,100

It was Gu who reminded me.

82
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,660

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,100
I kept wanting to resign.

89
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,740
But the nation was weak
and enemies strong,

90
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,330
so I couldn't leave.

91
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,210
In these past ten years,

92
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,980
I've watched our country

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,540
fall apart day by day.

94
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,540
If Bingqing saw the scene today,

95
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,660
would she think
her sacrifice was worth it?

00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,540
Maybe I really took the wrong path.

104
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,570
But I've come to the end of it.

105
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,500
It's time for me to step back.

106

But you're different.

107
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,210
You're just getting started.

108
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,450
You need to think through

109

which path you'd choose.

110
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,300
Don't let the Gu family's legacy
hold you down.

111
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,450
Father, I've thought it through.

112
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,730
Every generation

113
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,940
has its own road to walk.

114
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,450

115

117
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,330
But in the Gu family,

We've searched every corner.

123

We even checked every crack
in the ground.

There's really nothing.

125
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,540

You haven't found them yet,

132
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,610
but I know very well

133
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,020
that you're on official duty.

134
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,610
I should have fully cooperated just now.

135
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,380
I acted on impulse earlier. I'm sorry.

136
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,970
Please also help me tell Secretary Liu

137
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,140
that I sincerely apologize.

138
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,260
Just speak your mind.

139
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,210
Just now, my father

140
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,330
gave me a lesson.

141
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,330
He also told me off.

142
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,490
Said I was way too reckless

143
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,490
and too impulsive,

144
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,780
that I should think twice before acting,

145
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,850
and know how to set my priorities.

146
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,020
Most importantly,

147
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,210
I have to follow the Chief's orders

148
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,940
and instructions from my superiors.

149
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,250
So I just wanted to apologize to you.

150
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,770
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:43,490
Let's go.

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,420
Move!

153
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,650
Take care, Deputy Chief Luo.

154
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,890
Did Miss Hongyu die?

155
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,060
She went down fighting alongside
Japanese soldiers.

156
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,890
If it weren't for her,

157
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,370
Ding Yi might not have stayed.

158
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,100
And what happened after

159
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,650
might never have happened.

160
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,890
Why?

161
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,180
What did she do wrong?

162
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,700
And what did I do wrong?

163
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,300
You didn't do anything wrong.

164
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,100
What's wrong

165
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,770
is this world.

166
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,580
Then in this world,

167
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,770
why do we have to live so hard?

168
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,130
Life is hard.

169
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,420
So we have to fight for change

170
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,580
and head toward a new China.

171
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,820
Inspector Liu will be here
in a few hours.

172
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,730
This time,

173
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,010
it's your only chance to leave Shanghai.

174
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,060
You need to get in that car fast.

175
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,530
Let's go together.

176
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,420
I know,

177
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,700
you've wanted to leave for a long time.

178
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,060
You were just waiting for an invitation.

179
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,180
Five years ago,

180
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,890
you were the one who invited me

181
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,820
to join the Sword Thrust Operation.

182
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,580
And today,

183
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,940
it's my turn to invite you

184
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,940
to join us.

185
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,820
Back then, we fought side by side,

186
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,370
took down Takeda,

187
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,820
took down Sasaki,

188
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,700
and even Liang Jingyuan.

189
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,100
From now on,

190
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,850
we should keep working together

191
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,530
with other comrades

192
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,460
to protect our new life under the sun.

193
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,820
Is part of your mission

194
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,700
to win me over too?

195
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,300
Not really.

196
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,130
Actually, over the years,

197
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,650
I often thought about

198
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,700
how we fought side by side back then.

199
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,060
Ding Yi, actually,

200
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,580
I've wanted to find you for a long time.

201
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,770
I wanted to walk the same path as you.

202
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,610
Because I believe the road you've chosen

203
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,580
leads to a brighter

204
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,580
and a clearer future.

205
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,700
But…

206
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,810
my father's already getting old.

207
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,930
And in the past few years,

208
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,420
he's been holding an important position
in the Party-State.

209
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,060
If I had gone to see you rashly,

210
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:42,740
my father would...

211
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,340
But now, things have changed.

212
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,180
He's handed in his resignation.

213
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,340
And tomorrow, he's heading overseas.

214
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,490
Just like I told you earlier,

215
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,100
I've got nothing holding me back now.

216
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,290
When did you start to waver?

217
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,250
When Cao Yuanzhong…

218
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,090
turned and fled on the battlefield.

219
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,770
And when I found out Uncle Gu

220
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,700
was with the Communist Party.

221
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,810
And when Chairman Chiang

222
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,860
launched the New Fourth Army Incident

223
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,770
and when Chongqing

224
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,660
spared Liang Jingyuan's life

225
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,220
for the sake of their own interests.

226
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,090
It turns out, all these years

227
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,530
the one pretending to be blind

228
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,730
was you.

229
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,620
Alright, enough talking.

230
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,380
You're coming with us.

231
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,900
We're going to Yan'an together.

232
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,090
You still have to be my best man.

233
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,090
Do you remember

234
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,530
what I told you

235
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,860
when we were in Sanyangli

236
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,090
sharing the same bed?

237
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,010
Once the War of Resistance is over

238
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,700
we'll find a place
with hills and rivers.

239
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,250
You'd bring Miss Meng over

240
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,730
and we'd be neighbors.

241
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,770
If you run out of cooking oil,
just come borrow from me.

242
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,420
If I run out of flour,
I'll pop over to your place.

243
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,220
When we both have kids in the future,

244
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,420
we can arrange for them
to be childhood sweethearts.

245
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,490
If they're all girls or all boys,
it's fine.

246
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,420
We'll just have them sworn in
as best friends.

247
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,490
I really look forward to that day.

248
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,940
And I believe it won't be far away.

249
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,940
But Ding Yi, not right now.

250
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,250
You still have a mission.

251
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,900
Hand it over to me.

252
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,980
I'll take care of the mission for you.

253
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,490
Tell me how to reach your team.

254
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,180
Then you and Ms. Xian can head to Yan'an

255
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,770
and hold your wedding there.

256
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,700
Leave everything here to me.

257
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,220
I know Shanghai better than you do.

258
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,700
Tracking down the doctors
will be easier for me.

259
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,380
I've also witnessed

260
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,330
how Uncle Gu completed his missions.

261
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,250
I also saw firsthand
how Bai Ye operates.

262
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,420
So I know

263
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,250
when the Communists take on a task,

264
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,700
they never rest until it's done.

265
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,380
But Ding Yi,

266
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,180
things are different for you now.

267
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,770
You have a wife
and you're about to get married.

268
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,420
It doesn't have to be you.

269
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,570
There's a radio in my study.

270
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,940
I can report to your organization.

271
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,700
Let me handle this task for you.

272
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,700
I've been waiting for this day.

273
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,180
I'll seek instructions from leadership.

274
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,380
Looking forward to having you on board.

275
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,660
Comrade Gu Yangshan.

276
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,120
[Lead From the Front]

277
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,290
What are you doing?

278
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,090
You guys...

279
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,180
Don't move!
We're searching for a fugitive.

280
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,700
Officer, you've got the wrong person.

281
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,700
You've got the wrong person.

282
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,250
Everyone, turn around.

283
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,730
Sir, we're with the Shanghai BIS.

284
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,180
You two look just like fugitives to me.

285
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,570
You...

286
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,860
Grab them.

287
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,530
Officer, you've got the wrong people.

288
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,250
It's a misunderstanding.

289
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,730
Hurry, hurry.

290
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,940
Move it, quick.

291
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,330
Shixian.

292
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,980
See you in the new world.

293
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,490
See you there.

294
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,090
Go.

295
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,420
When you get to Yan'an,

296
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,940
we have to retake that group photo.

297
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,980
Alright, wait for me in Yan'an.

298
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,620
I also want to see
what the new world looks like.

299
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,570
Come on.

300
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,700
Take care.

301
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,570
Comrade Gu Yangshan.

302
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,380
Comrade Xiao.

303
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,250
We've been waiting a long time for you.

304
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,290
Finally, we meet in person.

305
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,490
Nothing here, nothing there.

306
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,420
All you say is there's nothing!

307
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,460
What else can you even say?

308
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,940
Sorry.

309
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,660
So many people.

310
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,140
You couldn't even catch a shadow.

311
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,900
Did the Communists grow wings
and fly away or what?

312
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,980
No way.

313
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,420
I know how they operate.

314
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,090
Yesterday,

315
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,530
they must've been inside
the Gu Residence.

316
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,730
What happened to your forehead?

317
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,180
Oh, that?

318
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,620
We were on plainclothes duty yesterday.

319
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,420
Ran into Garrison Command
catching a fugitive.

320
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,700
It was just a misunderstanding.

321
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,730
I'm afraid it isn't a misunderstanding.

322
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,860
Right now, the Elimination Committee

323
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,180
is using the banner
of rooting out traitors

324
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,620
to eliminate
our party's underground forces

325
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,700
from the War of
Resistance Against Japan.

326
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,420
Comrade Xiao,
is there anything else I can do?

327
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,570
No need, really.

328
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,180
We owe you a lot already.

329
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,900
Commissioner Luo from the Committee

330
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,180
has been running around
for over half a month

331
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,770
but he still hasn't caught our comrades.

332
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,460
And his chances are running out.

333
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,860
Any results
from the Chongqing Negotiations?

334
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,420
We've been pushing hard for progress.

335
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,860
The call for peace is louder than ever.

336
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,940
Chairman Chiang
can't withstand the pressure,

337
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,180
so he's starting to make concessions.

338
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,530
I think

339
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,980
within the next couple of days,

340
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,380
we'll know the outcome.

341
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,620
That's great.

342
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,940
During the war, when I was in Chongqing,

343
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,700
every time the frontline won a battle,

344
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,770
people would set off firecrackers.

345
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,330
But when the frontline lost,

346
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,250
white banners
would hang over the streets.

347
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,900
That was how the people shared
the nation's joy and sorrow.

348
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,940
After the war ended, I kept worrying,

349
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,220
if one day we ended up in a civil war,

350
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,380
with fathers and sons
turning on each other

351
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,700
and brothers fighting with blades,

352
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,220
how would they know when to feel happy,

353
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,330
for whom to set off firecrackers,

354
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,730
or for whom to hang white banners?

355
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,700
I think,

356
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,570
you already know the answer.

357
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,940
Comrade Xiao.

358
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,250
About my party membership application...

359
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,420
Comrade Gu Yangshan,

360
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,180
I'm officially informing you,

361
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,220
your application to join the Party

362
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,940
has been officially

363
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,090
approved by the Organization.

364
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,860
Starting today

365
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,380
you are now a full-fledged

366
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,140
probationary member
of the Communist Party of China.

367
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,140
Comrade.

368
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,380
I've been waiting for this day

369
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,900
for far too long.

370
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,140
Comrade Xiao, then I...

371
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,770
When will I get to see Yan'an?

372
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,980
The Organization
has decided that you use

373
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,490
your father's trip to the UK
for treatment

374
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,090
as a chance to leave Shanghai at once.

375
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,980
On your return,
our comrades will meet you

376
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,090
and you'll head straight to Yan'an

377
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,380
to receive organizational training.

378
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,900
You'll handle bigger tasks
in the future.

379
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,940
Good.

380
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,860
I understand, Director Dai.

381
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,980
I'll take care of it.
You can count on me.

382
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,090
Chief, I've already confirmed it.

383
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,420
The Garrison Command

384
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,860
lost a prison transport truck.

385
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,420
The newly appointed Deputy Inspector Liu

386
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,700
of the Songhu Garrison Command

387
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,730
is an old associate of the Gu family.

388
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,730
I'm one hundred percent sure

389
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,700
he let those Communist members go.

390
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,700
Mr. Dai just gave instructions.

391
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,700
Things have been settled in Chongqing.

392
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,380
And the Shanghai BIS has to halt

393
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,700
all actions against the Communists.

394
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,700
So quit running around over this.

395
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,460
What's going on?

396
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,860
No, that's not it.

397
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,660
I just don't get it.

398
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,250
What's the real grudge
between you and Yangshan?

399
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,620
You've searched, investigated,

400
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,860
and even smashed the place up.

401
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,210
But you found no members

402
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,420
of the Communist Party in his place.

403
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,290
What more do you want?

404
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,860
Sometimes you should stop
while you're ahead.

405
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,050
But the Gu family lives off
the Party-State's payroll,

406
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,290
taking every advantage they can from it,

407
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,940
yet always working against it in secret,

408
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,860
even shielding the Communists.

409
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,290
A traitor to the country like that,

410
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,940
if we don't take him out now,
when will we?

411
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,700
Deputy Chief Luo,
you're really stubborn.

412
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,220
He's not with the Communist Party.

413
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,250
Let's say he is for a moment,

414
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,980
what can you actually do to him?

415
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,980
I...

416
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,290
You can't just throw him in prison

417
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,730
and make him a cellmate
with General Ye Ting.

418
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,570
What, have the General
write another prison song?

419
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,700
"Why lock every door in and out?

420
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,490
And yet leave everything wide open?"

421
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,570
Aren't you just handing the CPC
free promotion material?

422
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,570
As for his situation,

423
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,290
Mr. Dai knows it inside out.

424
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,980
His father, Gu Zhengze,

425
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,180
along with Commander Chen Shaokuan,

426
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,620
submitted a resignation together.

427
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,730
When the Chairman got the letter,

428
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,010
he only said three words.

429
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,050
"What the heck."

430
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,290
Right then, Mr. Dai had it figured out.

431
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,460
This guy was a hot potato.

432
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,330
We can't keep him nor throw him away.

433
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,570
So tomorrow, he'll be sent to Nanjing

434
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,860
as the Deputy Director
of the new Cipher Bureau.

435
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,730
He's put on research work only

436
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,330
and is kept out of public view.

437
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,810
So just relax.

438
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,490
Relax?

439
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,620
He's becoming Deputy Director.

440
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,460
That's a promotion
instead of a demotion.

441
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,330
And he even colluded with Inspector Liu

442
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,010
and exposed the warehouse photos

443
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,980
of our Seized Asset
Disposal Committee.

444
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,010
And we're just letting it slide?

445
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,730
Mr. Dai just mentioned on the phone,

446
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,330
that some people in Shanghai
are making victory money.

447
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,420
And they've taken it way too far.

448
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,490
They must be punished severely.

449
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,530
So, what exactly did he find out?

450
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,770
The Meng family's residence.

451
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,050
Did you transfer it to Secretary Mao?

452
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,460
All the paperwork is done.

453
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,330
How did it all get processed so fast?

454
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,050
Chief Cao,
why does serving the Party-State

455
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,940
have to be so hard?

456
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,380
Taking the Meng Residence

457
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,330
was entirely my decision.

458
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,660
Deputy Director Mao
knew nothing about it.

459
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,420
I, Luo Han, am willing to resign

460
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,290
and take responsibility for it.

461
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,730
I'm stepping away
from the Traitor Elimination Work.

462
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,500

463
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,810
Deputy Chief Luo.

464
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,330
It didn't have to come to this.

465
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,500
Deputy Director Mao means to say,

466
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,020
next month, our bureau is holding

467
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,770
a War Medal Award Ceremony.

468
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,220
You don't need to take part.

469
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,980
Just make an appearance.

470
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,260
It's enough to give the team
an explanation.

471
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,940
Just keep doing what you usually do.

472
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,570
Chief Cao.

473
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,610
Just do as I said.

474
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,660
This is what I'm worth.

in my father's car.

has been set up in Nanjing.

as Deputy Director.

490
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,220
Mr. Cao, please thank Director Dai

491
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,020
on my behalf.

492
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,660
But as you know,

493
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,330
my father's not feeling well.

494
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,660
I need to take him
to the UK for treatment.

495
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,500
I understand.

496
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,020
You've always been a devoted son.

Old Commander Gu's health

498
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,020
is something
the Chairman's been concerned about.

499
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,290
He's assigned people to accompany him.

500
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,370
So you can rest easy.

501
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,610
Mr. Cao.

502
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,500
No one's better suited for this than me.

503
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,050
If I go, I'll feel at ease.

We can't let you leave.

513

You cracked Joseph Lee cipher.

514
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,850
Even experts from the US were amazed.

515
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,810
With your talent,

516
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,940

Deputy Director Gu, please.

Over 400,000,000 people in China

Yet breaking it apart

523
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,860
only took one man in power

524
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,900
and a reckless ambition.

525
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,900
In June 1946,

526
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,900

the Double Tenth Agreement,

00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,900
launching a full-scale civil war.

528
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,820
This enraged the Chinese people
longing for peace.

529
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,090
With the strength of the masses

530
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,980

got my last letter,

00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,570
The cipher officer handles encrypting
with the codebook.

558
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,570
By day, I teach the communications team

559
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:07,900
and at night,

560
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,940
I work on cracking enemy radio codes.

561
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,090
I often feel like I lack sleep.

562
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:14,690
Luckily,

563
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,380
I haven't had any insomnia.

564
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,570
My body and mind

565
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:19,940
are in good shape.

566
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,780
So please don't worry.

567
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:23,980
I had planned to

568
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,940
head south
after the New Year to see you.

569
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,690
But before I realized it,

570
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,570
spring had already turned
everything green.

571
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,170
Now...

572
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,050
I'm still tied up.

573
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,130
What I want to talk about today

574
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,250
is the basics of cryptography.

575
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,300
Right here,

576
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,170
with the Crossing the Yangtze ahead,

577
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,650
your work at the East China Bureau
must be intense.

578
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,940
I probably shouldn't urge you
to write back,

579
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,690
but the more I thought about it,

580
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,170
the more I knew there was one thing

581
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,460
I still want to tell you.

582
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,570
We're to get from here to there.

583
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,570
Back then, by a twist of fate,

584
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,980
our wedding was endlessly delayed.

585
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,460
It's something I still regret.

586
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,170
Since the civil war began,

587
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,090
we've spent more time apart
than together.

588
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,090
Yesterday at the Command,
I ran into Uncle Wu.

589
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,940
He said,

590
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,900
everyone from the troupe is in Shanghai

591
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,300
and they can all be reached.

592
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,500
When the day of liberation comes,

593
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,090
we'll marry at last,

594
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,090
invite all our old friends,

595
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,090
and have them witness it together.

596
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,090
What do you think?

597
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,250
It's already midnight now.

598
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,690
The courier is about to rest,

599
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,460
so I have to write this in a hurry,

600
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,530
just to send you my thoughts from afar.

601
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,090
So much to say, yet words fall short.

602
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,250
I'll kiss you a thousand times.

603
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,860
Ms. Xian, your smile makes you
even lovelier.

604
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,730
That mysterious radio inside Shanghai

605
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,530
is transmitting again.

606
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,900
It's that same radio again.

607
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,130
Comrade Ding Yi.

608
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,210
Xu.

609
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,460
Comrade Ding Yi.

610
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,020
What happened?

611
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,820
Something's gone wrong at the frontline?

612
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,210
Leader Xian and the others
are doing well.

613
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,570
Lately, they have run into

614
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,050
some trouble with cipher work.

615
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,690
They're gathering intel

616
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,250
for the Liberation of Shanghai.

617
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,730
Recently, they discovered

618
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,380
a new radio operating in Shanghai.

619
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,050
The radio's cipher is very unusual.

620
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,050
It's extremely hard to crack.

621
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,570
Leader Xian had the messages sent back,

622
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,650
so you could take a look.

623
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,900
The Joseph Lee cipher.

624
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,130
Why are you so determined to drop

625
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,420
the Joseph Lee cipher?

626
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,530
The ciphers we used before...

627
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,050
We designed them ourselves

628
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,570
and the Communists cracked every one.

629
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,380
Can you even call that a cipher?

630
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,570
It's basically brain-teaser riddles.

631
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,090
No, no.

632
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,650
It doesn't even qualify as that.

633
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,730
It's more like…

634
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,050
"What is the end

635
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,250
of everything?

636
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,650
Letter G."

637
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,900
Isn't that child's play?

638
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,500
And their CPC codebreakers

639
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,900
listen in on our channel every day,

640
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,130
like it's a holiday for them.

641
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,530
All that's left is for each of us

642
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,500
to hand them a bowl of sweet dumplings.

643
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,050
But it shouldn't have

644
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,050
come to using Joseph Lee cipher again.

645
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,050
That's a cipher we'd already retired.

646
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,900
The scorched earth tactic
is so critical.

647
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,730
How can we use
an abandoned cipher for that?

648
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,090
That cipher

649
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,530
was even praised by the US.

650
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,690
It's a top-tier cipher.

651
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,420
Ever since Gu Yangshan cracked it,

652
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,420
Director Mao has wanted to bring it back
if possible.

653
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,500
It's working perfectly fine now,

654
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,050
so why throw it away?

655
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,130
Chief,

656
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,130
it works on a one-time pad rule.

657
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,570
I know.

658
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,650
If a new cipher officer can't grasp it,

659
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,250
it's easy to make mistakes.

660
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,900
Unless Gu Yangshan comes back.

661
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,530
Nanjing Cipher Bureau

662
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,900
was shut down last month?

663
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,420
Where did Gu Yangshan go?

664
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,210
Out of respect for his late father,

665
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,090
Director Mao gave him a ticket
to China Taiwan.

666
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,650
But he turned it down.

667
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,650
He said he wanted to serve at Shanghai.

668
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,090
So?

669
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,650
You agreed?

670
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,730
He's with the Communist Party, Chief!

671
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,730
Yangshan has been
in Nanjing for 4 years.

672
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,020
He stayed out of sight, living clean.

673
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,900
Why do you still think he's a Communist?

674
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,780
And about that Ding Yi matter.

675
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,500
It's been almost ten years.

676
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,130
I can barely even remember...

677
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,130
Yeah, almost ten years.

678
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,020
But I still believe just this one thing.

679
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,610
You don't believe me at all, do you?

680
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,570
I...

681
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,570
I understand, Chief Cao.

682
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:43,090
Developing a new cipher
takes time and effort

683
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,730
and you don't have the patience.

684
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,420
Whether the scorched earth tactic works,

685
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,340
you don't really care.

686
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,090
You just want it done
and reported upward

687
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,650
and head to China Taiwan
as soon as possible, right?

688
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,730
Deputy Chief Luo,

689
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,940
listen to my advice.

690
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,420
I don't say this to anyone else.

691
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,570
If you're leaving, do it early.

692
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,780
The Communist Forces have stationed

693
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,610
a million troops
along the Yangtze River.

694
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,170
A million troops.

695
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,420
Do you know what that means?

696
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,650
With a few trucks of lousy explosives,

697
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,380
we can't turn the tide.

698
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,020
Even if we can't,
I won't let them have it easy.

699
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,940
Aren't they all about looking good?

700
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,020
Talking about winning the city.

701
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,570
Both for military and political gain.

702
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,420
I just can't stand the way they act.

703
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,170
Always trying to have it both ways.

704
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,570
If they're so eager to get in,

705
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:39,020
let's leave them an empty,
lifeless city.

706
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,570
Come in.

707
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,730
Who are you?

708
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:51,730
Mr. Cao,

709
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,090
it's me.
