00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:15,980
Uncle Gu.

5
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,100
You still read poetry?

6
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,540
I...

7
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,780
I just got fond of these two lines.

8
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,040
[Some work of noble note, may yet be done.
Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.]

9
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,340
Such a fine pen.

10
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,340
What's this for?

11
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,220
I found it in an antique shop in London.

12
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,020
The owner told me

13
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,900
it once belonged to a fallen viscount.

14
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,460
Uncle Gu, with your military exploits,

15
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,780
you are certainly greater than
that viscount.

16
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,290
You deserve it.

17
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,340
What a fine pen.

18
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,020
The word was originally his name,

19
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,900
[Devotion]
but I had it erased

20
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,780
and replaced with this word.

21
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,580
To be honest,

22
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,780
the craftsman's skill was poor.

23
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,170
"Devotion Shines Through the Ages".

24
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,340
The other words weren't engraved.

25
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,700
How many people

26
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,540

Director Lee.

37
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,460
I'm looking for Mr. Shen.

38
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,770
He isn't here right now.

39
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,650
He didn't come to work?

40
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,980
He came,
but said he left something at home,

41
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,940
and went back to Sanyangli to get it.

42
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,730
Thanks.

43
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,700
Take care on your way.

44
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,700
Wait a moment.

Where's Charlie? Still not with you?

49
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,220
Charlie is sick.

50
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,060
Why? Did you need him for something?

51
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,180
You just came back
and are leaving again?

52
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,220
With this kind of work attitude,

53
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,180
won't it look bad
to others in the institute?

54
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,700
Right now the first priority here

55
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,580
is breaking the Xige Code.

56
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,850
Even Mr. Shen's Encryption Section

57
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,610
has been reassigned to help.

58
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,460
Only my R&D Section

59
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,220
has become like a useless chess piece.

60
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,300
So do you think

61
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,820
there's any point for me to stay here?

62
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,850
Should I just sit in my office
doing nothing every day?

63
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,460
Director Liang.

64
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,700
Let me speak frankly.

65
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,060
Rather than wasting my time here,

66
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,340
I'd rather use it

67
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,490

68
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,980
Even if it's just walking
or having coffee,

69
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,460
I find that far more meaningful.

70
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,490
Whether it's idle time

71
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,610
or being the center of attention,

72
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,980
discipline is discipline.

73
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,850
As long as you
take the new government's salary,

74
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,060
even if your seat has nails in it,

75
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,220
you should sit properly during work.

76
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,940
Tell me,

77
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,850
are you speaking
on behalf of the Colonel

78
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,100
or is this your own opinion?

79
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,610
It's not important.

80

84

what you wanted at the office.

85
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,490
Maybe you can check at home again?

86
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,220
I understand.

87
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,300

94

95
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,820
then tell me the truth.

97
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,340
You know the man who sent me.

98
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,340
His name is Gu Fuhua.

99
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,820
Gu Fuhua?

100
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,610
Is he from Shanghai BIS?

101
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,820
Or from Sasaki's MSS?

102
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,300
He's a Nationalist army officer.

103
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,490
You don't know him?

104
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,220
But unfortunately, Mr. Shen,

105
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,530
you will never meet him.

106
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,060
Because he's dead.

107
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,580
He died at the hands of the Japanese.

108
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,820
But the fountain pen I gave him

109
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,580
is on your desk.

110
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,700
And the word "Devotion"

111
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,340
is engraved on it.

112
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,340
I gave that to him back then.

113
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,180
So who exactly are you?

114
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,580

You must tell me everything.

135

Otherwise, you will die.

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,740
Let's be formally introduced.

190
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,060
Hello, Comrade Bai Ye.

191
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,060
I am the liaison the Organization
assigned to you.

192
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,810
My name is Ruan Qing.

193
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,540
Finally, someone calls me
"comrade" again.

194
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,300
We figured you were eager to
make contact,

195
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,500
but Yi Aida was watching
Sanyangli closely.

196
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,940
After Comrade Hei died,

197
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,130
we've been conducting internal checks.

198
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,940
Farmer sent this photo to us

199
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,220
until we confirmed it was safe.

200
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,740
He asked me to give it to you.

201
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,500
Being able to see Susu once more
is enough for me.

202
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,780
Thank you, Comrade Ruan Qing.

203
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,780
The Organization originally
assigned me to assist you

204
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,060
to continue completing the covert plan

205
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,300
of replacing
the puppet army's military code.

206
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,220
But now Liang Jingyuan
has set his eyes on you,

207
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,780
and the KMT-CCP relations
are rapidly changing.

208
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,980
It's no longer safe to remain
in the Cryptography Institute.

209
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,130
The Organization has already arranged
an evacuation plan.

210
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,130
We will return to Yan'an together.

211
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,060
I'm afraid my time is running out.

212
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,300
Is it your illness?

213
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,780
Comrade Bai Ye,

214
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,740
we've already arranged a doctor.

215
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,300
It's cancer.
It has already spread to my lungs.

216
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,020
It's incurable.

217
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,940
The reason I hid this

218
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,130
is because

219
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,020
once the Japanese learned of my illness,

220
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,060
they'd never have allowed me
to come to Shanghai,

221
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,540
and I would never have had the chance

222
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,540
to continue executing the covert plan.

223
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,500
I didn't expect

224
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,850
that once I came,
Comrade Hei would sacrifice his life.

225
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,740
This next mission will depend on you.

226
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,460
What mission?

227
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,780
Comrade Bai Ye.

228
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,740
Using the data brought by Yi Xiuyuan,

229
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,540
I've decrypted their Xige Code.

230
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,300
And now I discovered that Chiang,
while speaking of resisting Japan,

231
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,300
is secretly planning to attack Huangqiao

232
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,740
to wipe out our New Fourth Army.

233
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,740
This top-secret level code

234
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,780
has been entirely used against us.

235
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,020
Han Deqin fears the Eighth Route
and New Fourth Army joining forces,

236
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,250
so he has already formulated

237
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,970
a plan to fight south first, then north.

238
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,730
They intend to first annihilate our

239
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,490
New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu,

240
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,410
and then move

241
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,410
to deal with
our southbound Eighth Route Army.

242
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,500
Ms. Xian.

243
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,020
What is it?

244
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,290
The market will close in 15 minutes.

245
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,260
Will you follow or sell your stocks?

246
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,050
You must decide quickly.

247
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,500
Help me sell them.

248
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,900
Alright, we'll act immediately.

249
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,420
Hurry.

250
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,740
Faster.

251
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,260
The New Fourth Army's
northern Jiangsu unit

252
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,740
is isolated
in the southeast at Huangqiao.

253
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,260
With only seven thousand troops,

254
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,530
they're unable to resist
Han Deqin's 40,000 troops.

255
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,260
And the Eighth Route Army to the north

256
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,260
and the Fourth and Fifth Detachments
of the New Fourth Army to the west

257
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,500
are all seven days' march
from Huangqiao.

258
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,700
Plus the puppet army's obstruction,

259
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,020
it's hard for them
to support each other.

260
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,980
Although Han Deqin is temporarily
delayed by heavy rain,

261
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,420
I estimate the battle will begin
as early as tomorrow night.

262
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,700
The anti-Japanese tide of fighters
from eight provinces

263
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,500
must not be stopped here.

264
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,020
Exactly.

265
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,900
That's why we
cannot waste even a minute.

266
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,020
The reason I risked trying to
meet you earlier

267
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,420
was because the matter was urgent.

268
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,700
If I couldn't see you today,

269
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,810
my only choice would be to risk
sending a transmission

270
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,500
to contact the Organization.

271
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,460
No matter what,

272
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,420
this intelligence

273
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,530
must be sent back before dawn tomorrow.

274
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,420
Give me the information.

275
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,530
I'll deliver it to
the Organization immediately.

276
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,980
Earlier,
I couldn't confirm your identity.

277
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,660
So to be safe, I didn't carry it on me.

278
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,500
Once back at Sanyangli,

279
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,700
I'll immediately give you their detailed

280
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,980
military strategic deployment map.

281
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,260
Alright, let's return to
Sanyangli immediately.

282
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,740
I'll take the front door.

283
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,500
You take the back door.

284
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,810
Six o'clock.

285
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,740
I'll come to your place
pretending to bring a food box.

286
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,260
Okay.

287
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,810
Someone's been shot!

288
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,090
Run!

289
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,530
Shen Wanqing is Bai Ye.

290
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,810
He cracked the Xige Code.

291
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:24,330
The Nationalists want

292
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,530
to suppress the New Fourth Army.

293
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,530
I know.

294
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,090
Don't speak, don't speak.

295
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,850
Get a car, quick!

296
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,570
Six o'clock.

297
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,570
Sanyangli.

298
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,850
He will

299
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,850
risk sending a message.

300
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,330
Stop him.

301
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,900
The signal truck

302
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,220
will locate him quickly.

303
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,370
He won't finish sending it.

304
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,370
Help him get the intelligence out.

305
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,180
Go help him.

306
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,180
Quick.

307
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,610
Biyun.

308
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,290
Biyun!

309
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,330
Biyun!

310
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,530
Biyun!

311
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,090
Mr. Lee, don't worry.

312
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,610
We will do our best to save Mrs. Lee.

313
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,740
Who fired the shot?

314
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,570
The shooter moved quickly.

315
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,130
From my angle at the time,

316
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,850
I couldn't see his face clearly.

317
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,740
Did you see who she was meeting?

318
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,810
There were too many people in the hall.

319
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,660
I lost her as soon as I entered.

320
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,260
When I saw her again,

321
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,570
she had already been shot.

322
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,900
Turns out you're not
as smart as I thought.

323
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,330
Liang Jingyuan.

324
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,740
I've told you long ago,

325
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,850
there was no need
to stage this self-injury act.

326
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,610
If you think Xian Biyun
is a Communist spy,

327
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,740
you could just arrest her directly.

328
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,260
If you can't lure out the spy,

329
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,850
and your father
still can't break Xige Code,

330
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,850
then next week,

331
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,610
you'll both return to Chongqing.

332
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,370
You know perfectly well

333
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,420
we can never go back to Chongqing.

334
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,260
To come to Shanghai,

335
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,570
I've already been on
the BIS's assassination list.

336
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,610
I've staked

337
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,900
my entire life on this trip.

338
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,330
This is

339
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,290
your last chance.

340
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,820
Director Lee.

341
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,380
It's so late. What are you doing?

342
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,340
Director Lee.

343
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,420
I'll be brief.

344
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,530
Ms. Xian has been shot.

345
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,530
She's now in the hospital.

346
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,090
I'm here on her behalf to meet you.

347
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,300
Where's the intelligence?
Give it to me quickly.

348
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,650
Director Lee.

349
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,780
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

350
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,500
Your eyes...

351
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,500
Comrade Bai Ye.

352
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,340
I know your contact code
with the Organization.

353
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,500
Susu.

354
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,460
Nice act.

355
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,860
Too bad.

356
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,420
My contact code has never been "Susu".

357
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,130
You're in such a hurry.

358
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,020
Two in a row rushing at me.

359
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,940
I know why you're here.

360
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,250
Too bad,
I don't have time to play with you.

361
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,380
Report.

362
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,820
We've found a new radio signal.

363
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,380
Someone is transmitting.

364
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,820
Keep close watch.

365
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,340
Yes, sir.

366
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,050
Judging by the signal strength,

367
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,170
I think the radio source
should be in Sanyangli.

368
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,820
Keep monitoring.

369
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,820
Yes, sir.

370
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,020
Why are you tied up here by him?

371
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,130
Mr. Shen.

372
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,250
Mr. Shen.

373
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,130
Mr. Shen, wake up.

374
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,730
The Third War Zone is currently
in radio silence.

375
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,050
All the Japanese in Shanghai are
searching for the transmission source.

376
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,570
Their signal trucks

377
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,340
will soon lock onto this area.

378
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,020
The military police
will be here any moment.

379
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,500
Go quickly.

380
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,730
What are you doing?

381
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,460
Shen Wanqing has cracked the Xige Code.

382
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,500
You know how important
this code is to us.

383
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,170
Once he hands over the decryption method

384
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,500
to any organization,

385
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,050
our front-line soldiers will be doomed.

386
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,730
I can't let him live.

387
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,170
But Liang Jingyuan still knows nothing.

388
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,420
That means
he has absolutely no intention

389
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,980
of telling anyone the decryption method

390
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,980
for the Xige Code.

391
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,050
The quartz crystal's frequency
in the radio

392
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,340
is proof he's been contacting outsiders.

393
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,420
Gu Yangshan.

394
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,610
You're anti-Japanese.

395
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,380
So is he.

396
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,380
But now you're actually holding a gun

397
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,860
at an anti-Japanese patriot.

398
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,210
I'm telling you,

399
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,860
if you kill him today,

400
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,860
I will immediately go to
Liang Jingyuan and report you.

401
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,340
Then none of us will live.

402
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,420
Can you guarantee that
after he's captured by the Japanese,

403
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,690
he won't betray us?

404
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,780
Can you guarantee it?

405
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,610
Ding Yi.

406
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,050
You're an actor, you can perform.

407
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,730
But the battlefield is no stage play.

408
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:33,730
I can gamble.

409
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,530
I can gamble with my own life.

410
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,380
But I can't gamble with the lives

411
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,860
of all the soldiers at the front.

412
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,500
And he just sent out a transmission.

413
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,130
Their direction-finding truck
will locate this place.

414
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,690
When that happens,
he won't survive anyway.

415
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:57,690
What are you doing?

416
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,530
