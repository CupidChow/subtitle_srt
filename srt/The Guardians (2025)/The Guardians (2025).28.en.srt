00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,130
I had only just arrived in Shanghai
for a few days

188
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,370
before I narrowly escaped death
several times.

189
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,700
Miss Megumi, please don't blame him.

190
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,010
Joseph once created for them

191
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,010
an ingenious cipher system.

192
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,180
But it was leaked by their own people,

193
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,850
and they made Joseph take the blame.

194
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,490
If it weren't for his status
being the sworn son,

195
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,370
he would probably have...

196
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,650
Megumi,

197
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,610
if you were in my position,

198
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,890
what would you do?

199
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,770
At least you shouldn't lie.

200
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,530
None of the privileges
the Grand Duke promised me

201
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,940
have been realized.

202
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,890
So does that make him a liar?

203
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,370
How dare you!

204
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,890
But that's what war is.

205
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,490
Every time war comes,

206
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,370
morality is the first casualty.

207
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,090
The Grand Duke took me
from the ivory tower

208
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,890
to the battlefield.

209
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,890
It was bad enough he gave me no weapon.

210
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,890
He shouldn't tie my hands and feet,

211
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,580
and expect me to uphold morality

212
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,110
when I'm facing the barrel of a gun.

213
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,770
I'm sorry,

214
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,770
but I just want to survive.

215
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,460
Looks like the Chinese battlefield

216
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,730
is far more tangled
than I ever imagined.

217
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,770
That's why I had Biyun

218
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,180
pretend her leg hadn't healed,

219
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,330
keeping her in this hospital.

220
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,770
I'm just worried

221
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,770
if something happens to me one day,

222
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,890
it might implicate her.

223
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,530
I also told her

224
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,060
in times of crisis
she could turn to you for help.

225
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,100
Do you think the Army Hospital is safe?

226
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,530
At least under the Tonoji's family's
protection,

227
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,490
Biyun would be safe for sure.

228
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,610
Not necessarily.

229
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,490
As far as I know,

230
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,010
a doctor's badge was stolen
from the Army Hospital.

231
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,370
That means an enemy
might've already slipped in.

232
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,700
Slipped in to do what?

233
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,530
Are they after the Grand Duke?

234
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,900
Sorry to interrupt.

235
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,860
The clamp handle
was deliberately filed thin,

236
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,380
so pressing it hard would cut the hand,

237
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,330
making the doctor unable
to perform surgeries for a while.

238
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,620
There was some unknown drug on it.

239
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,860
And Dr. Edward's thumb

240
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,660
did indeed have a wound.

241
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,050
Have you confirmed the identity
of that body?

242
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,140
Yes, but he wasn't Dr. Abe Shoichi.

243
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,810
He just stole Dr. Abe's badge.

244
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,660
He was using the alias Hashimoto Taro.

245
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,050
He worked as a Code Officer
in the Pacification Committee.

246
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,570
In fact, he was Major General Sasaki's
only son,

247
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,570
Sasaki Taro.

248
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,620
He was assassinated by someone
who resists Japan this morning.

249
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,380
The Sasaki family
has already taken his body.

250
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,220
Sasaki!

251
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,380
What on earth happened?

252
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,330
The doctor whom the Tonoji family

253
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,900
had brought all the way from the UK

254
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,660
was poisoned right under our noses.

255
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,810
You still claim the Hospital is safe.

256
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,700
Where is there any safety?

257
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,810
Poisoned?

258
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,700
Well…

259
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,730
That's impossible.

260
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,810
You can't see with your eyes,
so naturally you don't understand.

261
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,620
Megumi, I need you to calm down.

262
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,530
I think there's more to this
than it seems.

263
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,220
Now all of us

264
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,560
are hoping the Grand Duke wakes up soon

265
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,330
and takes charge again.

266
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,490
Why would anyone

267
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,140
want to poison the Grand Duke's
chief surgeon?

268
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,700
Of course, it's Sasaki.

269
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,700
The night before last, I saw someone

270
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,050
walk out of Dr. Edward's office.

271
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,180
His badge said Abe Shoichi.

272
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,900
He had a crescent-shaped scar
on his hand,

273
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,570
identical to the one on the body

274
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,490
of Sasaki's son.

275
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,460
He must be the one

276
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,290
who poisoned Dr. Edward.

277
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,180
And Sasaki was behind all of it.

278
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,050
I remember.

279
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,900
I've met Sasaki's son before.

280
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,050
He really did have a scar on his hand.

281
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,980
It's crescent-shaped.

282
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,330
But...

283
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,660
Go ahead, Biyun, but what?

284
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,620
But Sasaki would say

285
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,700
that scar can be faked.

286
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,900
Of course he'd say that.

287
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,860
That could never fool my eyes.

288
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,090
Wait.

289
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,380
I remember the Cryptography Institute

290
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,050
got a cipher from a private radio.

291
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,810
And this radio

292
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,220
transmitted steadily

293
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,660
at exactly 1:30 PM every day.

294
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,220
When we just began decoding it,

295
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,570
Sasaki suddenly gave a strict order

296
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,490
to destroy

297
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,700
all the radio's records immediately.

298
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,490
Megumi,

299
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,700
could it be that this radio

300
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,620
actually belongs to Sasaki himself?

301
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,860
He's planning to use this radio
to give orders

302
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,940
for a series of moves
against the Tonoji family.

303
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,660
Joseph...

304
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,570
General Yasui,

305
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,180
I need the Military Police Headquarters

306
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,570
to send me a radio direction finder.

307
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,420
Please hurry.

308
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,700
Are you tired of living?

309
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,900
I told you not to come,
yet here you are.

310
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,090
I shouldn't have come, my bad.

311
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,570
Hold on a second.

312
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,930
I've got clothes ready for you.

313
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,330
And a gun. I put it right here.

314
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,090
I've spoken to the person
in charge here.

315
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,180
Those evil guys outside

316
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,220
won't disturb your rest.

317
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,860
Try to bear with it here.

318
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,900
So in your eyes, they're evil.

319
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,900
What about me?

320
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,570
What about me?

321
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,380
In your eyes, there's no real difference

322
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,180
between me and them, right?

323
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,370
What are you talking about?

324
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,050
You are my comrade-in-arms.

325
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,380
How could you be the same as them?

326
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,220
You still don't know anything until now?

327
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,900
Hasn't Liang Jingyuan told you a thing?

328
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,180
He has.

329
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,900
He told me the condition
for getting you out

330
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,330
is the Deputy Chief
of China Hong Kong Bureau.

331
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,090
You've been through a lot.

332
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,090
Don't burden yourself with thoughts.

333
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,900
Secretary Mao has arranged a boat
for you.

334
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,860
You'll leave by water
before sunset tomorrow.

335
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,180
I might not be able to see you off.

336
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,900
I have to rush back right away.

337
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,900
If Sasaki finishes
the Spirit Transfer Ritual,

338
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,900
then it'll be too late for everything.

339
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,220
You can't stay here.

340
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,740
I originally intended

341
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,940
to expose the fact
that Ding Yi and Xian Biyun

342
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,900
were communists,

343
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,460
and then pin everything on them.

344
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,460
But in the end, I couldn't fool Sasaki.

345
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,900
He'll definitely keep questioning you.

346
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,130
You can't go back there.

347
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,700
Relax, I have my own plan.

348
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,700
There's no way.

349
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,500
The Communist Party will definitely
confront us openly.

350
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,260
Luo Han, at Yuyin Pavilion,

351
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,460
was there something
I didn't know happened?

352
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,220
Ding Yi fired at me.

353
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,130
He wanted to…to kill me.

354
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,500
You're saying Ding Yi fired at you?

355
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,700
The Communist Party
has always played hardball.

356
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,900
Luo Han, I don't know why Ding Yi

357
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,700
would fire at you.

358
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,890
The two sides hold different positions

359
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,230
and are in different places.

360
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,460
But if Ding Yi was caught first today,

361
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,940
we would pull that trigger too.

362
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,090
At this point,

363
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,940
would you really shoot Ding Yi?

364
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,180
Don't worry.
I'll take that shot for sure.

365
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,980
Liang Jingyuan...

366
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,940
Are you really taking him back
to Chongqing?

367
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,130
Luo Han,

368
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,020
I've got my own plan.

369
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,220
A shameless traitor to his own people.

370
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,460
Just because he did you a favor,

371
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,940
he'll get the position
of the Deputy Chief.

372
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,460
What about me?

373
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,460
What's my life worth in exchange?

374
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,940
Luo Han, what's wrong with you today?

375
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,900
Didn't I tell you to wait downstairs?

376
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,940
Sorry to interrupt.

377
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,740
I just want to ask when we're leaving.

378
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,900
We'll go meet someone right now.

379
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,740
He's in charge of everything
for your trip back to Chongqing.

380
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,180
Liang Jingyuan,

381
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,900
what exactly did you promise Chongqing?

382
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,980
Same as you.

383
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,940
A loyal heart devoted to the country.

[Sasaki's private radio room]

385
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,700
Don't move!

386
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,700
Stay still.

387
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,460
Search for it!

388
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,700
Don't move!

389
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,700
Take it all away!

390
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,850
We've found Sasaki's private radio
and the codebook.

391
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,700
We're interrogating his radio operator.

392
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,260
General Yasui,

393
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,420
if you still refuse to hand over

394
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,260
the letter framing the Tonoji family
to me...

395
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,940
Once I uncover

396
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,460
concrete proof Sasaki planned
to assassinate the Grand Duke,

397
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,460
you'll be guilty
of shielding a criminal.

398

[Denunciation Letter]

399
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,130
The handwriting on the letter

400
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,220
exactly matches Sasaki's handwriting.

401
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,370
He accused us of colluding
with British and American forces,

402
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,460
and also accused Dr. Edward

403
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,460
of being a spy for the British MI6.

404
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,460
He claimed meeting him in Shanghai
was treason.

405
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,700
It's beyond ridiculous!

406
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,930
General Yasui has been
a friend to the Grand Duke for years.

407
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,900
How could he ever let this happen?

408
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,220
The military is already run
by the Imperial Way faction.

409
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,460
They are just joining forces

410
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,600
to bully our family
because we have no one to rely on.

for Sasaki's Spirit Transfer Ritual.

414
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:09,940
Got it.

415
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,220
Go get the doctor, quick.

416
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,130
On it.

417
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,500
Doctor!

418

Doctor!

419
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,130
Doctor!

420
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,700
To be or not to be.

421
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,360
Such an intriguing question.

422
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,460
Father,

423
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,370
don't worry.

424
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,460
Without Dr. Edward,

425
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,130
I'll still find you another doctor
from the UK.

426
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,940
Joseph, the Grand Duke wants to see you.

427
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,700
I'm so glad you're awake.

428
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,330
What are you doing here?

429
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,460
Father,

430
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,900
don't you remember?

431
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,420
Three years ago,
you invited Joseph to China

432
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,900
to help the Expeditionary Army
with their cipher work.

433
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,700
Joseph has done a good job
over the years.

434
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:34,700
He now runs the Wang Government's
Cryptography Institute.

435
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,420
He's not Joseph.

436
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,740
Back then I invited Joseph

437
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,740
to be the chief advisor
on cryptography for the Kwantung Army.

438
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:53,660
He had no interest at all.

439
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,660
So why would he agree to run

440
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,460
a small research institute?

441
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,050
You're not Joseph.

442
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,900
Who are you?

443
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,900
Perhaps you don't remember me.

444
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:22,940
But

445
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,610
you should know this photo.

446
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,260
This is a photo

447
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,260
of him with you.

448
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,500
This photo,

449
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,610
you took at that time.

450
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,460
Right?

451
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:02,940
Yes.

452
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,180
You used the camera

453
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,380
for the first time.

454
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,860
Yes.

455
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,690
A that time, I failed to take photos
many times

456
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,570
and wasted a bit of film.

457
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,380
It's alright.

458
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,380
You did it nicely.

459
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,500
Sadly,

460
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,730
I tried many times back then

461
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,650
but failed.

462
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,500
In the end, Joseph Lee's father
took the photo.

463
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,820
Joseph had an exceptional memory
since childhood.

464
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,020
If you really are Joseph Lee,

465
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,570
there's no way you'd get this wrong.

466
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,610
Who are you?

467
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,500
Take him down.

468
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,250
Take them down.

469
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,500
Take them down.

470
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,340
Father,

471
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,820
are you alright?

472
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,570
Doctor, hurry!

473
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,050
Please!

474
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,500
Hurry!

475
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,530
Doctor!

476
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,730
The Grand Duke's blood pressure
is spiking fast.

477
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,340
It might be a sign of another stroke.

478
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,500
We need emergency care right now.

479
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,730
Father!

480
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,210
Father!

481
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,210
Keep an eye on them.

482
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,730
Got it.

483
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,300
This location list he gave us

484
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,690
doesn't seem fake.

485
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,300
However, you need to give me some time,

486
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,980
so I can find someone to verify it.

487
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,300
Since it's his show of loyalty,

488
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,570
it definitely isn't fake.

489
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,650
Let me bring him in.

490
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,980
Yangshan.

491
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,980
Once it's verified, we won't keep him.

492
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,820
Is that your idea or Chongqing's?

493
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,980
You get intel,

494
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,690
and catch the one
who blew up Shanghai Bureau.

495
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,820
Do you think it's my idea,

496
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,210
or an order from above?

497
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,090
But here's what I think.

498
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,530
No matter whose idea it is,

499
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,690
the Chairman won't hesitate to award

500
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,500
a Yunhui Medal, right?

501
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,570
Mr. Cao?

502
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,500
Alright, you're grown now.

503
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,210
You're right about that.

504
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,500
Liang Jingyuan deserves
everyone's justice.

505
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,050
I've already settled it. Get in.

506
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,210
Young Master,

507
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,820
I know this is Cao Yuanzhong's place.

508
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,820
I've already helped you.

509
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,090
But you can't throw me into danger.

510
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,500
How about this?

511
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,690
If you're still uneasy,

512
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,860
we can just head back.

513
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,730
I trust you completely.

514
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,980
Besides, this path is my own choice.

515
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,690
And having you with me

516
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,530
is an honor for me.

517
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,690
Is there anything else to say?

518
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,730
Tell me everything.

519
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,820
Megumi,

520
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,710
I've risked my life
for the Tonoji family

521
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,340
in the New Government.

522
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,380
But because of a photo, you...

523
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,210
Alright.

524
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,980
Still putting on an act, huh?

525
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,980
Isn't it enough?

526
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,090
Are you okay?

527
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,210
Your eyes can see now.

528
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,780
Guess you really are a married couple.

529
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,820
At least you didn't lie to me
about that.

530
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,610
But you do play the part well.

531
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,820
You even look exactly like Joseph.

532
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,380
Whoever found you
must've put in serious effort.

533
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,530
No one sent me here.

534
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,500
I came on my own.

535
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,610
Shut your mouth.

536
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,730
Don't be so impulsive.

537
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,610
My name is Ding Yi.

538
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,210
I'm an actor with the Chaosheng Troupe.

539
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,020
Joseph Lee himself came to hire me.

540
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,980
The Grand Duke invited him to Shanghai.

541
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,440
He was afraid of being assassinated
by those who resisted Japan,

542
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,380
so he hired me to be his double.

543
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,530
Always cautious, putting safety
above all else.

544
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,500
Sounds exactly like something
Joseph would do.

545
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,860
So where is he now?

546
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,210
I killed him.

547
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,820
And then you took his place.

548
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,730
Why?

549
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,690
Because Sasaki's people

550
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,650
took my sister Zhu Hongyu's life.

551
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,090
But fate was on my side.

552
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,500
Joseph Lee found me

553
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,820
and wanted me to be his double.

554
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,820
It was destiny.

555
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,690
So I swore to avenge my sister.

556
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,400
As long as they worked for Sasaki,

557
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,610
including Joseph Lee,

558
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,210
I wouldn't spare a single one!

559
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,820
What about her?

560
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,780
She's the leader of the troupe

561
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:24,860
and also...

562
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,130
And also my wife.

563
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,130
That's right.

564
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,340
Without this social butterfly,

565
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,690
you couldn't possibly have pretended
to be an Englishman

566
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,250
and fooled so many people.

567
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,020
Looks like you told me the truth
just now.

568
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,690
But you've misused the name
of the Tonoji family

569
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,690
to sow discord within the military.

570
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,020
Allowing you to live until now

571
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,900
is a disgrace to the Tonoji family,

572
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,440
and even more so to the Imperial Army.

573
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,380
I won't let this mistake continue
any longer.

574
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,530
Wait!

575
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,690
Miss Megumi,

576
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,980
I know, I deserve to die.

577
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,730
But I can't die yet,

578
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,990
because I'm still useful to you.

579
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,690
Sasaki

580
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,170
sent a telegram, wrote a report letter,

581
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,860
and poisoned Dr. Edward.

582
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,050
These are all facts you saw
with your own eyes.

583
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,130
I don't have the ability to fake it.

584
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,690
Give me a gun right now.

585
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,860
I can kill him for you

586
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,210
to protect the dignity
of the Tonoji family.

587
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,860
Ding Yi!

588
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,340
Giving a gun to a con man?

589
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,340
Sorry.

590
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,690
I'm not that foolish.

591
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,340
You have to believe me!

592
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,570
Sasaki still doesn't know

593
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,530
that my eyes can see.

594
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,690
So only if I go,

595
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,690
only then

596
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,730
will he have no defenses at all.

597
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,210
Then I can finish him.

598
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,730
I'm begging you, please.

599
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:16,820
Let me kill him.

600
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,690
If I can avenge my sister,

601
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,330
I'm willing to face death
without regret.

602
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,340
But I have only one request.

603
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,340
Let my wife go.

604
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,690
Ding Yi, don't be reckless!

605
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,730
If you go, you won't come back.

606
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,050
Shut up!

607
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,860
I never intended to come back.

608
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:51,650
Miss, the doctor is out.

609
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,170
He wants to see you.

610
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:55,570
Father!

611
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,730
Watch over them.

612
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:57,300
