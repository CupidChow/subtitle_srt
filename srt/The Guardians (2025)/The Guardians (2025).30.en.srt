00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,920
[Episode 30]

3
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,780
Biyun.

4
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,980
Biyun!

5
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,780
Biyun!

6
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,260
Biyun!

7
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,610
Biyun!

8
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,380
Biyun!

9
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,380
Biyun!

10
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,660
Biyun!

11
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,820
Lin Megumi strapped the bomb onto me

12
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,900
and made me bring it here.

13
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,660
Sasaki's men discovered it,

14
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,690
and a fight broke out.

15
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,340
The Tonoji family fired the first shot.

16
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,410
I've told you everything I know.

17
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,340
We're currently investigating the scene.

18
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,690
Please wait here

19
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,660
until we have results.

20
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,570
Thanks.

21
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,620
It's all good now.

22
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,250
Joseph Lee's eyes can't see.

23
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,580
By the way,

24
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,250
at the hospital earlier,

25
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,700
Grand Duke Tonoji suddenly woke up.

26
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,100
Nobody saw that coming.

27
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,580
My cover was blown.

28
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,700
I didn't have the chance to talk to you.

29
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,020
The only thought in my head was

30
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,410
that I had to keep you safe.

31
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,250
So maybe I acted a bit rashly.

32
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,250
Please don't be mad at me.

33
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,340
In the hospital, you yelled at me

34
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,250
and told me to shut up.

35
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,820
I was a little upset about it.

36
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,990
But I also told you to shut up earlier.

37
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,580
So now we're even.

38
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,410
Also,

39
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,700
as the two of us

40
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,970
walked from there to the well,

41
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,260
carrying the bomb together,

42
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,620
I...

43
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,940
I rambled on with a stream of nonsense.

44
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,530
Because I...

45
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,620
I honestly thought at that moment

46
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,580
I might not make it out alive.

47
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,380
I'm afraid it will be too late
to say it.

48
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,290
So I...

49
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,290
You...

50
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,410
Just pretend you didn't hear any of it.

51
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,580
But I did hear it.

52
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,260
When I was trapped in the hospital,

53
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,530
I was pretty scared too.

54
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,820
After you left,

55
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,140
that room felt so quiet

56
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,260
like a grave.

57
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,260
I pricked up my ears,

58
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,140
listening all the time,

59
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,940
hoping

60
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,650
and longing to hear the sound
of the cane again.

61
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,740
Yeah.

62
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,940
That exact sound.

63
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,290
I used to hate hearing it the most.

64
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,580
Because every time it meant

65
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,940
we had to hide who we were
and face danger.

66
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,380
But when I heard the sound fade away

67
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,140
and gradually disappear,

68
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,820
I was terrified for the first time
in my life.

69
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,410
I was scared of losing you.

70
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,620
Ding Yi,

71
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,070
it's not that I don't care.

72
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,140
I can feel it all.

73
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,340
I…

74
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,860
Honestly, I've always felt

75
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,330
I...I'm not worthy of you.

76
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,500
I am a very timid person.

77
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,740
Yes, you are.

78
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,530
But even so,

79
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,620
you've still done
so many amazing things.

80
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,620
Hurry and change out my cipher

81
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,340
to prevent any leaks.

82
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,930
I'm allergic to shrimp,

83
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,990
but I still asked them
for a plate of shrimp.

84
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,770
After eating it,

85
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,650
I indeed broke out in a rash.

86
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,770
I am now the Deputy Director
of the Cryptography Institute.

87
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,980
You won't need to ask anyone else
for help anymore.

88
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,980
I'm here with you.

89
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,460
Is it just about saving face?

90
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,740
What do you mean?

91
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,340
Biyun.

92
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,530
Biyun...

93
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,340
Be careful.

94
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,140
Is that you?

95
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,380
Yes, it's me.

96
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,530
I'm here.

97
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,620
Come on.

98
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,140
Smell me.

99
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,440
Smell me right now.

100
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,380
Come on.

101
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,220
Smell.

102
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,410
Don't worry.

103
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,620
This is the first official task

104
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,740
they've given me.

105
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,770
I won't let them down.

106
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,650
As for this Sasaki,

107
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,930
I can't let him stay.

108
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,530
Anyone under Sasaki's wing,

109
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,410
I won't let a single one go!

110
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,500
I'm not leaving now.

111
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,020
Please let me finish his mission.

112
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,650
I want to become Bai Ye.

113
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,690
Gu, Hongyu, and Bai Ye,

114
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,620
their sacrifice was not in vain.

115
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,260
I'll be just like them,

116
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,620
giving my all without holding back,

117
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,500
and risking everything to save others.

118
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,260
Every time I see you, I wonder

119
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,860
how there could be someone so silly.

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,930
You don't know anything.

121
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,620
You can't do anything.

122
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,980
You clearly had many chances to leave,

123
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,810
yet you insisted on staying,

124
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,670
going down this path to the very end.

125
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,650
When you left the hospital,

126
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,860
what you said

127
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,770
showed you were braver than anyone.

128
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,740
In the book of fate,

129
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,380
our names are written side by side.

130
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,260
At that time, I just wanted to prove

131
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,260
that until the day I die,
I am a good actor.

132
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,620
Actually, I have always

133
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,690
regarded you as my guiding light.

134
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,290
Like Romeo

135
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,020
to Juliet,

136
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,460
I only wanted to be by your side.

137
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,020
But at that time,

138
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,620
I overestimated love

139
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,260
and underestimated the revolution.

140
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,860
Later, I realized

141
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,620
you're not like Juliet.

142
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,860
To you, love

143
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,220
might just be a small flourish in life,

144
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,930
something extra to make life brighter.

145
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,620
Even without love,

146
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,620
you'd still be the bravest fighter.

147
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,620
That's why I kept pushing myself,

148
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,140
trying to become someone like you.

149
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,860
You made it happen.

150
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,860
Although we are not qualified
to talk about love now,

151
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,380
we all have the right to yearn for it.

152
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,500
This ring,

153
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,140
I'll treasure it forever.

154
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,140
It wasn't given to me by Joseph Lee.

155
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,740
It was from Ding Yi.

156
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,220
The shape of this ring

157
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,380
is called a Mobius strip.

158
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,100
It has only one curved surface

159
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,860
that loops endlessly.

160
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,860
No matter which direction they go,

161
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,860
they are on the same path

162
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,010
and will inevitably meet in the end.

163
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,620
In the book of fate,

164
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,020
our names are written side by side.

165
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:55,980
Of course,

166
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,620
on that very same line,

167
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,980
stand 400 million Chinese.

168
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,500
Hello?

169
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,740
The last stronghold is confirmed too.

170
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,020
Mr. Liang,

171
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,530
your intel accuracy...

172
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,660
You're truly impressive.

173
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,460
Since this is my show of loyalty,

174
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,810
I need to do it clean and proper.

175
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,330
I can't put you in a tough spot.

176
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,260
I've given you the intel,

177
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,180
and it's been checked.

178
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,460
We've been at this all night.

179
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,740
Now you should tell me
what time the ship departs.

180
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,530
See Mr. Liang onto the ship.

181
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,330
Wait.

182
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,850
What's that supposed to mean?

183
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,180
Mr. Liang,

184
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,180
don't blame me for playing it this way.

185
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,220
If you must blame someone,
blame yourself.

186
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,530
Such a large flour mill,

187
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,740
with dozens of people,

188
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,290
just disappeared like that.

189
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,530
In life, you have to keep a backup plan.

190
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,810
If I hadn't left myself a way out,

191
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,530
would you be where you are today?

192
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,290
Say whatever you want.

193
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,740
Anyway,

194
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,910
it is imperative for me

195
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,930
to eliminate traitors
and save the nation.

196
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,440
Eliminate traitors?

197
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,740
If that's how you put it,

198
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,660
then we really need to have a long talk.

199
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,980
Chief Cao,

200
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,540
where's that Late-Ming Heavenly Maiden
Scattering Blossoms?

201
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,180
After the Shanghai Bureau was bombed,

202
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,700
this painting turned up

203
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,530
at Vice Chairman Zhou's home
in the Nanjing Puppet Government.

204
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,490
What a coincidence.

205
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,460
The person who happened to help you
deliver it to the Zhou residence

206
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,980
is an old acquaintance of mine.

207
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,660
I've seen that painting myself.

208
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,700
The maiden in it
had the most alluring eyes.

209
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,330
You step outside for a minute.

210
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,490
That painting had been missing
for a long time.

211
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,050
You have news about it?

212
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,250
Chief Cao,

213
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,730
if I end up dying here today,

214
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,810
yes,

215
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,940
I can keep my mouth shut,

216
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,250
but whether my family

217
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,180
can keep this secret for you,

218
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,380
I am not sure.

219
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,900
Sasaki's radio and messages

220
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,980
are enough to prove
he wanted the Tonoji family dead.

221
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,420
And last night, Lin Megumi's actions

222
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,800
were also defined by the military

223
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,790
as undermining the unity
within the Imperial Army.

224
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,530
Now both groups are subject
to the investigation.

225
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,220
All their operations in China
will be shut down.

226
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,980
So the New Government's cipher work,

227
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:33,900
Mr. Lee,

228
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,620
can only rely on you now.

229
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,620
This is

230
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,250
the confidential radio data
managed by Sasaki.

231
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,490
Please handle the handover
as soon as possible.

232
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,400
[Confidential Document]

233
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,790
How about this?

234
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,900
This list of strongholds

235
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,050
can be considered my toll for passage.

236
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,860
What I have in my hands
is far more than just this.

237
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,420
Many people in the Wang Government

238
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,860
have a warehouse in China Hong Kong,

239
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,770
hiding tons of gold and antiques.

240
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,990
I'm the only one who knows the location.

241
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,220
Do you even dare to tell me
the location of the warehouse?

242
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,810
As long as I can safely
reach Chongqing,

243
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,490
we'll sign it together,

244
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,460
and the credit will belong
to both of us.

245
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,050
Such a big favor,

246
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,620
just for two ship tickets?

247
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,460
Of course,

248
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,050
I also need you

249
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,900
to give me a Letter of Appointment,

250
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,490
proving that I'm not a traitor,

251
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,180
but that you sent me
to infiltrate the Japanese organization.

252
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,180
Which comrade needs
to blow up Shanghai Bureau

253
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:32,090
sacrificing a key liaison point?

254
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,700
Mr. Liang, I'd love to help you,

255
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,980
but your story has holes.

256
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,330
Do you think it has holes,

257
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,620
or does someone else think so?

258
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,050
We must give the comrades
an explanation.

259
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,220
This is Director Dai's decision. I...

260
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,770
Dare not overstep.

261
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,090
So what kind of explanation do you need?

262
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:26,900
Finally,

263
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,010
all obstacles have been cleared away.

264
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,520
What's wrong?

265
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,050
There's one last thing.

266
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,730
Who is it?

267
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,220
It's me.

268
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,980
Liang, you're finally back.

269
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Those people at the door

270
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,440
look so creepy and strange.

271
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,980
I was so scared alone.

272
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,700
Close the door.

273
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,190
Did you get the ship tickets?

274
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,900
Yes, tomorrow afternoon.

275
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,570
Thank goodness.

276
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,040
Hurry up and pack your things.

277
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,860
Remember to bring my medicine.

278
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,900
It's all ready.

279
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,460
Not sure if the doctors
in Chongqing are good.

280
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,090
But I've prepared anyway.

281
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,250
If it really doesn't work out,
I'll just sell it

282
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,730
to help out with the bills.

283
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,330
If one day we can really move
to China Hong Kong,

284
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,620
that would be amazing.

285
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,490
It's pretty close to Shunde.

286
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,900
My whole family lives there.

287
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,630
We wouldn't have to worry
about anything.

288
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,530
People always say

289
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,380
China Hong Kong is warm all year round.

290
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,050
Your leg will get much better
over there.

291
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,980
There's a place called Queen's Road.

292
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,490
They say all the fancy stuff
is on Queen's Road.

293
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,380
Rich folks live in Mid-Levels.

294
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,490
In the Mid-Levels area,

295
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,980
if you open the window,

296
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,220
you can see Victoria Harbour
right there.

297
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,550
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

298
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,700
When we're settled,

299
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,700
maybe we could have a kid.

300
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,250
Before, we kept saying, let's wait.

301
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,090
We wanted to give our child
a better life.

302
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,520
I've finally understood something.

303
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,940
As long as we're both safe and sound,

304
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,980
that's the best life we could ask for.

305
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,700
Don't you agree?

306
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,700
Yin,

307
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,980
you've been through so much
all these years.

308
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,250
Good times are just around the corner.

309
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,220
Very soon.

310
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,460
Liang,

311
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,140
we've spent half our lives
scheming against others.

312
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,770
This time,

313
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,290
you even included me in your schemes.

314
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,770
You little wretch!

315
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,250
Liang,

316
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,490
people make their small plans,

317
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,730
but Heaven

318
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,700
has the ultimate plan.

319
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:01,980
Let it...

320
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,670
They say a real man must be ruthless.

321
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,980
Mr. Liang,

322
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,530
you really have guts.

323
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,980
So what kind of explanation do you need?

324
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,730
Back then in Japan, the one
who helped you rise up

325
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,700
is

326
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,980
Mrs. Liang.

327
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,140
Ye Yin sheltered
under the Japanese invaders,

328
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,280
and betrayed the central command.

329
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,190
Despite repeated efforts

330
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,980
to dissuade her,

331
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,790
she launched a surprise attack
on the Shanghai Bureau.

332
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,980
Dozens of our comrades died
in the flames.

333
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,050
This crime is beyond forgiveness.

334
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,050
Would this explanation satisfy you?

335
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,730
You seized the stronghold
in the Japanese Concession

336
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,420
and avenged our brothers in Shanghai.

337
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,460
Plus the gold from the warehouse
in China Hong Kong.

338
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,440
That's three major achievements.

339
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,940
Mr. Liang,

340
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,250
now I can see you off onto the ship.

341
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,180
Thank you, Chief Cao.

342
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,460
May I take my wife's body back
to Chongqing?

343
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,940
Sure, let's go.

344
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,420
I didn't expect

345
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,180
so many things to happen in one night.

346
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,940
Sorry I didn't help you.

347
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,420
But I was about to look for you too.

348
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,900
Now Sasaki is dead,

349
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,720
and Liang Jingyuan has gone missing.

350
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,530
The Sword Thrust Operation

351
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,530
will be the sole intel channel

352
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,770
within the New Government.

353
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,140
What a pity.

354
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,330
We can't share it.

355
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,700
That's quite a bold move.

356
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,690
Are you in such a hurry
to drive me away?

357
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,580
Luo Han's about to board the ship
back to Chongqing.

358
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,940
Once he reports

359
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,280
your and Xian Biyun's identities

360
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,530
to my superiors,

361
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,730
Chongqing will spare no effort

362
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,940
to take both your lives.

363
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,620
And these are

364
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,460
ship tickets to China Hong Kong.

365
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,860
Now Grand Duke Tonoji is dead.

366
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,560
I've joined the Pacification Committee.

367
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,530
I no longer need Joseph Lee.

368
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,730
To the public, I will say

369
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,460
that Joseph Lee can no longer
continue working

370
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,940
due to the worsening of his tumor.

371
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,080
Once you get to China Hong Kong,

372
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,280
decide for yourself where to go next.

373
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,260
Do you think

374
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,960
that after all this,

375
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,690
death can still threaten me?

376
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:20,880
By the way,

377
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,210
about your mother,

378
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,090
I'm sorry.

379
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,820
Tastes great.

380
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,690
Did you make this sauce?

381
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,980
Your mother made this.

382
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,460
This is from Baimahu.

383
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,050
Actually, I made that sauce myself.

384
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,130
Your mother is safe in Baimahu.

385
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,300
My people are just
protecting her discreetly.

386
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,150
They haven't disturbed her at all.

387
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,980
When you get to China Hong Kong,

388
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,750
I'll make sure she gets there too.

389
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,210
Really?

390
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,340
Do you think threatening me

391
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,900
using my mother repeatedly

392
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,740
will still work on me?

393
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,950
Do you think I'd leave her in Baimahu?

394
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,860
You're right.

395
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,530
I forgot

396
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,270
you're an organized person now,
aren't you?

397
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,460
Alright then.

398
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,650
From now on, let's stay out
of each other's way.

399
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,820
You work at the Cryptography Institute,

400
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,770
and I work
at the Pacification Committee.

401
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,820
Let's not interfere with each other.

402
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,820
The noodles are here.

403
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,780
Noodles for you two.

404
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,460
Tastes great. Great!

405
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,900
Tastes just like two years ago.

406
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,900
Hasn't changed a bit.

407
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,050
Go on, try it.

408
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,780
This is really interesting.

409
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,940
I remember two years ago,

410
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,780
the two of us

411
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,210
sat in this very spot.

412
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,610
Back then you told me to stay.

413
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,740
But today you're pushing me to leave.

414
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,530
But back then,

415
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,090
you were full of fire,

416
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,570
more spirited than now.

417
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:48,740
Yeah.

418
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,570
We still fought side by side then.

419
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,170
And that day,

420
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,010
I actually felt guilty towards you.

421
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,420
You told me
you had three great strengths.

422
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,530
Sharp eye, good at imitation
and a great memory.

423
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,520
Turns out you weren't lying.

424
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,460
Eat some more.

425
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,460
It's a long way back to Chongqing.

426
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,460
Sir, the soup's way too salty.

427
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,980
General Yasui asked me

428
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,090
what exactly was going on
with the report letter

429
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,050
you wrote earlier.

430
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,460
Sorry, I told him the truth.

431
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,170
You colluded with Liang Jingyuan

432
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,630
and tried to set me up on purpose.

433
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,530
Those four people you see now

434
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,980
are all under General Yasui.

435
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,940
They're about to take you back
for questioning.

436
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,130
Aren't you afraid I might disclose

437
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,300
both your identity and that
of Xian Biyun to him?

438
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,980
I met Charlie back in the UK.

439
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,130
He insisted on becoming my assistant.

440
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,980
And I have no idea

441
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,420
who he is

442
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,820
or what he has done.

443
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,610
Do you think General Yasui

444
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,650
would believe Charlie

445
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,490
or would believe

446
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,740
the only survivor of the Tonoji family,

447
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,210
Joseph Lee?

448
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,490
Don't forget

449
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,260
I'm the one who made you Joseph Lee.

450
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,900
Secretary Gu, please come with us.

451
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:09,960
It's just an investigation, right?

452
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,690
No problem.

453
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,690
I will conduct it thoroughly.

454
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,380
Let's go.

455
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,980
Hold on a second.

456
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,530
Charlie,

457
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,490
tell them everything.

458
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,460
Are you out of your mind?

459
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,420
You were right just now.

460
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,490
It's just an investigation.

461
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,460
Not scary at all.

462
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,340
But things are different now.

463
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,660
You killed four Japanese
Military Police

464
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,090
with the gun in your hand.

465
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,210
The Japanese,

466
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,300
as you well know,

467
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,730
will come and execute you on the spot.

468
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,100
These people here

469
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,380
are all working for Yasui.

470
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,630
As soon as your gun is fired,

471
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,040
the backup troops they have arranged

472
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,120
will immediately rush over.

473
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,300
Two minutes at the most.

474
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,940
So now you have two minutes

475
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,730
to escape.

476
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,420
Take me hostage.

477
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,610
At the mouth of the alley,

478
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,940
I've got a car ready for you.

479
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,210
The key is inside.

480
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,090
What happened between us in the street

481
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,570
will reach Chongqing in no time.

482
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,020
You cut ties with the communists.

483
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,820
Only then,

484
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,610
can you protect all the glory
of the Gu Family.

485
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,570
This is your plan, huh?

486
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,340
You have only 90 seconds left.

487
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,300
Think it through now.

488
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,420
Leaving now

489
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,020
is your only way to survive.

490
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,020
Interesting.

491
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,980
I once tricked you using your mother.

492
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,420
Now you've dragged my father into it.

493
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,980
This isn't a scheme.

494
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,460
It's the truth.

495
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,690
And it's what you taught me before.

496
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,090
Feelings should always come
after stance.

497
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,050
Our stances

498
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,020
are no longer the same.

499
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:28,820
Fine.

500
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,250
Then we'll just wait quietly for them.

501
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,860
Stay back.

502
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,170
Or I'll hurt him.

503
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,250
I said, stay back!

504
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,820
Don't shoot. Don't hurt Mr. Lee.

505
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,500
Take care.

506
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,210
Mr. Lee!

507
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,340
Are you alright?

508
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,170
Go after him, hurry!

509
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,610
Check over that way.

510
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,210
Got it.
