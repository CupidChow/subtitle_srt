1
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,520
Give it to me.

2
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,160
What are you doing?

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,440
You need to put medicine on your wound too.

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,040
There isn't enough herbal medicine.

5
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,840
Don't waste it.

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,760
Don't move.

7
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
There isn't enough herbal medicine.

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,000
I can go pick some.

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,400
If your wound gets infected too,

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,120
who will take care of me?

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Don't move.

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,080
Does it hurt?

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,560
I...

14
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,680
See, I'm fine too.

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,560
Princess

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,080
Everything has been properly arranged.

17
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,440
The Lord of the City has arrived.

18
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,760
Respectfully welcoming the Lord of the City.

19
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,320
Your body has only just recovered.

20
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,760
You still don't look fully well.

21
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,200
There's no need for such formalities.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,200
Thank you for your concern, Lord.

23
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,440
With the careful care of the royal physician,

24
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,760
my daughter's health has mostly recovered.

25
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,760
You must not let your guard down.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,080
You still need to take good care of yourself.

27
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,080
Thank you for your kindness, Lord.

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,880
Recently, my father heard that I had awakened.

29
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,640
He sent goat milk tea from our hometown in Northern Yue.

30
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,080
Please have a taste, Lord.

31
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,080
The Lord of Northern Yue is very thoughtful.

32
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Please, Lord.

33
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,760
I have come from Northern Yue.

34
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,200
Carrying the hopes of the thirty-six tribes of Northern Yue.

35
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,800
But who would have thought

36
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,000
that I would fall ill from poisoning.

37
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,000
Now I have recovered.

38
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,760
All thirty-six tribes of my people

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,400
hope that Northern Yue and Nanling

40
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,000
can become even closer.

41
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,000
Even my father wrote in his letter

42
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,960
hoping

43
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,000
to hear soon

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
the good news I send home.

45
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
the good news I send home.

46
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,320
This is delicious!

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,440
Chief Hong

48
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,200
You should try it too.

49
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,320
My Lady,

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,760
your body has only just recovered.

51
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,200
The physician advised that you still need to rest well.

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
At this time,

53
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,880
I truly do not wish for any grand events.

54
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't want you to endure

55
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,000
any more exhaustion.

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,800
I hope

57
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,200
you can wait until your health improves further.

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,120
What do you think?

59
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,880
Your arrangements are, of course, the best.

60
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,760
But you have only just taken office.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,760
You are already busy with official duties every day.

62
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,000
I feel concerned for you.

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,200
I hope I can personally take care of your daily needs.

64
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,520
I hope you will allow me to do so.

65
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,000
Your concern for me

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,320
is naturally my honor.

67
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,640
Then I will trouble you, My Lady.

68
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Li Yan

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,760
Li Yan

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,320
Where did you go?

71
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,400
Li Yan

72
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Where did you go?

73
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,240
Don't come over here.

74
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,200
Don't come over here.

75
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,320
Don't come over here.

76
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,320
Don't come over here, don't come over here.

77
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,680
Don't touch me.

78
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,200
It's me.

79
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,200
I've already driven the snake away.

80
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,480
Where did you go?

81
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,520
I went to gather herbs.

82
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,440
Look.

83
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
You're so badly hurt, yet you still run around everywhere.

84
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,760
Don't you know I was really worried?

85
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,760
I...

86
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,680
But I came back, didn't I?

87
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,320
Then don't ever leave me again.

88
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Okay?

89
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,640
Let the heavens be my witness.

90
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,120
I, Li Yan, swear

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,000
that I will never leave Lin Qianjin again.

92
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,640
I will protect her forever.

93
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,200
Then, in the future,

94
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
will you still be the City Lord's wife?

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,400
Wake up, quickly.

96
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
Young people these days

97
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,440
sleep so soundly.

98
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,320
Even with all the noise I made,

99
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,240
they still sleep so deeply.

100
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,880
I guess you two

101
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,320
eloped, right?

102
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,640
Fell down from Lovers' Valley.

103
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,640
Senior,

104
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,240
the two of us were being chased by enemies.

105
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,320
We fell down here.

106
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,240
We had no choice.

107
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,840
But once we recover,

108
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,240
we'll leave on our own.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,680
Just call me Dali.

110
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,200
This cave is really quite basic.

111
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,000
I happen to have a thatched hut at home.

112
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
If you don't mind,

113
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,640
you can stay there to recover.

114
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,080
You two,

115
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,400
for the next couple of days,

116
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
just stay here for now.

117
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,680
I'll go get you some clean clothes.

118
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,960
Okay.

119
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,840
There's only one bed.

120
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,440
You, go rest.

121
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,640
I'll tidy up.

122
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,840
Go on, go on.

123
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,640
I'll sleep on the floor.

124
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
You're a girl, so let me do it.

125
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,880
No, no.

126
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,240
You're injured.

127
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,080
Let me do it instead.

128
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,600
These past few days, Princess Liuyun has been coming every day.

129
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,480
The city lord seems to be in much better spirits.

130
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,440
Yes.

131
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,240
Princess Liuyun comes up with something new every day

132
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
to make food for the city lord.

133
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,880
The attendants say everything she makes is exquisite.

134
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,560
It looks like Princess Liuyun will become the city lord's wife

135
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
very soon.

136
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,080
The soldiers stationed at the border between the two cities

137
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,000
heard that the young lady will become the city lord's wife as soon as she wakes up.

138
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
They all say the two cities are now one family.

139
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,760
They are eager to serve the city lord wholeheartedly.

140
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,120
Princess Liuyun.

141
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
You may be new to our Nanling City.

142
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,320
You might not know the rules here.

143
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,200
The servants and attendants in the back

144
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,560
are not allowed to discuss state affairs.

145
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,320
Yes, city lord.

146
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,240
I, Liuyun, overstepped.

147
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,480
Come.

148
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,240
This...

149
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,480
is what I was thinking.

150
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
I only wish to care for the city lord.

151
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,560
I want to share the city lord's burdens.

152
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,560
I have chosen the best craftsmen in the city.

153
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,640
After several rounds of selection,

154
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,840
I picked the most outstanding ones.

155
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,480
I hope that on the wedding day,

156
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,760
I can make a flawless wedding robe for the city lord.

157
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,840
That's all good.

158
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,880
As for the wedding robe,

159
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
I'll leave it to Princess Liuyun to handle.

160
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,720
Yes.

161
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,720
City lord.

162
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
City lord.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,600
City lord.

164
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,720
City lord.

165
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,840
Greetings, Princess Liuyun.

166
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,880
Did you find it?

167
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,120
Keep going.

168
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,360
Put in some effort.

169
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,600
Why are you looking at me?

170
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm admiring your graceful sleeping posture.

171
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,360
Is that so?

172
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,600
Did you make all of these?

173
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,360
What about these?

174
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,840
They're all to repay you for saving my life.

175
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Are you sure, then?

176
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,480
You're only doing this to repay me for saving your life?

177
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,240
Not to win over someone you like?

178
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,880
Here.

179
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,760
Not bad.

180
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,480
Then try this one, too.

181
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,600
Flip this.

182
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,640
Miss Lin

183
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,360
In the past

184
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
I thought you were

185
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,840
an arrogant and vicious mad girl

186
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,240
I even once suspected

187
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,800
that you were the one who poisoned them
