1
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,240
The effect is immediate.

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,000
It will let you soon

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,480
be blessed with a son.

4
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,520
Who said we were having a child?

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Have a child?

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Of course we want to have one.

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,720
Then we thank you, boss.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,200
Don’t believe in those folk remedies.

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,320
After you have the child,

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,320
just help me spread the word.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,680
Alright.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,680
We’ll take our leave now.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,320
Don’t trust those folk remedies.

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,480
Please.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,480
Take care on your way.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,480
Why are you getting so worked up?

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,800
We almost gave ourselves away.

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,920
You really got into character.

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,560
But since the boss is so enthusiastic,

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,320
I’ll just accept it.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,040
I’m not doing this to have a child.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
I just think this is pretty interesting.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,280
I’ll study it carefully when we get back.

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,560
Let’s go have some tea.

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,320
Okay.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,080
You two are here.

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,440
Thank you.

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,200
You’re too kind.

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,800
What are you doing?

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,600
Don't move.

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,480
There's a special scent on you.

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,280
Oh no.

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,400
Could it be that the Couple's Fragrance Pill is working?

34
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,600
Get a hold of yourself.

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,320
Drink some tea.

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,440
What?

37
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,720
I'm perfectly clear-headed, why drink tea?

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,320
You...

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,040
It's this.

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,080
I knew it.

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,160
Why does this scent seem so familiar?

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,400
And it's really unique.

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,040
What scent is this?

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,960
I remember now.

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,680
This is the scent of that little yellow flower.

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,200
Do you still remember?

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,680
That little yellow flower from Lover's Valley.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,200
What kind of flower is this? It's so unique.

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,800
Come on, let's go to Lover's Valley.

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,680
When I came here before,

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,200
it was definitely here.

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,200
Why can't I see it now?

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,160
Li Yan, go look over there.

54
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,440
Okay.

55
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,920
Are you looking for this?

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,440
Give it to me.

57
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Oh, you!

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,560
You really don't treasure the things I give you.

59
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,200
If I hadn't found it,

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,680
would you have just left it?

61
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,960
I cherish everything you give me.

62
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,680
This...

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,720
This was really an accident.

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,600
Then tell me a joke.

65
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,800
Make me laugh.

66
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Then I'll give it back to you.

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,960
Tell a joke?

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,920
Sorry, sorry.

69
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,560
I won't tease you anymore. Here, take it back.

70
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,440
You're tricking me.

71
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,600
I'm not giving it to you.

72
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,200
Not giving it.

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,840
Not giving it.

74
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,680
Not giving it.

75
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,320
I...

76
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,440
I've fallen for someone I shouldn't like.

77
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,440
Does that count as a joke?

78
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,840
You...

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,440
You... Miss.

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
Look, look.

81
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,680
Little yellow flower.

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,320
Isn't this what you mentioned?

83
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,680
The little yellow flower from the story?

84
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,280
That's right.

85
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,320
Exactly.

86
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,480
This is the scent.

87
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,200
It smells exactly like the medicine residue.

88
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,920
Let's take it to Shibali Inn and ask around.

89
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,080
Okay, let's go.

90
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,160
Let's go.

91
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:50,960
Stop!

92
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,560
Stop!

93
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,200
Stop!

94
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,080
Stop! Don't run!

95
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,680
What should we do?

96
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,560
Miss!

97
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,680
Retreat!

98
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,640
Li Yan

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,640
Li Yan

100
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,600
Wake up, quickly!

101
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,520
Don't scare me.

102
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Li Yan

103
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,480
Li Yan

104
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
Li Yan

105
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
You must not die.

106
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,280
Don't leave me.

107
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,920
Master

108
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,720
Young Miss

109
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,480
What happened to the Young Miss?

110
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,760
The Young Miss, she...

111
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Just say it!

112
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,200
The Young Miss didn't come back last night.

113
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,160
Did you check the City Lord's residence?

114
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,640
We checked, but she wasn't there.

115
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,160
Then why are you only telling me now?

116
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,840
Someone, come!

117
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,760
At your service.

118
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,040
Send five hundred soldiers to search the entire city.

119
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,440
Especially the taverns and jewelry shops.

120
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,160
And everyone who stayed at inns last night.

121
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,640
Search every single one of them.

122
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,480
Send another hundred men outside the city.

123
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,440
Search every village and town within ten miles.

124
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,400
Even if you have to turn the whole city upside down,

125
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,840
you must find Miss Lin.

126
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,600
Yes, sir!

127
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,600
Go quickly!

128
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,000
Butler

129
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,840
Prepare the sedan chair.

130
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,720
I want to see the City Lord.

131
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,320
Reporting to Your Highness,

132
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,560
Li Yan and Miss Lin have fallen into the valley.

133
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,440
Their chances of survival are extremely slim.

134
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,320
The task was completed well.

135
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,320
I will do my utmost to assist Your Highness.

136
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,160
Now,

137
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,720
the position of City Lord's wife

138
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,480
will definitely be mine.

139
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,440
Reporting to Your Highness,

140
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,480
Lin Sizheng just met with the City Lord.

141
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,160
He asked the City Lord to search for Miss Lin's whereabouts.

142
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
No rush.

143
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,200
As for these obstacles,

144
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,720
they must be removed one by one.

145
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,040
Li Yan

146
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,920
Li Yan

147
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,880
Li Yan

148
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,560
Li Yan

149
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,840
Li Yan

150
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,880
Li Yan

151
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,440
You're finally awake.

152
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,280
You scared me to death.

153
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,280
I-I hurt your wound.

154
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,600
It's okay.

155
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,280
It's good that your fever is gone.

156
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,120
Does it still hurt?

157
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,560
The conditions here are limited.

158
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,480
But you still need to take care of your wound.

159
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,920
If it gets infected, it'll be a problem.

160
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,880
Here.

161
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,880
Don't move.

162
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,400
Give it to me.

163
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,040
What are you doing?

164
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,320
Your wound needs medicine too.

165
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,920
There's not enough herbs.

166
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,720
Don't waste them.

167
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,640
Don't move.

168
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
There's not enough herbs.

169
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,880
I can go pick some.

170
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,280
If your wound gets infected too,

171
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,000
who will take care of me?
