1
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,320
Yes.

2
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,240
Hit her.

3
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,960
Why are there no eggs or vegetables today?

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,960
Take off your shoes.

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,080
Hit—hit her.

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,760
Beat her to death.

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,800
Stop it, all of you!

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,520
Hit.

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,800
Even if I die,

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,080
I won't forgive you even as a ghost.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,880
You deserve it.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,560
You bunch of troublemakers.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,160
You deserve it.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Troublemakers.

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,280
There's not a single good person in your whole family.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
You deserve it.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,240
Serves you right.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,320
You deserve it.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,760
Serves you right.

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,920
Beat them to death.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,280
I didn't expect Miss Lin to be in such a miserable state.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,440
I was thinking she hadn't died.

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,840
How should we deal with her?

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,280
Who would have thought she'd end up in prison?

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,000
Your Highness,

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,280
even the heavens are helping you.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,000
It seems the position of the city lord's wife

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,440
is destined to be yours.

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,000
You don't need to tell me that.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,440
But what's going on with Li Yan?

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,120
He just went through hardships with Miss Lin.

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,240
And now he's abandoned her.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,160
I don't understand it either.

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,720
But this time, Miss Lin's imprisonment

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,120
is really thanks to him.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,440
No matter what,

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,880
he's helped me this time.

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,760
When I become the city lord's wife,

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,040
I must thank him properly.

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,120
Yingxue,

41
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,240
go find the best tailor in the city for me.

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,720
Bring them to me.

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,440
Yes, Your Highness.

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,560
Be sure to pick the best fabrics.

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,880
Only the best will suit Your Highness.

46
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,560
No,

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,400
the city lord's wife.

48
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,480
You're so quick-witted.

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,440
Go in.

50
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,240
Who would have thought,

51
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,600
I'd run into

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,880
the once-mighty Minister Lin here.

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,680
The city is full of turmoil.

54
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,960
Yesterday, he was in court.

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,120
Today, he's in prison.

56
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Who can say?

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,440
Let's go.

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,600
Miss

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,240
Don't be sad.

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,720
People who stab others in the back like this

61
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,480
I've seen plenty of them, my dear.

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,000
Father

63
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,680
Was it really you who poisoned Liuyun?

64
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,440
My daughter,

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,440
do you not even trust your own father?

66
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,440
If I did it,

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,240
I'd admit to murder or arson.

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,280
If I didn't do it,

69
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,680
I wouldn't even admit to stepping on an ant.

70
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
It's not that I don't trust you.

71
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,880
I just can't figure it out.

72
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,320
How did Li Yan suddenly become like this?

73
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Why do you care so much about Li Yan?

74
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,440
You should be thinking about the City Lord

75
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,920
and what he will think.

76
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,080
Time to eat.

77
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,240
Time to eat.

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,680
Hurry up.

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,240
Hurry, hurry up!

80
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,320
Is this even food for people?

81
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,440
It's all spoiled.

82
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,360
Be glad you have anything to eat.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,880
In this prison,

84
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,560
even if they don't give you food, you have to endure it.

85
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,000
You dog servant!

86
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,640
Don't think I don't know

87
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,200
who's backing you up.

88
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Miss

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,760
Miss

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,560
Don't be sad.

91
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,120
Eat something.

92
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,240
Your health is important.

93
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,000
Dad

94
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,520
Dad

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't be afraid

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,080
It's just a mouse

97
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,520
Go away, quickly

98
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,120
Go away

99
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,320
Why isn't it leaving yet?

100
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,320
It'll leave after it finishes eating

101
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,560
It has to go home

102
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:53,920
Dad

103
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,080
Don't be afraid

104
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,360
Did you hear?

105
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,760
Princess Liuyun is about to become the City Lord's wife

106
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,640
Everyone knows about it

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,440
I heard the official robes for the City Lord's wife are already finished

108
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,440
Haven't you noticed these past few days

109
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,000
Commander Li has been busy running around

110
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,000
He only follows the City Lord's wife's lead

111
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,680
Li Yan

112
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,080
Dad

113
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Dad

114
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,520
Dad

115
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,760
Don't come over

116
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,560
Don't go

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,880
You still haven't told me

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,360
Why did you do this?

119
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,000
Are you saying what you said in the village

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
was all a lie?

121
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,880
I just want to find out the truth

122
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,680
Impossible

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,920
I don't believe it

124
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,320
You sounded so sincere back then

125
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,320
There's no way you were lying to me

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
The City Lord wants to see you

127
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Then tell me

128
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,240
Why are you still carrying

129
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,560
the sachet I made for you?

130
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,800
It's just a decoration.

131
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,880
The city lord has arrived.

132
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,800
City lord.

133
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,800
City lord.

134
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
I stake my life on this.

135
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,880
I absolutely have not done anything deceitful in secret.

136
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,120
Minister Lin.

137
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,000
You'd better confess quickly.

138
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,080
That would also put my mind at ease.

139
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
City lord.

140
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,240
For something like this,

141
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,680
no one would confess, no matter who did it.

142
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,320
No need to waste words on him.

143
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,200
If he deserves to be executed, then execute him.

144
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,640
Give justice back to Beiyue City.

145
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,680
City lord.

146
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,560
In my opinion,

147
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,360
since Minister Lin refuses to confess,

148
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,560
this cell is dark and damp.

149
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,240
We'd better leave as soon as possible.

150
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,560
Miss Lin.

151
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,560
Do you have anything else to say?

152
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,440
I just want to take a closer look.

153
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,080
So I can see some people's true colors.

154
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,880
Well, well, Miss Lin.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
A disgraced woman like you

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,240
actually claims to see my true colors.

157
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,760
There's an assassin!

158
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,920
Come with me!

159
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,800
Who are you people?

160
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,880
How dare you break into the prison?

161
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,640
We received a message from Minister Lin.

162
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,200
He told us to break into the prison tonight.

163
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,200
Where did you come from?

164
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,440
I don't even know you at all.

165
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
City Lord.

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,200
The prison is heavily guarded.

167
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,880
How could I possibly send out any message?

168
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,320
What about the prison guards?

169
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,560
The guards can testify for me.

170
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,520
Minister Lin.

171
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,000
Unfortunately,

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,800
all those guards are already dead.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,800
City Lord.

174
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,880
I can testify for my father.

175
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
He really didn't do these things.

176
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,800
You testify?

177
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,240
Yes.

178
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,520
Maybe you arranged all of this.

179
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,560
City Lord.

180
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,560
Please look into this carefully.

181
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,440
I am willing to follow Minister Lin to the death.

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,880
Nonsense!

183
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,680
I don't know them at all.

184
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,520
Who sent you to frame me?

185
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,080
City Lord.

186
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,520
You can't be merciful anymore.

187
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,680
Take these people away and keep a close watch on them.

188
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Since they're so loyal,

189
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,360
let them

190
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,320
all go to the underworld together.

191
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,240
Take them away.

192
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,240
Move! Move!

193
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,200
City Lord.

194
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,520
City Lord!

195
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,880
City Lord.

196
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,240
I originally wanted to spare his dignity.

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,080
Let him confess on his own.

198
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,520
Spare his life and send him back to his hometown.

199
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,320
Let him live out his remaining years in peace.

200
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,000
I didn't expect him to be so ruthless.

201
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,800
Not only did he poison Liu Yun,

202
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,680
he even tried to break into the Heavenly Prison.

203
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,120
City Lord.

204
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Don't you find it strange?

205
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,440
They didn't act earlier or later, but chose tonight specifically.

206
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,240
When you appeared here,

207
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,000
that's when they showed up.

208
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,120
This...

209
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,640
You mean...

210
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,200
I dare not make reckless guesses.

211
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,440
Isn't it obvious?

212
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,000
What's there to guess?

213
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,880
They must be trying to assassinate the City Lord.

214
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,440
Li Yan.

215
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,320
I order you

216
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,080
to immediately lead people to search the Lin residence.

217
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,120
You must find the Dan Zhi Hong Yan Lao.

218
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,080
Bring it to me.

219
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,640
Make that old thief admit defeat.

220
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,440
Yes.

221
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,560
Also,

222
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,440
convey my verbal order.

223
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,680
Have the guards escort Miss Lin and Lin Sizheng

224
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,560
to the execution ground to await orders.

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,120
Once you have the evidence,

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
immediately have them executed.

227
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,760
Princess

228
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Nanling City

229
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,120
is going to execute

230
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,360
the Minister Lin and his daughter.

231
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
There have been a lot of big events lately.

232
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,440
Trouble just keeps coming one after another.

233
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,120
It looks like Miss Lin is doomed.

234
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,240
Princess

235
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,880
What should we do with this evidence?

236
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,760
Since he wants evidence,

237
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,320
let's just give it to him.

238
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,760
Yes.

239
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,880
Princess

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,320
Hurry up, hurry up!

241
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,920
Don't touch my daughter!

242
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,080
Forget it.

243
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,560
She's as good as dead.

244
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,000
Are you alright?

245
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,520
Let him enjoy his moment a little longer.

246
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,760
Come, you two.

247
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,440
Please.

248
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,560
Let's go.

249
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,800
Pay your respects to the Lady of the City.

250
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,800
The appointed time has arrived.

251
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,920
The criminals Lin Donghai and Lin Qianjin.

252
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,760
Execute.

253
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,800
In just a little while,

254
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,280
the seat of the city lord's wife

255
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,800
will be mine.

256
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,120
Sorry, Princess Liuyun,

257
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,040
but I might have to disappoint you.

258
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,800
Commander Li,

259
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,800
Princess Liuyun,

260
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,520
your actions

261
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,160
are already known to us.

262
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,160
I don't understand what you're talking about.

263
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,800
That's true.

264
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,120
Princess Liuyun has done so many bad things

265
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
that it's hard to remember them all at once.

266
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
That's quite possible.

267
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,880
Then let me remind you.

268
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,400
The first thing:

269
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,440
You poisoned Miss Lin.

270
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,000
That day, when you were drinking with Miss Lin,

271
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,800
you secretly put something in her wine flask

272
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,440
— the "Instant Beauty Fades" poison.

273
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,640
But unexpectedly,

274
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,160
because Chang Le interrupted,

275
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,400
you two took the wrong cups.

276
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,680
So you ended up poisoning yourself.

277
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,440
Princess

278
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,240
The next day, when you woke up,

279
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,640
Princess

280
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,800
you discovered your appearance

281
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,160
had become terribly aged.

282
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,280
You thought Miss Lin had switched the wine cup.

283
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,760
However, the poison the royal physician found in the cup

284
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,280
was actually the Night Camellia placed by Lu Yiwen.

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,520
So you kept pretending to be poisoned by Night Camellia

286
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
while secretly taking Little Yellow Flower

287
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,400
to restore your looks.

288
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,800
But unfortunately,

289
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,680
the symptoms you faked

290
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,760
did not match the real symptoms of Night Camellia poisoning

291
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,080
at all.

292
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,960
Commander Li

293
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,680
I really didn't do this.

294
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,040
Besides,

295
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,080
you have no evidence.

296
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,200
This is all just your speculation.

297
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,680
If I'm not mistaken,

298
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,280
that day at Shenlong Temple,

299
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,440
the assassin sent from Lover's Valley

300
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,040
was arranged by you, wasn't it?
