1
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
I thought you were

2
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,280
a spoiled and vicious crazy girl.

3
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,680
I even suspected

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,240
that you were the one who poisoned them.

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,240
So

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,560
so now you know

7
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,840
that I have a kind heart, right?

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,040
Miss

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,120
I want to tell you

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,960
I don't know when it started,

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,120
but I can't stand anyone speaking ill of you.

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,680
Nor can I allow you to suffer

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,840
any harm.

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,600
I want to always

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,960
be by your side to protect you.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,320
I realize that when you're happy,

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,840
I'm happy too.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,120
When you're sad,

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,080
I feel sad with you.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,040
Miss

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,320
I want to know everything about you.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,840
Me too.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,960
Although,

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,320
most of the time, you're

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,600
a big, silly, and clumsy blockhead.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,920
You're usually so foolish and silly.

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
But

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,240
because of you,

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,600
my heart always feels warm.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,080
I still remember

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,600
the last time we watched the sunrise together,

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,560
you said

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
back where we're from,

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
it takes two people who like each other

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
to watch the sunrise together.

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,080
So,

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,120
what if we watch the stars together?

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,800
Can I take it to mean

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,720
that you're confessing your feelings to me?

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,320
Is that it?

41
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,560
Is that it?

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Hurry, tell me, is it?

43
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Are you confessing to me?

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Is it?

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,320
Isn't that Dali?

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,360
What is he doing?

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
Yeah.

48
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,320
Come on, let's go take a look.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
Wait, something's off.

50
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,600
There must be something wrong with him.

51
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,560
Let's go.

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,960
Let's go.

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,200
Dali.

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,040
What are you cooking?

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,720
This stir-fried seasonal vegetable is the city lord's favorite.

56
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,440
Place it in front.

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,720
Yes.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,080
Take this abalone away.

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,080
The city lord hates extravagance the most.

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,800
Wait a moment.

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,200
Put the white fungus soup back on the stove to keep warm.

62
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,920
Bring it out when the city lord arrives.

63
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,440
Yes.

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Princess

65
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,920
The City Lord has already been notified.

66
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,200
The City Lord said

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,080
he will come over soon to have lunch with the Princess.

68
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,960
Then

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
did the City Lord mention the marriage alliance?

70
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,920
The City Lord said the Princess is thoughtful.

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,440
He will come at noon to discuss the wedding together.

72
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,080
Quick, have them light all the incense burners.

73
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
Don't let the smell of oil and smoke fill the room

74
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,960
and bother the City Lord again.

75
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,840
Yes.

76
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Reporting to Minister Lin,

77
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,200
our people found

78
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,480
the young lady's lost ribbon in Lover's Valley

79
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,560
along with bows and arrows from the Northern Yue people.

80
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,600
Where is the young lady?

81
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
The young lady

82
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
is still missing.

83
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,600
But we found

84
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,200
signs of a struggle involving the young lady and others.

85
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,120
We suspect the young lady was harmed by the Northern Yue people

86
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,840
and fell into the valley.

87
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
Then what are you still doing here?

88
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Hurry up and search for her!

89
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,440
If anything happens to the young lady,

90
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,840
I'll have your head.

91
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,200
Before you find the young lady,

92
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,960
if you let that Princess Liuyun

93
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,120
become the City Lord's wife,

94
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,120
I'll have your head as well.

95
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,200
Yes, yes.

96
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,080
I will obey.

97
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,080
Go quickly!

98
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,120
Father

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,560
This Princess Liuyun is really strange.

100
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,720
They've found both the poison and the antidote, right?

101
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,040
But she still hasn't woken up.

102
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,920
What's going on?

103
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,680
I was originally

104
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,440
a physician named Dali from Northern Yue.

105
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,960
But two years ago,

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,200
because I offended someone powerful,

107
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,080
I was punished by the city lord.

108
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,560
I was forced to take a poison.

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
Aging Beauty in a Snap

110
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,440
Aging Beauty in a Snap

111
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
Whoever takes this medicine

112
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,920
whether a young girl

113
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,960
or a charming young man,

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,280
their body will rapidly age.

115
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,240
I think the antidote should be

116
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,320
the little yellow flower.

117
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,360
So you've been living in seclusion here all this time?

118
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,080
Yes.

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Although the little yellow flower can cure

120
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,360
the poison of "A Beauty's Youth Fades in a Snap,"

121
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,640
it must be taken every day.

122
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,320
So I have no choice but to live here.

123
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,520
To preserve my life.

124
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,480
That day, when you fell from Lover's Valley,

125
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,880
I noticed you.

126
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,480
At first, I thought

127
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,360
you were here to silence me.

128
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,440
But after observing, I realized that wasn't the case.

129
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,520
Seeing you two together, I felt it was fate.

130
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,360
So I let my guard down.

131
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,120
And allowed you to stay here to recover.

132
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,760
I see.

133
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you, great healer.

134
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,880
So,

135
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,440
the poison Princess Liuyun was afflicted with

136
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,360
was "A Beauty's Youth Fades in a Snap."

137
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
Now the truth is finally revealed.

138
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,440
But,

139
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,120
why would Princess Liuyun

140
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,000
poison herself?

141
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,720
I think

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,080
the person she wanted to poison

143
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,840
was someone else.

144
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,360
It couldn't be...

145
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,520
me, could it?

146
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,520
Reporting to the Princess,

147
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,320
the City Lord says he is busy with official duties

148
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,360
and will come another day.

149
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,120
Your Highness, please calm your anger.

150
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,360
Help me get dressed.

151
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,760
Everyone inside, listen up.

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,640
You have one hour.

153
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,840
Release Miss Lin.

154
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,840
Otherwise,

155
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
I will not only destroy your post house,

156
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,840
but also flatten all of you,

157
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,000
and Beiyue City.

158
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,720
Release Miss Lin! Release Miss Lin!

159
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,120
Release Miss Lin! Release Miss Lin!

160
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,520
Arrest Minister Lin for me.

161
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,000
Everyone, stand down.

162
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,360
Are you trying to rebel?

163
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,480
City Lord.

164
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
Wait a moment.

165
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,640
My daughter!

166
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,240
Father! Father!

167
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,840
My daughter!

168
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
What happened to you?

169
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,840
Are you alright?

170
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,760
You’re not hurt, are you?

171
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,840
I’m fine.

172
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,760
You’ve suffered.

173
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,600
Why did you arrest my father?

174
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,600
I’m just glad you’re back safely.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,960
Because you went missing,

176
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,080
Minister Lin

177
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,000
even led soldiers to storm the post house to find you.

178
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,720
City Lord.

179
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,080
Since this happened because of me,

180
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,080
why not release my father,

181
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,000
and I’ll go back with you.

182
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,600
City Lord.

183
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,480
How about I accompany Minister Lin

184
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,600
and Miss Lin

185
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,240
together.

186
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,200
City Lord,

187
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
we have already investigated thoroughly.

188
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,880
We know the whole story.

189
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,760
I suspect that the person who poisoned the banquet that day

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,040
was not just Lu Yiwen.

191
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,920
There was another person involved.

192
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,200
Oh?

193
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,160
That person is Princess Liuyun.

194
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,400
Actually, all of this

195
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,400
was a scheme she orchestrated herself.

196
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
She originally intended to use the secret poison from Northern Yue

197
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
and make me drink the "Aging Beauty" poison.

198
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,520
Unexpectedly, even the heavens couldn't bear to watch.

199
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
She ended up suffering the consequences herself.

200
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,680
She even went so far as

201
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,920
to try to frame me for it.

202
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,320
She even wanted to kill me.

203
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,160
In fact, she did all of this

204
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,320
just so the City Lord would misunderstand me.

205
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,720
That way, she could become the City Lord's wife.

206
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,280
This little yellow flower can serve as proof.

207
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,160
You think you can just use any yellow flower as evidence?

208
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,840
This...

209
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,160
is far too childish.

210
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,400
What if I told you

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,280
that this little yellow flower

212
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,240
is actually the antidote to the "Aging Beauty" poison?

213
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,920
This...

214
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,640
Miss Lin,

215
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,960
stop trying to defend yourself.

216
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,920
Li Yan

217
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
What did you say?

218
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,640
City Lord, according to my investigation,

219
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,600
the poison that afflicted Princess Liuyun

220
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
is indeed a secret poison from Northern Yue.

221
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,800
It's called "A Beauty Ages in a Snap."

222
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,720
But this poison

223
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,120
was actually purchased by Minister Lin

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,640
in collusion with people from Northern Yue.

225
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,560
It was used to poison Princess Liuyun.

226
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,360
So that

227
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,640
Miss Lin could become the City Lord's wife.

228
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,440
And they wouldn't arouse suspicion from the people of Northern Yue.

229
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,720
Li Yan

230
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Do you know what you're saying?

231
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,480
Miss Lin, Minister Lin,

232
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,840
the two of you conspired to poison Princess Liuyun.

233
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,200
This is an undeniable fact.

234
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,440
You should confess as soon as possible.

235
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,280
That way, the City Lord might show you some mercy.

236
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,200
If this gets out of hand,

237
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,000
it will only get uglier.

238
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,480
Li Yan

239
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Stop distorting the truth.

240
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,000
You already investigated the poisoning.

241
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,200
You also proved my daughter's innocence.

242
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,000
Why are you trying to frame me today?

243
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,920
Let me tell you,

244
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,280
I, Lin,

245
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,560
have never done anything despicable.

246
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,280
City Lord,

247
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,560
my loyalty, Lin Donghai's loyalty, is as clear as day.

248
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,360
I would never collude with Northern Yue.

249
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,200
Minister Lin,

250
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
stop trying to argue.

251
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,920
Do you really think I have no evidence?

252
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,120
This

253
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,000
is the evidence of your collusion with Northern Yue.

254
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,000
City Lord, please take a look.

255
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,360
I really didn't expect this.

256
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,480
Those Nanling people who traded "Fleeting Beauty" powder,

257
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,840
turned out to be Lin, the Secretary of State.

258
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,120
City Lord.

259
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,480
Our City Lord

260
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,720
has already executed the Northern Yue people who colluded with Secretary Lin.

261
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Now it’s up to you, City Lord.

262
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,120
Let us give our City Lord an explanation as well.

263
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,000
Shut up.

264
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,360
City Lord.

265
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
You will believe me sooner or later.

266
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,720
I could never do such a thing.

267
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Li Yan.

268
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,280
He is clearly framing me.

269
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,560
And those

270
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,080
pretentious Northern Yue people,

271
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,480
they’re all in it together.

272
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,120
Lin Donghai.

273
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,000
What are you still arguing about?

274
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,280
Show him.

275
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,040
Guards!

276
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,160
Take Lin Donghai and Miss Lin

277
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,560
and throw them into the dungeon.

278
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,160
They will be executed on another day.

279
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,160
Yes.

280
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,920
Let me go!

281
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,280
Li Yan!

282
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,600
Does everything you told me before

283
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,760
mean nothing now?

284
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,040
You lied to me!

285
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,000
Take them away.

286
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,640
Move.

287
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,640
Li Yan!

288
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,840
Li Yan!

289
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,320
Li Yan!

290
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,200
City Lord.

291
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,640
Go.

292
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,600
Hurry up, move!

293
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,720
Isn't that Miss Lin?

294
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,440
Yes, that's really her.

295
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,280
I heard that Princess Liuyun

296
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,440
was poisoned by her and Minister Lin

297
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,680
working together.

298
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
It wasn't me.

299
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,400
I thought she had changed for the better.

300
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Turns out it was all an act.

301
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,680
Luckily, she didn't become the city lord's wife.

302
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
Otherwise, we would have been the ones to suffer.

303
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,680
That's right, we would have been the ones in trouble.

304
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,720
Miss

305
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,000
Don't be afraid.

306
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,120
Your father is here.

307
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,480
You've done so many heartless things.
