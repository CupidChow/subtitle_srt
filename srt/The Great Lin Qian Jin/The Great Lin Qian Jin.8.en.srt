1
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,560
Coming and going with the wind, wild geese fly diagonally before the peaks.

2
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,440
Feng Xian

3
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,720
You two have pulled it.

4
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,560
The only red string of fate that connects people across a thousand miles.

5
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,960
Who is destined with her?

6
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,760
Who is destined with him?

7
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,080
Little girl,

8
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,600
you look so blessed.

9
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,960
Let me make a sugar figurine for you.

10
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,200
Sure!

11
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,160
Miss,

12
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,360
what do you want me to make?

13
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,520
Draw...

14
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,840
How about making it look like his face?

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,040
Make him look a bit silly.

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,840
Even better if

17
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,040
you capture his totally clueless look.

18
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,080
Show it all in the figurine.

19
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,280
Forgive my ignorance,

20
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,120
but how do you make someone look silly?

21
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,120
And what exactly is a "totally clueless guy"?

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,480
Let me do it.

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,640
Done.

24
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,920
What kind of style is this?

25
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,200
This...

26
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,480
It's neither freehand nor meticulous.

27
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,480
This is a two-dimensional comic style.

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,920
Two-dimensional comic style?

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,280
How come I've never heard of

30
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,480
this kind of painting style?

31
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,200
There’s a lot you don’t know.

32
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,640
Just follow me and learn slowly.

33
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Brother Li Yan,

34
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,200
Brother Li Yan!

35
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,000
Where did you go?

36
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,920
I’ve been looking for you for so long.

37
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,200
Princess,

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
I was just looking for you.

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,120
But I ran into Miss Lin on the way.

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,840
She happened to take me to make a sugar figurine.

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,040
Sugar figurine

42
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,680
One eye is bigger than the other

43
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,040
Who is this supposed to be?

44
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,120
It's really ugly

45
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
Your Highness, you might not know

46
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,760
This is a style called

47
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,840
anime

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,320
the drawing style of anime

49
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,400
It's a drawing of a

50
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,920
dumb, hopeless straight guy

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,560
Dumb

52
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,680
dumb, hopeless straight guy

53
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,280
Actually, I think

54
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,320
the drawing is pretty good

55
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
Brother Li Yan

56
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,120
Why are you speaking up for Miss Lin?

57
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,760
You weren't like this before

58
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,280
Your Highness, I...

59
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,320
It's just that...

60
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,480
Miss Lin's craftsmanship is actually quite good.

61
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,280
Look at this.

62
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,920
This sachet of mine,

63
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,560
she made it too.

64
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,560
Brother Li Yan, how can you carry

65
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,920
a sachet sewn by that woman?

66
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,760
How about

67
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,200
you carry mine instead?

68
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,120
Didn't you say before

69
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,000
that my sachet has a unique fragrance?

70
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
Princess Changle,

71
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,720
although your fragrance is quite unique,

72
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,920
but

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,560
I have an even better one.

74
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,720
What is it?

75
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,920
This one is called

76
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,200
Night Begonia.

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,560
However,

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,000
because its ingredients are hard to find,

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
very few people have ever smelled it.

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,200
No matter how unique your fragrance is,

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,440
compared to this one,

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,160
it's just ordinary.

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,720
I thought it was something rare.

84
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,280
How do you know I don't have it?

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,320
So you do?

86
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,720
I...

87
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
Miss Lin,

88
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,840
I think you're just jealous of me.

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,840
Do you believe I'll order right now

90
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,600
that you're disrespecting the princess and have you arrested?

91
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,760
Princess,

92
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,560
why bother arguing with this crazy girl?

93
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,720
Let me escort you back first.

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,880
Alright, let's go, Brother Li Yan.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,880
Miss Lin,

96
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,040
but Brother Li Yan is taking me back.

97
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,920
Miss

98
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,480
Brother Li Yan

99
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,720
What happened to this young lady?

100
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,200
Miss

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,680
Lin Qianjin

102
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,160
What's wrong with you?

103
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,880
Jinjin

104
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,000
Jinjin

105
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,000
Jinjin

106
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,160
Get up

107
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,040
Jinjin

108
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,000
This girl suddenly fainted for no reason

109
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,320
That's so scary

110
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,280
Brother Li Yan

111
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,840
Were you sent by the city lord to investigate her

112
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,680
or to harm her?

113
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,160
Jinjin, let's go

114
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Young Master Lu

115
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,760
What happened to Miss?

116
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,400
Lian'er

117
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,840
Quick, go get the medicine I prepared for you earlier

118
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,480
and decoct it for Jinjin

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,040
Yes

120
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,760
By the way

121
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,760
Also

122
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,320
Jinjin just fainted from a sudden fright today

123
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,440
Don't tell Minister Lin

124
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,000
Alright

125
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,720
Jinjin must not have anything happen to her

126
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,480
Otherwise, how will I explain this?

127
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,320
Were you sent by the city lord to investigate her

128
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,600
or to harm her?

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,760
Jinjin

130
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,880
Jinjin

131
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,640
Jinjin

132
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,560
Get up

133
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,560
Let's take the medicine

134
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,360
Jinjin, how are you feeling?

135
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,200
Is your head still dizzy?

136
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
I'm much better

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,120
Thank you, Wenwen

138
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,440
But what exactly happened to me?

139
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,760
It's nothing serious

140
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,000
You just caught a bit of a chill

141
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,120
After taking the medicine

142
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,240
Just sleep a bit more and you'll be fine

143
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
I lost

144
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,120
After all, daily training

145
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,240
None of us are your match anymore

146
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,440
Chengfeng

147
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,960
You work hard every day

148
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,880
Of course, there are things more important than martial arts training

149
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,640
Xiao Lizi

150
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,320
Come on

151
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,640
This is the most relaxing time of the day.

152
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,120
Those officials in the city

153
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,800
All they do all day is talk about knowledge and propriety.

154
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Etiquette and rules.

155
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,320
You have to sit upright and proper even when eating.

156
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,560
You can only drink on big festivals.

157
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,640
Otherwise,

158
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,080
they'll say

159
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,560
that I

160
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,080
am harming my health and don't know what's appropriate.

161
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,440
Thinking about it,

162
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,320
ordinary people have it better.

163
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,800
They can

164
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,320
have a little drink

165
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
and enjoy the breeze whenever they want.

166
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,320
Life is like that of an immortal.

167
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,880
My Lord,

168
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,760
you are the ruler of this city.

169
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,680
You carry a heavy responsibility.

170
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,120
How can you compare yourself to ordinary people?

171
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
To be honest,

172
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,880
you should take care of your health.

173
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,520
As for this wine,

174
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,440
it's better to drink less.

175
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,120
Oh, come on.

176
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,200
Weren't you the one who taught me all this?

177
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,000
Remember when I was thirteen,

178
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,680
just named the heir to the city lord?

179
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,360
I was locked up here every day learning etiquette and rules.

180
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,320
To cheer me up,

181
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,520
you hid some wine and roast chicken here.

182
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,640
You kept me company, chatting about everything.

183
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,680
If it weren't for you,

184
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,200
I would have been bored to death.

185
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,560
Between us,

186
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
do we really need to say all this?

187
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,440
Come on.

188
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,880
Drink a little less.

189
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,880
Not bad.

190
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Let's talk about something serious.

191
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,000
The seven-day deadline is almost here.

192
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,360
How is the investigation going?

193
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,960
I found Miss Lin.

194
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,320
But there's no evidence that she poisoned Liuyun.

195
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,240
After investigating these past few days,

196
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,800
in my opinion,

197
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,640
Miss Lin is not the culprit.

198
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,320
Someone else is responsible.

199
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Did you find new evidence?

200
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,440
Not yet.

201
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,000
But

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,120
I've been staying by Miss Lin's side lately.

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,760
I've noticed

204
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,760
she just acts a bit eccentric,

205
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,360
and sometimes says surprising things.

206
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,120
But

207
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,680
she's not as vicious as the rumors say.

208
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,320
On the contrary,

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,760
she

210
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,560
is actually quite straightforward.

211
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
And it doesn't seem like she's pretending.

212
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,240
So I think

213
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,960
the one who poisoned Princess Liuyun

214
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,680
was not Miss Lin.

215
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Since when did you learn to be so evasive?

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you really believe

217
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
Miss Lin is innocent,

218
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,440
then hurry up and bring out the evidence.

219
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
Give everyone an explanation, understood?

220
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,320
Come on.

221
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,960
Alright.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,560
I'll do my best

223
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,760
to find the real culprit

224
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
and give everyone an explanation,

225
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,200
and also clear Miss Lin's name,

226
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,880
restoring her innocence.
