1
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,160
What are you doing?

2
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm here to make the request with you.

3
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,840
Then do you know

4
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,760
why I'm making this request?

5
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,760
It's because I, Li Yan,

6
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,880
will marry no one but you, Lin Qianjin.

7
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,040
It's raining, let's hurry.

8
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,080
Qianjin.

9
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,880
This is my decision alone.

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,440
Because I've found the one to spend my life with.

11
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,520
I'm willing to protect her for a lifetime.

12
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,200
In this world,

13
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
whatever she wants, whatever she likes,

14
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,720
I'll find it for her.

15
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,760
No matter where she goes,

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
whether it's

17
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,520
wandering the world,

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,840
or returning to the countryside,

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,280
or even the hometown

20
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,520
she talks about,

21
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,080
I'll give up everything

22
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,840
to go with her.

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
I will marry no one but you.

24
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,200
My resolve will never change.

25
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,960
This is probably the most touching thing

26
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,200
you, this blockhead, have ever said.

27
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,080
Why is it so hot?

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,080
No.

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,720
You can't kneel.

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,160
I'm fine.

31
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,080
Come back with me.

32
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,520
Li Yan.

33
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,840
Please listen, okay?

34
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,040
You really can't kneel anymore.

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
You'll lose your life.

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,720
I beg the city lord.

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,840
Please let the two of us be together.

38
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,280
Li Yan.

39
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
If you keep this up, you'll really die.

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,640
Let's go.

41
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,400
No.

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,720
I can't.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,280
I can't leave.

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,200
If I leave,

45
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,200
everything will be gone.

46
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,840
Let's go, please?

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,440
Is fate playing tricks on us?

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,400
Our ending

49
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,160
was already decided long ago.

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,760
Miss.

51
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,840
City lord.

52
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,960
Please listen to what I have to say.

53
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,400
Didn't you say

54
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,400
that in this world

55
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,640
you would give me whatever I wanted?

56
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,960
But what I want

57
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,080
is the position of the city lord's wife.

58
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,760
This is the one thing

59
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,040
I can't give you.

60
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,960
If you can't give it to me,

61
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,880
then go and marry your Princess Changle.

62
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,600
Miss,

63
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,760
you—

64
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,520
do you even know what you're saying?

65
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,640
I'm very clear about why I came here.

66
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,640
Escort Commander Li back to his residence.

67
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,200
Send for the royal physician.

68
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,440
Make sure he receives proper treatment.

69
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,880
Yes.

70
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,760
Please rest assured, City Lord.

71
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,280
I will fulfill everything I have promised.

72
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,960
I also ask the City Lord

73
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,520
to keep your word.

74
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,280
I have promised to make a clean break with Li Yan

75
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,760
and end things completely.

76
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,400
So that he will willingly marry Princess Changle.

77
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,600
I sincerely hope the City Lord

78
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,760
will pardon him for his grave disrespect.

79
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,760
And ensure his safety for the rest of his life.

80
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,960
Then, have you truly ended your feelings for him?

81
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
I take my leave.

82
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,080
Miss

83
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,760
Miss

84
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,560
Brother Li Yan

85
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,800
You're awake

86
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,320
Changle

87
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,320
It's you

88
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,040
Of course it's me

89
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
Who else would worry about you like I do?

90
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,920
Let me check if your fever's gone down

91
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,560
Changle

92
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,160
I'm fine now

93
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,400
You should go back

94
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,040
We're about to get married soon

95
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,960
You don't have to be so reserved

96
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,880
Between Changle and me

97
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,760
we're just like siblings

98
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,200
nothing more

99
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,200
I know you don't want to marry me

100
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,280
But I still can't understand

101
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,560
what's so good about Lin Qianjin

102
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,440
She's the one who made you like this

103
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,440
I'm the one who's been by your side, taking care of you

104
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,200
Changle

105
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,040
You're a good person

106
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
But in my heart

107
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,440
I've already had Lin Qianjin for a long time

108
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,680
I'm destined to let down your feelings, Changle

109
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,560
The one Changle loves in this life

110
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,200
shouldn't be me

111
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,760
You're still thinking about Lin Qianjin

112
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,760
The fate between you two has long run out

113
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,200
Now, the ones meant to be together are you and me

114
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,320
Do you know

115
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,040
she's now happily

116
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,680
preparing for her wedding

117
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,680
to become the city lord's wife

118
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,320
Miss

119
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,800
I have something to tell you

120
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,320
Li Sijun, you have trespassed into the City Lord's private residence.

121
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,800
If you’re not here to congratulate me,

122
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,320
please show some respect and leave.

123
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,160
Miss

124
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,560
can you tell me

125
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,400
why?

126
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,680
Why?

127
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,840
Didn't I make it very clear to you before?

128
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,520
I don't believe it.

129
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,680
Then, Li Sijun,

130
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
was I wrong about you from the very beginning?

131
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,560
I’ve always been cruel and heartless.

132
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,040
How could I ever truly care about anyone?

133
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,040
From start to finish,

134
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,800
you were nothing more than

135
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,320
a pawn to help me become the City Lord’s wife.

136
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,960
Just a chess piece, that’s all.

137
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Miss

138
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,160
Did I do something wrong?

139
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,040
Or did the city lord force you?

140
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,520
I told you before,

141
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,920
we would face everything together.

142
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,920
You promised me.

143
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,640
We would enjoy all the romantic things together.

144
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,160
In spring,

145
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,440
we would go for outings together.

146
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,040
And in summer,

147
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,960
we would jump into the pool and swim together.

148
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
In early winter,

149
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
with the one you love,

150
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,520
eat fried chicken together.

151
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,160
Drink beer and eat fried chicken.

152
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,320
These are all things you said.

153
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,800
I'll take you away right now.

154
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,640
Far away from this place.

155
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,080
Let's go.

156
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,560
No.

157
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,920
Come on, let's go.

158
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,440
Let go.

159
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,160
Come on, let's go.

160
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,560
Let go.

161
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,560
Was I not clear enough with you?

162
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,560
Do you still not understand?

163
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,640
From beginning to end,

164
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,920
I was lying to you.

165
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,040
Every minute I spent with you,

166
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,680
every second,

167
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,440
I felt miserable.

168
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,680
Go.

169
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,080
I'm not leaving.

170
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,080
Let go.

171
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,440
We once went through life and death together.

172
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
I won't let you go.

173
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,200
Let go.

174
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,560
I don't believe what you said. I don't believe it.

175
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:38,840
Let go.

176
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,320
Let me ask, in Nanling City,

177
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,920
which woman

178
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,760
doesn't want to become the city lord's wife?

179
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,960
Since the city lord favors me,

180
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,560
that is the blessing I deserve.

181
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,080
You can't possibly be naive enough to think

182
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,560
I would give up the position of city lord's wife

183
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,800
to be with someone like you,

184
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,640
a mere guard, right?

185
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,960
As for Li Sijun,

186
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,440
I advise you to quickly marry Princess Changle

187
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,440
to put an end to the rumors about us.

188
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,320
You should go.

189
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,560
Then what about this—

190
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,800
this—

191
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,040
Why did you personally

192
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,840
sew this sachet for me and give it to me back then?

193
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,680
If I hadn't found it,

194
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,040
would you have just abandoned it?

195
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,320
I treasure everything you gave me.

196
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,680
I was just afraid you would die.
