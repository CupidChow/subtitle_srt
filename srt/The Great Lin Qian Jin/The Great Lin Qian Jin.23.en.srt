1
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,280
Changle

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,560
Compared to Miss Lin,

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,360
where do I really fall short?

4
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,760
I'm sorry, Changle.

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,280
Brother Liyan,

6
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
do you know,

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,080
from the very first moment I saw you,

8
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,080
I felt that in this lifetime,

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,640
I would marry no one but you.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,000
But I never expected

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,840
that no matter if I acted cute and innocent,

12
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,080
or cold and charming,

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,120
or even tried to use the city lord's influence to pressure you,

14
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,480
no matter what I did,

15
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,760
you would never look at me twice.

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,000
I tried everything I could,

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,280
but I could never become the one in your heart.

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,920
Changle,

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,440
I truly hope

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,200
you can find someone who truly loves you,

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,480
cherishes you,

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,000
and protects you for a lifetime.

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,200
Brother Liyan,

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,440
I feel that nothing else matters.

25
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,040
Whether I can be with you or not

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,320
doesn't matter anymore.

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,360
I just hope you come back alive.

28
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,000
I hope that we

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,880
can still be like we were before.

30
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,320
Don't cry, Changle.

31
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,880
Brother Liyan,

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,280
don't cry.

33
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,760
I don't want your apology.

35
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,160
Maybe

36
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,880
this is the best outcome.

37
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,880
So this time,

38
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,320
I will be the most open-minded princess of Nanling City.

39
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,280
Our engagement

40
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,720
ends here.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,120
I know you're not doing this just for Miss Lin.

42
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,760
It's also for Nanling City.

43
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Brother Li Yan,

44
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,320
please,

45
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,000
come back safely.

46
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,440
I promise you.

47
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,480
Lian'er,

48
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,720
I'm the one who forced him onto the battlefield.

49
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,120
Miss,

50
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,040
please don't blame yourself.

51
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,920
Commander Li is a good man; fortune will favor him.

52
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,840
He will definitely come back safely.

53
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,480
Miss,

54
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,200
City Lord,

55
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,880
Miss,

56
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,600
Why are you crying?

57
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,160
I'm fine.

58
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,760
The wedding is approaching.

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,760
Miss, you...

60
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,360
Miss,

61
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,160
Miss, she was upset by this ugly sachet I made.

62
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,440
It made her cry out of frustration.

63
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,320
Miss Lin,

64
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,920
All these things brought in are rare treasures.

65
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,600
Why cry over such an ugly sachet?

66
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,160
Nanling and Beiyue are at war right now.

67
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,760
The City Lord is overwhelmed with work.

68
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,600
I can still come to see you at a time like this.

69
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,480
You see,

70
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,200
shouldn't you show some appreciation?

71
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,480
Since the City Lord is busy with official duties,

72
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,360
we should prioritize important matters.

73
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,200
I've been making a sachet lately.

74
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,000
It has the effect of refreshing the mind.

75
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,200
Once I finish it,

76
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,760
I'll deliver it to the City Lord myself.

77
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,440
Alright.

78
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Then I'll be waiting for you.

79
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,320
Okay.

80
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,640
Chief Hong,

81
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,240
let's go.

82
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,520
Yes.

83
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,680
Miss,

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,200
why go to such trouble?

85
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,880
No matter what,

86
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,680
becoming the City Lord's wife is a happy occasion.

87
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,640
You're right.

88
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,000
It is a happy occasion.

89
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,760
How is the battle going now?

90
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,680
After days of fighting,

91
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
supplies are running dangerously low.

92
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,800
Send for the supply officer immediately.

93
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,200
Transfer one hundred shi of grain for me.

94
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,400
Within two days,

95
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,240
make sure it reaches the camp.

96
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,880
Yes.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,680
Where is the deputy general?

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,440
Deputy General Lu has held the front line for two days and nights.

99
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
I'm afraid he can't hold out much longer.

100
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,200
What did you say?

101
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,520
Who says I can't hold out?

102
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,080
I never thought

103
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,760
I would meet you here.

104
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,080
As a man of Nanling,

105
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,440
it's my duty to defend my homeland without hesitation.

106
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,880
Alright.

107
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
From now on, we will

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
fight side by side.

109
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,880
Miss

110
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,680
Is she doing well?

111
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,120
She's doing very well.

112
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,760
She's about to become

113
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,000
the wife of the city lord.

114
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
She has finally fulfilled her wish.

115
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,440
Do your best.

116
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,960
Together,

117
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,240
let's return alive.

118
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,760
It's a promise.

119
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
Tomorrow is the big day.

120
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,400
Everyone, stay spirited.

121
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
Make sure everything is in order.

122
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,880
Don't let the Lin family lose face in front of the city lord.

123
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,800
This wedding dress fits so well.

124
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,440
And Miss is so beautiful.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You will surely be

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,560
the most beautiful city lord's wife in Nanling.

127
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,520
Miss,

128
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
Miss,

129
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
The big day is almost here.

130
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,880
You should be a little happier.

131
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,520
Miss, look quickly.

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,680
The Madam has given you the bracelet from her youth.

133
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,760
She has bestowed it upon you.

134
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
She said it's a wedding gift for you.

135
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
It shows that the Lord must have spoken well of you to the Madam.

136
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
He must have praised you a lot.

137
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,640
That's why the Madam is so fond of you.

138
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,400
If you like it,

139
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,400
just take it.

140
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,560
Miss.

141
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,760
Please forgive me, Miss.

142
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,120
Li Yan

143
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,760
I inherit the mandate of heaven and continue the grand legacy.

144
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,760
The way to govern a nation begins with managing the family.

145
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,880
The relationship between husband and wife reflects the order of heaven and earth.

146
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
It is truly with reverence for the ancestral rites.

147
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,760
And with sincere devotion to mutual support.

148
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,440
This is of utmost importance.

149
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,000
Lin Qianjin, daughter of the Minister of State,

150
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,560
possesses the virtue of chastity and calmness.

151
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,200
She is worthy to be a model of womanhood.

152
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,120
She should join in upholding the ancestral temples and the will of heaven and earth.

153
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,560
Hereby, she is appointed as the Lady of the City Lord.

154
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,120
Bestow upon her the fragrance of a hundred washes of moon branches.

155
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,240
Stop right there.

156
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,760
Move aside.

157
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,320
Wait.

158
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,120
Changle

159
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,440
Do not make a scene.

160
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,760
What is it?

161
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,320
Wait until the investiture ceremony is over to talk.

162
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,240
No.

163
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,880
There are things I must say right now.

164
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Lin Qianjin

165
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,000
This morning, news of battle came from the border.

166
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,440
Li Yan was assassinated.

167
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,760
He is gravely injured and unconscious.

168
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,000
The reinforcements he led are surrounded by Northern Yue soldiers.

169
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Perhaps, after this ceremony ends,

170
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,320
in this world,

171
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,440
there will be no more Li Yan.

172
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
What did you say?

173
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,880
Qianjin

174
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,640
What are you going to do?

175
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,440
Lin Qianjin

176
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,640
The position of City Lord's wife

177
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,560
is not something you can just refuse at will.

178
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,200
Even if you don't love me,

179
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,440
I will still marry you as

180
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,760
my City Lord's wife.

181
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,760
You must take on the responsibilities of the City Lord's wife.

182
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,440
No.

183
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,760
If Li Yan is gone,

184
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,200
then being the City Lord's wife

185
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,320
means nothing to me.

186
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,880
I just want Li Yan to live well.

187
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,640
Are you going to defy the City Lord's order?

188
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,000
Then, City Lord,

189
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,320
please punish me here and now.

190
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,960
Lin Qianjin

191
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,120
has defied the City Lord's order.

192
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,080
Exile her to the borderlands.

193
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,640
She is to depart immediately.

194
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
From this day forward,

195
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,320
she is forbidden from setting foot in Nanling City.

196
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,160
Go.

197
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,320
Nanling City

198
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,440
can no longer tolerate you.

199
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,920
Thank you, City Lord, for granting my wish.
