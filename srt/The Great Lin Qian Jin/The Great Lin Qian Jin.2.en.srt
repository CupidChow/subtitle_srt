1
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm so angry!

2
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,480
Lian'er

3
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,840
I want to take a bath.

4
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,160
You audacious scoundrel!

5
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,240
How dare you barge into my room without permission!

6
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,400
Speak.

7
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,800
You—

8
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,600
How do they say it in TV dramas again?

9
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,680
What are your intentions?

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
What are your intentions?

11
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,840
I—

12
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,800
I was just passing by.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,560
No, that's not it.

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
I was ordered to—

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
come check on Miss Lin.

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,120
You're making this up.

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,920
Go on, keep making things up.

18
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,840
Next, are you going to say

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,560
that it was me

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,400
who invited you here?

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,120
That's right.

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
It was you, Miss.

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,160
You were the one who arranged to meet me in your boudoir.

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,920
You're talking nonsense.

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
When did I ever arrange to meet you?

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,240
You're really playing with fire.

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,400
Where's your evidence?

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,480
Where's the letter?

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,360
Where's the item?

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,120
You can't produce it, can you?

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,800
In a moment, you'll say again

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,120
that it was me

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,720
who told you to burn the letter, right?

34
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,600
That's right.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,400
Exactly.

36
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,480
Miss, you said

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,240
to burn it after reading.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,680
The future city lord's wife is secretly meeting with the commander.

39
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,000
Secrets like this—

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,480
are people like us even allowed to know them?

41
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm afraid we will be

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
silenced, won't we?

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,120
Miss, please spare me! Please have mercy!

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,600
I didn't see anything.

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,760
I didn't hear anything.

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Well, Li Yan, you've got some nerve.

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,520
Now you’re even turning the tables on me.

48
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,520
I really underestimated you.

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,120
What I’m doing is called

50
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,040
using your own tactics against you.

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,720
No,

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,280
the two of us,

53
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,600
what grudge do we really have?

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,040
You—

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,800
Why do you insist on coming after me?

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,520
You’re so vicious.

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,400
And you’re still pretending to be crazy and clueless.

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,520
I’m vicious?

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,520
Tell me,

60
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,800
did I toy with your feelings,

61
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,520
or did I take advantage of you?

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,520
You’re shameless!

63
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,240
I—

64
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,280
Li Yan!

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,880
Don’t you dare harm my daughter!

66
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,400
This must be Lin Qianjin’s real father.

67
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,640
It’s Lin Sizheng.

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,520
Father!

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,000
Save me!

70
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,280
What did you just call me?

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,880
Dad!

72
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,360
My daughter!

73
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,800
Are you sick or confused?

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,160
What’s wrong with me?

75
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,360
Or did he do something to you?

76
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,280
I—

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,120
I’m scared, I’m scared!

78
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,920
Father!

79
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Li Yan!

80
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,640
You’ve got a lot of nerve.

81
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,120
How dare you hurt my daughter!

82
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,280
Minister Lin, there’s something you don’t know.

83
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,640
Your daughter is pretending to be crazy here.

84
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,760
Nonsense!

85
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,280
How could I not know my own daughter?

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,040
In the past,

87
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,280
she only called me “old geezer.”

88
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,400
Now her whole personality has changed.

89
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,640
She actually calls me

90
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,120
“father.”

91
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,280
It’s clearly you—

92
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
you’re the one who scared her silly.

93
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,800
Oh, my precious daughter…

94
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,880
Minister Lin,

95
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
please allow me to say something.

96
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,480
Your daughter tried to frame me.

97
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,640
I’ve already experienced how formidable she is.

98
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,400
If I so much as touch a finger of hers,

99
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,880
I’m afraid she’ll pretend to be dead and extort me.

100
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,760
I hope Minister Lin will see the truth.

101
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,800
You still want to touch a finger of mine?

102
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,280
And I’ll pretend to be dead and extort you?

103
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,640
Go ahead, try touching a finger of mine!

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,400
Just try touching a finger of mine!

105
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,000
Try it!

106
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,880
Go on, try!

107
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,920
City Lord

108
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,200
City Lord

109
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,320
This Officer Li secretly snuck into my residence

110
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,800
and interrogated and tortured my daughter.

111
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,040
Was this not done under your orders, City Lord?

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,720
Today,

113
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
you must give me an explanation.

114
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
What were you thinking?

115
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,080
I didn't expect things to turn out like this either.

116
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,320
What should we do now?

117
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,840
I think Minister Lin has misunderstood.

118
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,080
Yesterday, Princess Liuyun was poisoned and fainted.

119
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,320
Miss Lin also had a sudden fit for no reason.

120
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,960
I only went to check on them out of concern.

121
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,040
City Lord

122
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,440
I did not handle the matter properly.

123
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,840
Please punish me, City Lord.

124
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,440
If Officer Li

125
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,320
really went to investigate Miss Lin,

126
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,560
then

127
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,840
he should not be punished.

128
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,720
Miss Lin

129
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,960
in front of everyone,

130
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,960
poisoned Princess Liuyun of our city.

131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,680
Are you

132
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,720
going to let the real culprit go free?

133
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,840
There were many people present that day.

134
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,040
What evidence do you have to prove my daughter

135
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,200
is the criminal?

136
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,360
But as for Beiyue City,

137
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,200
they have always harbored ill intentions.

138
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,320
City Lord

139
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,200
I have just received a secret report from the border troops.

140
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,600
Beiyue City

141
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,480
is amassing a large army at the border.

142
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,680
They are making suspicious moves.

143
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm afraid

144
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,200
they want to use the Liuyun incident as a pretext

145
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
to start trouble

146
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,840
and invade our city.

147
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,040
Princess Liuyun

148
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,600
is the snow lotus

149
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,440
in the hearts of our people.

150
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,080
If the City Lord doesn't give an explanation,

151
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
our city will definitely not

152
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,320
let this matter rest.

153
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,840
City Lord,

154
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,440
please grant me the command token.

155
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,240
Allow me to lead troops

156
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,680
to the border to quell the unrest.

157
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,440
Give our city an explanation.

158
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,320
Li Yan,

159
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,600
why aren't you thinking of a solution?

160
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,200
What should we do?

161
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,840
This...

162
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,720
Alright, alright.

163
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,320
On one hand,

164
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,360
we have our allied nation.

165
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,200
On the other hand,

166
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
it's my trusted official.

167
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,200
I truly don't wish to see

168
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,560
discord between the two of you.

169
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,680
As for Princess Liuyun's case,

170
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,200
I...

171
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,920
City Lord,

172
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,320
I, Li Yan, am willing to investigate the truth

173
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,920
and find the real culprit.

174
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,480
I will give justice to Minister Lin and the envoy.

175
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
City Lord, this Li Yan

176
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,440
Li Yan

177
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,080
is the commander of my city guard.

178
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,840
He is upright and impartial.

179
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,320
He will surely handle the case fairly.

180
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
Let Li Yan take charge of this case

181
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
with full authority.

182
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,080
Yes.

183
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,720
Jin Jin.

184
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,680
Jinjin

185
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,200
It's only been half a day since we last saw each other,

186
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,720
and you've already suffered such a disaster.

187
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,960
I hate it.

188
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,920
I hate myself for leaving you.

189
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,200
Jinjin

190
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,680
Oh, come on.

191
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
Who are you?

192
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,560
Get away from me.

193
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,600
You don't even recognize me?

194
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,240
I'm Wenwen.

195
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Lu Yiwen

196
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,080
Lu Yiwen

197
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,840
I don't know you.

198
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,480
Do you believe I'll slap you?

199
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,080
Someone, come here!

200
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,200
Li Yan

201
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,560
You scoundrel!

202
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,360
How could you harm my Jinjin like this?

203
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,360
Qianjin

204
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,440
I came today just to say goodbye to you.

205
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,440
Even if it costs me my life,

206
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,320
I'll take down Li Yan to avenge you.

207
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,080
Wait.

208
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,200
You remember me now?

209
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,720
No.

210
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,160
I just wanted to say,

211
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,360
if you want to kill someone, go ahead,

212
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,720
but don't drag me into it.

213
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Go away, are we even that close?

214
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,080
We grew up together, you know.

215
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,840
We may not be related by blood,

216
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,240
but we're closer than family.

217
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,080
Then

218
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,440
What was I like before?

219
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
You, before...

220
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
You, before...

221
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,360
You were truly unrivaled.

222
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,240
A person invincible in the world.

223
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,320
But now,

224
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,240
You don't speak with the same authority as before.

225
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Li Yan

226
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,840
I'll chop you up.

227
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Wait a moment.

228
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,080
Killing him isn't a big deal.

229
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,720
This person actually seems to genuinely care about me.

230
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360
I need allies right now.

231
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,040
Seeing how well-equipped you are,

232
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,720
your martial arts must be excellent.

233
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,800
Let's go with him.

234
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,200
Run!

235
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,960
The little poison girl is coming!

236
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,960
Back in Nanling City,

237
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,360
you were admired by tens of thousands.

238
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,240
Everyone knew you were the future wife of the city lord.

239
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,960
So,

240
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,720
whenever people saw you,

241
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,080
they would spontaneously show you the highest respect.

242
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,440
Wherever you went,

243
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,720
the people were overjoyed.

244
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,920
They would generously offer you everything they had.

245
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,200
Over time,

246
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,960
an unwritten rule developed among the people.

247
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,600
Thank you.

248
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,720
Any shop visited by the young lady

249
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,040
would become the most prosperous shop in all of Nanling City.

250
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,840
Business would definitely boom.

251
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,560
So I'm actually this popular in Nanling City

252
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,040
I'm really that well-liked?

253
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,320
Yes, you are.

254
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,840
Yeah, right.

255
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,560
I saw you secretly giving them silver.

256
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,080
I know.

257
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,440
You just didn't want me to feel bad.

258
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,720
But thinking about it,

259
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,920
being a spoiled and bossy rich girl

260
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,480
is actually kind of fun.

261
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,800
If you haven't had enough fun,

262
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,960
I can take you to another market.

263
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,200
Still want to play?

264
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,800
You sure have a lot of money.

265
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,800
Once is enough for this kind of thing.

266
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,360
Don't trouble the common people anymore.

267
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Besides,

268
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,440
I'm not that kind of person.

269
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,360
Why did you bump into someone?

270
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,200
You bumped into me first.

271
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,920
How can you accuse me when you're the one at fault?

272
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,720
Miss, are you alright?

273
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,760
Don't kill me.

274
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,880
Don't kill me.

275
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,280
I...

276
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,880
Who's trying to kill you?

277
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,360
I just saw you fall.

278
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,600
So...

279
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,560
Help!

280
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,280
Why is it you again?

281
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,840
You really are such a blockhead.

282
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,000
Are you going to draw your sword every time you see me?

283
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,960
Miss Lin, I advise you

284
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,920
not to say

285
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,280
such foolish or crazy things.

286
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,520
Brother,

287
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,960
look,

288
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,320
you're so handsome and impressive,

289
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,160
and full

290
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,840
of righteousness.

291
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,360
Now look at me,

292
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,320
I have such a cute face,

293
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,600
and look so innocent.

294
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
You must have caught the wrong person.

295
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
I've never caught the wrong person.

296
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,640
Li Yan, how dare you!

297
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
You still dare to bully Jin Jin?

298
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,960
I haven't even settled the score with you yet,

299
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,760
and now you show up yourself?

300
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,080
If you attack the City Guard,

301
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,160
do you know what the consequences are?

302
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,560
But the young lady,

303
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,960
is innocent.

304
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,680
If Young Master Lu shelters the suspect,

305
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,000
he will be guilty as well.

306
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,000
What suspect?

307
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,080
I don't like that word.

308
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
Take it back right now.

309
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,360
I advise Miss Lin once again,

310
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,520
not to speak nonsense.

311
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,640
Pretending to be crazy and foolish.

312
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,600
Pre- Pretending to be crazy and foolish? What do you mean?

313
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,520
I don't understand at all.

314
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,600
What is he talking about?

315
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,520
Then I'll say it again.

316
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,040
You'd better listen carefully.

317
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,680
I will definitely find

318
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,320
the evidence that you poisoned Princess Liuyun.

319
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,480
When the time comes,

320
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,800
you will surely pay the price.

321
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,160
Farewell.

322
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,600
He, he, he

323
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,400
He just said, who was poisoned?

324
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,040
Princess Liuyun

325
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
What happened to Liuyun?

326
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,480
She was poisoned by drinking at the banquet.

327
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,320
Then, then, then

328
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,960
What about me?

329
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,240
You are the suspect.

330
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,040
Me?

331
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,600
Yes, you are the suspect.

332
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,760
Me?

333
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,120
You're the suspect who poisoned Liuyun.

334
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,600
No, no

335
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm not.

336
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,480
I didn't do it.

337
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,160
Don't talk nonsense!

338
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,400
Don't get upset, Jinjin.

339
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,880
Of course I believe you.

340
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,120
But

341
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
Actually

342
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,880
However

343
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,320
I'm not so sure either.

344
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,120
Who knows?

345
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,680
Before I came over

346
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,400
That vicious young lady

347
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,240
might have done something like this.

348
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,320
Here, in your place

349
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,520
usually

350
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,600
if someone poisons a princess from a neighboring city

351
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,760
what's the usual punishment?

352
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,680
If convicted

353
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,520
unless the city lord grants a special pardon

354
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
otherwise, it's the death penalty.

355
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,920
Death penalty.
