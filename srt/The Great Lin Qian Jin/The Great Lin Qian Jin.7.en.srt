1
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,160
No.

2
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,080
How could there not be?

3
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,520
Thank you both for waiting.

4
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,840
Come, take a look.

5
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,280
Come.

6
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,640
Take a look, take a look.

7
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,920
Why does this fragrance smell a bit special?

8
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,720
It's very precious.

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:19,960
Boss.

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,520
How do we know if what you're saying is true?

11
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,320
What if you're just like the other shops,

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,160
and deliberately deceiving us?

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,840
I have proof here.

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,840
Wait a moment.

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,200
This one is the Chen family's young lady.

16
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,520
This one is the eldest daughter of the Zhang family.

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,200
That's impressive.

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,840
And this one,

19
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,720
is the personal maid of Princess Changle.

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,280
Xiang'er.

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Xiang'er.

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,840
What the boss said,

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,720
you heard it too, right?

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,720
Now I can finally prove my innocence, right?

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,400
That's not necessarily true.

26
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,720
That's just his side of the story.

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,640
What if he just wants you to buy the spices,

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,960
and randomly made up some names,

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,040
and invented some identities?

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,480
Impossible.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,280
The boss sounded so convincing.

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,640
If he really made up the identities,

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,160
then at least we know

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,640
that Changle and Xiang'er's identities are real, right?

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,760
Why are you always picking on me?

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,520
It's like you don't want me to clear my name.

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,960
What are you really up to?

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,320
Say something.

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,920
I'm just talking about the facts.

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,840
Don't overthink it.

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,280
Just talking about the facts, huh?

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,960
Then let me explain it to you clearly.

43
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,520
First of all,

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,400
the boss doesn't even know me.

45
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,320
Lian'er’s name isn’t in the account book either.

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,760
Secondly,

47
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,400
which is what I just mentioned,

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,040
the issue with Chang Le and Lian'er's identities.

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,160
Most importantly,

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,640
I have absolutely no motive to commit a crime.

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,080
Chang Le likes you.

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,920
You like Liu Yun.

53
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,400
So Chang Le wants to get rid of Liu Yun.

54
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,960
That makes perfect sense, doesn't it?

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,520
In the end, the real culprit

56
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,040
is you, the playboy.

57
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,640
Me?

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,160
What about it?

59
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,840
Got nothing to say now, do you?

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,280
If you don't believe me,

61
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,520
you can go ask Chang Le.

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,520
After all, she likes you, doesn't she?

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
This is amazing.

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,160
I'm not dead.

65
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,520
Looks like I wasn't poisoned by the night camellia.

66
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,040
What are you laughing at?

67
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,280
Didn't you really dislike me before?

68
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,720
I've never said I disliked you.

69
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,960
You're the one who's always trying to make me dislike you.

70
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,720
But the way you act

71
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,160
makes it seem like you really dislike me.

72
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,720
You're being unreasonable.

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,400
Come down.

74
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,600
No, no.

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm dizzy, so dizzy.

76
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,160
Why aren't they back yet?

77
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,400
Where did they go?

78
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,600
Why does my brother insist

79
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,640
on having Brother Li Yan follow Miss Lin?

80
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,720
Are all the people in the Lin household useless?

81
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Princess, keep your voice down.

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
It wouldn't be good if Minister Lin heard you.

83
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,960
Miss Lin, come down right now!

84
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm not coming down.

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,960
What can you do about it?

86
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Come down.

87
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,080
Don't pull me.

88
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
You're clinging to Brother Li Yan.

89
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,760
You spoiled princess.

90
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,400
Come down, Changle.

91
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,160
Let go, let go!

92
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,280
I'll come down.

93
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,040
Put me down.

94
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,160
Are you really okay?

95
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,200
I'm fine.

96
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Brother Li Yan.

97
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,640
The lantern festival is tonight.

98
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,960
Let's go see the lantern festival together.

99
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,640
Sure, sure.

100
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,040
Li Yan loves watching the lantern festival the most.

101
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,280
Isn't that right, Li Yan?

102
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,960
Look at his expression.

103
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,840
He agreed to go to the lantern festival with you.

104
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,080
Take the opportunity to investigate the case.

105
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,720
Miss Lin is right.

106
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,600
Princess.

107
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,080
Let's go to the lantern festival together.

108
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,280
Brother Li Yan.

109
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Then it's settled.

110
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,720
No being late.

111
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,080
Jin Jin.

112
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
The lantern festival is tonight.

113
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,640
Let's go have fun at the lantern festival together.

114
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,080
Sure.

115
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,520
I love lively events the most.

116
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
It's really beautiful.

117
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm going to play for a bit.

118
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,200
Make sure you handle your business quickly.

119
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,280
Get it done fast.

120
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,920
Wenwen, let's go check out the front.

121
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,840
Let's go.

122
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,200
Let's go.

123
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,400
I really can't stand Lin Qianjin.

124
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,960
She acts like such a wild girl.

125
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,720
So unsophisticated.

126
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,760
Cotton candy.

127
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,080
Brother Li Yan.

128
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,280
Let's go check that out.

129
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,280
They're even selling cotton candy.

130
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,400
Brother Li Yan.

131
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
Which of these two looks better?

132
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,520
They both look good.

133
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,600
What a blockhead.

134
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,760
At least ask!

135
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,960
Come here.

136
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,040
Did you ask or not?

137
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,720
Not yet.

138
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,080
I knew it.

139
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,320
Here, give this to her.

140
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,560
Give this to Changle.

141
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,040
I'm leaving.

142
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,040
Brother Liyan.

143
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,400
Did you buy this for me?

144
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,800
Yes.

145
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,200
Thank you, Brother Liyan.

146
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,800
Changle

147
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,200
You, today

148
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,040
smell really nice.

149
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,840
Brother Liyan

150
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,040
You could even smell that?

151
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,200
Isn't the scent quite special?

152
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,680
I had Xiang'er

153
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,320
buy it for me specially from Shibali Shop.

154
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Shibali Shop?

155
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,560
That's right.

156
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,080
They have all sorts of strange medicines there.

157
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,800
Brother Liyan, do you need anything?

158
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
I can help you ask around.

159
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
No wonder it smells so unique.

160
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,680
What's inside it?

161
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,160
Nothing special, really.

162
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,320
Just some ordinary spices.

163
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,160
Changle

164
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,040
Did you ask or not?

165
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Let's go.

166
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,440
Liyan

167
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,920
It's me, Wenwen.

168
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,560
Why is your mind now

169
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,440
filled with that Liyan?

170
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,720
Sorry!

171
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,960
I've been investigating cases with that blockhead lately.

172
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,080
It's made my brain all muddled.

173
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,200
So how's your case going?

174
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,560
No problem at all.

175
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,720
Is there anything I, Lin Qianjin, can't handle?

176
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,640
We'll know the result tomorrow.

177
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,320
So,

178
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,440
have you found out who the culprit is?

179
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,200
Not yet.

180
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,680
But we'll know very soon.

181
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,440
You used to never hide anything from me.

182
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,640
Ever since you met that Li Yan,

183
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,280
we've both started keeping secrets.

184
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,280
From now on, if anything happens,

185
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,960
I'll tell you first, right away.

186
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,960
But,

187
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,560
this time, it's because the matter is too serious.

188
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,960
I didn't want to drag you into it.

189
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,680
But later on,

190
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,160
I might come to you for help.

191
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,040
Alright.

192
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
Then if you need help,

193
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,960
you must tell me.

194
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,560
Okay.

195
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,280
Anyway, I'm willing to help you with anything.

196
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,800
Okay.

197
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,920
There's a dragon dance up ahead.

198
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,640
Let's go watch!

199
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,040
Let's go.

200
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,040
Alright, alright.

201
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,920
It's so beautiful!

202
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,840
Jinjin.

203
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,800
Jinjin.

204
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,160
Wenwen.

205
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,960
Jinjin.

206
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,920
Wenwen.

207
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Jinjin.

208
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,720
Wenwen.

209
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,840
Jinjin.

210
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,920
Brother Li Yan.

211
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,680
Wenwen.

212
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,640
Oh, right.

213
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,400
How did it go asking about Changle?

214
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:44,960
Almost.

215
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,080
I even had you buy cotton candy.

216
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,560
How is it still just "almost"?

217
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,680
Seriously.

218
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,160
There are river lanterns over there.

219
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,720
Let's go release river lanterns.

220
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,440
Let's go.

221
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,520
Aren't you going to pay?

222
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,920
How did your hands get dirty?

223
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,680
Here.

224
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,440
It's fine, I can do it myself.

225
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,040
Don't move.

226
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,080
What's this strange thing?

227
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,640
Tell me if you want to buy something, don't touch everything.

228
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,400
Be careful.

229
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,440
This isn't anything special.

230
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,960
What's wrong with touching it a little?

231
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,920
What are you doing?

232
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,680
Hurry up and go.

233
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,800
Come back here!

234
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,280
Let's go take a look over there.

235
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
It's so beautiful.

236
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,040
You two.

237
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Would you like to guess a lantern riddle?

238
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,920
Sure!

239
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,920
Boss.

240
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Is there a prize if we guess correctly?

241
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,920
Yes, there is.

242
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,800
The prize is a sugar figurine—delicious and fun.

243
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,960
I can even make it according to your request.

244
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,800
You blockhead.

245
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,440
You're bound to lose to me today.

246
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,560
That's just a petty trick.

247
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,840
Looking south, a lone star rises with the crescent moon.

248
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,800
Dignity.

249
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,920
Mandarin ducks play together in the water.

250
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,200
Pairs of butterflies flutter among the flowers.

251
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,680
Love.

252
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,800
Waiting for a fated meeting.

253
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,560
And enjoying spring, summer, autumn, and winter together.

254
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,560
Heaven and earth.

255
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,040
The wind comes and goes; wild geese fly slantwise before the peaks.

256
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,920
Impatiens.
