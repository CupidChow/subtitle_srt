1
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,440
I mean, give me your hand.

2
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,320
You want to—

3
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,320
Are you going to eat my hand?

4
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,360
If you don't bandage the wound in time,

5
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,960
it could get infected.

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,040
It's nothing.

7
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,600
It's just a minor scratch anyway.

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,560
It's no big deal.

9
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,720
Look who's talking.

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,840
Your own wound is still bleeding.

11
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,680
I'm fine.

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,600
No way.

13
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,280
Come here.

14
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,920
I'll do it myself.

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,560
Don't move, let me do it.

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,680
I—I...

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,560
Be gentle.

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,680
It's okay.

19
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,560
What are you doing?

20
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,320
In my hometown,

21
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,600
if you draw patterns on a bandage,

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,720
it means

23
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,960
a beautiful wish

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,560
can come true.

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,840
Your hometown?

26
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,160
I mean,

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,160
my mother's hometown.

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,600
So,

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,320
is that different from Nanling?

30
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Of course it's different.

31
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,920
Everyone is equal there.

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,320
And two people,

33
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,440
it's because of love

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,280
that they are attracted to each other.

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,560
They also do many, many romantic things together.

36
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,840
Romantic?

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,560
Yes.

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,960
Romantic things like

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,480
in spring,

40
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,320
going on an outing with the one you like.

41
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,200
In summer,

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,960
jumping into the pool and swimming together.

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,960
When autumn comes,

44
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,320
the two of you climb up high to watch the sunrise.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,440
Oh, right.

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,040
The most important thing

47
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,080
is in winter.

48
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,200
On the first snowy day,

49
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,840
you must be with the one you like

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,680
eating fried chicken

51
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,080
and drinking beer together.

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,440
He... he fell asleep just like that.

53
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,680
Reporting to the city lord,

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,960
Miss Lin has arrived.

55
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,440
How dare you sit on this throne?

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,840
What are you doing?

57
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,320
It's so hard.

58
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,440
I don't even like it.

59
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,080
You—

60
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,080
How dare you!

61
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,920
What do you mean, "you"?

62
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,960
I just want to know

63
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,160
what the city lord usually does.

64
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,680
You really have no regard for proper manners.

65
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,480
How am I not being proper?

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,200
You completely ignore me.

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
You don't even look at me.

68
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,040
Tell me,

69
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,960
isn't that being rude?

70
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,360
No one has ever dared speak to me like this.

71
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,680
You're the first.

72
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,840
Fine.

73
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,680
I'll stay right here

74
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,280
and listen to what you have to say.

75
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,480
Let's see how you interpret the "Lessons for Women."

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
My understanding of the "Lessons for Women" is

77
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,440
that women here

78
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,160
live such miserable lives.

79
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,680
Miserable?

80
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,360
Yeah.

81
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,840
Doesn't the book say

82
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,320
that women should always be humble and yielding,

83
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,960
put others before themselves,

84
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,080
and ideally,

85
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,320
be even more hardworking,

86
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
working all day long?

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,560
What else?

88
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,680
Take care of themselves,

89
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,360
and if there's nothing to do,

90
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,280
go out less and play less.

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,440
Whenever something happens,

92
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,480
they should always put their husband first.

93
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,080
Tell me,

94
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,280
isn't that just too miserable?

95
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,920
Then if it's like you said,

96
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,720
that a woman living for her husband is miserable,

97
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,200
then

98
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,080
what would not be miserable?

99
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
I think

100
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,680
men and women

101
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,040
should be equal.

102
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,040
We all have the right to pursue our dreams.

103
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,280
Everyone should have their own hobbies.

104
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,560
Why revolve around men every day?

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,320
It's boring.

106
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,960
How meaningless.

107
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,680
So you love when you want to love,

108
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,800
and do what you want to do.

109
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Li Yan is right.

110
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,840
You really have become much more straightforward.

111
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,840
So what you're after now

112
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,680
is to become my wife, the Lady of the City,

113
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,920
isn't it still for the recipe?

114
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,360
I'm also trying to prove

115
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,320
that even a notorious heiress can turn over a new leaf

116
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,160
and one day care for the people like her own children.

117
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,560
This Miss Lin is quite interesting.

118
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,160
Let me walk you back.

119
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,840
Consider it a thank you for bandaging me up

120
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,040
and for drawing the pattern.

121
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,200
It's nothing, I can go back myself.

122
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,960
Miss Lin,

123
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,160
Miss Lin,

124
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,720
Miss,

125
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,600
It's so bitter.

126
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,280
Finish this bowl,

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
and I'll buy you some candy.

128
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,440
Here,

129
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,360
have another sip.

130
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,280
Jinjin

131
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,600
Are you okay?

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,240
Wenwen

133
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,560
I'm fine.

134
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,400
No need for you to worry, Commander Li.

135
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,120
I'll take care of Jinjin myself.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,040
Jinjin, how are you feeling?

137
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,400
Did you just faint?

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,320
How did you know?

139
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,440
What are you doing?

140
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,240
Don't move.

141
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,320
Your pulse is a bit unsteady.

142
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,240
Wenwen

143
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,440
How do you know everything?

144
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
If Wenwen doesn't understand Jinjin,

145
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,080
how can she help her become the city lord's wife?

146
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,920
Don't you think so?

147
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,280
From now on, I'll handle making the medicine.

148
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,000
Well then,

149
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,080
I'll go check out the kitchen first.

150
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Get familiar with the place.

151
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,080
Thank you, Wenwen.

152
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,280
I took some medicine.

153
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,160
How are you feeling now?

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
Much better.

155
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,800
What about today?

156
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,920
You should just rest well.

157
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,640
No.

158
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,360
What are you going to do?

159
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,440
I need to get up quickly.

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
From yesterday to today,

161
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,920
I've already wasted a whole day.

162
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,920
I need to hurry and investigate the case.

163
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,000
Lin Qianjin, come out here!

164
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,280
Brother Li Yan

165
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,080
Why are you taking care of this woman?

166
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
Changle, you're so willful.

167
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
You've learned to show up uninvited now.

168
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,640
Then when you went to my place,

169
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,000
and did those sneaky things,

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,360
did you let me know?

171
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,200
You poisoner!

172
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,800
I—

173
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,200
You're the real poisoner!

174
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,920
Changle.

175
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,920
Come here.

176
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,440
Changle.

177
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,640
Tell me the truth.

178
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,840
Did you secretly keep any night begonia or not?

179
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,440
I...

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,640
Changle.

181
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,200
You must tell the truth.

182
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,920
This concerns Princess Liuyun's life.

183
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,360
Brother Liyan,

184
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,280
I do have night begonia,

185
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,920
but—

186
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,560
I used it to make the "Begonia Mystery,"

187
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,280
which is for skincare.

188
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,840
If you don't believe me, come back to my residence and check.

189
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,360
I heard that night begonia

190
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,920
can be made into excellent skincare products.

191
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,640
After using it, your skin becomes smooth as jade.

192
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,360
The princess asked me to buy a tael or two of night begonia.

193
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,560
It's all here.

194
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,280
Weren't you going to make the "Begonia Mystery"?

195
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,160
The process for "Begonia Mystery" is complicated.

196
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,720
I haven't learned it yet.

197
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm afraid of ruining it.

198
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,160
So I haven't used the night begonia yet.

199
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,920
How can I be sure

200
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,280
that this is really a tael?

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Xiang'er, bring the scale.

202
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,920
Seven qian

203
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,160
Then we're still short three qian.

204
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,320
Still missing three qian.

205
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,320
Didn't you say you didn't make the Haitang Mystery?

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,640
Then it seems you poisoned Liuyun.

207
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,880
Princess

208
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,200
Is that true?

209
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,280
I didn't.

210
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,480
Li Yan, even you don't believe me?

211
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,880
Then tell me,

212
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,200
these missing three qian,

213
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,760
what did you do with them?

214
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,160
I...

215
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,360
See? See?

216
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,360
You can't explain it, can you?

217
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,480
You, a dignified princess,

218
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,760
actually poisoned Liuyun,

219
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,480
and tried to frame me for it.

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,480
Let's go.

221
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,640
You're coming with me to see the city lord.

222
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,040
I want to see what the city lord has to say.

223
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,640
Let go! I didn't poison anyone!

224
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,080
I remember now!

225
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Princess, Miss Lin, Commander Li

226
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,160
I remember now!

227
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Xiang'er, what are you doing?

228
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,480
Wait!

229
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,080
Look, it's exactly one tael.

230
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,480
What's going on here?

231
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,760
Your Highness, please forgive me.

232
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
I was flustered and almost forgot.

233
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,040
I once put three qian of night begonia in Your Highness's sachet.

234
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Enough, Xiang'er.

235
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,760
Miss Lin.

236
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,160
I now suspect

237
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,320
that you are the one who poisoned Princess Liuyun.

238
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,280
You were so eager to accuse me just now.

239
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
It seems to me you just want a scapegoat.

240
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,360
to help you escape blame.

241
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,720
That's right.

242
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,160
I...

243
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm not.

244
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,280
You haven't cleared your own name.

245
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,360
And you want to drag me down with you.

246
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,720
I didn't!

247
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,560
Brother Li Yan, you saw that, right?

248
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,880
This vicious woman

249
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,160
has shown her true colors so quickly.

250
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,280
I don't want to stay with her even a moment longer.

251
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,560
Xiang'er, see the guest out.

252
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,480
Miss Lin, please.

253
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,640
I...

254
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,160
Brother Li Yan.

255
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,480
I've already had good food and wine prepared.

256
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,040
Please stay and eat with me.

257
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,840
Miss Lin, what's wrong?

258
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,200
Wait.

259
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,880
Don't fall here.

260
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,600
Brother Li Yan.

261
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,640
Miss.

262
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,160
Miss Lin.

263
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,240
Miss.

264
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,920
The city lord ordered me to protect Miss Lin for seven days.

265
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,800
Then I won't stay, Your Highness.

266
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,880
I'm so angry!
