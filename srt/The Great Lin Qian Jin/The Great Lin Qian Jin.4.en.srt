1
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,880
To clear my name,

2
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,640
I have to investigate the root cause.

3
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,920
I need to meet this Princess Liuyun.

4
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,760
I'm really not the one who poisoned you.

5
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,640
But don't worry.

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,920
I will definitely help you find the real culprit.

7
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,880
But

8
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,000
if

9
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,000
the culprit really is

10
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,360
that Miss Lin from before,

11
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,760
then I'll accept it.

12
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,240
But if it really isn't me,

13
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,400
I can't just die wrongly accused.

14
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,640
Did you find out that Princess Liuyun is still alive

15
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,120
and now want to harm her again?

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
You had Minister Lin

17
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,000
pretend to discuss important matters

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,360
to get the city lord to send me away,

19
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,160
while

20
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,880
you came here to harm Princess Liuyun.

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,040
I used to think you were

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,600
but I didn't expect

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
you'd be such a ruthless woman.

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,680
I underestimated you.

25
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,520
Can you not be so worked up?

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,240
I'm not the real culprit.

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,760
I came here

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,120
just to check

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,240
what medicine Liuyun took,

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,920
so I can figure out what poison she was given.

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,760
Don't you think what you're saying

32
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,280
is basically admitting your guilt?

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,920
You're truly vicious.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,520
I absolutely can't let you harm anyone else.

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,680
Aren't you tired of this? Here you go again.

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Tell me,

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,240
if someone found out

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,640
that a man and a woman are alone together in a room,

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,880
what would they think?

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,680
I'm just here to investigate you.

41
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,400
Oh my god

42
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,800
It actually feels a little romantic

43
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:30,920
Let's go

44
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,400
Come with me to the Supervision Bureau

45
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,520
Go

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,920
Go to the Supervision Bureau

47
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
Is it getting beaten or going to jail?

48
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,280
No, no, no

49
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,600
I'm not going

50
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,400
It's not up to you

51
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Last time you pretended to be crazy

52
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
I already let you off once

53
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,640
This time you have to come with me

54
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,760
No way

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,360
You

56
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,400
I... I can't go

57
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,040
Let go of me

58
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,120
Wait

59
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,880
My stomach hurts

60
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,920
Stomach hurts

61
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,120
Yeah

62
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,040
My stomach

63
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,000
Feels really uncomfortable

64
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,880
The living conditions at the Supervision Bureau

65
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,280
are so harsh

66
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,520
What if something happens

67
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,400
and there aren't enough toilets

68
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,160
How could you just watch

69
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,480
a young girl like me

70
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,640
because there are no toilets

71
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,880
and

72
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,400
end up polluting the environment

73
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,400
You

74
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,240
So I'm not suited for jail

75
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,920
No one is suited or not suited for jail

76
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,760
No

77
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,600
That's just you being narrow-minded

78
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,520
Someone like me

79
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
would turn the whole cell upside down

80
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,120
Right

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
No matter what you say,

82
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,120
I must take you to the Supervision Office.

83
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,000
Whether you go to jail or not,

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
the Supervision Office will decide.

85
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm really so miserable.

86
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,520
We're both women,

87
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,240
why are you so cruel to me

88
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,000
but so gentle to Liuyun?

89
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,160
Could it be that you like her?

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How could I possibly like Liuyun?

91
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,280
Let go of me.

92
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,280
Let go.

93
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,360
Come with me.

94
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,280
Why are you so nervous?

95
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Could it be

96
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,400
that you really like Liuyun?

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,160
So that's how it is.

98
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,400
You really do like Liuyun.

99
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,600
Otherwise, you wouldn't be explaining so much.

100
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,640
Well, Li Yan,

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,760
the City Lord became sworn brothers with you,

102
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,520
yet you bully him behind his back.

103
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,400
The City Lord treats you with respect,

104
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,400
and you repay him with betrayal.

105
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,240
Just wait for your doom.

106
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,600
You're being unreasonable.

107
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,640
Look quickly!

108
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,280
He's silencing her!

109
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,760
City Lord!

110
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,480
Why am I so unlucky?

111
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,520
Li Yan, let me tell you,

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,880
if I die here today,

113
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,880
I won't let you off even as a ghost.

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
I'll become a vengeful spirit

115
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,240
and appear in the City Lord's dreams

116
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,280
to tell him that his good brother

117
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,640
has betrayed him behind his back.

118
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Miss Lin,

119
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,000
what exactly do you want?

120
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,240
Give me some time.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,520
Let me prove my innocence.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,520
If you don't agree,

123
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,600
then I'll tell the city lord.

124
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,640
Li Yan.

125
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,280
Liu Yun.

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,680
Miss.

127
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,760
The master just sent a letter.

128
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,800
He mentioned Li Sijun.

129
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,000
What happened?

130
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,880
It's nothing.

131
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,120
Then let's go.

132
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,240
This is...

133
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,120
Miss, be careful.

134
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,160
Miss

135
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,520
City Lord

136
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,360
I have an important matter to report.

137
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,800
Young Lady

138
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,240
Father

139
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,080
Why are you all soaked?

140
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
How did this happen?

141
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,120
I didn't want this either.

142
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,960
Was it Li Yan who did this?

143
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,440
What crime has my daughter committed?

144
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,080
Why are you treating her so roughly?

145
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,520
Reporting to the City Lord,

146
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,480
the real culprit who poisoned Princess Liuyun

147
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:42,920
Father

148
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,480
I have already found them.

149
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
This person is

150
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,360
Miss Lin

151
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,080
Li Yan

152
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,680
You beast in human clothing, you blockhead!

153
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,720
You just open your mouth and speak nonsense.

154
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,280
You spout nonsense as soon as you open your mouth!

155
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,440
With which eye

156
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,280
did you see me poison Princess Liuyun?

157
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,640
Answer me!

158
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,680
Miss Lin, on Princess Liuyun's

159
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
route back to the residence, set up a trap

160
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,600
in order to harm the Princess.

161
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,600
So as to achieve

162
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,240
the goal of becoming your wife, City Lord.

163
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
And her accomplice

164
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,360
I have also brought back for you.

165
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,520
This person

166
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,640
is Miss Lin's personal maid

167
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,840
Lian'er

168
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,720
I...

169
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,400
This...

170
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,120
This is the only road back to Liuyun's villa.

171
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,040
When the time comes,

172
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,240
as soon as she enters the trap I set up,

173
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,000
she will definitely fall into the lake.

174
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,920
You just need to distract the nearby guards.

175
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,040
She'll be at the bottom of the lake,

176
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,720
dreaming of becoming the city lord's wife.

177
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,280
Absurd.

178
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,280
To convict someone so hastily

179
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,040
is far too reckless.

180
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,640
City Lord,

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
please stand up for my daughter.

182
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,960
Miss Lin,

183
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,400
confess the truth at once.

184
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,560
Considering

185
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,320
your father's meritorious service as an advisor,

186
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,400
I'll spare your life.

187
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,960
But if you continue to—

188
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Fine, fine, fine.

189
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,560
I'll confess.

190
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,120
You—

191
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,760
This trap

192
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,600
was indeed set up by me.

193
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,320
But

194
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,320
on this road,

195
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,600
so many people come and go.

196
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,120
How can you be sure

197
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,960
that I

198
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,560
set it up specifically for her?

199
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,960
And most importantly,

200
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,600
this has nothing to do

201
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,560
with poisoning Princess Liuyun.

202
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
If you insist on arguing this point,

203
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,680
should I take it to mean

204
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,680
that you're so eager to solve the case

205
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,040
because you like Princess Liuyun

206
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,880
and want to win her heart?

207
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,240
Of course, the two are connected.

208
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,240
This is your motive for murder.

209
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,040
Stop.

210
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,960
He didn't deny the last statement just now.

211
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,480
That means,

212
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,120
he admits he likes Princess Liuyun.

213
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,600
Alright.

214
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,120
Then let's make another bold guess.

215
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
He wants to win over Princess Liuyun so much

216
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
because he wants to become the prince consort of Beiyue City.

217
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,840
That way, he can reach the peak of power.

218
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,480
Nonsense!

219
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,760
Human imagination is limitless.

220
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,480
But there is always only one truth.

221
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Since he

222
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,200
accused me without any evidence,

223
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,400
then I can also

224
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,240
use his own methods

225
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,560
against him.

226
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,320
What Miss Lin said

227
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,600
makes some sense.

228
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,760
So I will

229
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,400
grant you seven days

230
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,880
to prove your innocence.

231
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,240
Li Yan.

232
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,320
This matter

233
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,480
will be entrusted to you and Miss Lin.

234
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,480
You must

235
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,320
protect Miss Lin well.

236
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,760
Yes.

237
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,320
Boss

238
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,400
Boss

239
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,400
I

240
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,960
My tongue coating is pale.

241
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,320
There is stagnation of qi and blood.

242
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,680
Miss Lin

243
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,600
Have you caught a cold recently?

244
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,880
I'm not here for a consultation.

245
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,680
Your pulse is thin and soft.

246
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,400
There is excessive dampness.

247
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,000
Miss Lin, have you been experiencing

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,480
insomnia and irritability?

249
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,960
But Miss Lin, you don't need to worry.

250
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,960
I have here

251
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,560
a thousand-year-old ginseng.

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,840
This medicine will cure your illness.

253
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,960
This medicine can heal the body,

254
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,720
but

255
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,000
it cannot heal the heart.

256
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,840
For someone as cruel as you,

257
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,880
no matter how much ginseng you take,

258
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,280
it will be in vain.

259
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,320
Why is it you again?

260
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,760
Where is the culprit?

261
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,320
Wherever the culprit is, that's where I'll be.

262
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,000
Fine.

263
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,400
I won't argue with you.

264
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,040
Boss

265
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,000
Actually, I came today to ask you, Boss,

266
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,600
has anyone come to your shop recently to buy

267
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,440
a medicine that, after taking it,

268
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,240
leaves a person half-dead?

269
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,280
Miss Lin, listen to what you're saying.

270
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,440
Medicine either cures you,

271
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,560
or kills you.

272
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,280
A medicine that leaves you half-dead

273
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,120
must be a fake or inferior product.

274
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,720
Our shop only sells genuine medicine.

275
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,880
We don't have the kind of medicine you're talking about.

276
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll be honest with you.

277
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,720
I'm here to investigate a case today.

278
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,400
So, boss,

279
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,000
please do me a favor.

280
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,120
I'll have my staff go right away.

281
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,720
What medicine did this customer buy?

282
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,400
What medicine was he looking for?

283
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
He knows better than I do.

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
It's a pity, boss.

285
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,440
You

286
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,720
carelessly leaking customer information

287
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,440
If word of this gets out,

288
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,720
will anyone else still come to your shop?

289
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,320
Boss,

290
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,840
I'm just saying this casually.

291
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,000
You should follow your own heart.

292
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,960
Miss Lin,

293
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,720
you...

294
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,720
Please keep this, please keep this.

295
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,680
Li Yan

296
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,760
I've told you both everything I know.

297
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
I haven't hidden anything.

298
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,520
Take care, take care.

299
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,760
According to what the boss said,

300
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,160
in the city of Nanling,

301
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,520
this kind of deadly poison isn't sold at all.

302
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,400
Then how did you get this poison?

303
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,400
I...

304
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,280
What do you mean, how did I get this poison?

305
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Can't you stop following me all the time?

306
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,160
The city lord gave us seven days.

307
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,120
You investigate your way, I'll investigate mine.

308
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,440
Let's compete fairly and openly.

309
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,280
Is that okay?

310
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,040
Were you fair and open yesterday?

311
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,720
What if you destroy the evidence?

312
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,160
Then what am I supposed to do?

313
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,840
So,

314
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,000
I have to

315
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,720
stick with you like a shadow.

316
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,240
You...

317
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,320
Princess Liuyun,

318
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,520
why are you awake?
