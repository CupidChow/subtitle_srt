1
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,560
If you destroy the evidence,

2
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,000
what am I supposed to do?

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,680
So

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,840
I have to

5
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,560
stick with you like a shadow.

6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,080
You—

7
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,160
Princess Liuyun,

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,360
why are you awake?

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,080
I said,

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,600
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,280
Just go anywhere.

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,120
Li Yan, aren't you annoying!

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,680
How long are you planning to follow me?

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,160
So shameless.

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,800
You crazy girl.

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,280
As long as you don't face justice,

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,840
I'll follow you for a day.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,240
If you never face justice,

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,360
I'll follow you for a lifetime.

20
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,000
With your blockhead personality,

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,960
you still want to follow me forever?

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,280
Then try following me when I take a bath.

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,360
Or when I sleep.

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,680
Nonsense.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Unreasonable.

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
This way.

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,560
Over here.

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,680
Throw it down!

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,120
You're getting off easy.

30
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,160
Miss Lin

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,000
Come, come, take a look!

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,760
The City Guard's Commander

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,840
Li Yan

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,240
is having a public matchmaking event

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,040
Ladies, young and old

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,960
Hurry up and join in!

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,520
Miss Lin

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,480
You

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,280
You all

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,920
Please make way

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,280
I received a message from Miss

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,040
I dare not delay

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
I acted on it right away

44
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,800
Lian'er

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,040
You’re amazing

46
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,960
Come on

47
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,080
High five

48
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,360
High five

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,080
But

50
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,720
I have something

51
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,080
even more important to do now

52
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,160
As for you

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,520
go back and help me find a set of

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,280
medical officer’s clothes

55
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,080
Yes

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,360
Let’s go

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,400
Miss Lin

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,920
Please make way

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,640
Liu Yun’s diagnosis report

60
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,200
Where would it be placed?

61
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,040
How bold.

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,960
You dare not salute me when you see me?

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
This colleague here,

64
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,040
why have I never seen you before?

65
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,600
And also,

66
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,400
what is that thing on your hat?

67
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,160
I am specially invited by the city lord,

68
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,920
an international master perfumer of the highest rank.

69
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,600
How come I've never heard of

70
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,400
such a position?

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,480
I am here on behalf of the city lord,

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,040
sent here in secret.

73
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,600
Very few people know about this.

74
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,640
If you dare to tell anyone,

75
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,200
watch your head.

76
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,920
I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare.

77
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,200
Um...

78
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,520
About Princess Liuyun's poisoning,

79
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,960
there's something suspicious about it.

80
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
The city lord specifically sent me

81
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,280
to get her diagnosis report and prescription.

82
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,400
That way,

83
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,600
I can

84
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
use fragrance to detoxify her.

85
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,600
Hurry up and get them for me.

86
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,520
Why?

87
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,920
To obtain such confidential items,

88
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,920
you need the city lord's written order.

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,280
You don't even know this rule?

90
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,640
Who exactly are you?

91
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,160
I...

92
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,200
Didn't I already tell you?

93
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,160
I came here to investigate in secret.

94
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,960
Of course, I can't reveal that.

95
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,720
I'm sorry, but I can't disclose anything.

96
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,400
Since you say

97
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,360
you're the city lord's perfumer,

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,520
then tell me,

99
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,280
what spices does the city lord use?

100
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,840
How many kinds are there?

101
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,040
Testing me?

102
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,960
Spikenard, storax, benzoin, turmeric,

103
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,840
clove, agarwood, sandalwood, musk, black agarwood,

104
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,160
angelica, radix angelicae pubescentis,

105
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,520
patchouli, galangal,

106
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,080
fennel, costus root, mother clove,

107
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,600
rhubarb, frankincense, golden fragrance,

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,360
rose petals, borneol, ambergris.

109
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,400
Besides these,

110
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,280
there are also thirteen types of blended fragrances and wondrous scents,

111
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,160
twelve types of blended floral scents,

112
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
and spices for other uses,

113
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,520
a total of six categories,

114
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,840
with eleven types.

115
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,920
Doctor,

116
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,400
do you

117
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,280
have any other questions?

118
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,360
I truly admire you with utmost respect.

119
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,960
You are truly a master beyond compare.

120
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,280
Then why aren't you hurrying up

121
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,800
and quickly go get it

122
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,600
Yes

123
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,160
The princess is feeling restless today

124
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Please trouble the physician

125
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,720
to prepare some incense for the tent

126
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,160
You came at just the right time

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,200
This is the top perfumer personally appointed by the city lord

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,280
My skills are nothing compared to hers

129
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,960
They're just minor tricks

130
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,480
The fragrances she creates

131
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,040
are truly unmatched through the ages

132
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Alright, alright

133
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,080
You

134
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,520
come with me

135
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,080
Wait

136
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,400
I have important matters to attend to today

137
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,800
I'm afraid

138
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,960
What matter

139
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
could be more important than Princess Changle's health

140
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,720
Say one more word

141
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,520
and you'll be dragged out and beaten to death immediately

142
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,720
Princess

143
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
The physician has been brought

144
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,160
to check your pulse

145
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
You may leave

146
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,160
Greetings, Princess Changle

147
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
How do you read this pulse?

148
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,600
Got it.

149
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,480
Looking at Your Highness's palm,

150
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,720
this shows great fortune and wealth.

151
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,400
You will live a long life.

152
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,640
And recently,

153
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,280
you will definitely meet someone

154
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,400
who works in the City Lord's mansion,

155
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,360
with a prominent status,

156
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,480
handsome,

157
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,520
and fall in love with a tall, strong man.

158
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,280
Is that true?

159
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,080
You—

160
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,160
know palmistry?

161
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,400
I know a little.

162
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Just a little.

163
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,720
Who are you?

164
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,400
Why don't you dare show your face?

165
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,720
I am

166
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,280
a perfumer.

167
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Because I look ugly,

168
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm afraid of startling Your Highness.

169
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,720
Please spare me, Your Highness!

170
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
You servant,

171
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,960
you really went to great lengths to please me.

172
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,920
I will definitely

173
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,720
prepare the finest

174
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,080
fragrance for your chambers

175
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,160
to repay Your Highness.

176
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,400
This fragrance

177
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,280
is wonderful.

178
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,600
Of course it is.

179
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,160
I am

180
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,720
an internationally renowned master perfumer.

181
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,520
This little task

182
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,200
is enough to impress you.

183
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,040
Come and smell it, everyone.

184
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,520
Hurry.

185
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,400
Yes.

186
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,600
Miss Lin.

187
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,600
I knew it was you.

188
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,720
Disguising yourself as a physician to sneak into the clinic,

189
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,080
and even disturbing Princess Changle.

190
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,600
What exactly are you up to?

191
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
I just wanted to go to the clinic

192
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
to check Liuyun's diagnosis report.

193
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,280
How was I supposed to know I'd be brought to Changle?

194
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,280
This

195
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,840
is the breakthrough in the case.

196
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,960
It's really important, okay?

197
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,960
Liuyun's prescription.

198
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,040
That's right.

199
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,080
I have it.

200
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
You have it?

201
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,160
I just got it from Physician Wang.

202
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
This prescription

203
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,480
absolutely cannot be given to you.

204
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,520
After all, you're still the prime suspect.

205
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,600
Li Yan.

206
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,600
If you really want to solve the case,

207
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,720
please set aside your prejudice against me first, okay?

208
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,600
At the very least,

209
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,360
in terms of interests,

210
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,040
the two of us are on the same side, right?

211
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I can give you Liuyun's prescription.

212
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,400
But you have to promise

213
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,360
that all your actions

214
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,160
must be carried out under my supervision.

215
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,520
Alright, alright.

216
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,200
I promise.

217
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,440
Let's pinky swear.

218
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,800
Pinky swear, hang it high,

219
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,600
and never break it for a hundred years.

220
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,720
Seal it.

221
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,080
So ancient doctors

222
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,080
also had their own literary system.

223
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,800
This records the symptoms of Liuyun's poisoning.

224
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,560
And also—

225
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,960
Wait a minute.

226
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,080
Why is my name on here?

227
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,840
You really are ignorant.

228
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,200
Qianjinzi is the antidote to the poison.

229
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,280
It has nothing to do with you.

230
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,320
I know.

231
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,800
I was just joking.

232
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,320
Just trying to make you laugh.

233
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,280
Go on.

234
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,720
The poison that Princess Liuyun was afflicted with

235
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,200
was caused by Ye Haitang.

236
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,520
But this substance is rare.

237
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,560
You can't buy it at ordinary pharmacies.

238
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,960
In Nanling City,

239
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,200
only high officials and nobles

240
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,960
can buy medicine at Shibali Shop.

241
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,920
That's the only place to get it.

242
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,840
Shibali Shop.

243
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,920
Let's go check Shibali Shop

244
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,040
to see who bought Ye Haitang.

245
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,680
Then we'll know who poisoned her.

246
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,080
Shenlong Temple

247
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,680
That's strange.

248
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,040
The location of Shibali Inn on this map

249
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,200
is right here.

250
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,400
And you call yourself a commander of the City Guard.

251
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,680
How can you have no sense of direction at all?

252
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,680
Do you even know how to read a map?

253
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,280
Uh...

254
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,560
This map...

255
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,040
isn't my own map.

256
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Then it probably needs to be updated.

257
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,920
Updated?

258
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,560
What I mean is,

259
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,520
it's too old.

260
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,800
Forget it, forget it.

261
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,160
Today was a wasted trip.

262
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,920
Let's go.

263
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,840
Don't go!

264
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,440
Since the map

265
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,720
shows it's here,

266
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,840
there must be something hidden at Shenlong Temple.

267
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,920
Come on, let's check it out.

268
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,160
Why has this guy been sneezing all day?

269
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,680
Could he be sick or something?

270
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,040
Let's go.

271
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,560
We're not here just to burn incense.

272
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,200
Since we're already here,

273
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,280
let's pay our respects.

274
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,800
We can take the chance to pray to the gods

275
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,680
to bless us with a quick resolution to the case.

276
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,840
We must make sure to pray sincerely later.

277
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,320
So that wicked woman Lin Qianjin will be caught.

278
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,960
And peace will return to Nanling City.

279
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,560
That's right.

280
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
But if she hasn't been caught,

281
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,800
doesn't that just prove

282
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,720
she isn't the one who poisoned Princess Liuyun?

283
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
You don't know

284
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,080
how vicious Lin Qianjin is.

285
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,040
She's incredibly cruel.

286
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,560
She poisons anyone she doesn't like.

287
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,440
I heard that under the Lin residence

288
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,080
thousands of people are buried.

289
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,200
All poisoned by her.

290
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,400
So if you say the princess

291
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,520
wasn't harmed by her,

292
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,840
who would believe it?

293
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Where did you all hear these ridiculous rumors?

294
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,320
Did you see those bodies with your own eyes?

295
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,080
I...

296
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,320
Lin Qianjin was indeed a bit cruel before,

297
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,440
but that doesn't mean

298
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,560
she did all the bad things herself.

299
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,440
Who are you to Lin Qianjin

300
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,600
to defend her like this?

301
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,680
Let me give you some advice:

302
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
in Nanling City,

303
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,160
if you don't hate Lin Qianjin,

304
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,200
you're an enemy to all of us.

305
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,920
That's right, exactly.

306
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
She should be arrested.

307
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,680
Are you just like them,

308
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
hoping I'll disappear soon?

309
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,920
Because cruelty has long been branded

310
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,200
into my very bones, hasn't it?

311
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,520
I only care about the truth.
