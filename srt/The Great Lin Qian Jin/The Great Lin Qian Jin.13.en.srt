1
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,920
It's him.

2
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Yes, it's him.

3
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,040
He's the one who poisoned Princess Liuyun.

4
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,040
Wenwen.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,760
Wenwen.

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
Wenwen.

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,200
Lu Yiwen.

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,240
Lu Yiwen, stop right there!

9
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,640
You're still not well. Go back quickly.

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,480
I can't let you go.

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,760
I'm the one who hurt you.

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,440
I don't deserve to see you.

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,760
No.

14
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,760
I don't believe you poisoned her.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,480
Brother, please help.

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,480
Thank you, please help.

17
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,080
Tell me.

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,320
What exactly happened?

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,200
My original intention was to poison Princess Liuyun.

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,480
I don't know why you were the one poisoned.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,880
Jinjin.

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,040
Don't trust anyone.

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,520
The symptoms of Princess Liuyun's poisoning

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,720
are not caused by Night Camellia at all.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,160
But...

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,080
Her medical report

27
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,640
shows all signs

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,040
that she was poisoned by Night Camellia.

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,080
Night Camellia dissolves in wine, colorless and tasteless.

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,200
Those poisoned by it

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
seem normal for the first few days.

32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,560
But gradually, symptoms of weakness appear.

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,320
Like suddenly falling unconscious.

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,760
If there's no antidote,

35
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,760
they'll die from the poison in just a few days.

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,280
The dangerous thing about this poison is

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,200
that on the victim's body

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,320
there's no way to find any trace of poisoning.

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,400
I only put the poison in Princess Liuyun's wine flask.

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,440
That's where I used the poison.

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,880
This is also why, after the incident, the royal physician confirmed that Princess Liuyun

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,440
was poisoned with Night Camellia.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,800
But

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,280
after Princess Liuyun was poisoned,

45
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,200
she has been in a coma ever since.

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,320
But instead, it was me

47
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,640
who seemed to match

48
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,200
all the symptoms of Night Camellia poisoning.

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,000
So you mean

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,760
I suspect someone switched the wine cups.

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,280
Switched the cups?

52
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Then who poisoned Princess Liuyun?

53
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,320
What kind of poison was she given?

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,760
Are you done talking?

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,640
Hurry up, let's go.

56
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,080
Wenwen

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,760
Jinjin

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,560
Actually,

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,520
you've always known how I feel.

60
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,440
Ever since we were young,

61
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,880
as long as it's something you want to do,

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,520
I'm always willing to be by your side.

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,880
But all you ever wanted was to become the City Lord's wife.

64
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,440
If you're happy,

65
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,760
then I'm happy too.

66
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,680
Wenwen

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,000
Wenwen

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,560
Take care of yourself.

69
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,880
Wenwen, don't go! Wenwen!

70
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,280
Are you okay?

71
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,680
I just didn't expect things to turn out like this.

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,320
Liking someone

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,440
does it really mean you have to do something like this?

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,880
There's nothing wrong with liking someone.

75
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,680
But you have to take responsibility for your actions.

76
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,640
I really can't bear to let him go.

77
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
This isn't like you at all.

78
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,120
I want to tell you,

79
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,520
since it's all over now,

80
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,320
you should look forward.

81
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,120
No, it's not over yet.

82
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,520
There are still doubts about how Liuyun was poisoned.

83
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,520
I have to figure it out.

84
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
How did Liuyun get poisoned?

85
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,280
First of all,

86
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,200
I have to stay at the City Lord's residence.

87
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,320
and look for opportunities to investigate clues about Liuyun's poisoning.

88
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,560
Let's talk as we walk.

89
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,440
Let's go.

90
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,640
City Lord

91
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,000
Now I can finally prove I'm not the real culprit, right?

92
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,640
You misunderstood me all this time.

93
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,680
You realize you were wrong, don't you?

94
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,640
Since you know you were wrong,

95
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,880
shouldn't you do something to make it up to me?

96
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,640
I was wrong.

97
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,200
I should even reward you.

98
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes, yes, yes.

99
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
I really should reward you properly.

100
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,560
For us,

101
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,520
make a pot of tea.

102
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,440
This is the highest honor.

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Me, make tea?

104
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,200
Aren't you supposed to invite me to the City Lord's mansion to have fun?

105
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,080
Shouldn't you let me stay for a few days?

106
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,200
Why are you making me make tea?

107
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,640
No way.

108
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,960
Weren't you the one insisting

109
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,680
on becoming the City Lord's wife?

110
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,840
Being the City Lord's wife means doing these things.

111
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,320
Why is this Murong Chengfeng acting so weird?

112
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,840
Fine.

113
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,960
For the sake of the investigation, I'll put up with it.

114
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
It's too hot.

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,760
Let's see what excuse you have now.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Make another pot.

117
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,640
It's too cold.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,640
You blockhead, help me!

119
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Good tea.

120
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,560
I want to eat fruit.

121
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,080
Feed me.

122
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,400
Feed Li Sijun.

123
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,080
City Lord.

124
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,200
I remember you love bananas the most.

125
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,200
Eat.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,560
Massage

127
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,400
Lord

128
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,000
I think

129
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,440
Why don't we go paint instead?

130
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,520
But I heard

131
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,120
Miss Lin

132
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,280
music, chess, calligraphy, and painting

133
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,640
can't do any of them

134
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,840
Who says I can't?

135
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,000
I—I can

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,560
anime-style ink painting

137
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,760
anime-style ink painting

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840
Showcase

139
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,080
How is it?

140
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,400
Interesting, right?

141
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,320
Very interesting, very interesting

142
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,320
I think

143
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,680
It's missing a stroke here

144
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,000
Lord

145
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
I think

146
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,440
We should play chess instead

147
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,120
Sure, sure

148
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,640
Do you know how, Miss?

149
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,400
I do

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I can

151
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Gomoku

152
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,760
Gomoku

153
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,960
Lian'er

154
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,200
Did you deliver the letter to my father?

155
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,440
Don't worry, Miss. Master already knows.

156
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,080
Now I finally understand

157
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,000
Being the Lord's wife is really not easy

158
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,640
You have to know music, chess, calligraphy, and painting

159
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,880
And you have to take good care of the Lord

160
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,840
It's even harder than being a housewife

161
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,320
Isn't that Yingxue?

162
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Why is she sneaking around?

163
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,840
Lian'er, you go back to the other courtyard first

164
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,080
I still have important things to do

165
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,200
Yes, Miss

166
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,000
This Miss Lin is quite interesting.

167
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,400
She’s given us brothers something new to enjoy.

168
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,640
Interesting, yes,

169
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
but she’s a crazy girl.

170
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,440
Look at that smile of yours.

171
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,280
Don’t tell me you’re interested in her.

172
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,280
Me, interested in her?

173
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,000
Nonsense.

174
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,000
You’d better be honest.

175
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,520
Any woman I set my sights on

176
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,520
I won’t let anyone else have her.

177
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,760
You—

178
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,520
You like her?

179
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,000
Her?

180
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,440
How could that be?

181
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
She’s malicious and has a terrible reputation,

182
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,560
not to mention she’s uneducated.

183
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,680
She’s disrespectful to her elders.

184
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,520
Aside from being interesting, she has no redeeming qualities.

185
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,640
Looks like her dream of becoming the lord’s wife

186
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,840
is as good as shattered.

187
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
But,

188
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,400
she’s been behaving quite well lately.

189
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,520
But the position of the lord’s wife is a serious matter.

190
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,080
I’ll consider it carefully.

191
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,920
Think it over.

192
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,560
Xiao Li,

193
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,160
look,

194
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,280
you can’t beat me.

195
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,560
Go call Miss Lin over here.

196
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,920
I want to have a proper match with her.

197
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,680
When did you get four?

198
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,000
What are you doing?

199
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,440
You scared me to death.

200
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,920
Look at Yingxue over there.

201
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,040
Why is she being so sneaky just dumping out some medicine dregs?

202
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,560
You suspect her?

203
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,440
Yes, I suspect her.

204
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,560
Let’s go.

205
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,920
As expected.

206
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,040
Isn't this the antidote, Qianjinzi, used to treat Ye Haitang?

207
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,400
Qianjin, Qianjin.

208
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,640
Come here, come here.

209
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,000
This game of Gomoku you taught me

210
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,520
is simply fascinating.

211
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,200
What other fun things do you know?

212
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Show them all to me.

213
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,680
If I’m pleased, I’ll reward you handsomely.

214
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,000
What I’m best at is making incense.

215
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,560
Making incense?

216
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
City Lord,

217
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,160
lately, for the sachets I’m making,

218
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,160
I’m missing a special ingredient.

219
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,560
But this ingredient

220
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,920
can only be bought at Shibali Shop.

221
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,920
So,

222
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
I’d like to go out for a bit.

223
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,760
Don’t worry, City Lord.

224
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,800
The sachet I make

225
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,040
definitely won’t disappoint you.

226
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,400
It’s even more interesting than the ink wash paintings of the second dimension school.

227
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,160
That’s much more interesting.

228
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,760
Alright.

229
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,560
However,

230
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,640
I'm still a bit worried.

231
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm sure Minister Lin

232
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,800
also wouldn't feel comfortable letting you go out alone.

233
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,280
After all, our relationship with Northern Yue

234
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,680
is still a bit tense right now.

235
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,640
How about I send a few

236
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,680
guards to accompany you?

237
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,560
They can ensure your safety.

238
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,680
Why go to so much trouble?

239
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,880
I think it would be better

240
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,800
to just have Li Yan go with me.

241
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,920
Why does it have to be Li Yan who goes with you?

242
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,760
Who else could go

243
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,880
that would be safer than the commander by the city lord's side?

244
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,800
Isn't that right?

245
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,560
Besides, hasn't the city lord always assigned him

246
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,800
to protect me during investigations?

247
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,320
I think he's done a good job protecting me.

248
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,760
Alright, then let Li Yan go with you.

249
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,800
Yes, city lord.

250
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,400
How strange.

251
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,760
Of all the medicines seen by the city's doctors,

252
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,560
I doubt any have seen more than I have.

253
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,640
But these medicine dregs

254
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,160
I can't tell what kind of medicine they are by the smell.

255
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,760
May I ask, this medicine

256
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,040
what illness was it originally meant to treat?

257
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,560
Well,

258
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,920
I have an older brother who is infertile.

259
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,440
I don't know where to find a remedy for this.

260
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,440
As for me,

261
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,040
I'm worried he might upset his stomach.

262
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,640
So I wanted to ask someone knowledgeable.

263
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,400
So, you see,

264
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,120
Last time,

265
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,560
your husband came here

266
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,880
and got you some Danggui Yimuwan.

267
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,840
That means

268
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,040
your periods are irregular.

269
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,960
When it comes to fertility,

270
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,800
there must be some issues.

271
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,800
I know, madam,

272
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,040
you must be embarrassed.

273
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,800
About these matters,

274
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,880
it's hard to talk about them.

275
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,080
But let me tell you,

276
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,560
this is for your infertility.

277
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,800
I

278
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Your brother, your brother

279
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,760
For your brother's infertility

280
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,800
it doesn't help at all.

281
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
If that's the case,

282
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,040
let's find someone more capable.

283
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,760
Let's go.

284
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,920
Why look for someone else?

285
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,560
Why not ask me instead?

286
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,880
Please wait, both of you, wait!

287
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,160
Wait!

288
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,920
Last time,

289
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,520
the fertility medicine I recommended to you

290
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,320
you didn't take it.

291
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,280
You two seem like a loving couple.

292
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,920
This time,

293
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,640
I'll give you a couple's incense pill for free.

294
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,800
Here, take it.

295
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,560
Take it.

296
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,800
At night,

297
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,560
put it in your tent as incense.

298
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,800
The effect is immediate.

299
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,560
It will let you

300
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,040
have a child right away.

301
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,080
Who said we want a child?
