1
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,520
The lord has ordered me to protect Miss Lin for seven days.

2
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,400
I won't stay any longer, Your Highness.

3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,640
This is so infuriating.

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,560
Why did I faint again?

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,400
Put me down.

6
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,720
Don't talk. I'll take you back.

7
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,680
Actually, the clues have already run dry.

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,560
I really have no way to find the real culprit.

9
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,400
Three days.

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,920
How do I have any time left to clear my name?

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,640
But you can tell the Lord of the City

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,800
that I will keep my promise.

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,120
Even if I'm convicted, it's just fate.

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,120
Actually, after these days of investigation,

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,640
I no longer think you're the culprit.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,360
I know.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,720
But I have no way to clear my name.

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,000
Besides, the Lord of the City dislikes me so much.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,720
He definitely won't let me off.

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,360
How do you know the Lord of the City dislikes you?

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,560
Otherwise, why would he have you

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,080
watch me all day long?

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,920
That must mean

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,480
he doesn't want me to become the Lady of the City.

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Maybe he even wants me to confess and accept punishment.

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,720
That's probably what he's hoping for.

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,000
Stop overthinking and focus on getting better.

28
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,080
Don't worry.

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,840
I'll help you find a way.

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,520
It's fine, you can't help me anyway.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,960
I just feel a bit regretful.

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,240
I never really got to see the world.

33
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,120
Li Sijun.

34
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,240
What is it?

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,800
The Lord of the City summons you.

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,160
Li Sijun.

37
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,360
Thank you for helping me just now.

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,840
I'm not dizzy anymore.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,640
Please put me down now.

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,120
Are you really okay now?

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,960
I'm fine.

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,400
I'm going to see the city lord now.

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,080
Miss Lin isn't feeling well.

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,000
Please escort her back to the residence.

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,280
Yes, Commander Li.

46
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,800
Wait.

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,520
I can't watch over you tonight.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm actually quite worried about you.

49
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,760
Take this token.

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,680
Showing this token is the same as seeing me.

51
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,920
If anyone tries to bully you,

52
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,680
show them this token.

53
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,000
If something really happens to you,

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,480
I'll search all of Nanling City to find you.

55
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Thank you.

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,440
According to what you said,

57
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,880
Miss Lin hasn't cleared her suspicion yet,

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,360
but her behavior has been pretty good.

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,800
This Miss Lin,

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,000
if she really were the culprit,

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,560
she wouldn't be so calm.

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Besides,

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,760
she wouldn't have said

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,360
that even if the culprit isn't found,

65
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,240
she would still keep her promise.

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,880
So the real culprit isn't her.

67
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,480
Then who is it?

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,480
The clues have run dry now.

69
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,440
I still can't be sure.

70
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,440
Xiao Li,

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,040
it's not that I want to make things difficult for you.

72
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,480
It's just that this matter has dragged on for too long.

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
Princess Liuyun still hasn't woken up.

74
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,160
That envoy from Beiyue City

75
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,880
keeps pressuring me every day.

76
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,000
Their hundred-thousand-strong army is stationed at the border.

77
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,120
If anything happens to Princess Liuyun,

78
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,160
I'm afraid they

79
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,880
might start a mutiny.

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,880
Xiao Li,

81
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
please help share my worries too.

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,480
I know you're under

83
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,680
a lot of pressure right now.

84
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
So,

85
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,680
I've already come up with a solution for you.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,240
This method

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,240
could wake up Princess Liuyun

88
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,480
and also catch the real culprit.

89
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,480
When the time comes,

90
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,760
you'll be able to give Beiyue City

91
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,800
a proper explanation as well.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Good brother,

93
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,800
I knew you were thinking of me.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,120
But,

95
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,480
this method

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,680
requires your cooperation with me.

97
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Of course.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,800
Let's do it again.

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,920
Come on.

100
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,920
Commander Li,

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,120
your clothes have been mended.

102
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,680
What are you all doing?

103
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,120
Seeing the commander wear this smiley face

104
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,680
makes him look really happy,

105
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,240
so we wanted to try it too.

106
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,760
No laughing.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're on patrol at the City Lord's residence.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,120
How can you behave like this?

109
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,360
This badge

110
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
can only be worn by me.

111
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,160
All of you, take it off.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,800
Let's go.

113
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,360
Seeing this token is the same as seeing me.

114
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,240
If anyone dares to bully you,

115
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,800
just show them this token.

116
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,680
If

117
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
something really happens,

118
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,480
I'll search the entire Nanling City to find you.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,560
Actually, after these past few days of investigation,

120
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,920
I no longer think you're the culprit.

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,160
You said you believe me

122
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,560
Of course, that makes me very happy

123
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,680
But

124
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,800
Now Chang Le is no longer a suspect

125
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,680
The suspicion

126
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,240
is once again undoubtedly pointed at me

127
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,320
The clues to finding the real culprit have been cut off

128
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,240
What exactly do I have to do

129
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,360
to prove my innocence?

130
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,680
There are only three days left

131
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,880
Unless heaven gives me a miracle

132
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
otherwise I really

133
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,000
could lose my head at any moment

134
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,000
Who is it?

135
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,880
Miss, it's me

136
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,920
Why did you come to my house so late?

137
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,000
Hurry and get dressed, I'll take you somewhere

138
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,320
It's so beautiful.

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
Didn't you say yesterday

140
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,000
that you haven't really seen the world yet?

141
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,320
So you startled me in the middle of the night

142
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
just to bring me here?

143
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,040
Could it be

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
that you don't like it?

145
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,480
I do like it.

146
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,920
I just didn't expect

147
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,680
someone as clueless as you

148
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,120
could actually do something so romantic.

149
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,360
I...

150
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,680
When two people

151
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,120
are attracted to each other, it's because of love.

152
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,800
And also,

153
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,480
they do lots and lots of romantic things together.

154
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,120
Look,

155
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,040
the sun is already up.

156
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,480
You blockhead, do you know

157
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,680
where I come from,

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
only two people who like each other

159
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,120
will watch the sunrise together.

160
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,240
So is this blockhead confessing to me?

161
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,040
Blockhead, where are you going?

162
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,560
I'm still injured, you know.

163
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,600
You—why did you come back?

164
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,120
I was worried you couldn't get down by yourself.

165
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,000
I...

166
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,680
Thank you for taking me to watch the sunrise.

167
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,120
I feel much better now.

168
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,120
I think the reason you're so anxious

169
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,560
is just because of the position of Lady of the City.

170
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
If you let go of being the Lady of the City,

171
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,480
whether you have the title or not,

172
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,680
it actually doesn't affect you at all.

173
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,440
Then you wouldn't feel so tense.

174
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,240
You're right.

175
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,440
Actually, I don't really

176
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,240
want to be the Lady of the City that much.

177
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,120
Everything I've done

178
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,560
is just to get one thing.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,800
So,

180
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,120
what I mean is,

181
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,920
my father is the Grand Minister.

182
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,760
So even if I were the real culprit,

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,120
I probably wouldn't be sentenced to death, right?

184
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,800
After all, Princess Liuyun

185
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
isn't dead either.

186
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,240
Right?

187
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,680
Then,

188
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,480
if you don't want the title of Lady,

189
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,120
what do you want to do?

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,600
If I'm lucky,

191
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,160
I'll be with the person I like.

192
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,320
But,

193
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,120
if Murong Chengfeng

194
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,320
insists that I'm

195
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,240
the culprit,

196
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
and demands my life,

197
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,600
then what future would I have?

198
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Have you thought of any other way?

199
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,600
For example,

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,880
helping Princess Liuyun recover,

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,800
and when she wakes up,

202
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,920
ask her what really happened.

203
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,160
Maybe then we'll know who the real culprit is.

204
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,160
This is a good idea.

205
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,520
Make way, make way.

206
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,560
Please make way.

207
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,040
What's going on here?

208
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
What's happening?

209
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,680
Come and take a look.

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,040
They've posted an official notice.

211
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,240
Princess Liuyun of Beiyue City has fallen into a coma from poisoning.

212
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,280
She still hasn't woken up.

213
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,760
The city lord intends

214
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
to find the best doctor in the city

215
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,560
to treat Princess Liuyun.

216
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,480
To help Princess Liuyun regain consciousness.

217
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,520
Anyone capable of curing Princess Liuyun may accept the challenge.

218
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,920
Whoever can wake Princess Liuyun

219
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,880
will be heavily rewarded.

220
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,280
Taking on the city lord's order means taking responsibility.

221
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,400
Can you do it?

222
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,160
I can.

223
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,160
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

224
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,640
I don't have any other options anyway.

225
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,400
That's right.

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,880
Are you okay?

227
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,160
I'm fine, I'm fine.

228
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,160
I'm just too excited.

229
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
She took it off.

230
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,120
Boss.

231
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,680
A returning customer, huh?

232
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,280
Your wife didn't come?

233
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,560
She's sick.

234
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,640
You're here to get medicine for your wife, right?

235
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,560
What's wrong with her?

236
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,400
She's been acting really strange lately.

237
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,520
Sometimes she's dizzy and listless.

238
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,640
Other times, she gets emotional very easily.

239
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,400
She often contradicts herself when she talks.

240
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,160
That's right.

241
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,800
She also often has stomachaches.

242
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,160
I understand, I understand.

243
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,040
There are always a few days like this every month.

244
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,680
Every month?

245
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,880
Then could it be something...

246
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,160
...some rare or complicated illness?

247
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,680
No, no, it's a minor issue.

248
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
However,

249
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,240
during this period, her emotions

250
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,360
are at their most sensitive and fragile.

251
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,240
You need to take good care of her.

252
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,120
Of course, I understand.

253
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,120
Let me take a look.

254
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,800
Here, take this.

255
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,400
Take the medicine and you'll be cured.

256
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,040
Danggui Yimuwan.

257
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,560
This medicine is great.

258
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,640
Boss.

259
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,640
Is my Young Master Lu's medicine ready?

260
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,760
It's ready, it's ready.

261
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,920
Here.

262
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,880
Put it on my young master's tab.

263
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,360
Alright.

264
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,560
Thanks, boss.

265
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,040
No need.

266
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,880
By the way, boss.

267
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,640
That person just now,

268
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,800
what medicine did he get?

269
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,880
He got a dose of Qianjinzi.

270
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,640
Qianjinzi?

271
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,240
Why is my name on this?

272
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,360
You really are ignorant.

273
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,520
Qianjinzi is the antidote for poison.

274
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,400
It has nothing to do with you.

275
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,360
Young Master Lu.

276
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,000
Young master, your medicine.

277
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,800
Wenwen.

278
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,680
Thank you for doing this look for me.

279
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,880
I didn't expect

280
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,680
you actually have pretty good taste.

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,520
It's only because you like it

282
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,360
that I studied it.

283
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,640
Leave it to me.

284
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,480
Alright, so

285
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,040
we should get going soon.

286
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,920
Miss.

287
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,240
Li Yan, why are you here?

288
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,560
I came to check on your injury.

289
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,160
I brought you some supplements.
