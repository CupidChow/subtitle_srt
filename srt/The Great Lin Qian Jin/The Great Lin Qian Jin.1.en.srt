1
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,360
Legend has it

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
that Nanjing City holds an ancient book.

3
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,920
In this ancient book,

4
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,240
the method for making Yue Zhi Bai Zhuo incense is recorded.

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,520
This incense

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,240
is fragrant and refreshing,

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,920
and can prevent plagues.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,680
Even after being washed a hundred times, its scent does not fade.

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,840
Because this ancient book

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,680
is passed down only by the Lady of Nanjing City

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,320
from generation to generation,

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,400
other city-states, led by Beiyue,

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
have sent their finest women

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,840
to Nanjing to compete for the position of Lady of the City.

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,760
Their aim is to seize the opportunity to obtain the ancient book

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,320
and acquire Yue Zhi

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,800
Bai Zhuo incense.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,720
It's the day to select the City Lord's wife again.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,640
The one in charge of this selection

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,520
is known as

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,080
the most handsome man in Nanling,

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,400
the commander of the City Guard,

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,200
Li Yan.

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,680
Even Beiyue has sent their princess.

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,040
How can we even compete?

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,240
I don't think it's decided yet.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
Don't forget, in our city

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,800
there's still the little poison girl.

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,520
A mere city gate can't stop me.

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,600
Yuezhi Baizhuo Fragrance

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,960
can only be mine.

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,360
There's an assassin!

33
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,520
Follow me!

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,360
Yes!

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,000
That vicious jinx

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,440
actually dared to break into the City Lord's mansion.

37
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,120
Look, everyone!

38
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,880
Who is that?

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,920
How is she flying so high?

40
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:50,960
Stop!

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,120
My father is the Grand Minister.

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,880
I am Lin Qianjin.

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Let's see today

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,360
who dares to touch me.

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,200
Where is Princess Liuyun of Beiyue City?

46
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,920
I am here.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,080
You’re something else, Li Yan.

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,480
You dare ruin my plans again.

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,440
Lin Qianjin.

50
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,640
You were the one who was late.

51
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,560
You missed the preliminary selection.

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,280
And you even barged into the residence without permission.

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,040
Guards!

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,120
Seize her!

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,120
Let’s see who dares to touch me today.

56
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,440
What preliminary selection?

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,520
I only need to attend the final palace selection.

58
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,920
My father is the Grand Minister.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,680
I’m the future wife of the city lord.

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,240
Why does it always stop loading at the crucial chapter?

61
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,480
It just won’t load.

62
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,760
Damn it.

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,040
The next chapter is about

64
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
the recipe for the legendary Yue Zhi Bai Zhuo fragrance.

65
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
The signal is terrible.

66
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,760
My name is also Lin Qianjin.

67
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,240
What a coincidence, right?

68
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,920
Don’t look down on me just because

69
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,760
I’m just a lowly salesgirl right now.

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,480
Soon, I’ll be promoted to

71
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,840
chief perfumer.

72
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,760
Because I used

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,120
a combination of traditional fragrance-making and modern techniques,

74
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,720
and the company has already approved it.

75
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,720
Besides,

76
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,960
I’ve been searching for a long time for

77
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,760
the legendary Yue Zhi Bai Zhuo fragrance,

78
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,840
and now I finally have a lead.

79
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,720
Once the next chapter loads,

80
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,240
I’ll be able to see the recipe.

81
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
What’s going on?

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,680
Why hasn’t it loaded yet?

83
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,440
The internet is really bad.

84
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,520
Princess

85
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,080
What's wrong, Princess?

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Someone, come!

87
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,720
What's going on?

88
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,880
Why did she faint?

89
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,040
Help Princess Liuyun away first.

90
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,960
The rest of you,

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,720
collect all the utensils Princess Liuyun touched

92
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,840
and seal them all.

93
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,320
Take them away.

94
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:21,880
Test them for poison.

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,440
Yes.

96
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,600
Move aside!

97
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,280
It's pure gold.

98
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,440
Take it away.

99
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
How dare you, Miss Lin!

100
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
In my presence,

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
how dare you behave so rudely?

102
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,440
You have no manners at all.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Isn't this...

104
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,280
that... what's-his-name...

105
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,720
Murong, my friend!

106
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,280
I...

107
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
It seems reading this book

108
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,720
has gotten me too obsessed.

109
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,160
I think about it during the day,

110
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,280
and dream about it at night.

111
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,760
This gold-thread embroidery is really something special.

112
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,400
Since I can't take things from my dreams,

113
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,040
I have to at least try, right?

114
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,680
Let me try it.

115
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,120
Murong, my friend!

116
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,480
You're crazy.

117
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,160
Hurry up and let me try!

118
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,880
Li Yan, Li Yan

119
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,200
Lin Qianjin

120
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,840
You’re really bold.

121
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,320
What exactly are you trying to do?

122
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,600
This is my dream.

123
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,160
In my dream,

124
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,840
I can do whatever I want.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,560
I’ll do whatever I want.

126
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,880
How improper! How improper!

127
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,000
Has Lin Qianjin gone mad?

128
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,760
Miss

129
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,480
You bunch of idiots,

130
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,760
none of you can catch me.

131
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,280
That’s right.

132
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,880
This is how a dream should be.

133
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,280
I never thought my first dream like this

134
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,040
would be with the most handsome man in Nanling.

135
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,760
My luck is just too good.

136
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,480
Young man

137
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,760
You smell so nice.

138
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,000
Here I come.

139
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,960
Shameless!

140
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,160
Let’s go.

141
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,600
Come with me to the Supervision Office.

142
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,360
You—

143
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,400
Why are you like a block of wood?

144
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,080
Fine.

145
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,240
Anyway,

146
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,360
since I’m here,

147
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,520
I’ve played as much as I wanted.

148
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,600
I’ve eaten what I wanted.

149
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,480
I’ll have to return to the real world eventually.

150
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,720
Come on.

151
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,480
Kill me.

152
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,600
Let me die quickly and painlessly.

153
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,920
Just let me die.

154
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,040
You—

155
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Miss

156
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,480
Miss

157
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Miss, you're awake.

158
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,040
Miss, you finally woke up.

159
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,040
You...

160
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,920
What did you call me?

161
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,680
Miss

162
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,120
Mi—

163
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,360
I... this...

164
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,880
Where is this?

165
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,800
Miss, what's wrong?

166
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,440
You're at your own home.

167
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,280
I...

168
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,480
This...

169
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,280
Did I really end up inside an ancient book?

170
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,800
Miss

171
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,160
No, no...

172
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
That's impossible.

173
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,040
Impossible, impossible...

174
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,040
Impossible.

175
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,120
Miss

176
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,360
Miss

177
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
Miss, don't run! Miss!

178
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Miss

179
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,480
Miss, be careful not to fall.

180
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,040
This house is really big.

181
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,560
Miss

182
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,600
Miss

183
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,920
Miss, stop running.

184
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,480
Wha—what are you doing?

185
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Don't kneel to me.

186
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,240
Get up, quickly.

187
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,880
Let me ask you,

188
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,800
what's your name?

189
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,600
Miss,

190
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,800
I'm Lian'er.

191
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,040
Is this

192
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,480
Nanling City?

193
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,600
The current city lord

194
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,360
is named

195
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,040
Murong Chengfeng,

196
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,240
and I am

197
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,240
the only daughter of Lin Sizheng,

198
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,480
Miss Lin.

199
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,480
A few days ago,

200
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,240
Princess Liuyun of Beiyue City

201
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,000
came from afar.

202
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,680
It's all true.

203
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,240
Wait,

204
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,600
the most handsome man in Nanling,

205
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,680
that dream,

206
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,680
it's all real!

207
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,720
Th-this...

208
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,800
How exciting!

209
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,800
Wait,

210
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,680
the book said Miss Lin would become the city lord's wife.

211
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,480
Doesn't that mean I can see

212
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,360
the recipe for Yue Zhi Bai Zhuo Xiang with my own eyes?

213
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,440
Heavens are helping me!

214
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,120
Lian'er,

215
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,720
go and bring out all the best food

216
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,800
in the house for me.

217
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,040
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,240
Li Yan,

219
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,920
Princess Liuyun's poisoning is a serious matter.

220
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,440
If we don't investigate thoroughly and give Beiyue City an explanation,

221
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,680
it may lead to war between the two cities.

222
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,480
I need you to secretly go to the Lin residence

223
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,680
and look into the poisoned wine incident.

224
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,720
Find out the truth.

225
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Hidden weapons and poison

226
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,480
Once I find the evidence

227
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,160
let's see how Minister Lin can protect you

228
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,480
Let's go, let's go

229
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,480
Yes

230
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,280
Antique vase

231
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
They're all mine

232
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,840
There are more over here

233
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,800
This Miss Lin

234
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,640
really does know how to make incense and weave grass

235
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,960
Take it away

236
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,600
What smell is that

237
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
It smells so good

238
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,920
This scent

239
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Young man

240
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,040
You smell so nice

241
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,520
So it was you

242
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,600
It's time

243
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,720
to stretch my muscles.

244
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
I'm so angry, I'm furious!

245
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,840
Lian'er

246
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,200
I want to take a bath.
