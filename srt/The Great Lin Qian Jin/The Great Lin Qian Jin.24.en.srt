1
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,120
You should leave.

2
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,280
Nanling City

3
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,400
can no longer tolerate you.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,880
Thank you, City Lord, for letting me go.

5
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,000
Stop right there.

6
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,160
Who are you?

7
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,720
I know this person. Everyone, stand down.

8
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,640
Wenwen, why are you here?

9
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,240
I should be asking you that.

10
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
Do you have a death wish?

11
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,280
Li Yan is dying.

12
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,960
Where is he?

13
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,440
Take me to him, quickly.

14
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,400
Li Yan

15
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,680
Li Yan

16
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,320
It's me, Qianjin.

17
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,080
I've come to see you.

18
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,840
Li Yan

19
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,320
Aren't you the greatest general in the world?

20
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,240
Aren't you the one who draws your sword at everyone you meet?

21
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,440
You're so powerful,

22
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,680
so why are you lying here?

23
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,200
Blockhead.

24
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,440
It's all my fault.

25
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm the one who forced you onto the battlefield.

26
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm sorry.

27
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
The sachet.

28
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,560
Blockhead.

29
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,320
I've sewn the sachet back together.

30
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,440
I brought it to see you.

31
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,080
Just to tell you

32
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
that from beginning to end,

33
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,000
there's only you, Li Yan, in my heart.

34
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,800
And the words you said to me in the cabin,

35
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,000
I remember them all clearly.

36
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,200
I was wrong, I'm begging you.

37
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,920
Please get up, Li Yan.

38
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,320
I won't be the city lord's wife anymore.

39
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Please wake up, okay?

40
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,560
I was wrong.

41
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Don't scare me, please get up.

42
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,840
Li Yan

43
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll have someone come and take care of him.

44
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,960
Qianjin

45
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,240
No, let go of me!

46
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,120
Li Yan isn't dead!

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,240
No, don't touch him!

48
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,320
Li Yan will wake up, right?

49
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,560
Li Yan

50
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,480
Don't treat me like this, Li Yan.

51
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,360
I'm begging you, please don't do this to me.

52
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,680
Li Yan

53
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,120
Why did you bring her here?

54
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,720
You two teamed up to trick me.

55
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,200
You lied to me.

56
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,840
He really is injured.

57
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,720
But we did it to make Northern Yue underestimate us.

58
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,960
That's why we deliberately spread

59
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,320
the news that he was on the verge of death.

60
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,920
You too, you lied to me with him.

61
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,600
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,240
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
Does it hurt?

64
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,600
It doesn't hurt.

65
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,200
How did you get hurt like this?

66
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,080
I'm fine.

67
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,320
You still say you're fine.

68
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,120
This is a serious injury, not a minor one.

69
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,960
You even lied to me together with Wenwen.

70
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,920
Go away, I don't want to see you again.

71
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,720
Alright, alright, don't be mad.

72
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,720
I won't bother you two anymore.

73
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,960
I never want to see you again.

74
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,200
Miss.

75
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,480
Aren't you going to help me up?

76
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,600
It's fine.

77
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,200
Do you know

78
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,920
I was so angry just now, I almost burst.

79
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,840
You made me so mad.

80
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,960
Didn't you insist on becoming the Lord's wife?

81
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Don't you want me anymore?

82
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,840
Why did you come looking for me again?

83
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,480
Who said I didn't want you?

84
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,320
I'm already here, aren't I?

85
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,600
Who cares about being the Lord's wife?

86
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,480
Then why did you say you didn't like me?

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,840
And that you were just using me?

88
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I was lying to you.

89
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,080
It was to save your life.

90
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,680
It's so dangerous here.

91
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,600
Aren't you afraid you'll get yourself killed coming here?

92
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
Of course I'm afraid.

93
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,320
But I'm even more afraid of you dying.

94
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,200
How did it go?

95
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
I've already had the news spread.

96
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,840
It says that Li, the commander of the Nanling army,

97
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,560
is gravely injured and beyond saving.

98
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,000
The funeral will be held soon.

99
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,080
Once the pyre is lit,

100
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,720
they will surely believe it.

101
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,120
Wenwen,

102
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,680
you're getting more and more cunning.

103
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,360
Learning from Li Yan,

104
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,600
teaming up to deceive people.

105
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,720
This move of Commander Li is called "luring the enemy into the trap."

106
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,960
If he hadn't spread the news of his fake death,

107
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,240
the Northern Yue people wouldn't have fallen for it.

108
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,720
They think that in our camp

109
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,120
this is our weakest moment.

110
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
But in reality,

111
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,960
once they attack,

112
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,960
the troops we've hidden outside the camp

113
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,600
will surely deal them a heavy blow.

114
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,720
Qianjin,

115
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,240
the outcome depends on this battle.

116
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,680
In a moment, I'll send you to a safe place.

117
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,840
No.

118
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,600
I have to go with you.

119
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,600
Promise me,

120
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,080
don't come with me.

121
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
Otherwise,

122
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
you'll become a burden to me on the battlefield.

123
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,360
Then you all have to promise me

124
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,200
that you'll return safely.

125
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,440
I promise you.

126
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,600
It's an ambush.

127
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,600
Here.

128
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,280
Liuyun

129
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,000
You should leave.

130
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,800
We of Nanling are still willing to

131
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,720
restore friendly relations with Beiyue.

132
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,200
But if Beiyue invades our land again,

133
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,240
I will lead the soldiers of Nanling

134
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,680
and flatten your Beiyue city.

135
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,000
Li Yan

136
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,960
Do you remember?

137
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,720
Be careful.

138
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,600
Li Yan

139
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:01,960
Qianjin

140
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,600
It's over.

141
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
It's over.

142
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,080
So can we be together forever now?

143
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Yes.

144
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,200
Qianjin

145
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,920
Qianjin

146
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,600
Qianjin

147
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
Qianjin

148
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,360
What should I do?

149
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm so useless.

150
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,360
I can't stay with you anymore.

151
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Qianjin

152
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,960
What are you saying?

153
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,680
Li Yan

154
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,720
Listen to me.

155
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,920
If I leave today,

156
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,800
promise me

157
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,200
you won't be sad.

158
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,480
Wherever you go, I'll follow you.

159
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,560
There are some places

160
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,600
you can't follow.

161
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,600
Qianjin, what are you talking about?

162
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,960
Qianjin

163
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,440
You'll be fine.

164
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,200
I will save you.

165
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,480
I promise I will save you.

166
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,840
Go.

167
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,000
Go.

168
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,960
Li Yan.

169
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,080
I can't hold on any longer.

170
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,560
Listen to me.

171
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,840
Qianjin.

172
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,840
You promised me.

173
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
You wouldn't leave me.

174
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,360
You promised you wouldn't leave me.

175
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,600
You promised you wouldn't leave me.

176
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,960
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,840
I can't keep the promise we made before.

178
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,960
I've been here.

179
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,840
I was very happy.

180
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,920
Li Yan.

181
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,960
I

182
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,960
love

183
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,480
you

184
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,480
Qianjin.

185
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,960
Qianjin.

186
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,320
Qianjin.

187
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,600
Qianjin.

188
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Qianjin.

189
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Qianjin.

190
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,440
Qianjin, wake up!

191
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,560
You'll be fine.

192
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,440
I'll save you.

193
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,720
I will definitely save you.

194
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,720
You promised me.

195
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,080
You won't leave me.

196
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,240
You promised.

197
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,360
You won't leave me.

198
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,920
I've been here before.

199
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,960
I'm very happy.

200
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,840
Wherever you go, I'll follow you.

201
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,120
There are some places

202
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,680
that you can't follow.

203
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,200
Hometown.

204
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,080
Isn't that different from Nanling?

205
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,320
Of course it's different.

206
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,200
No matter where she goes,

207
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,560
whether she wanders the world

208
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,840
or returns to the countryside,

209
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,080
or even to the place she calls

210
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,560
her hometown,

211
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,200
I would give up everything

212
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,480
to go with her.

213
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,200
I will marry no one but you.

214
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,240
My heart will never change.

215
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,080
Qianjin.

216
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,320
I said it before.

217
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,320
We'll face everything together.

218
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,320
You promised me.

219
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,960
We'll enjoy all the romantic things together.

220
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,440
Then never leave me again.

221
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,480
Okay?

222
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,720
Heaven is my witness.

223
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I, Li Yan, swear

224
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,200
that I will never leave Lin Qianjin again.

225
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,840
I will protect her forever.

226
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
Qianjin.

227
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,920
I want to know everything about you.

228
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:04,920
Then

229
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,200
in the future,

230
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,200
will you still be the city lord's wife?

231
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,600
The things I gave you,

232
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,720
do you really not cherish them at all?

233
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,920
I cherish everything you gave me.

234
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,560
Li Yan

235
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,440
Hello

236
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Do you have any perfume here that's suitable for people with pollen allergies?
