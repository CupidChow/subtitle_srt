1
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,160
I'm just afraid that you might die.

2
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,440
Then there would be no Li Yan in this world.

3
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,560
I've fallen for someone I shouldn't have.

4
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Is this supposed to be a joke?

5
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
So it really is me, Li Yan.

6
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,360
It was just wishful thinking.

7
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,960
If I had known it would be like this,

8
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,200
It would have entangled my heart.

9
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,200
I wish things had been different from the start.

10
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,280
It would have been better if we had never met.

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,280
Reporting to the City Lord,

12
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,320
According to the night sky observations by the Ceremonial Office,

13
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,440
the fifteenth of next month is the most auspicious day in three years.

14
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,440
It's perfect for a grand wedding.

15
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,080
Alright.

16
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,280
Then the wedding date for me and your daughter

17
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,080
will be set for that day.

18
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,080
Chang Le and Li Yan's wedding

19
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
will also be on that day.

20
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,200
Congratulations, City Lord! Best wishes, City Lord!

21
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,600
Clean up that water more thoroughly.

22
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,960
And you over there, keep sweeping the water.

23
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,960
You over there, work a bit faster.

24
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
Make sure all the lanterns are hanging straight.

25
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
You two, carry those more steadily.

26
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,200
Straighten the ladder over there.

27
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,280
The City Lord and the Princess

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,320
are about to have their wedding.

29
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,960
All of you, be careful.

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,160
Don't let anything go wrong.

31
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,840
Did you hear me?

32
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,440
We heard you.

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,720
You over there, hurry up!

34
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,840
Miss Lin, please take a look.

35
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,720
Which one do you prefer?

36
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,840
Does it really matter?

37
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,200
Brother Li Yan,

38
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
which one do you like?

39
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Let's use the green chrysanthemum.

40
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
You have excellent taste, sir.

41
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
I heard the city lord's wife chose this one too.

42
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,960
Then let's choose the lily.

43
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,800
I don't want to pick the same as her.

44
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
All your actions

45
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,440
must be carried out under my watch.

46
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,040
Heaven is my witness.

47
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
I, Li Yan, swear

48
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,960
that I will never leave Lin Qianjin again.

49
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,560
I will protect her forever.

50
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,800
If something really happens to you,

51
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,080
I will search all of Nanling City to find you.

52
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,440
Brother

53
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,280
How are the wedding preparations going?

54
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,720
Brother,

55
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,480
Miss Lin is getting eighteen betrothal gifts.

56
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,960
I only have ten dowry chests.

57
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
It's not fair at all.

58
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,360
Miss Lin is my only wife as the city lord.

59
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,840
Of course I want to give her the very best.

60
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,560
But I'm your own sister.

61
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,480
If you like them, Princess,

62
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,040
just take them all.

63
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
No need to act generous.

64
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,560
Forget it.

65
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,840
I've thought it through.

66
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,160
These are just material things.

67
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,320
How could they compare to our Li Yan?

68
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,840
Li Yan and Changle are finally together.

69
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
You should be at ease now.

70
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,920
Madam

71
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,480
Then congratulations to Princess Changle.

72
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,560
The rarest thing in life

73
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,960
is simply that the one you love

74
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,360
loves you back.

75
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,560
Li Yan

76
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,200
Chang Le is my dearest younger sister.

77
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
From this day forward,

78
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,920
I will entrust Chang Le

79
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,720
into your care.

80
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,480
I hope you can fulfill

81
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,040
your duties as her husband.

82
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,040
With your whole life,

83
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,960
cherish and protect her.

84
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,720
Do not let her down.

85
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,960
Brother.

86
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,440
Brother Li Yan is mature and steady.

87
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,680
He is considerate to others.

88
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,080
During this time,

89
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,920
he and I have treated each other with respect.

90
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,960
In the future, we will surely support each other.

91
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
And look after one another.

92
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,480
Prince Consort,

93
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
am I right?

94
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,080
Alright, alright.

95
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,040
You little girl,

96
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,600
you’re not even married yet,

97
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
and you’re already protecting your husband like this.

98
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,600
However,

99
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,360
I still hope

100
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,280
to hear it personally

101
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,440
from Li Yan himself.

102
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,320
After all,

103
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,960
rumors can be hurtful.

104
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,680
City Lord

105
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,200
I made a mistake earlier due to a moment of confusion.

106
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,240
Thank you, City Lord, and also the Princess.

107
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,200
For not holding past grudges.

108
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,360
And Miss Lin as well.

109
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
For pleading on my behalf regardless of your own status.

110
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,520
Commander Li, you are too polite.

111
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,280
City Lord

112
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,360
If there is nothing else,

113
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,840
I will take my leave.

114
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Report!

115
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,400
Urgent message from 800 li away!

116
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
The battle at the front is critical.

117
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,120
We request the City Lord to send reinforcements.

118
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,720
City Lord

119
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
I volunteer for the mission.

120
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,760
To go to the front lines

121
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,840
and defend Nanling.

122
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,640
You—

123
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
Dear soldiers of Nanling,

124
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,000
I am your city lord,

125
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,360
Murong Chengfeng.

126
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,360
Not long ago,

127
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,040
Beiyue City

128
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,680
attempted to use despicable means

129
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,040
to force Nanling into a marriage alliance with them,

130
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,840
to fulfill their wild ambitions.

131
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,840
Now that their plot has been exposed,

132
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,680
they have sent a large army to invade our northwest border.

133
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,040
At this very moment,

134
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,240
the vanguard soldiers of Nanling

135
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,520
are fighting the enemy in a bloody battle.

136
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,880
They need your support.

137
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,640
You have volunteered for this mission today,

138
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,400
and I am deeply gratified.

139
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,160
This journey

140
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
will be extremely dangerous,

141
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,080
but I believe

142
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,120
you will surely accomplish your mission,

143
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,680
strengthen Nanling's military might,

144
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,760
and protect our homeland.

145
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,120
Finally,

146
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,040
I also hope that you

147
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,400
can return safely with good news.

148
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,520
This cup of wine

149
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,640
is my send-off for you.

150
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,320
Li Yan will surely

151
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,120
not fail your command,

152
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,680
defend Nanling,

153
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,120
strengthen our military might,

154
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,520
and return safely.

155
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,040
Strengthen our military might, return safely!

156
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,840
Strengthen our military might, return safely!

157
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,840
Xiao Lizi,

158
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,440
no matter what,

159
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,360
I want you to come back alive.

160
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,400
Your subordinate

161
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,560
will obey.

162
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,120
Changle

163
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,400
Compared to Miss Lin,

164
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,200
where exactly do I fall short?
