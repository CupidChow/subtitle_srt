1
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,000
This is a contest between men.

2
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,920
Let me do it.

3
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,760
Brother,

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,880
Would you like to buy something?

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,800
To give to your wife?

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,880
Wife.

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,520
I think you should consider this sachet.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,520
Your wife will definitely like it.

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,360
Cheng Feng will definitely win.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,400
Brother Li Yan will definitely win.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,120
Impossible.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,800
How is it impossible?

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,640
It was never possible.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Shut up.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,240
But...

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,920
I...

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,360
I haven't married yet.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,040
That's all right.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Tomorrow, I'll send someone

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,680
to bring ten ladies to your residence.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,160
I guarantee each one is beautiful and well-behaved.

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,240
However,

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,400
I don't want to marry so soon.

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,160
Are you disrespecting me?

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,760
I think in Nanling City,

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,760
you don't want to get by anymore, do you?

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,320
I only have three coins.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,080
But I only have three coins.

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,400
What can I buy from your shop with that?

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,400
Look, with that little money,

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,480
you can buy the bracelet in my hand.

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,800
But what about his?

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Xiao Li,

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,000
Let me do it this time.

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,840
Cheng Feng,

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,880
I really can't let you this time.

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,520
Young Lady

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,120
Young Lady, Changle

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,240
Young Lady

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Changle

41
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,880
Young Lady

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Stop, Changle

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,400
Would you like to buy a necklace for Madam?

44
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,640
Three coins

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,560
It's fine

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Princess, we won

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,280
I knew I would win

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,800
Brother

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,880
This time, I set an example for the frontline soldiers

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
You must keep your word

51
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,400
Charity sale tonight

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,560
Changle and Li Yan's team wins

53
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,400
There is a reward

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,680
Respectfully seeing off the City Lord and Princess

55
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,160
Lian'er

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,000
You all should go back too

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Yes

58
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,000
Does it hurt?

59
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,640
No, it doesn't.

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,880
How could I possibly lose to Changle?

61
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,160
I'm in the heavyweight class, you know.

62
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,920
I could totally beat her.

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,160
But she actually won.

64
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
That can't be right.

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,640
You were really trying your best to beat me just now.

66
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,520
I...

67
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,520
What do you mean, "I"?

68
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,520
Who told you to get so close with the city lord?

69
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,040
Like that.

70
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,240
I—I didn't!

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,880
Then what about you and Changle?

72
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,240
You even put a bracelet on her.

73
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,240
And you were laughing and joking with other female customers.

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,480
All flirty and playful.

75
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,160
You looked really happy.

76
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,520
I...

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,400
When was I ever flirty?

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,480
You totally were.

79
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,920
I...

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,040
That was for the charity sale.

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,360
I wasn't doing it for the charity sale?

82
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,400
Fine.

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,400
Then...

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,280
They're all just customers.

85
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,640
None of them can get into my heart.

86
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,520
The one who is in my heart,

87
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,160
there's only one.

88
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,040
Who is it?

89
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't know.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
Of course, it's you.

91
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,680
Congratulations to the City Lord! Congratulations to the City Lord!

92
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,960
This charity sale raised a total of 18,000 taels of silver.

93
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,160
All of it will be used to purchase military provisions.

94
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
And will be delivered to the battlefield in a timely manner.

95
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,640
The soldiers know

96
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
that it was the City Lord and the Princess who organized the charity sale.

97
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,720
It boosted morale and led to a great victory.

98
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,320
The battle was won.

99
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,280
Very well, draft my official order.

100
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,680
If, through this charity sale,

101
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,200
I can achieve even a small accomplishment,

102
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,960
then I ask my brother

103
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,680
to grant me a small reward.

104
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,920
City Lord’s decree.

105
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
Lin Qianjin, daughter of Minister Lin,

106
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,560
Li Sijun is of noble character and dignified appearance.

107
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,080
He is a loyal soldier from a distinguished family.

108
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,440
He is gentle and composed by nature.

109
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,680
I have chosen an excellent son-in-law from among the palace’s young men.

110
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,640
They shall be wed.

111
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,400
Hereby, Princess Changle is given in marriage to Li Sijun.

112
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
May their union be blessed and bring honor.

113
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,400
Lin Qianjin is officially appointed as the City Lord’s wife.

114
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,200
Since Miss Lin has received the decree,

115
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
please follow me

116
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,400
to the residence to receive your title.

117
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,520
I still have matters to attend to.

118
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,360
You may leave for now.

119
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,480
Go make preparations for the wedding.

120
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,280
City Lord.

121
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
I humbly beg the City Lord

122
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240
to withdraw your order.

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,800
This is not something that can be withdrawn just because you say so.

124
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,560
Remember your place.

125
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,560
Stand down.

126
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,280
There are some things

127
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,320
I must say.

128
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,280
Li Yan.

129
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,480
Are you really going to defy my order?

130
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,760
Even if it means defying your order,

131
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,760
I still have to say it.

132
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,760
City Lord.

133
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,320
I

134
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,640
will marry no one but Lin Qianjin.

135
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,560
Insolence!

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,240
Lin Qianjin

137
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,520
is to be my future wife, the Lady of the City.

138
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,320
But I

139
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
truly love her.

140
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,480
I beg you, City Lord,

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
please withdraw your order.

142
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Though I regard you as a brother,

143
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,520
you must remember

144
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,520
I am the City Lord,

145
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,800
and you are my subject.

146
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,600
Now you disregard the propriety between ruler and subject,

147
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,600
showing me disrespect,

148
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,640
and defying my command.

149
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,840
What punishment do you deserve?

150
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,600
I am willing to accept any punishment.

151
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,520
City Lord, please

152
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,800
withdraw your order.

153
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,880
Guards!

154
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,440
Give him a beating.

155
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,160
Yes, sir.

156
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,240
If you are willing to marry Changle without hesitation,

157
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
and have no other intentions,

158
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,320
I can let bygones be bygones.

159
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,040
I will marry no one but the lady.

160
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,520
I ask the city lord

161
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,880
to grant your blessing.

162
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,680
Escort Li Yan back to the residence to recover.

163
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,600
Without a summons,

164
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,520
he is not allowed to see me.

165
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,320
Yes.

166
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,720
Why put yourself through this?

167
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,040
If you marry the princess,

168
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,440
you will enjoy endless wealth and honor.

169
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,360
But defying orders and turning against the city lord

170
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,960
is a capital offense, Li Commander.

171
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,240
That's right, Li Commander.

172
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,360
Go on, all of you.

173
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,640
Miss Lin, please raise your arm a bit higher.

174
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,760
If we wait any longer, it will be too late.

175
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,960
Miss Lin, please cooperate with us.

176
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,760
You're about to get married soon.

177
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,640
If you don't cooperate, the City Lord will punish us.

178
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,200
Miss Lin.

179
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,920
Are there any foods you usually avoid?

180
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,480
Miss Lin, please just cooperate.

181
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,920
Miss Lin.

182
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,040
Miss Lin.

183
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,160
Please try to understand us servants.

184
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,920
Miss.

185
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,440
This time, I absolutely won't leave you.

186
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,320
The Miss Lin in the story

187
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,200
was always meant to become the City Lord's wife.

188
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,600
But Li Yan and Changle...

189
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,040
I'm the one who least

190
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,920
should be here.

191
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,920
Maybe

192
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,920
after I become the City Lord's wife,

193
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,240
I'll be able to get the Yue Zhi Bai Zhuo Xiang.

194
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
And return to reality.

195
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,920
Everything is just a dream.

196
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
But

197
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,360
why does my heart hurt so much?

198
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,040
Li Yan.

199
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,440
Li Yan.

200
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,360
Don't be foolish, Miss Lin.

201
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,080
None of this is real.

202
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,760
Li Yan isn't real.

203
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,720
You can go home.

204
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,200
You should be happy.

205
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,640
I heard that Commander Li defied the order and refused to marry Princess Changle.

206
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,800
He was caned by the City Lord.

207
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,240
But he still hasn't given up.

208
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,600
He's been kneeling in front of the hall the whole time.

209
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,200
Begging the City Lord to take back his order.

210
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,240
Li Yan.

211
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,720
Miss.

212
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,640
Step aside.

213
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
Li Yan

214
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,520
What are you doing?

215
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,960
How can the City Lord be so cruel?

216
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,760
To beat you like this.

217
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,520
No.

218
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,800
You have to come back with me right now.

219
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,760
If you keep kneeling, you'll die.

220
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,360
Get up, quickly.

221
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,960
Miss

222
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,160
I disobeyed orders.

223
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,760
I angered the City Lord.

224
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,360
I'm willingly accepting my punishment here.

225
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
I already know.

226
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,160
The City Lord has ordered

227
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,200
that you marry Princess Changle.

228
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,320
I won't marry her.

229
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,880
Even if it means death,

230
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,200
since I have feelings for you,

231
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,920
no matter the danger to my life

232
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,360
or how deep the abyss,

233
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
I will stand by your side without hesitation.

234
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,040
I will ask the City Lord

235
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,320
to withdraw his order.

236
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,760
Don't talk about dying.

237
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,320
No.

238
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,440
You really have to get up right now, hurry.

239
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,240
Get up, come on, get up.

240
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,760
I...

241
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
I— Are you really not getting up?

242
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,200
Fine.

243
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,920
Then I'll go beg the City Lord.

244
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,200
Miss

245
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,720
Qian...

246
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,480
Lord of the city,

247
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,360
I beg you to pardon Li Yan.

248
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,480
If this continues, he really will die.

249
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,600
Lord of the city,

250
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,600
Lord of the city,

251
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,720
I know.

252
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,480
You feel terrible inside.

253
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,040
But you two are like brothers.

254
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
Can you help him? I beg you.

255
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,560
Lord of the city,

256
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,240
Lord of the city, I beg you.

257
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,040
Lord of the city,

258
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,560
If you insist on being so heartless,

259
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,560
then I'll kneel with him and plead for his life.

260
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,360
Until you change your mind.

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,040
What are you doing?

262
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm pleading with you together.
