1
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
If you really think

2
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,960
Miss Lin is innocent,

3
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,640
then hurry up and show the evidence.

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,000
Give everyone an explanation, understand?

5
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,520
Come.

6
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,160
Alright.

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,760
I will do my utmost

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,960
to find the real culprit

9
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
and give everyone an explanation.

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,400
Also, to clear Miss Lin's name

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,080
and prove her innocence.

12
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,760
After our investigation,

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,000
the mastermind behind poisoning Princess Liuyun

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
is Miss Lin.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
The city lord has already ordered

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,440
that Miss Lin

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,880
be executed immediately.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,960
It wasn't me!

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,760
I'm glad you're alright.

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,320
What's wrong?

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,840
I'm fine.

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,960
You...

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,520
You, you should take good care of your health.

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,200
You shouldn't have come so late.

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,960
I have something urgent.

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,720
What is it?

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
I really can't do this without you.

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,960
If you're not here,

29
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,000
the case can't go on.

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,080
So I need you.

31
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,080
All the evidence now

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,320
points to Changle.

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,760
Back at Shibali Inn that day,

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,640
she was already acting suspicious.

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,640
Later, at the lantern festival,

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,400
her reactions were strange as well.

37
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,960
Especially when I asked about Ye Haitang,

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,720
she refused to say anything.

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,720
And she reacted very strongly.

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,960
Tell me,

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,280
do you think she's deliberately avoiding

42
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,200
our questions?

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,200
What's wrong with you?

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm fine.

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,000
I...

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,960
Lately,

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,640
have you had any more fainting spells like last time?

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,960
No.

49
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,000
It only happened twice.

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:25,960
Then...

51
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,440
Have you

52
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,840
eaten anything unusual recently?

53
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,080
Any strange food?

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,760
Or maybe caught a chill

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,560
because of the cold weather?

56
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,280
No.

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,320
None at all.

58
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,560
Look,

59
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,000
it's not hot at all.

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,880
What's really wrong with you?

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,400
I...

62
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,160
You're dressed too lightly.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,080
You've just recovered from a serious illness.

64
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,080
It's quite cold outside.

65
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Take my cloak.

66
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,760
You care about me.

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,440
If you really care about me,

68
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,440
then do me a favor.

69
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,640
What favor?

70
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,640
I need to go to the City Lord's residence.

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,440
To investigate Ye Haitang.

72
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,200
You want to investigate Ye Haitang at the place where Changle lives?

73
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,760
Then I have no other choice.

74
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,320
You were lucky last time.

75
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,160
But it won't be like that every time.

76
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,160
I won't let you go.

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
You care about me.

78
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,520
No matter what,

79
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,920
I still won't let you go.

80
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,160
If you care about me,

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
then you should help me clear my name even more.

82
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,080
That's twisting words.

83
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,200
I have to get to the bottom of this quickly.

84
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,440
Otherwise,

85
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,080
the City Lord will keep misunderstanding me.

86
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,440
I...

87
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,440
I can stall for you for at most half an hour.

88
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Great!

89
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,280
I knew you wouldn't just stand by and do nothing.

90
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,400
Good brother, I'm off then.

91
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,280
Wait a second.

92
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,640
Go ahead.

93
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,400
Xiang'er.

94
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,080
Help me think about it, will you?

95
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,160
How can I arrange to meet Brother Li Yan again?

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,680
Xiang'er thinks

97
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,200
Why doesn't the Princess have the City Lord give the order

98
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,080
Would Li Sijun dare to disobey then

99
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
What do you know

100
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,760
I want Brother Li Yan to fall in love with me on his own

101
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,320
Not because of some order

102
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,040
When it comes down to it

103
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Isn't it all because at the Lantern Festival

104
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,680
Miss Lin interrupted halfway

105
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,320
If she hadn't tried to seduce

106
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,920
Brother Li Yan

107
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,040
Maybe he would have already fallen deeply for me

108
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
Brother Li Yan

109
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,160
I knew Brother Li Yan had feelings for me

110
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,320
Brother Li Yan

111
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,320
Princess

112
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,760
Xiang'er just washed some fresh grapes

113
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,200
They're sweet and juicy, perfect for cooling off

114
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,680
Come sit and try some

115
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,680
Princess, this...

116
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,680
Sit down

117
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,280
Princess

118
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,280
The City Lord has been busy with official duties lately

119
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
He specially ordered me to bring

120
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,520
the luminous pearl from Northern Yue's tribute

121
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,760
as a gift for the Princess to enjoy

122
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,040
On such a sunny day

123
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,160
Of course, it should be accompanied by flowers and music

124
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,560
Brother Li Yan

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,160
Would you like to enjoy a song with Changle

126
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
To enjoy it with the Princess

127
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,680
is my honor

128
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,960
Where exactly is the night-blooming begonia hidden

129
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,280
Brother Li Yan, do you think it sounds nice?

130
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,560
Brother Li Yan.

131
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,080
This music is beautiful.

132
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,440
It brings back many wonderful memories.

133
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,320
I recently bought a lot of fresh spices.

134
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,640
I’d like to invite you to take a look with me, Brother Li Yan.

135
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,640
Princess.

136
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,320
This...

137
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,920
The whole garden is filled with fragrance.

138
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,560
Of course,

139
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,800
the natural scent is even richer.

140
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,440
I will accompany the Princess myself.

141
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,400
Alright.

142
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,440
Then...

143
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,400
Let’s enjoy this natural fragrance together.

144
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,880
Who’s in there?

145
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,800
Brother Li Yan.

146
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,200
Can you come and enjoy the flowers with me more often from now on?

147
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,280
Look at that lotus.

148
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,040
Stop!

149
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,320
Stop!

150
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,320
Stop!

151
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,280
Stop!

152
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,040
Stop!

153
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,400
Reporting to the Princess.

154
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,640
This assassin broke into your bedchamber.

155
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,560
Seize the audacious assassin!

156
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,400
Yes!

157
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,160
Brother Li Yan

158
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,040
Are you alright?

159
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,280
You're bleeding.

160
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,400
It's nothing.

161
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,680
You audacious thief!

162
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,920
How dare you trespass into the princess's bedroom!

163
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,560
Princess

164
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,680
I must take her to the Inspectorate now.

165
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,280
Xiang'er

166
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,520
Take good care of the princess.

167
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,560
Brother Li Yan, be careful.

168
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,920
Princess

169
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,680
Come with me.

170
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
Is your hand alright?

171
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,800
I'm fine.

172
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,800
What about Ye Haitang?

173
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,520
Staying alive is the priority now.

174
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,320
Hurry, go!

175
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,440
Wait!

176
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,280
Miss Lin

177
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,760
Why is it you?

178
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,280
You really are unbelievably bold.

179
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,280
You actually dared to barge into my bedchamber.

180
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,680
Do you think the City Lord's residence is your own home?

181
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,800
Sister-in-law,

182
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,040
don't be angry.

183
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,680
It will be my home in the future.

184
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,800
And right now, it's basically my home too.

185
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,920
Sister-in-law, don't you consider me family?

186
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,960
You really are shameless.

187
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,040
My brother hasn't even looked at you properly.

188
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,200
And you still dare to call yourself his wife.

189
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,560
Guards, seize her!

190
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,760
The City Lord has arrived!

191
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Greetings, City Lord.

192
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,760
City Lord.

193
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,800
What is going on here?

194
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,160
What has happened?

195
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,440
Brother,

196
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,920
Miss Lin entered the City Lord's residence without being summoned.

197
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,320
She even sneaked into my bedroom—an unforgivable offense.

198
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,280
Miss Lin,

199
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,640
it's you again.

200
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,280
City Lord,

201
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
um,

202
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,800
here's what happened.

203
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,800
Lately, I've been obsessed with making incense.

204
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,440
And I heard that Princess Changle here

205
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,760
has a very special spice.

206
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,640
So I came over out of curiosity to take a look.

207
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,920
I can vouch for that.

208
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,560
Miss Lin is quite knowledgeable

209
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,680
when it comes to making incense.

210
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,640
So I—

211
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,920
Did I give you permission to speak?

212
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,680
I deserve punishment.

213
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,760
Brother,

214
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,640
weren't you going to punish Miss Lin?

215
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,680
Why are you blaming Brother Li Yan instead?

216
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,040
Miss Lin

217
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,280
You have no respect for rules and act recklessly.

218
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,920
You are to copy "Lessons for Women" as punishment.

219
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,040
One hundred times.

220
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,440
You can't go home until you've finished copying.

221
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,920
Li Yan will supervise.

222
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,880
Why am I so unlucky?

223
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,680
It was strange enough to end up inside an ancient book,

224
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,280
and now I have to copy this "Lessons for Women"?

225
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,800
I'm so hungry.

226
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,760
I really want to go home.

227
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,320
And eat my mom's braised chicken drumsticks.

228
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,040
Are you hungry?

229
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,280
It's delicious.

230
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Those two siblings from the Murong family,

231
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,640
they're really too much.

232
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,080
They must know

233
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
I hate these wordy, old-fashioned things the most.

234
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,880
That's why they made me copy "Lessons for Women".

235
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,680
So many times, too.

236
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,960
Give me your hand.

237
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,040
I mean, give me your hand.

238
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,920
You want to...

239
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,480
You want to eat my hand?
