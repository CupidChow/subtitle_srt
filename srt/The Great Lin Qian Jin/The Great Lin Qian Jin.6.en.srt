1
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,760
Are you just like them?

2
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,880
Do you all hope I disappear soon?

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,000
Because malice has long been branded

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,280
into my very bones, right?

5
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,600
I only care about the truth.

6
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,360
This temple is truly effective.

7
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,480
The last time I saw you,

8
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,640
you didn't have it yet.

9
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,480
But now you do.

10
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,880
I just heard it from others too.

11
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,280
At Shibali Shop,

12
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,160
they specialize in selling

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,400
strange and unusual medicines.

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,760
So I went and bought some.

15
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,480
I didn't expect it, but it really worked.

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,400
Really?

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,160
Then...

18
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,280
I want to try it too.

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,040
I'll take you there.

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,680
Husband,

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,520
if this time

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,880
I still can't have a child,

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,000
will you divorce me?

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,680
I... I...

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,640
Will you sell me to a brothel?

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,400
Husband, please don't treat me like this.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,800
How can this man be like this?

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Then... then...

29
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,040
Of course.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,160
Buddha,

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,000
if you can grant me a child,

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,760
I will give up half of my life.

33
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,880
You heartless person.

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Can't have children.

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
You blame the woman.

36
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,800
Why don't you think about it?

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,280
Maybe the problem is with you.

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
And you still want to divorce her.

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,760
You really are

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
worse than a beast.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
Worse than a beast.

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
Stop hitting.

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Actually,

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,280
um,

45
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,400
in the past,

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,880
my husband and I

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,160
were very loving.

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,360
If we had our own child,

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,760
he would treat me as well as he used to.

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,000
You really are a good girl.

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,520
Even after all he's done to you,

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,760
you're still defending him.

53
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,520
But,

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,600
having a child isn't that difficult.

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,520
You two,

56
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,880
just need to go to Shibali Inn,

57
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,600
and ask for a medicine called Xunzi Dan.

58
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,280
Where is Shibali Inn?

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,760
Shibali Inn?

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,360
It's right over there.

61
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:02,920
Let's go.

62
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,680
Let's go.

63
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,160
Hurry, let's go! Run!

64
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,880
Blockhead

65
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,160
Blockhead, what's wrong with you?

66
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,000
Blockhead

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,760
Murder!

68
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,520
Hurry, come with me!

69
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,680
This way, this way!

70
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,360
Li Yan

71
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,240
Li Yan, are you okay?

72
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,360
Li Yan

73
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,760
Li Yan

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,880
I didn't expect this blockhead

75
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,400
to look so strong

76
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,680
and still be allergic to pollen.

77
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,040
What are you doing?

78
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,600
Don't even think about ruining my reputation!

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,280
What the heck?

80
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,280
I've been working so hard here

81
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,120
taking care of you all night

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,040
I'm so tired I haven't even had a sip of water

83
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,680
Do you think it's easy for me?

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,000
You don't think

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
that

86
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,120
No

87
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,000
It's not that

88
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,520
But still

89
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,640
I still have to thank you

90
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,240
Sorry

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,360
I made you get hurt

92
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,640
You took care of me for so long

93
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,160
Now we're even

94
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,760
What's this?

95
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, this

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,120
Right

97
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,280
I made this for you

98
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,480
It's an anti-allergy sachet

99
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,640
You should wear it from now on

100
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,000
Then you won't have to worry about allergies anymore

101
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,600
You still know how to do this?

102
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,360
Of course.

103
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,160
Making incense is my old trade.

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Old trade?

105
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,520
No, no.

106
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,800
I mean,

107
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,920
You must be thirsty now.

108
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,480
I'll get you some water.

109
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,080
Miss

110
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,600
The medicine is ready.

111
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,800
S-sorry.

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
I didn't mean to.

113
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Um...

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,520
We...

115
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,680
Go have tea.

116
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,760
No, take the medicine.

117
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,480
Let me do it myself.

118
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,760
What?

119
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,200
Are you saying I don't take good care of you?

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,080
The doctor said so.

121
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,480
The medicine must be taken while it's hot.

122
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,200
You can't let it cool down.

123
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,960
What's wrong with that?

124
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,320
Because it's bitter.

125
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,480
When it's hot,

126
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,120
your mouth goes numb from the heat, so you don't taste it.

127
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,480
That's nonsense.

128
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,040
Just give it to me.

129
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,960
Thank you.

130
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,600
Li Sijun actually says thank you?

131
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,040
That's rare.

132
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,040
If you really want to thank me,

133
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,600
then owe me a favor.

134
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,600
You really are...

135
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,920
Alright, alright.

136
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,200
Just kidding.

137
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,400
Seriously, you always take it so seriously.

138
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,760
How about this:

139
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,400
Just rest here today.

140
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,680
If you need anything, call Lian'er.

141
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,400
I'm going out for a bit.

142
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,560
Where are you going?

143
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,200
I have to go to Shibali Pu.

144
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,480
I've already found a good spot.

145
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,040
I'll be right back.

146
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,840
I'll go with you.

147
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,680
But your health...

148
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,200
It's nothing.

149
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Besides, the city lord said

150
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
I should protect you.

151
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,600
If anything happens to you,

152
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,400
then you have to take good care of yourself.

153
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,480
If something happens to you,

154
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,200
I can't take responsibility for it.

155
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,680
I'll leave it to you two in a moment.

156
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,480
Make sure to act convincingly.

157
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,960
Okay, no problem. Got it.

158
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,680
Come on, hurry up!

159
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,320
This...

160
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,840
What's going on here?

161
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Miss, please forgive us.

162
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,120
We were wrong.

163
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,200
Those two spoke badly.

164
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,600
They're here to apologize to you.

165
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,560
Hurry, get up.

166
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,200
Quick, quick!

167
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,600
It's fine now, let's go.

168
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Listen, listen.

169
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,320
The young lady is being so forgiving to you.

170
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,760
Gossiping about others

171
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,240
should have its limits, right?

172
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,120
You're right, Young Master Lu.

173
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
We won't dare again.

174
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,760
Let's go.

175
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,120
Wenwen

176
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
Didn't I already tell you?

177
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm not like I used to be.

178
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,400
I won't hold a grudge over things like this anymore.

179
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,240
So don't be mad, okay?

180
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,480
Alright.

181
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,680
Jinjin won't be mad.

182
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,960
I won't be mad then.

183
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,320
Oh, right.

184
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,800
The two of us still have important things to do.

185
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,760
We'll head out first.

186
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,040
Take me with you.

187
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,800
We can't.

188
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,840
It wouldn't be convenient to bring you along.

189
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,040
We're leaving now.

190
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,520
Bye-bye.

191
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,800
Let's go.

192
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,080
Don't you owe me a favor?

193
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,080
How about this—

194
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,040
Buy me a hairpin to wear.

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,120
You two, aren't you—

196
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,480
No, no, no, we're not.

197
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,080
That's right, it's you.

198
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
You forgot about me.

199
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,400
Aren't you the one from that day—

200
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,360
The young lady praying for a child.

201
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,640
Oh, it's you, sister.

202
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,040
I almost forgot about you.

203
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Important people really are forgetful.

204
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,760
Are things still good between you and your husband?

205
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,600
Of course.

206
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,920
My husband

207
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,760
is even planning to buy me a hairpin.

208
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,120
Right?

209
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,080
Husband.

210
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,840
That's good to hear.

211
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,520
You two look so loving together.

212
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
I believe

213
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,840
you'll be pregnant soon.

214
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,640
Hurry up.

215
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,400
Put it on your wife and let us see.

216
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,120
Come on.

217
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,520
Then you pick one, husband.

218
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,520
Alright.

219
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,480
But I've never worn one of these before.

220
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,040
Just put it on, hurry up.

221
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,640
Then I'll just put it on.

222
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
There really are all kinds of people.

223
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
So funny.

224
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,800
Yeah.

225
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
Are you trying to dress me up

226
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,760
or are you

227
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,920
sticking a lightning rod on me?

228
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,640
I can't stand you straight guys.

229
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,320
I already told you, I don't know how to do it.

230
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,760
But I think it's pretty interesting.

231
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,040
Interesting, my foot! What's so interesting about it?

232
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,080
You heartless man!

233
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,600
You're bullying the young lady again.

234
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,960
You call me heartless?

235
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,360
If not you, then who?

236
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,040
Move aside, move aside.

237
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Young lady!

238
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,040
I'm just saying,

239
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,240
why do you insist on sticking with this man?

240
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
You're so kind-hearted.

241
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
Sister, let me introduce you to the handsome guy next door.

242
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,520
He's much better looking than this man.

243
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,600
Way more handsome.

244
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,360
Sister, that's not necessary.

245
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,960
As for me,

246
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,400
it has to be him.

247
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,920
Thank you.

248
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,040
Go take care of your business.

249
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,960
Thanks.

250
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,200
I suddenly got a great idea.

251
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,080
What idea?

252
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,040
Let's go.

253
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,240
That one belongs to the master.

254
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,320
If you mess this up for me,

255
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,240
you'll have to pay for all of it.

256
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,920
Did you hear me?

257
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,360
You're always so careless.

258
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,800
Young master, madam.

259
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,360
Come take a look.

260
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,200
What would you like?

261
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,240
We have everything.

262
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,240
Yes.

263
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,640
Madam.

264
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,600
It's rare for us to come out together.

265
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,080
What do you like?

266
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,960
Just go ahead and buy it.

267
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,920
Alright.

268
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,240
Then I'll be straightforward.

269
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,520
We want to buy some Night Begonia to try.

270
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,480
Night Begonia, huh?

271
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,480
This isn't something you can just play with casually.

272
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,680
With our current means,

273
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,480
we can still afford it.

274
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,720
Right, dear?

275
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,440
We'll do as Madam wishes.

276
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,920
No, that's not what I meant.

277
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,240
So do you have it or not?

278
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
We've been talking for so long.

279
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,160
If you don't have it,

280
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,120
we'll just go to another shop.

281
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,720
I heard that

282
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,600
there's a place called Bashili Inn

283
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,600
that also sells Night Begonia.

284
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,440
Nonsense.

285
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,920
No,

286
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,680
what I mean is,

287
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,240
in the whole city of Nanling,

288
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,040
the only place with Night Begonia

289
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,800
besides our Shibali Inn

290
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,600
is nowhere else.

291
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,240
What's so special about it?

292
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,480
Why is it only your shop that can sell it?

293
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,680
You don't get it, do you?

294
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,680
The petals of the Night Begonia

295
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,800
are dark purple.

296
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,040
In the trade, it's called "black gold."

297
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,360
Not only that,

298
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,920
it gives off a unique fragrance.

299
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,680
Ladies of high status often use it as a spice.

300
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
The amazing thing is,

301
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,920
once it touches alcohol, it becomes colorless and tasteless.

302
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,600
It also becomes highly poisonous.

303
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,040
If someone accidentally drinks it,

304
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,480
it could be fatal.

305
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,160
Boss

306
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,240
You say that,

307
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,440
how do I know if it's true?

308
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,040
If it really is poisonous,

309
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,480
why would anyone buy it?

310
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,600
You don't know, do you?

311
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,560
But people actually do buy it.

312
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,240
And

313
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,360
they pay a pretty high price for it.

314
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,360
Of course,

315
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,800
as for me,

316
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,360
every time I sell some, I remind them repeatedly.

317
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
As for them,

318
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,240
when they buy it,

319
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,120
they just put it in a sachet and smell it, that's all.

320
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,040
I don't believe that.

321
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
You've been talking for so long, but I haven't seen anything.

322
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,360
How do we know if it's real or fake?

323
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,600
Yeah,

324
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,120
right?

325
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,360
If you don't believe me,

326
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,600
I'll show it to you.

327
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,040
Grind it well.

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,600
Buddy,

329
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,160
what kind of medicine is this?

330
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,160
This is Darjeeling tea.

331
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,680
And what about this one?

332
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,600
It's the stamen of a balloon flower.

333
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,680
Go ahead, keep busy.

334
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,120
No.
