1
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,800
Ladies,

2
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,040
you absolutely have to get this.

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,240
There are only three hundred available.

4
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,280
Raise your hand to indicate.

5
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,520
First come, first served.

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,920
Alright, are you ready?

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,560
Three,

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,640
two,

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,080
one,

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,240
Start selling!

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,880
Oh, right,

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,400
I just forgot to mention something.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,080
This violet sachet

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,840
can not only be carried with you,

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,920
but we can also make it into a necklace.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,920
You can wear it around your neck.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,400
That way, you'll not only smell amazing,

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,600
but it also looks beautiful.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,440
Now, let's have Li Sijun show us

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,080
how to wear the necklace.

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,400
Li Sijun

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
Li Sijun is blushing.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,640
It seems this sachet really is effective.

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,760
I want to buy one.

25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,960
I want to buy one too.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,040
Alright.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,840
I'll take them all.

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,040
Okay.

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,280
I want one too.

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,000
Mine.

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Hold it carefully.

32
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,680
Mine.

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,280
I want one too.

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,600
Thank you.

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,440
Princess Changle has arrived.

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,760
I want one too.

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,680
The princess is here too.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,600
Why is the Princess here too?

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,240
Yes.

40
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,560
Clean up this area for me.

41
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,840
In half an hour,

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,560
I will open for business.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Miss, why did Princess Changle come here?

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,280
Brother.

45
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,200
I heard Miss Lin is organizing a charity sale on the main street.

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,600
All the young ladies and gentlemen are eagerly participating.

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,600
Even Brother Li Yan went.

48
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,800
As a princess,

49
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,920
I should contribute as well.

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,480
So, Brother,

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,160
please allow me to join the charity sale.

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,280
To set an example for the nobles of Nanling.

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,280
To share the city lord's burdens.

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,960
Of course, that's my duty as a princess.

55
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,080
I came here today

56
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,480
to raise funds for the soldiers on the front lines.

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,600
To do my part.

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,040
Miss Lin.

59
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,840
Don't think your little tricks

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,200
can let you control everything.

61
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,200
Let me tell you,

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,840
the top spot on today's popularity ranking

63
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,520
will definitely be mine.

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,720
As it happens,

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
I also want to tell you,

66
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,640
I will never give up the top spot

67
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,720
to you.

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,960
The Princess is joining the charity sale too?

69
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,520
You guys, take care of this.

70
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,840
Brother Li Yan.

71
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Princess Changle.

72
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,600
Why are you here?

73
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,800
Brother Li Yan.

74
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,040
Before I left, my brother told me

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,960
to ask you for help if I needed anything.

76
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,400
You...

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,720
Can you help me?

78
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,720
Since it's the city lord's order,

79
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,800
then I, Li Yan, will accept the command.

80
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,920
Miss Lin,

81
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,160
I, the princess, will have a public contest with you today.

82
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
Let's see who

83
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,640
is truly stronger.

84
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,160
Brother Li Yan, let's go.

85
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,400
Um...

86
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,400
You go ahead first.

87
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
I'll just follow you.

88
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,960
Alright.

89
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,280
I don't have a choice either.

90
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,600
I'll go ahead.

91
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,280
You...

92
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,480
You blockhead, are you really going?

93
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,600
You're making me so mad!

94
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
Just put it here.

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,960
Brother Li Yan, let's get started.

96
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,520
Come take a look at the same bracelet as mine.

97
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,600
How much is this?

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,520
Come on, it's buy one get one free. Get one!

99
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,640
I want one too.

100
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,160
Miss, more and more people are coming.

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,080
What are you afraid of?

102
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,200
Customers are always curious.

103
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,960
Once their curiosity fades,

104
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,160
they'll naturally realize

105
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,040
that our products are better.

106
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,520
Oh my god.

107
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,280
This sachet is so charming!

108
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,040
This scent...

109
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,960
It makes you feel so special.

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,920
Buy one, get one free!

111
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,160
Buy one, get one free during the charity sale!

112
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160

Buy one, get one free!

114
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,400
My sachets are unique.

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,600
Gold and silver jewelry from the City Lord's Mansion is buy one, get one free!

116
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,920
Don't go, don't go!

117
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,040
Buy one, get one free! Come and see!

118
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,280
Buy one, get one free.

119
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,160
Hold it carefully.

120
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,960
Buy one, get one free.

121
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,280
Buy one, get one free.

122
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,840
Two coins.

123
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,920
Miss Lin.

124
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,160
Let's see what you can use to compete with me.

125
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,520
That spendthrift princess...

126
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,600
She started with cutthroat competition right away.

127
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
How can I help Miss Lin?

128
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,040
Boss Wang, your letter.

129
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,280
Brothers,

130
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,600
this is our best chance to repay Sister Jin.

131
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Does everyone know which street they're responsible for?

132
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,480
We know.

133
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,040
Shibalipu is partnering with the spice shop.

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,400
Unique medicinal spices,

135
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,400
guaranteed to fill the air with fragrance

136
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
and cure your ailments at the same time.

137
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,360
Grandma Li, and Grandma Wang next door,

138
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,400
after buying incense from our spice shop,

139
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,720
immediately met the grandpa from the pancake shop,

140
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,520
and found a new love in life.

141
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,920
Quick, help me over there, I want to buy incense too!

142
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,280
What's gotten into the boss?

143
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,160
He actually wants us to sell sachets on the street.

144
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,480
What do you know?

145
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,200
This is all for Miss Lin.

146
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,600
Selling incense,

147
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,040
sachets,

148
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,600
unique medicinal spices,

149
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,720
guaranteed to fill the air with fragrance

150
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,160
and cure your ailments.

151
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,840
Come and take a look!

152
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Thank you for helping me.

153
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,480
Between us,

154
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,600
there's no need for thanks.

155
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,400
But...

156
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,280
If Changle finds out you helped me,

157
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,520
that would be deceiving the princess.

158
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,640
That's a capital offense.

159
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,480
Since I have feelings for you,

160
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,520
no matter if it's life-threatening

161
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
or a bottomless abyss,

162
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,600
I'll stand by your side without hesitation.

163
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,840
You blockhead,

164
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,400
you even know how to rhyme.

165
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,160
Then let me tell you too,

166
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,840
I really like you.

167
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
That means, "happy cooperation."

168
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,720
Happy cooperation.

169
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,640
Brother Li Yan

170
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,280
Brother Li Yan

171
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,080
Why did you come over to Miss Lin's side again?

172
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,280
I'm almost overwhelmed over there.

173
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,480
You didn't even offer to help me.

174
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,640
Help you with what?

175
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,400
Li Yan isn't your servant.

176
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,920
He doesn't have to do whatever you tell him.

177
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,800
You're busy over there,

178
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,480
but can't you see I'm busy here too?

179
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,280
Brother Li Yan

180
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,040
Are you helping me or her?

181
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,720
You, little girl,

182
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,280
why do you only know how to act spoiled?

183
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,960
Let me tell you,

184
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,520
we modern people aren't fooled by that anymore.

185
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,720
Brother Li Yan is mine.

186
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,600
He's mine.

187
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,520
Mine.

188
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,840
Mine.

189
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,720
Stop it!

190
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,840
Brother, Miss Lin is bullying me.

191
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,960
Changle

192
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,840
As a princess,

193
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,040
you should always be dignified and proper.

194
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,040
You too.

195
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,400
Brother, how could you be fooled by Miss Lin too?

196
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,480
Nonsense.

197
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,040
I,

198
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,640
I am the city lord.

199
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,600
How could I be fooled?

200
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,080
Then why are you siding with outsiders?

201
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
What do you mean, siding with outsiders?

202
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,920
She will be my city in the future.

203
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,960
That's a secret.

204
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,520
She'll be part of our family in the future.

205
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,600
I think today,

206
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,160
let's have a fair competition.

207
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,200
I'll team up with Qianjin.

208
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,160
Li Yan will team up with Changle.

209
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,720
Whichever team sells more tonight,

210
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,160
I

211
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,600
will give

212
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,480
a generous reward.

213
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,400
Let's compete, then.

214
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,960
Thank you. Here.

215
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:48,760
Alright.

216
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,800
City Lord.

217
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,200
Thank you.

218
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,720
This...

219
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,880
You're still calling me City Lord at a time like this?

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,600
That's too formal.

221
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,600
I'll take this one.

222
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,800
Just call me

223
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,360
Chengfeng.

224
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,000
Chengfeng.

225
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,800
I'll take one of these.

226
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,160
By the way,

227
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,640
this is made with many spices.

228
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
It includes thirty kinds of fruit and eighteen kinds of flowers.

229
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,160
You have to remember all of them.

230
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,000
That way, you can better promote it to customers.

231
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,440
Straight men are really scary.

232
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,440
What exactly is a straight man?

233
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,120
Is it also some kind of spice?

234
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,520
Yes.

235
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,120
Miss.

236
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,520
What are your

237
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,760
expectations for your future partner?

238
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Do you have any hopes?

239
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,760
My other half...

240
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,680
I think

241
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,520
even though he looks

242
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,080
like a stubborn old man,

243
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,520
when he acts childish,

244
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,120
he's mischievous and playful,

245
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,840
just like a little kid.

246
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,080
On the surface,

247
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,760
he seems a bit dull,

248
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,800
and looks silly and slow,

249
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,280
but deep down, he's actually very

250
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,760
pure and kind.

251
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,280
He's like the sun.

252
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,160
Those who understand him

253
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,920
can feel his warmth.

254
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,160
Isn't that exactly me?

255
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,160
Miss.

256
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,080
I'm really

257
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,400
so touched.

258
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,160
Touched by what?

259
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,760
I mean,

260
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,680
I know you do all this for me.

261
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,440
Oh, no—

262
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,400
you're doing it for our

263
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
for our Nanling City.

264
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Actually,

265
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,400
I just want to do something for the soldiers on the front lines.

266
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,920
I just want to contribute in my own way.

267
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,040
Which one do you want?

268
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,040
This one is fine.

269
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,080
Thank you.

270
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,400
Here you go, thank you.

271
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,280
Come.

272
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,680
Everyone,

273
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,520
Everyone here today is a guest.

274
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,680
Anyone who buys something from the princess today

275
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,320
will have it personally put on by me.

276
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
I, the princess, will buy first.

277
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,440
Then,

278
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,960
what do you want?

279
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,680
What is it?

280
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
A bracelet.

281
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,000
Come.

282
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,280
Thank you.

283
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,400
You blockhead!

284
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
You said we were on the same side.

285
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,680
But as soon as you heard about the competition, you pull this.

286
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,520
Putting a bracelet on Changle,

287
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,200
and putting a necklace on another woman.

288
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,560
Men's words are nothing but lies.

289
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,680
Why did everyone leave?

290
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,680
Nice going, Li Yan.

291
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,280
Cheng Feng.

292
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,800
Are your limbs coordinated?

293
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,760
Coordinated limbs?

294
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,640
Yes.

295
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,680
Exactly.

296
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
Can you dance?

297
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,160
Don't go!

298
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,800
I'll buy two more.

299
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,080
I'll buy one too.

300
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,440
Give me one.

301
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,560
Give me one.

302
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
I want one too.

303
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,040
Give me one.

304
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,000
This one?

305
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,280
Give it to me.

306
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
Here, these are yours. Take them all.

307
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,560
Give me all of these.

308
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,280
I'll take them all.

309
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,200
Give me two more.

310
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,280
I'll take everything.

311
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,400
Sold out, there's nothing left.

312
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,160
If you want to buy, try over there.

313
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,320
I'll take everything.

314
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,800
This...

315
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,920
Gone.

316
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,560
All sold out.

317
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,160
They're all so good.

318
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,200
It's really worth it.

319
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,320
I've never even seen this before.

320
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,040
Congratulations to the Princess and Miss Lin.

321
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,040
The amount of charity funds raised is the same.

322
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
What?

323
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,160
I, the Princess, am supposed to be at the top of the list.

324
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,520
Are there no other customers?

325
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,800
Miss, a new customer.

326
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,760
Brother Li Yan, hurry, hurry!

327
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,520
This is a contest between men.

328
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,440
Let me do it.
