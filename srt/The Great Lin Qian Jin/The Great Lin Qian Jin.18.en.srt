1
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,640
If I'm not mistaken,

2
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,240
that day at Shenlong Temple,

3
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,400
and the assassins sent from Lover's Valley,

4
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
were arranged by you, weren't they?

5
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,480
That's even more baseless.

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,520
I've never harmed Miss Lin.

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,280
Nor have I ever sent anyone to kill you.

8
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,400
I was unconscious for a while recently.

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,880
The court physicians can all testify to that.

10
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,480
Besides,

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,640
when I woke up later,

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,120
I heard that Miss Lin had suffered so much.

13
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,520
I was heartbroken too.

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,240
Oh?

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,400
Is that so?

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,280
Princess Liuyun,

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,240
when you lie,

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,160
your tears just won't stop.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,280
And you don't even blush or flinch.

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,120
Fine, I admire you.

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,480
Guards!

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Bring the person in.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,120
Yes.

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,360
Yingxue!

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,760
You...

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,400
Commander Li,

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,160
what crime has Yingxue committed?

28
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,280
Why are you treating her like this?

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,520
Princess Liuyun,

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,600
what crime has Yingxue committed?

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm afraid you know better than I do.

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,520
Li Sijun

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,400
Li Yan

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,000
You usually seem so dull.

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
I didn't expect

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,640
you to be so cunning.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,280
Yes, you're right.

38
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,400
Poisoning,

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,520
the Lovers' Valley assassination,

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,400
Shenlong Temple—

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
I arranged all of it.

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,640
But so what?

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,520
Lin Qianjin has already been beheaded.

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,880
As long as you die too,

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
no one will know I did all this.

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,120
Princess Liuyun

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,040
What is this?

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,000
Princess Liuyun

49
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,640
Do you think your tricks are clever?

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,280
Li Yan

51
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,240
Already revealed the truth

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,360
to me.

53
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,840
Back at Lovers' Valley,

54
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,880
I had already sent a message to the Lord

55
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,000
that you were the mastermind behind all of this.

56
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,160
We did this

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,120
just to make you lower your guard,

58
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,640
to make you think Miss Lin was sure to die,

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,280
so you would feel safe hiding the poison,

60
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,360
and finally reveal your true colors.

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,480
Lord

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,640
I was momentarily blinded by greed, my Lord.

63
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,600
Seeing how well you treated Miss Lin,

64
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,760
I was afraid,

65
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,600
I was afraid she would really take you away from me.

66
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
That's why I did this, my Lord.

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,720
This is not an excuse for you to stir up trouble

68
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,640
or frame others for murder.

69
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,000
Lord of Northern Yue

70
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,240
wants an explanation from us, doesn't he?

71
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
Go back and give him a proper explanation.

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,120
Guards!

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,520
Take Liuyun

74
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,840
and escort her back to Northern Yue.

75
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,240
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,160
Anyway, with Miss Lin buried with me,

77
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,480
it's worth it for me.

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,880
Weren't you dead?

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,040
Oh, right.

80
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,160
I forgot to tell you.

81
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,760
Chief Lin

82
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,760
and the evidence of colluding with Northern Yue

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
as well as the prison break by the man in black

84
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
were all orchestrated by the city lord.

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,400
Miss Lin and Chief Lin

86
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,120
were acquitted and released long ago.

87
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,760
Fine.

88
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,120
You all set me up.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,520
Do you think this means you've beaten me?

90
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,240
Just wait and see.

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
Who is it?

92
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,400
Miss.

93
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,400
It's me.

94
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,000
Go away.

95
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,280
I don't want to see you.

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,240
Aren't you annoying?

97
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,720
I said I don't want to see you.

98
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Even if you break down the door,

99
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,640
I still won't see you.

100
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,760
Li Yan.

101
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,920
You really left.

102
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,880
Who told you to leave?

103
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,120
Miss.

104
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
I didn't leave.

105
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
I was just afraid you'd be angry.

106
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,520
And it would harm your health.

107
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,040
I'll always be here with you.

108
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,240
Miss.

109
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,640
You saw it in the main hall too.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,520
If Liu Yun hadn't walked right into our trap,

111
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,400
we really wouldn't have been able to do anything to her.

112
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,720
We set up this plan

113
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,880
just to let you and your father

114
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,480
suffer grievances for Liu Yun to see.

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,280
But I couldn't tell you.

116
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,120
You know, every time I see you suffer,

117
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,000
my heart

118
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,280
feels like it's being cut by knives.

119
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,880
Take off her shoes.

120
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
Hit her! Beat her to death!

121
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,280
Beat her to death!

122
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,880
Beat her to death!

123
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Commander Li.

124
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
As you ordered,

125
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,120
all the eggs and vegetables on the street

126
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
have been bought and brought back.

127
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,640
But what should we do with all these eggs and vegetables?

128
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,000
I smashed several times and still don't feel better.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,400
Exactly, it doesn't help.

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,880
If anything happens to Miss Lin,

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,280
I'll hold you all responsible.

132
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,400
Yes.

133
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,640
But you came here,

134
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
yet you still didn't save me.

135
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,920
You even locked me in that

136
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,360
room full of rats.

137
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,880
I...

138
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,920
I was so scared, so hopeless.

139
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,880
Do you know that?

140
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,040
I couldn't even get enough to eat.

141
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,640
I've gotten so thin from hunger.

142
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,240
I'm telling you,

143
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,520
the most hateful thing is,

144
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,640
you even came to the cell

145
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,240
to say those hurtful things to me.

146
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,720
Do you know how heartbroken I was, crying by myself?

147
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,040
Tell me clearly,

148
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,000
did you see me getting hit by others,

149
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,160
and you didn't feel sorry for me at all?

150
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,400
Those eggs and vegetables, I...

151
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,280
Don't talk about that.

152
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,240
It would have been better if you hadn't brought this up.

153
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,720
Now that you mention it, I'm even angrier.

154
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,920
See for yourself.

155
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,000
Other guys

156
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
all do romantic things

157
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,400
for the people they like.

158
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,000
But you,

159
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,000
you just bought eggs and vegetables.

160
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
When they ran out of things to throw,

161
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,520
they all started throwing shoes at me.

162
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,840
Do you know how much that hurt?

163
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,600
I know.

164
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
You weren't the one getting hit.

165
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,640
Of course you don't understand.

166
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,040
Don't be upset—

167
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't be upset, right?

168
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,760
That's easy for you to say.

169
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,040
Let me tell you,

170
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,360
don't think that just because you cleared my name

171
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,520
you can make up for everything.

172
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,240
All those hurtful things you said,

173
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,640
I remember them perfectly.

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,880
I didn't.

175
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,640
You didn't?

176
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm telling you,

177
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
it's over between us.

178
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,600
I never want to see you again.

179
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,720
From now on,

180
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,360
we're cutting all ties.

181
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,120
We're done for good.

182
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,200
Since Liu Yun was escorted back to Northern Yue,

183
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,680
Northern Yue has assembled an army of one hundred thousand.

184
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,800
They have invaded our borders.

185
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,560
What are your thoughts on this?

186
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,840
These Northern Yue scoundrels...

187
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,720
I originally planned to have the Grand General

188
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,040
lead two hundred thousand elite soldiers

189
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,920
to resist them.

190
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,200
But I hope the city lord will reconsider.

191
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,040
As the saying goes, "Before the troops move, provisions must come first."

192
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,680
But this year, there is a plague in the city.

193
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,560
The state treasury is lacking funds.

194
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,400
If we want to ensure supplies for the front lines,

195
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,320
we will inevitably have to increase taxes.

196
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,920
But with the plague this year,

197
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,480
how can we

198
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,320
ask the people to pay these taxes?

199
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
What you mentioned

200
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,560
is exactly what troubles me.

201
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,000
Actually, I have an idea.

202
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,920
In Lover's Valley,

203
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,800
the great physician once mentioned

204
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,400
the little yellow flower from the story

205
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,080
can dispel wind-heat and clear toxins.

206
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,000
If we combine it with other medicines into a powder,

207
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,160
and put it into the wells, it can quickly cure the plague.

208
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,200
Have you heard?

209
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
The young lady of the Lin family solved this plague.

210
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,600
Who would have thought this little poison girl

211
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,080
would do such a good deed?

212
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,960
We really should thank her.

213
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,640
The plague is over!

214
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,960
It's over!

215
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,960
Miss, you are truly amazing.

216
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,320
The plague that affected everyone in the city

217
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,880
was cured by you.

218
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,520
It was nothing.

219
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,160
Today is truly, since the plague began,

220
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,400
the most lively day in Nanling City.

221
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,120
I heard the city lord praised the event you organized,

222
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,680
the charity sale to raise funds and donate provisions to the army,

223
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,040
and couldn't stop complimenting it.

224
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,320
Fresh juice! Come and try some!

225
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,240
It's been so long since we've seen

226
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,760
such a lively scene.

227
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,520
It's already dark,

228
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,880
but everyone in the city

229
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,800
is still out setting up stalls and selling goods.

230
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,240
All to raise provisions for Nanling.

231
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,160
Miss, you really are incredible.

232
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,520
When I step in,

233
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,800
success is only natural.

234
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,680
But Miss,

235
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,600
we're currently at the bottom

236
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,520
of the rankings.

237
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,520
What?

238
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,120
Hurry, hurry, get the goods to them quickly!

239
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,040
The top salesperson is about to start selling.

240
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,680
Everyone, come and take a look!

241
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,440
These are sachets I made myself.

242
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,400
And scented balm and powder.

243
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,760
If you take these home,

244
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,240
you'll give off a charming fragrance.

245
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,160
Most importantly,

246
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,960
every penny you spend

247
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,240
will go to support the front lines.

248
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,760
To the soldiers fighting bravely.

249
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,240
If you're interested, take action!

250
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,760
That's right.

251
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,600
These sachets,

252
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,640
they must be poisoned.

253
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
I think we shouldn't buy them.

254
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,600
Boss.

255
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,680
I'd like to buy a scented lip rouge.

256
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,800
Why are you here?

257
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,160
I want to buy a gift for someone I love.

258
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,960
Which one do you think would suit her?

259
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,240
Then may I ask, sir,

260
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,960
your beloved,

261
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,240
what color does she like?

262
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,680
I think...

263
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,880
it should be red.

264
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,880
Red.

265
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,520
We have three kinds of red here.

266
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,160
They are classic peach red, rose red,

267
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,240
and death Barbie pink.

268
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,600
May I ask,

269
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,120
your beloved,

270
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,240
which shade of red does she like?

271
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,880
If you get it wrong,

272
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,960
you're doomed.

273
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,920
You...

274
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,960
What's the difference between them?

275
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,720
This is true peach pink.

276
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,240
This is rose red.

277
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,280
No, I mean this one.

278
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,440
This is death Barbie pink.

279
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,240
Then, that must be the last one.

280
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
You blockhead.

281
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,840
You're dead today.

282
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,120
Isn't this Li Sijun?

283
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,040
Why are you buying things for girls too?

284
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,120
Why don't we look around some more?

285
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,280
Li Sijun is really gentle and considerate.

286
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,000
Everyone,

287
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,120
Qianjin Shop mainly sells spices and sachets.

288
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
And all kinds of fragrant items.

289
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,440
Come and have a look, everyone.

290
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,840
They're very suitable.

291
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,520
Recommended by Li Sijun.

292
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,720
Then there’s definitely no problem.

293
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,720
I want one of these. I want one. Me too!

294
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,720
We have them all, we have them all.

295
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,280
Don't push.

296
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,440
Don't rush, don't rush.

297
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,400
We have everything, we have everything.

298
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,440
Don't push me.

299
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,280
Give me two of these.

300
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,520
I want this one too.

301
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,120
Thank you.

302
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
This is yours.

303
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,280
Thank you.

304
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,000
Alright.

305
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,120
So there were influencers selling products even in ancient times.

306
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,000
Fan economy.

307
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,880
Miss, what did you say?

308
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,720
I mean,

309
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,440
maybe

310
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,840
we should change our marketing strategy.

311
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,840
Oh my god

312
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,520
This fragrance is just so enchanting

313
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,800
The magical violet

314
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,840
blended with the aroma of Feizixiao lychee

315
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,040
makes you feel as if you are

316
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,840
standing on the Bai Causeway by West Lake

317
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,600
encountering

318
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,560
a romantic and mysterious love

319
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
All the ladies

320
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,160
you absolutely have to buy this

321
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,840

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,960
will fall in love with you instantly

325
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,720
If you don't believe me

326
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,240
we can ask Lord Sijun

327
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,800
Lord Sijun

328
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,440
after smelling this scent

329
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,120
how do you feel

330
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,160
I have a kind of

331
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,880
feeling of being in love

332
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,520
A feeling of being in love, did you hear that

333
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,280
Li Sijun said he feels like he's in love

334
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,560
