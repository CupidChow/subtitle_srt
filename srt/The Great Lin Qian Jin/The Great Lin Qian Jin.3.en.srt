1
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,840
Here in your city,

2
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,040
usually,

3
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,120
if a princess poisons a neighboring city's lord,

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,280
what is the usual punishment?

5
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,200
If found guilty,

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,040
unless the city lord grants a special pardon,

7
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
it's a capital offense.

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,440
A capital offense.

9
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,520
Jinjin, where are you going?

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
To save my life.

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,040
This young man looks healthy and energetic.

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
His eyes are bright and he has strong vitality.

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,840
His brow is glowing, indicating good fortune.

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,240
He doesn't look like someone who's ill.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,520
He's sick, he's sick!

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,400
He... he's sick.

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,120
What illness?

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,960
He has

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,520
paranoia.

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,680
Overactive imagination.

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,160
Sees things upside down.

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,600
Uh...

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,120
Isn't this the young lady from the Sizheng family?

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,760
You...

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,880
What medicine do you need?

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,760
As long as my shop has it,

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,960
I'll give you everything you need.

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,840
Do you think

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,040
I am the kind of person

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,760
who would just take other people's money?

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,240
No, no, of course not.

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,240
Miss,

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,400
is definitely not that kind of person.

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,480
Let me first give this young man

35
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,240
a diagnosis.

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,040
Paranoia.

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm not sick.

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,480
I'm here to investigate a case.

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,920
This shop is just a small business.

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,320
All the neighbors around here

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,280
know each other.

42
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,040
We've never done any shady or dishonest business.

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,160
I'm not here to investigate you.

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,480
I just want to ask you

45
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,160
about this young lady.

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,280
Did she come to buy medicine yesterday?

47
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
What kind of medicine did she buy?

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,760
Please make sure

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,720
to answer truthfully.

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,880
Otherwise,

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,320
covering up for a suspect is just as guilty.

52
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,560
Uh, um...

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,320
I-I understand.

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,440
This road here

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
leads from the Lin residence

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,400
to the City Lord's mansion.

57
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,040
You want to check

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,440
what kind of poison I bought,

59
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,760
and whether I gave it to Liuyun, right?

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,920
See, see?

61
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,160
I already told you,

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,040
he's just a suspicious person.

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
If you do nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear.

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,560
You rushed over here in such a hurry to interfere,

65
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,680
which actually makes me suspicious of you.

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,200
Boss,

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,840
just answer honestly.

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,160
I, uh...

69
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,880
Alright.

70
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,600
Go ahead.

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,560
Today, you really have to

72
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,280
tell me everything clearly.

73
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,000
How did it go?

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,840
The shop owner said he didn't see me yesterday.

75
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,680
And also,

76
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,000
my name isn't in the ledger either.

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,120
Have you given up now?

78
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,200
I think he only said that because you threatened him.

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,040
That's the only reason he said it.

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Besides,

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,040
that's just one shop.

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,720
Wait.

83
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,880
Are you...

84
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,040
Do you have any solid evidence

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,880
that proves I was the one who poisoned it?

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,600
Yes.

87
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,760
Did someone see it?

88
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,000
Or did someone tell you to accuse me?

89
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,320
I don't have any solid evidence right now.

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,320
But

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,200
my intuition tells me

92
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,480
you're the one who did it.

93
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,440
Well, my intuition

94
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
says you did it.

95
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,440
Then let's see if you have what it takes to prove it.

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,560
This is the last one on this street

97
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,680
the last pharmacy.

98
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,880
If there's still no evidence that I bought poison,

99
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,160
doesn't that prove my innocence?

100
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't worry.

101
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,480
This is just the beginning.

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,040
Are you done yet?

103
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,560
Boss,

104
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,600
please check for me.

105
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,160
Is there a

106
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,200
Miss Lin

107
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
who bought medicine here?

108
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,720
I think

109
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,320
yes,

110
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,040
there was

111
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,400
a Miss Lin

112
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,440
who

113
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,600
bought medicine here.

114
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,680
I knew it.

115
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,040
Boss,

116
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,280
then please check quickly

117
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,200
which Miss Lin

118
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,160
it was.

119
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,400
Okay.

120
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,640
Lin

121
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,240
Qian

122
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,000
Jin

123
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Buy

124
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,800
Have bought

125
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Arsenic

126
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,320
Trioxide

127
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,960
Arsenic... arsenic trioxide

128
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,440
And you still say you haven't been here

129
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,680
You even bought something like arsenic trioxide

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,680
Come back with me

131
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,440
It wasn't me

132
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,960
Let go

133
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,640
Show me

134
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,560
Brother

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,760
This is Lin Renjin

136
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,320
That's not me at all

137
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,120
See?

138
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,120
I'm not the one who came to buy the poison

139
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
I think you're really funny

140
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
From the first time you met me

141
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,360
You drew your sword to cut me down

142
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,960
Who knows, in the end

143
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,680
You might come up with some other ridiculous reason

144
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,760
To frame and accuse me

145
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,680
Not everyone is like you

146
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
Willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want

147
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Then we

148
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,120
will take our leave now.

149
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,880
Selling oneself to bury one's father.

150
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,200
Selling oneself to bury one's father.

151
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,960
Don't run away.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,960
Little beggar.

153
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,080
Our young lady

154
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,120
offers fifty coins.

155
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,760
If you accept,

156
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,120
come back to the residence with us now.

157
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
If you don't want to,

158
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,640
we'll leave right away.

159
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,320
What can fifty coins buy?

160
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,000
How can you

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,760
have no sense of humanity at all?

162
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,440
Your young lady

163
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,320
is she really a proper lady?

164
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:57,960
You

165
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,080
This daughter of the Chief Minister

166
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,000
and the daughter of the Vice Minister are fighting over someone in the street.

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,200
Who do you think will win?

168
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,960
Of course, the Vice Minister's daughter.

169
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,800
This daughter of the Chief Minister

170
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,200
poisoned Princess Liuyun.

171
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
She's vicious by nature.

172
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,320
No one likes her.

173
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,320
So she's a poisoning suspect.

174
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,120
What right do you have to criticize here?

175
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,240
You all said

176
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,760
I'm just a suspect.

177
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,240
If it really was me,

178
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,440
would I still be standing here alive

179
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,880
talking to you?

180
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,880
Since buying and selling is free,

181
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,640
if you can spend money to buy someone,

182
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,440
so can I.

183
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,640
Little beggar

184
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,200
Sister, I'll offer fifty taels

185
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,080
Come with me

186
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,360
That Miss Lin is ruthless

187
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,560
She's vicious at heart

188
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,320
She took a liking to this little beggar today

189
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,440
She wants to take him back

190
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,520
Tomorrow

191
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,200
Who knows how she'll torment him

192
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,680
Don't worry

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
I'll make sure your father gets a proper burial

194
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,560
I heard that if her servants make a mistake

195
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,760
they all get poisoned

196
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,880
and turned mute

197
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,120
No need

198
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,000
If this child goes with her

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,640
he definitely won't have a good ending

200
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,120
If you dare talk nonsense again

201
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,120
watch out or I'll

202
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,560
tear your mouths apart

203
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,880
Why are you so fierce?

204
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,200
Stop talking

205
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,120
Fifty taels.

206
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,320
If you don't raise your bid,

207
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,880
I'll assume you're giving up.

208
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,680
Yuer,

209
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,440
we can't lose.

210
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,680
Fifty-one taels.

211
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,000
Sixty taels.

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Sixty-one taels.

213
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,960
One hundred taels.

214
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,560
Miss,

215
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,960
one hundred taels is too expensive.

216
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,200
We can't let ourselves be laughed at.

217
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,800
Our reputation

218
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,440
must be upheld, even if we have to force it.

219
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,640
One hundred taels.

220
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,560
Plus one string of coins.

221
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,680
Then I'll bid

222
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,760
ten taels.

223
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Ten taels.

224
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,440
Are you bad at math?

225
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,080
Just admit defeat if you're giving up.

226
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,200
Sorry,

227
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,960
what I meant was

228
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,760
it really is ten taels

229
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,240
of gold.

230
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,760
Did you understand?

231
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,760
Yuer, let's go.

232
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,560
Ten taels of gold.

233
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,200
That's enough for you to give your father a proper burial.

234
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,520
The remaining money,

235
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
you can save it up.

236
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,200
You can use it for your studies,

237
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
or start a small business if you like.

238
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,520
In any case,

239
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,640
it's all yours.

240
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,440
Please, I beg you, let me go.

241
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't want the ten taels of gold anymore.

242
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,320
Can I not sell myself?

243
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,880
Don't be like this.

244
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,120
Oh, right.

245
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,680
I forgot something.

246
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,360
I forgot something.

247
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,800
Why did she tear it up?

248
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,680
She really tore it up.

249
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,800
You don't want my indenture anymore?

250
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,000
Of course not.

251
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,440
Once this is torn up,

252
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,560
you're a free person.

253
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,120
No one can buy you at will,

254
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,000
or sell you.

255
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,320
As for me,

256
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,760
I don't need you to come with me to the Lin residence

257
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,760
to be a servant.

258
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,000
You,

259
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
just don't worry.

260
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,640
Mm.

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,960
Take care, Commander.

262
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,320
Thank you, Commander Li, for your treat.

263
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,120
Here.

264
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,000
Let me tell you something.

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,200
I really hate human trafficking the most.

266
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,680
You say everyone is equal.

267
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,320
So why do things like this?

268
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,080
Sister,

269
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,880
they say you're very vicious.

270
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Is that a lie?

271
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,320
What do you think?

272
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,560
I think

273
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,760
they should get to know you again.

274
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Exactly.

275
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,000
Here.

276
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,680
Li Sijun,

277
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,640
you don't need to see us off.

278
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,680
We can go back ourselves.

279
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,320
You two are unarmed.

280
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,200
I'd better escort you back.

281
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,360
Alright.

282
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,520
Let's go.

283
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,680
This Miss Lin

284
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,320
doesn't seem as bad as the rumors say.

285
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,880
Alright.

286
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,640
We're here.

287
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,360
Then I'll take my leave.

288
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,560
Bye-bye.

289
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,000
What does "bye-bye" mean?

290
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,320
Bye-bye.

291
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,200
It means farewell.

292
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,960
You can go now.

293
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,520
Farewell.

294
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,560
My dear daughter

295
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,440
You're finally back

296
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,760
Are you feeling any better?

297
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,440
I'm okay, I guess

298
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,760
Why did you bring someone back with you?

299
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,080
Hurry, hurry

300
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,760
Dad

301
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,960
I bought him

302
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,760
I didn't have enough money

303
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,560
How much were you short?

304
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,320
Dad will make up the difference for you

305
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,200
I spent

306
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,640
ten taels

307
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,560
of gold

308
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
It's just ten taels of gold.

309
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,320
As long as my daughter is happy,

310
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,440
what's ten taels of gold?

311
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,880
I think so too.

312
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,880
In front of others,

313
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
money doesn't matter.

314
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,680
Right?

315
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,800
Xiao Hai,

316
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,520
take him down and let him get familiar with things.

317
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
From now on,

318
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
arrange for him to work in the back kitchen.

319
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,120
Yes.

320
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,680
No, no, no.

321
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,680
I...

322
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,080
I'll take his indenture contract

323
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,640
and tear it up.

324
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,680
It's a small matter.

325
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,080
My daughter has come back.

326
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,640
That's more important than anything.

327
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,000
I didn't expect that after entering the book,

328
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,320
I'd end up with such a good father.

329
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
I really have to be filial to this good father.

330
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,080
I've got an idea!

331
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,880
Let's see how that blockhead Li Yan can keep pestering me now.

332
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,880
Father treats me the best.

333
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,640
Of course.

334
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,680
Father,

335
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,000
since you care about me so much,

336
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,200
why don't you help me again?

337
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
How can I help you?

338
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,560
City Lord

339
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,760
I have mentioned before

340
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,440
the plan to reclaim the southwestern cities.

341
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,560
Li Sijun, who serves by the City Lord's side,

342
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,320
is courageous, insightful, and strategic.

343
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,120
I

344
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
specifically invited Li Sijun to join the discussion.

345
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,320
I wonder

346
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,880
if the City Lord has

347
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,680
informed Li Sijun about this.

348
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,080
The Sizheng's proposal

349
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,120
benefits both the city and its people.

350
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,320
Of course, I fully support it.

351
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,600
City Lord

352
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,720
Sizheng

353
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,720
Now that everyone is here,

354
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,080
let's begin.

355
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,720
Begin what?

356
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,240
What trick is he up to this time?

357
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,200
I don't know either.

358
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,120
I'll follow

359
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,960
Sizheng Lin's arrangements.

360
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,320
No, no, no.

361
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,760
I would still like to hear

362
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,080
the City Lord's opinion first.

363
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,240
What I mean is,

364
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,880
if we want to reclaim the lost southwestern lands,

365
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
the most important thing is

366
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,360
to overcome

367
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
the difficulties of the terrain.

368
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The southwest

369
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,080
has treacherous terrain,

370
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,240
easy to defend but hard to attack.

371
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,960
To clear our name,

372
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,720
we must investigate the root cause.

373
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,000
I need to meet this Princess Liuyun.
