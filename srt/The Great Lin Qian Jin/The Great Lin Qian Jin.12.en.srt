1
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,080
Miss

2
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,280
Li Yan

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,400
Why are you here?

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,720
I came to check on your injury.

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,320
I brought you some tonics.

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,320
Danggui Yimuwan

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,520
Isn't this for treating period problems?

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,560
What kind of tonic is this?

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,440
The bird's nest I make for Jinjin every day is real tonic.

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
What is this?

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,400
It's fine, it's fine.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,920
I can use this too.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:01,960
Thank you.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,200
You're welcome.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,800
Seeing how you're dressed, where are you going?

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,920
We're about to head out.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,560
We're going to Lover's Valley to make perfume for Liuyun.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,440
That's right.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,080
This season,

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,920
the flowers in Lover's Valley bloom abundantly and beautifully.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,320
We're planning to go to Lover's Valley together

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,160
to pick fresh flowers for making fragrance.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,640
Let's go.

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,400
Then I'll go with you.

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,160
I'd like you to come with us,

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,920
but aren't you allergic to pollen?

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,640
That's right, that's right.

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,800
Commander Li

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,800
Why don't you just stay at the residence

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,040
and wait for us?

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,320
Did you forget

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,200
I have the sachet you made for me.

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,920
That's true.

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Then let's go together.

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,840
Let's go.

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,160
Jinjin.

37
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,920
When did you make him a sachet?

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,960
Why didn't I get one?

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,400
He's allergic to pollen.

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,800
It's for medical purposes.

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,520
You don't need it.

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
I don't care.

43
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,800
I want one too.

44
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,920
Alright, alright.

45
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,720
When I have time,

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
what kind of sachet do you want?

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
I'll make one for you.

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,960
Let's head out first.

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,560
Okay.

50
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,440
Let's go.

51
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,440
It's really beautiful here.

52
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,680
Of course it is.

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,200
As long as you like it,

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,800
I'll make sure to make you happy.

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640
Thank you, Wenwen.

56
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,080
No need to thank me.

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,800
Bletilla

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,960
and sandalwood, dried tangerine peel

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,080
clove, ambergris

60
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Blended together, they can make Cuiyun Longxiang

61
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,320
The fragrance is elegant

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,720
When burned, the smoke resembles a dragon

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
It's perfect for a girl like Jinjin

64
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,400
I didn't expect, Young Master Lu

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,320
that you know so much about spices

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Of course

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,840
Don't you know what Jinjin likes most

68
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
is making fragrances?

69
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,840
It seems you really don't know Jinjin at all

70
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,680
She never told me about this

71
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,320
It's because she knows

72
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,200
I have a pollen allergy

73
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,080
Look, I picked a lot of flowers

74
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,200
I even made a flower crown

75
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,800
Try it on

76
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,200
I think

77
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
this suits Young Master Lu better

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,640
You should keep it for yourself

79
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,160
Jinjin, look at this

80
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,800
What kind of flower is this?

81
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,160
It's so unique

82
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,320
I'm not sure what it's called either

83
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,040
Then I'll give it a name

84
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,280
Let's call it

85
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,720
the little yellow flower from the story

86
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,080
I want this one too

87
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,040
Pick some more for me

88
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,440
No problem

89
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,560
Jinjin

90
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,200
Let's take a break

91
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,080
and have some tea

92
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,720
Sure

93
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,840
Sorry, Li Sijun.

94
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,440
I only brought teacups for myself and Jinjin.

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,920
It's okay.

96
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,320
We can just share one.

97
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,440
Jinjin.

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,920
You made him a sachet again.

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,440
Now you're even sharing a teacup with him.

100
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,720
What about me?

101
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,920
You...

102
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,800
I'll pour tea for you.

103
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,800
Here.

104
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,280
For you.

105
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,320
The city lord has issued an order.

106
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,640
Miss Lin is to enter the residence immediately.

107
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,200
She is to prepare an antidote for Princess Liuyun.

108
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Didn't they say that after accepting the city lord's order,

109
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,280
you could arrive at the city lord's residence within three days?

110
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,520
Why is it a day earlier?

111
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,560
The city lord knows I accepted the task.

112
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,040
He's been urging me nonstop.

113
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,440
I have to leave today.

114
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,800
Can't you tell the city lord

115
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,840
to postpone it by a day?

116
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,040
How could I do that?

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Since I agreed to the city lord's request,

118
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,320
I have to fulfill it.

119
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,520
Besides, my seven-day deadline is almost up.

120
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,200
If Liuyun doesn't wake up soon,

121
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,840
I won't be able to clear my name.

122
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,440
Then at least eat this bird's nest soup before you go.

123
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,080
No, no.

124
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,560
I really don't have time, I have to go now.

125
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,440
Jinjin.

126
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,800
I... I'm worried about you.

127
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,520
How about I go with you?

128
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,560
No need, Li Yan is in the carriage.

129
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,920
And Lian'er is with me too.

130
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,560
Don't worry.

131
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm leaving now.

132
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,680
Alright, I'll wait for you at the residence.

133
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,680
Go and come back soon.

134
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,640
Got it.

135
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,320
Hurry up, let's go too.

136
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,600
Miss, why did you faint again?

137
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,640
Miss!

138
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,240
Stop the carriage! Stop!

139
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,720
Young Master Lu, something's wrong!

140
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,560
Lian'er!

141
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,480
Why are you back?

142
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,600
Miss fainted again.

143
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,360
This is bad.

144
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,120
Jinjin

145
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,960
Are you okay?

146
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,600
I knew something would happen today.

147
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
Quick, drink the bird's nest soup.

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,720
Jinjin

149
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
It seems your bird's nest soup is quite special.

150
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,640
Young Master Lu

151
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
Where is Jinjin?

152
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,200
Where did you take Jinjin?

153
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,840
Speak.

154
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,320
The medicine you've been giving Miss Lin,

155
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,640
what exactly is it?

156
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,680
This scented pill

157
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,720
can really cure Princess Liuyun's illness?

158
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,640
Although Princess Liuyun was poisoned,

159
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,280
she hasn't died.

160
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,280
During this time,

161
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,880
the method I thought of

162
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,520
was to use some invigorating incense

163
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,640
to stimulate her senses.

164
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,320
As for whether she can wake up,

165
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,720
it depends on her will to survive.

166
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,360
It's worth a try.

167
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,320
Alright.

168
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,360
You two

169
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,600
take this scented pill right away

170
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,120
and deliver it to Princess Liuyun.

171
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Slow down, slow down.

172
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,960
Miss Lin.

173
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,480
I truly did not expect this.

174
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,400
Reporting to the city lord.

175
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,320
I have an important matter to report.

176
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,760
Jinjin.

177
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,160
Wenwen.

178
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,520
Why are you here?

179
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,320
Are you alright?

180
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,680
City lord.

181
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,320
I'm fine.

182
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
The one who poisoned Princess Liuyun

183
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,880
and the real culprit behind Miss Lin's case

184
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,160
is Lu Yiwen.

185
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,000
Previously, Miss Lin frequently showed

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,520
strange symptoms of fainting.

187
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,400
I noticed

188
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,840
that Lu Yiwen was very concerned about this.

189
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,760
When she fainted at the lantern festival,

190
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,040
Lu Yiwen started

191
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,120
to pay close attention to Miss Lin's health.

192
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,320
Lian'er.

193
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,840
Quick, go get the medicine I prepared for you earlier

194
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,680
and decoct it for Jinjin.

195
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,480
Then you fainted.

196
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,400
Jin Jin

197
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,480
How are you feeling?

198
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,960
Did you just faint?

199
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,680
How did you know?

200
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,920
From now on, I'll take care of preparing the medicine.

201
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,840
Lu Yiwen took over the task of preparing the medicine

202
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,480
and handled it himself.

203
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,840
This made me suspicious.

204
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,600
So I started following Lu Yiwen.

205
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,120
Put it in a shady spot.

206
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
This flower is extremely precious.

207
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,120
You won't find another one like it in all of Nanling City.

208
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
When you move it,

209
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,760
be extremely careful.

210
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Yes, Young Master.

211
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
I discovered that he was secretly

212
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,480
growing night camellias in the residence.

213
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,760
Later, I went to Shibali Shop

214
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,960
and happened to see him buying medicine.

215
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,960
Put it on my young master's tab.

216
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,440
Alright.

217
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,400
That person just now,

218
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
what medicine did he get?

219
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,200
He got Qianjinzi.

220
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,200
Qianjinzi?

221
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
Both Princess Liuyun and Miss Lin

222
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
were poisoned by night camellia.

223
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,320
But you knew about this

224
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,320
and bought Qianjinzi to detoxify Miss Lin.

225
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,960
So,

226
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,840
the culprit is Lu Yiwen, that's right.

227
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,200
Wen Wen

228
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,040
Was it really you who poisoned them?

229
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
So,

230
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
you had Miss Lin come a day early

231
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,560
just to catch me?

232
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,760
The fact that you can ask this question

233
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,760
shows that you are quite clever.

234
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,320
Actually, Li Yan already told me

235
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,480
about his suspicions of you.

236
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,920
Ever since I issued the city lord's order,

237
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,760
I have been making arrangements.

238
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,320
Miss Lin taking the challenge

239
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,200
was also within my expectations.

240
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Summoning Miss Lin a day early

241
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,840
was also to coordinate with Li Yan

242
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,120
and lure the snake out of its hole.

243
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,680
Wenwen,

244
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,320
was it really you?

245
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,680
I did it.

246
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,360
But I

247
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,400
never thought I would accidentally hurt you.

248
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,640
Lu Yiwen,

249
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,640
you poisoned

250
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,920
both Princess Liuyun and Miss Lin at once.

251
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,520
Both of them

252
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,920
are candidates to be my future wife.

253
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,080
You are unbelievably bold.

254
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,320
I can only sentence you to—

255
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:40,920
Wait!

256
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,800
Jinjin,

257
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,640
kneel.

258
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,840
City Lord,

259
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,360
about Lu Yiwen poisoning us,

260
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,840
he was indeed in the wrong.

261
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,840
But neither I nor Princess Liuyun died.

262
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,680
Although Princess Liuyun is still unconscious,

263
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,400
there is still a chance she will survive.

264
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,480
You can't just sentence him to death like this.

265
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,680
You really are compassionate.

266
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,920
And the City Lord is a good ruler who loves his people like his own children.

267
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,400
I

268
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,800
Who said I was going to sentence him to death?

269
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,800
Lu Yiwen

270
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,240
You poisoned and tried to harm the daughter of the Chief Minister.

271
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,600
You also caused Princess Liuyun to fall into a coma.

272
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,080
This made Beiyue City

273
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,520
lose trust in me.

274
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,400
Your crime is unforgivable.

275
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,120
But considering that you

276
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,760
You

277
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,680
You

278
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,240
What about you?

279
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,640
It's all because Miss Lin pleaded for you.

280
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,240
That's the only reason I'm being lenient with you.

281
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,600
Thank you, City Lord.

282
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,320
I will sentence you to

283
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,800
exile and conscription into the army.

284
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,640
You will depart immediately.

285
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,360
Guards, take him away.

286
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,240
Yes.

287
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Miss

288
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,760
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,800
From now on,

290
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
if anyone slanders Miss Lin

291
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,080
as a murderer,

292
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,800
I will not forgive them lightly.

293
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,080
Don't be too upset.

294
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
How are you feeling now?

295
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,480
By the way, Lu Yiwen said

296
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,520
you must take the last dose of the antidote today.

297
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,680
Otherwise,

298
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,520
your life will be in danger.

299
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:41,920
Let me.

300
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,400
City Lord.

301
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,200
Your status is distinguished.

302
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,320
Let me do it instead.

303
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,320
I wrongly blamed your daughter before.

304
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,200
It's only right that I feed her myself.

305
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,680
City Lord.

306
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,960
Let me do it.

307
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,200
I'll do it.

308
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,480
Let me do it instead.

309
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,800
I'll do it.

310
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,800
Let me do it.

311
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,200
Are you crazy?

312
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,440
Let me do it.

313
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,000
I'll do it.

314
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,640
Let me do it.

315
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,320
Let go.

316
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,040
I'll do it.

317
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Let me do it instead.
