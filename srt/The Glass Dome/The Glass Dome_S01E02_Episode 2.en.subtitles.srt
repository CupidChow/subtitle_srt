1
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,000
HAVE YOU SEEN ALICIA?

2
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,840
POLICE

3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
Alicia!

4
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,480
MOUNTAIN RESCUE

5
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,840
Is there anything you need?

6
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,200
-Was that the last one?
-Yeah.

7
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,120
Sorry.

8
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,040
-Take it gently.
-Of course.

9
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,800
HAVE YOU SEEN ALICIA?

10
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,040
THE GLASS DOME

11
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,520
Were you in my room last night?

12
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,360
The window was wide open.

13
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,760
Please, don't come into my room
when I'm sleeping.

14
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,600
I haven't been in your room.

15
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,880
Perhaps something is broken.

16
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,560
Look what I found outside.

17
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,960
Two out in the yard,
and this one floundering on the porch.

18
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,480
-They must have eaten something bad.
-Are you leaving them there?

19
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,800
I wanted to show you.

20
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,240
-Did you book a new flight?
-What? No.

21
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,200
Then you could come help me decorate
Ann-Marie's grave.

22
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm heading out. To the search.

23
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,760
-You were out until 4:30 this morning.
-I know.

24
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,240
-You need to rest. Have you eaten?
-No.

25
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,040
Then please do.

26
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,920
Where they found Alicia's clothes,
is it cordoned off?

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,080
I would assume so.

28
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,760
I want to go there.

29
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,120
To do what?

30
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,400
I just want to go there.

31
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
I want to see it.

32
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,800
You have to come with me
so they'll let me through.

33
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,960
We'll visit the grave on the way back.

34
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,720
Do you want something?

35
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,840
A sandwich or something?

36
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,600
No, thank you.

37
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,160
Tomas!

38
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,320
I need to know what's going on.

39
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,920
-No one is allowed…
-Why are you holding Said?

40
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,120
Said is next of kin.
That's why we're holding him.

41
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,760
That's inhumane!

42
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,920
Is he supposed to sit in there,
hour after hour, after what's happened?

43
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,800
I want to bring him home.

44
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,680
Valter would never
have handled it like this.

45
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,760
He would never have kept anything from me.

46
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,800
I think you should go home.

47
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,400
I'm not going anywhere.

48
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,880
Here you are.

49
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,000
Thank you.

50
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,120
They're saying internet is too slow,
but I don't know what to do.

51
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,320
Sören is out with the search party
and won't be in until this afternoon.

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,280
And…

53
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,040
people are calling about dead birds.

54
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,120
Dead birds.

55
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,360
-I don't understand.
-I don't know who to contact.

56
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,480
The Environmental Protection Agency?

57
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,920
-Yes. Or… I don't know, actually.
-Can I try one?

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,040
-Sure, help yourself.
-Thanks.

59
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,960
Sorry for the wait.

60
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,960
Good, you got some coffee and whatnot.

61
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,600
The time is 09:22.

62
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,080
Let's continue.

63
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,600
Can I ask you something?

64
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,320
Will it take much longer?
I need to be out there, searching.

65
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,360
I understand.

66
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,560
I wanted to talk about something else.
About Louise.

67
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,760
How were things between you two?

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,480
Fine.

69
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,640
What do you mean?

70
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,400
You are very collected,
for someone who just lost his wife.

71
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,160
What?

72
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,880
Were you happy together?
Did you love each other and…

73
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,520
You and Louise?

74
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,960
Yes.

75
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,040
We've heard from several people

76
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,640
that you weren't on the best of terms
at the memorial service.

77
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,440
Would you agree with that?

78
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,320
Well, no… She…

79
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,480
She was a bit upset with me.

80
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,520
Because I was going to Stockholm.
For work.

81
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,920
It was important to her, so…

82
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,200
We…

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,800
-We quarrelled about that.
-Did you quarrel a lot?

84
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,040
Sometimes.

85
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,960
What about?

86
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,520
I don't know.
Nothing in particular. Like people do.

87
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,800
Why are you lying?

88
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,400
What do you mean?

89
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,520
Louise wanted a divorce.

90
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,920
The papers only have Louise's signature.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,760
The six-month waiting period
expires next week.

92
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,960
I don't understand.

93
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,440
Should this have something to do
with her killing herself?

94
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
I don't get it.

95
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,800
She wasn't happy here.

96
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,600
She wanted to move back.

97
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,520
She was very angry with me for that.

98
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,240
That's when she sent those in.

99
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,080
She would do stuff like that.

100
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,680
Was filing for divorce
something she had done before?

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,920
No.

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,880
But now she did,

103
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,200
then she changed her mind?
Is that what you're saying?

104
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,240
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

105
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,520
It certainly looks like
she wanted a divorce.

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
But you didn't.

107
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,600
And now Louise is dead
and Alicia is missing.

108
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,920
It all seems very strange
when you're lying to us.

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,440
I'm waiting for the autopsy report.
We'll treat your house as a crime scene.

110
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,560
Well, hello!

111
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,360
-Hi.
-Long time no see. Nice to see you.

112
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,760
-Yes, it's been a while.
-Hi.

113
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,960
-Well…
-Yep.

114
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,600
Did they finally manage
to recruit you to the mine?

115
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,200
Hell no.

116
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Tomas asked me to come down
and have a look at the scene.

117
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,640
-They just started.
-It's bloody awful.

118
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,920
This is Lejla.

119
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,680
Hi.

120
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,640
Well… So…

121
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,600
Is there anything else, or is this it?

122
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,360
No, this is it.

123
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,480
Should she really
be walking around in there?

124
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,560
I'll keep an eye on her.

125
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,760
Well, have a look around.

126
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,640
Someone is making a statement.

127
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,680
Someone is saying,
"I'm in full control of the situation."

128
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,560
Someone chose Alicia specifically,
abducted her,

129
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,040
and wants the police to know it.

130
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,600
Tomas needs to hear this.

131
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,440
VALTER CALLING

132
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,080
NATIONAL BOARD OF FORENSIC MEDICINE

133
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,640
I'll have a quick chat with…

134
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,320
Thank you.

135
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,360
Thank you for calling.

136
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,560
I would have been there all day.

137
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,080
-They haven't told you anything?
-No, they…

138
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,520
They're still holding Said.

139
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,880
-Kristina.
-Yes?

140
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Well…

141
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,120
Alicia.

142
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,280
Is there anyone outside of the family

143
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,040
that Alicia could have been
in contact with?

144
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Anyone she talked about
or mentioned in any way?

145
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,800
It could be anyone at all.

146
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,800
Someone who's been kind to her
or given her attention in any way?

147
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,200
Maybe that builder?

148
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,440
What builder?

149
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,720
They had people in last fall
to repair parts of the roof.

150
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,840
One of Daniela's guys
was very fond of Alicia.

151
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,480
-In what way?
-He just took a liking to her.

152
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,840
I saw them together several times
when I was there.

153
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,200
They made videos together on his phone.

154
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,760
What kind of videos?

155
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,680
Was he filming her?

156
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,760
I don't know.

157
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,400
Jorun is not picking up either.

158
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,520
Someone has to pick up, right?

159
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,360
It's a bloody police station.

160
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,400
Why don't you and I
go and talk to that builder?

161
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,080
It's not a nice place.

162
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,160
Time might be running out.

163
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,120
WELCOME TO GRANÅS COTTAGES

164
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,040
Daniela?

165
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,040
Hi, Dani!

166
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,880
How are you?

167
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,760
We'd like to talk to one of your guys.

168
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,600
He did a job a while back
for Said and Louise Kamran.

169
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,800
Why do you want to talk to him?

170
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,440
I thought you retired?

171
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,120
I help out from time to time.
A bit of moonlighting.

172
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,000
It can pay well, as long as nobody
starts digging around. Right?

173
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,680
Another one.

174
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,960
For Christ's sake.

175
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,680
What do you want?

176
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,840
You speak Swedish?

177
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,280
A bit.

178
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,880
So…

179
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,680
You've done some work
for Louise and Said, right?

180
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,320
Yes. Sometimes.

181
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,480
Did you hear about what happened?

182
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,080
Louise is dead

183
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,000
and their daughter is missing.

184
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,560
I know.

185
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,360
Okay.

186
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,440
-Police?
-No, friends of theirs.

187
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,960
Do you like Alicia?

188
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Yes.

189
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,600
Did you film her?

190
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,280
I…

191
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,680
If you've filmed Alicia,
I'd like to see those videos.

192
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,280
Now.

193
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,360
Mirtel.

194
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,760
My daughter.

195
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
Hi, Alicia. How are you?

196
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,000
Also 10 years old.

197
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,800
Is that Said?

198
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,480
In the car.

199
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,440
-No…
-Do you know?

200
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
No. The other one.

201
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,040
Don't know name.

202
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,440
With Louise.

203
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,520
When home alone.

204
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,080
What did he look like?

205
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,240
Never seen up close.

206
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,640
-Was he there often?
-Yes, often.

207
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,080
Said was working.

208
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,200
Just worked.

209
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,280
Welcome to this press conference.

210
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,120
I'm Tomas Ness,
chief of police here in Granås.

211
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,800
I'm also in charge of the investigation

212
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,760
of the disappearance of Alicia Kamran.

213
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,920
I can take your questions right away.

214
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,400
Do you see a link
between what's happening now

215
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,960
and the Lejla Ness case 22 years ago?

216
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,760
No.

217
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,000
Lejla Ness went missing in Stockholm,
not Granås.

218
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,880
But the assumption is that Alicia Kamran
has been taken against her will?

219
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,280
Yes, that is our working theory.

220
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,280
How do we present this to Tomas?

221
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,560
We appeal to the public.

222
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,760
Contact the police immediately
if you see Alicia

223
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,400
or if you see something that may…

224
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,120
You heard him. Tomas is asking for help.

225
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,840
There is a police hotline.

226
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,560
Björn has a paper
with telephone numbers you can call.

227
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,200
Thank you.

228
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,880
Look at the hand. It looks like a kiss.

229
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,120
What do you want me to do with this?

230
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,800
Louise was seeing someone.

231
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,680
You can't see who it is now,
but you can sort that, right?

232
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,880
You two can't set up shop on your own.

233
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,000
Right?

234
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,720
You're making things very hard for me.

235
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,840
You went to see Björn too.
Said that I sent you.

236
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,120
And then Kristina.

237
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,760
And now Daniela too, apparently.

238
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,760
Yes. And I called both you and Jorun.

239
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,480
We were in an interview.

240
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,720
Knock it off.

241
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I'm sorry if I've put my foot in it
and made you look stupid, but…

242
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,760
I've been a cop here for 40 years.

243
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,560
And I'm coming to you with information
that I believe is crucial.

244
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,480
Can I decide what's crucial?

245
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,920
It sure as hell is crucial
if Louise had a lover.

246
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,000
Just take the information.
Doesn't fucking matter where it came from.

247
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,160
Just send in the video.

248
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,480
Send it.

249
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,760
Hi there.

250
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,400
Abusers often get close to a child
through the parents.

251
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,320
I know.

252
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,600
It's also common
that the parents are behind an abduction.

253
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,880
Yes,

254
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,560
in custody battles

255
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,520
or in an attempt to protect the child.

256
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,200
But they don't put the child's clothes
on display like a trophy.

257
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,400
Lejla, I understand
this hits close to home.

258
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,240
You think you see a parallel
between your case and Alicia.

259
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,120
But…

260
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,400
Louise was murdered.

261
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,560
It's confirmed now.

262
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,920
There was a puncture on her neck
from a needle.

263
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,640
She was drugged
and then had her wrists cut.

264
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,040
There were also signs of violence,
so she was beaten too.

265
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,880
Another thing you don't know
is that Louise wanted to divorce Said,

266
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,240
something he kept quiet about.

267
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,560
He's been lying.

268
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,520
If she was seeing someone else,
that's motive for Said.

269
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,240
A witness saw Said driving home
after the memorial service,

270
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,480
not straight to Stockholm, like he said.

271
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,720
When you got there the door was open.
Either the perpetrator was let in,

272
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,720
or someone had a key.

273
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,640
And what Said did in Stockholm,

274
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,800
no one knows.

275
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,680
They're still tracking the phone,

276
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,560
but I'll contact the prosecutor.

277
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,160
That's what I've been doing,
while you "investigated."

278
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,480
How are you doing?

279
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,400
I don't know.

280
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,280
I don't like it
when they cover everything in sauce.

281
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,920
Order something else if you want.

282
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,760
Well?

283
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,120
I don't feel so good.

284
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,120
No…

285
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,840
Do you think it's Said?

286
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,560
-Who did it?
-I don't know.

287
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,880
He seems to have lied quite a bit.

288
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,080
If it's him, he's put Alicia's clothes
at the entrance of his own mine.

289
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,640
Do you want to go home right away,
or can I have some coffee first?

290
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,240
I'll get the coffee to go.

291
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,600
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

292
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,680
We meet again at the coffee station.

293
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,520
How are you doing?

294
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,840
Well, it's…

295
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,960
What about you?

296
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,640
It's… It is the way it is.

297
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,280
You survive.

298
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,560
I heard they're still holding the dad.

299
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,200
I mean… Sorry.

300
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,080
I tend to get obsessed
with things like this. Overly interested.

301
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,280
Like, I know very well who you are.

302
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,800
I follow your account on profiling.

303
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,160
And I've read about your case.

304
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,680
-Yes. Okay.
-It's horrible.

305
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,400
But I can't help finding it…

306
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,440
interesting and fascinating.

307
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,560
I'm sorry, we haven't… I'm Martin.

308
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,960
Lejla.

309
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,800
-Hi.
-Hi.

310
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,040
I just think you're so fucking cool.

311
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,040
Your life in San Diego
is totally my dream life.

312
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,280
-Okay…
-I could…

313
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,360
Anyway, are you going out again today?

314
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,800
-No, I'm not.
-Okay. No.

315
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,280
-Right. We're about to leave, so I…
-Okay.

316
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,360
But… we might run into each other again
by another coffee station sometime.

317
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,880
-Take care.
-You too. Bye.

318
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,760
-Hi.
-Hi.

319
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,680
POLICE

320
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,360
Said. You are detained, by order
of prosecutor, on suspicion of murder,

321
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,760
having on March 5th in Granås
taken the plaintiff Louise Kamran's life.

322
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,200
You are also suspected of kidnapping,
having on March 5th in Granås

323
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,600
abducted the plaintiff Alicia Kamran
against her will.

324
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
-What do you mean murder?
-Stand up.

325
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,360
-You have to come with us.
-Do as she says.

326
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,600
Take it easy!

327
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,920
You have to explain what's happened.
What do you mean murder? Explain!

328
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,120
-Come with us.
-Tell me what's happened!

329
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,360
What do you mean?

330
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
Explain what you mean!

331
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
Let go!

332
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,560
You do as I say! Do you understand?

333
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,080
Do you understand?

334
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,520
Do you understand?

335
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,400
Do you understand?!

336
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,840
Tomas, calm down!

337
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,480
Hi!

338
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,760
Come.

339
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,360
Come.

340
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,440
There's a memorial service for Louise.
You're coming, right?

341
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,920
You'll regret it if you don't.

342
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,720
Poor girl.

343
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,680
What in God's name has happened?

344
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,600
Where is Alicia?

345
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,960
I never really liked the father.

346
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,480
Can he have taken her? Or killed her?

347
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,080
I don't know.

348
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,800
She did think very highly of herself.

349
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,520
Dearie me!

350
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,800
Oh, dear!

351
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,520
What's happened?

352
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,160
We have to get help.

353
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,840
Where did you come from?

354
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,360
Let's get her to the police.

355
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,560
INTERVIEW

356
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,880
I'm glad we get to talk to you, Lejla.

357
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,160
Do you feel a bit better?

358
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,800
I'm going to ask you some questions.

359
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,680
Just answer if you can and want to.

360
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
The place you were talking about,

361
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,240
could you describe
what it looked like inside?

362
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,800
If you tried to look outside,
what could you see?

363
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,720
Dark.

364
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,480
What was that?

365
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,040
Dark. It was dark.

366
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,680
Pitch-black.

367
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,520
It was like a big aquarium.

368
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,880
Are you the green one in the middle?

369
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,400
And the other three, who are they?

370
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,240
The ones who were there before me.

371
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,040
How do you know three children
had been there before you?

372
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,520
From the pictures they drew.

373
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,040
Did you meet any of them?

374
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,000
They were gone.

375
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,080
What is it you've drawn underneath?

376
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,600
Pussy.

377
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,680
A fucking doll Ecki gave me.

378
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,160
Did Ecki used to give you things?

379
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,240
Sometimes.

380
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,280
When I read.

381
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,680
"I was standing there, defenseless"…

382
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,240
Why did you call him "Ecki"?

383
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,080
From the sound
when the light was switched on.

384
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,520
Did you cut your own hair?

385
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,920
No, Ecki cut it.

386
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,720
When I was going to die.

387
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,520
Stop it!

388
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,640
Stop it!

389
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,040
No, stop it!

390
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,800
-No!
-Come on.

391
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,240
Stop it!

392
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,840
It's all right.

393
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,160
-Hi.
-Hi.

394
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,720
Do you have time to talk?

395
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,440
Sure.

396
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,040
Hi there!

397
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,960
Okay…

398
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,960
Right…

399
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,960
What did you want?

400
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,920
There was a thing that we…

401
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,640
The video that you…

402
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,200
-Yes.
-…brought in…

403
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,800
It's me.

404
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,320
It's Louise and I in the video.

405
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,000
So what you're saying is
that you and Louise…

406
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,920
Yes.

407
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,160
How long?

408
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,800
Since Sep… September.

409
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,840
And you're telling us now?

410
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,120
Louise is getting a divorce,
so we have been…

411
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,320
-It's not against the law.
-You're running a murder investigation.

412
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,480
When you were in a relationship
with the victim.

413
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,040
-No. Well…
-That's beyond all reason.

414
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,240
Was the plan to keep covering this up?

415
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,600
I had a relationship with Louise,
who was in the middle of a divorce.

416
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,520
Then…

417
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,480
this extreme situation developed

418
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,120
which I, in my role as chief of police,
am trying to handle

419
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,520
as delicately as possible.

420
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,040
You have withheld information
while conducting interviews with Said.

421
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,520
You have to report this.

422
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,720
-But…
-Otherwise, it's my duty to do it.

423
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,480
You don't have to do a fucking thing.
You're retired.

424
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,000
I can handle this.
Nothing can be traced to me.

425
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,520
Louise's phone is missing,

426
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,800
so please,
keep this information to yourselves.

427
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,760
I would be eternally grateful if you did.

428
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,640
I'm the only one qualified
to lead an investigation like this.

429
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,680
But you're not doing your job, are you?

430
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,920
I don't understand.

431
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,480
How could I be so stupid?

432
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,200
To get you to come back here
to succeed me.

433
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,400
I don't understand.

434
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,000
He was fucking right, the old man.

435
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,800
You're out of your mind.

436
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Whisky?

437
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,240
No, thanks.

438
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,920
Do you still eat mushrooms?

439
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
Yes.

440
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,360
Every day?

441
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,040
Maybe.

442
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,520
Do they work? Don't you get addicted?

443
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,440
I do what works for me.

444
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,080
Did anyone else know about you two?

445
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,840
No.

446
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,600
The warning siren can be heard in Granås
in Northern Dalarna.

447
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,240
The alarm means people should stay indoors

448
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,360
and shut windows, doors, and ventilation.

449
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,320
Until further notice, do not drink
the water from taps, wells, or springs.

450
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,160
Keep listening to Sveriges Radio P4
for more information.
