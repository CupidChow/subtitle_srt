1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,040
Hello?

2
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,000
No. Shh! Don't wake up yet.

3
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,480
THE GLASS DOME

4
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,880
No, Said! Stop!

5
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Back up.

6
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
Stay there.

7
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,720
Come here.

8
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,640
I promise you, we'll find Alicia too.

9
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,880
Did he leave almost immediately
after he locked you up?

10
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,960
Did he say where he was going?

11
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,320
To the other girl.

12
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,320
Okay.

13
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,600
It's all right, Elma.

14
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,920
-Valter keeps calling.
-Not now.

15
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,360
I know,
but he's calling from the hospital saying

16
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,880
that Lejla was drugged by Frick.

17
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,160
-Hi.
-Hi.

18
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,400
How is she?

19
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,720
They're saying she's stable.

20
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,040
But I don't know.

21
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,480
Has she said anything?

22
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
I should have kept an eye on her.

23
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,200
-I'm totally fucking useless.
-No.

24
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,880
You saved her.

25
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,760
Again.

26
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,000
Now it's your job to find the bastard.

27
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,560
Well, well. Here comes the constable.

28
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,160
Our brother in blue. Good day.

29
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,600
Looking for the quarry?

30
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,880
There are better hunting grounds
outside of town.

31
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,320
-Depends on what you're hunting.
-Really?

32
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,640
Paedophiles often roam in built-up areas.

33
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,440
Paedophiles?

34
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,520
The kind that abduct little girls.

35
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,480
You don't do shit about it,
so we're stepping in.

36
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,440
The bastard better wish
we don't find him first.

37
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
Right?

38
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,720
I'll stab him!

39
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,840
There are better places
to hunt paedophiles

40
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,400
than by a police station.

41
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,640
Are you sure?

42
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,520
Get out of here!

43
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,560
Tomas.

44
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,320
-Come on.
-What is it?

45
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,920
"Tomas, come on."

46
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,960
We've been searching all night
and have found Frick's cabin.

47
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,440
-What?
-Yes.

48
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,600
-Why the hell didn't you call?
-You were on your way.

49
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,640
You could have called, for fuck's sake.

50
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,680
I told you.

51
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,600
-Hi.
-Hi.

52
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,360
How's Lejla?

53
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,320
She'll be fine.

54
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,400
-She's not been questioned yet?
-No.

55
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,920
Look at this.

56
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,560
Blocked in.

57
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,840
Buses? Trains?

58
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,600
We've had people out all night,
plus roadblocks.

59
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,280
-Nobody's seen anything?
-No.

60
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,200
So he might still be in Granås.

61
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,160
Come with me.

62
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,240
-Hi there.
-Hi.

63
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,160
-Can I go inside?
-We're done. Step inside.

64
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,320
Thank you.

65
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
-Hi.
-Hello.

66
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,160
-Can I?
-Yeah, sure.

67
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,640
Right, Lejla.
Not a very nice cocktail you were given.

68
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,600
I found high levels
of a substance called ketamine,

69
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,000
which can be used as an anaesthetic.

70
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,640
Also, a sleeping agent called zolpidem.

71
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,800
It's amazing you managed to stay upright.

72
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,360
I'd like to keep you in for observation.

73
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
No.

74
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,560
There's still a risk of complications.

75
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,160
Heart failure, seizures,
sudden deterioration.

76
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,920
You might experience nightmares
and sometimes act irrationally.

77
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,720
I'd also like you
to speak to our psychologist.

78
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
That sounds good.

79
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,120
I want to go home.

80
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,640
Tomas is here.

81
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,440
Are you up for it?

82
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,200
Judging by the books
we found in Frick's flat,

83
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,120
he has a morbid fascination
for child abductors.

84
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,920
Your case seems to be high on his list
of personal favourites, so to speak.

85
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And he seems obsessed with Granås.

86
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,760
We found tonnes of drawings
with local motifs.

87
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,320
This farm, among others.

88
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,400
How the hell do you grant
such a maniac leave?

89
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,800
Well, Säter Hospital found him
to be sufficiently rehabilitated.

90
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,360
The first thing he did was come here
and find a victim, Alicia.

91
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,000
Then he ran into you.
Must have felt like he hit the jackpot.

92
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,040
Or maybe he came here because of you.

93
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,760
The girl we found in the flat says
Frick was talking about "another".

94
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,080
We think he has another place
where he's keeping Alicia.

95
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,240
You met for a beer.
What did you talk about?

96
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,200
Alicia.

97
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,600
And…

98
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
her, the latest one.

99
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,840
Elma.

100
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,400
He had some theories
about the perpetrator I found…

101
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,080
I don't know. Interesting.

102
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,320
So you went home with him?

103
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,760
Yes.

104
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,480
I did.

105
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,200
Voluntarily?

106
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,640
One more thing. The flat in Mora
was full of stuff about Lejla.

107
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,360
Pictures, articles, newspaper clippings.

108
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Most of it can be found online,
but there were personal items too.

109
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,400
Like your old school books.

110
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,320
Isla didn't see him
taking anything from your room.

111
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,520
-So he's been here before.
-Probably.

112
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,760
Wait here.

113
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,000
He's taken it.

114
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,960
The box.

115
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,080
I put it here.

116
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,640
Are you sure it's okay to take that many?

117
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,120
I'm staying in the US.

118
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,400
I can't live in Sweden.

119
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,520
It suffocates me.

120
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,560
Mummy's sweetheart.

121
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,080
It's cold. Why don't you come inside?

122
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,120
Hello? It's Said.

123
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,360
Yeah.

124
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,840
Sorry, did I wake you?

125
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,160
I heard the hospital sent you home.
Are you okay?

126
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,160
Yeah, I'm fine.

127
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,640
Okay.

128
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,920
Is it… Should I call…

129
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Should we talk tomorrow?
Is this a bad time?

130
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,280
No, I'm just a bit tired.

131
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,200
Did he say anything? Frick.

132
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,000
About Alicia?

133
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,920
He doesn't have her.

134
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,360
What?

135
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
She's with Ecki.

136
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,160
I saw him.

137
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,440
By the fire.

138
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,200
What fire? Who's Ecki?

139
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,000
Hello? Lejla?

140
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,600
Who is he? Have you seen her?

141
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,120
What are you on about?

142
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,480
Hello?

143
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,840
Yes?

144
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,120
I need to see Tomas.

145
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,080
-Do you have an appointment?
-It's important. Please.

146
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Who is Ecki?

147
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,120
Lejla has been through a bunch of stuff
that still affects her today.

148
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,440
She…

149
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,880
She takes on everything that's happening.

150
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,080
She's incredible at what she does,

151
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,720
but we're conducting
a police investigation.

152
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,200
If we find Frick,
I'm convinced we'll find Alicia.

153
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,360
You've been convinced
of a number of things.

154
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,920
Right.

155
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,240
Let me rephrase.

156
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,120
The most likely scenario is
that Frick has Alicia,

157
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,680
not some ghost from the past.

158
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,240
We'll find Frick.

159
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,720
There's a nationwide warrant
out for him. Hang in there.

160
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,200
You wasted the most important first days
investigating me.

161
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,680
We still don't know
who Louise was cheating with.

162
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,600
Her cell is still gone, Alicia's missing,

163
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,800
and you issue a warrant
and sit here and drink coffee.

164
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,680
Just talk to Lejla. She knows something.

165
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,440
Where the hell have you been?

166
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,360
Hi.

167
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,040
Fucking icy roads.

168
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,400
You're wasted.

169
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,760
No, you're wasted.

170
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,560
What the hell is this?

171
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,040
Blood?

172
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,920
What have you done?

173
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,760
Huh?

174
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,360
I've been hunting.

175
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,920
Give me your jacket.

176
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,840
Go and wash up.

177
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,480
And then go to bed.

178
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,480
Do you hear me?

179
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,880
-Hi.
-I heard what happened.

180
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,880
How horrible!

181
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,680
Yes.

182
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,640
How are you?

183
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,560
It's… It's under control.

184
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
Thanks for coming.

185
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,480
So…

186
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,960
I saw Tomas yesterday.
He doesn't believe in your theory.

187
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,720
So we'd like to hear it straight from you.

188
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,360
Why you are so sure.

189
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,040
Sure?

190
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,240
About what you told me yesterday.

191
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,520
You said Frick doesn't have her.

192
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,960
And something about someone by a fire.

193
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,440
Ecki. Who's that?

194
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,160
But…

195
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,960
When did I say this?

196
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,240
Last night!

197
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,800
I'm sorry,
but I don't remember saying that.

198
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,800
So what do you think?
Does Frick have her or not?

199
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,600
I was kind of out of it yesterday.

200
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,840
What the fuck? Are you kidding me?

201
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,760
I'm sorry if I made you think
I have some sort of answer. It…

202
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,160
I wish I could help you.

203
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,600
I get that.

204
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,080
What's that?

205
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,440
Daniel Frick.

206
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,280
Säter just confirmed it.

207
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,800
Single cut through the cardiac muscle.
Drained of blood.

208
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,360
What do you want me to explain?

209
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,800
I was here at work, then we found the guy.

210
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,680
-Tomas, what is it?
-What the hell do you think?

211
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,720
How do we find Alicia
now that the bastard's been murdered?

212
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,960
How can an entire police force
fail in finding Frick?

213
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,000
When the half-wit who did this clearly
didn't find it the least bit difficult!

214
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,440
Calm down!

215
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,920
-Where's Jim?
-The gym.

216
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,040
Come on. One more.

217
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,840
Come on, fatty.

218
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,680
-Was it you, you fucker?
-Take it.

219
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,840
What the fuck?

220
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,800
You're not right in the head.

221
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,360
You're not right in the head.

222
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,320
Innocent!

223
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,880
-What?
-Hey…

224
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,880
Where were you
and your hunting party last night?

225
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,680
What's going on here?

226
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,680
-Hi, Dad.
-He's telling me what he did last night.

227
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,280
What happened last night?

228
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,320
Someone was murdered.

229
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,840
What's that got to do with me?
Is this even a real interview?

230
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,440
How can you be so stupid?

231
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,240
Tomas! Do you have anything on him?

232
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,840
Then I suggest you get out of here.

233
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,560
Right away.

234
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,400
Listen to Daddy.

235
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,040
And you just… Shut up.

236
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,720
-I have to shower!
-Shut up.

237
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,800
One day
I'll shut that fucking yapper of yours!

238
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,720
-Send these to the lab.
-What is it?

239
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,960
Jim's boots.

240
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,400
Have you seen Jim?

241
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,120
-Did you have a warrant?
-They've got blood on them.

242
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,760
It's raw outside.

243
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,280
It smells nice.

244
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,520
I've found a flight back.

245
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,400
Via Munich, on Thursday.

246
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,320
All right.

247
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,600
So you're booking it?

248
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,120
Wouldn't it be wise
to listen to the doctor?

249
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,600
You can talk to a psychologist
before you leave.

250
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,720
No.

251
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,640
I'm fine.

252
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,760
I try and I try,
but I'm not getting through.

253
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,560
I really thought I could make a difference
in the investigation.

254
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,680
That I could solve it.

255
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,960
Never mind.

256
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,480
I'm going.

257
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,520
Okay, I understand.

258
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,400
I understand.

259
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,280
For you.

260
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,640
There's no sender.

261
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,680
Can I see?

262
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,600
No! Leave it. Don't touch it.

263
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,720
All right!

264
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,400
Is that really necessary?

265
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,640
What is it?

266
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,080
Tell me what it is.

267
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,840
Is it Alicia's?

268
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,040
No, it's mine.

269
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,120
-It was just there, in the mailbox?
-Yeah, the audacity…

270
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,360
From now on,
I want this place under guard 24/7.

271
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,960
I can arrange that.

272
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,800
We have to establish
if it really is Lejla's hair.

273
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,160
I'm certain.

274
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,520
It's my scrunchy.

275
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,440
He took it when he cut my hair.

276
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
The last thing he did
before it was supposed to end.

277
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,080
Frick did not take Alicia.

278
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,240
Where do you suggest we go from here?

279
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,920
There's an investigation at your disposal.

280
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,200
-22 years' worth of material.
-That led nowhere.

281
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,920
No, but with a fresh set of eyes,
it might lead somewhere.

282
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,840
If you'd care
to open the investigation again.

283
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,640
This is not a competition.

284
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,280
We need to go through it,
all of us together.

285
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,040
You too, Valter.

286
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,840
There. Take this.

287
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,280
Elisabeth Byfeldt, Eva Fransén,
Tova Danielsson…

288
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,400
Inas Jović, the container girl.

289
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,440
I'm convinced there are more.

290
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,240
INAS JOVIĆ, 11
REPORTED MISSING 4/29/93

291
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,000
What?

292
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,160
You looked into Inas Jović?

293
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,040
Yes.

294
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,200
Can we do more?

295
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,200
-First of all…
-We'll look into it.

296
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,880
Great.

297
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,560
Then there's Frick.

298
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,080
Frick?

299
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,960
He was treated like an animal.

300
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,600
Hung upside down,

301
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,760
drained of blood.

302
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,880
This is pure hatred.

303
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,480
Frick pretended to be Ecki.

304
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,160
And he got his punishment.

305
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,880
Do you think your perpetrator
killed Frick?

306
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,040
Mm.

307
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,000
Well done.

308
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,760
HAVE YOU SEEN ALICIA?

309
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Good morning.

310
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,360
-Hello.
-Björn will drive you home.

311
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,520
And then he'll keep you company.
Does that sound okay?

312
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,040
Great.

313
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,440
We'll leave in about ten minutes.

314
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,320
I wanted a job
that would let me be outdoors.

315
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,480
All the men in my family
are in the military.

316
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,240
But I think it's too destructive.

317
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,120
Then I talked to my grandmother.

318
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,240
And she said, "Why don't you
become a police officer?"

319
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
"Here in Granås."

320
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Wait. You have to wait here.

321
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,680
I need to secure the house first.

322
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,320
Just stay here.

323
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,560
Right.

324
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,720
Can I take my jacket off?

325
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,280
Funny!

326
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,280
Right, then.

327
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,440
-Hello, everybody.
-Hi there.

328
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
-Hello.
-Hi.

329
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,280
I have been asked
to put retirement on hold for a while

330
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,800
to assist in the Alicia investigation.

331
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,480
I guess we might as well…
kick things off. Tomas?

332
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,480
Do you want me
to run through your investigation?

333
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,240
No, I understand.

334
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,880
I'll get started
and then you can take over.

335
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,080
Let's do that.

336
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:41,120
I'll try to take you through the course
of events as briefly as possible.

337
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,920
We have to go back in time,

338
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,320
specifically to November 2002.

339
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,040
That's when Lejla Ness was found
in Granås.

340
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,320
Nine months earlier
she had been reported missing

341
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,080
by her mother, Milena,
from Vårby in Stockholm.

342
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,120
Six months later,
her mother is found dead.

343
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,920
The postmortem shows
she had taken an overdose of sedatives.

344
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
She went to school in the morning.

345
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,120
We said goodbye.

346
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,520
I was working late.

347
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,360
Can you tell me
where you've been in the last year?

348
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,080
Mostly at home in Vårby.

349
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,720
A short cruise to Åland.

350
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,920
A friend worked at a building site
and we went to visit him.

351
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,360
A male friend?

352
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,280
Who's he? Where can we find him?

353
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,600
In Bosnia.

354
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,240
Right. When was this?

355
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,880
April, May.

356
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,040
It was… What's it called?

357
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,520
-Vatra.
-"Vatra"?

358
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,840
The big fire.

359
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,200
Which fire? You mean Walpurgis Night?

360
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,680
-Yes, Walpurgis.
-Okay. And where was this?

361
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,560
Up north.
I don't remember the name of the place.

362
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,720
He rented a cabin for us.

363
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,120
Lejla wanted to see Mora.

364
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,120
We drove there. It wasn't far.

365
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,960
Wait!

366
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,160
Where are you going?

367
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,560
Lejla!

368
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,480
Lejla told us about the drawings

369
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,840
she thought were done
by three different kids.

370
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,640
That would support the theory
that this is a serial perpetrator.

371
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,440
On the other hand,

372
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,720
Louise's murder is completely inconsistent
in that respect.

373
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,000
The motive must be entirely different.

374
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,600
What about Frick's murder?
If it is as Lejla says.

375
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,080
We still can't write Jim off

376
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,200
until we get the results
of the analysis of his boots.

377
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,400
It was moose blood.

378
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,280
It's in the report, Tomas.

379
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,200
Right.

380
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,800
At least the investigation is open again…

381
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,920
There you are.

382
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,320
Hi, Tomas.

383
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,240
The usual?

384
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,600
Yes.

385
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,960
Can I get ice and lemon with that?

386
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,200
Ice and lemon.

387
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,120
Actually…

388
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,560
Skip that. I'll have a…

389
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,800
-Jäger, a single shot.
-Jäger?

390
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,480
Can I have another one? A large, a double.

391
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,680
-Party today?
-Not really.

392
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,040
WELCOME TO GRANÅS COTTAGES

393
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,160
Wait here. I'll be right back. Okay?

394
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,480
-Shouldn't I come?
-I'll be right back.

395
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,680
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

396
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,720
Are you coming?

397
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,480
Yeah.

398
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,080
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

399
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,760
What year did you say?

400
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,160
2001, I think.

401
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,960
2001. Where the hell could that be?

402
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,600
2001. Well, I'll be damned.

403
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,360
The spring. Walpurgis.

404
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,440
April 28th.

405
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,320
29th…

406
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,320
Walpurgis… Name?

407
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,680
Milena Delić.

408
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,480
-Delić?
-And Lejla Delić.

409
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,000
Delić, Delić…

410
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,800
Here.

411
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,280
Yes, you were here. Three nights.

412
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,400
End of April, beginning of May.
Cabin number 12.

413
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,760
Do you remember staying here?

414
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,360
I had a feeling.

415
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,880
Right, then.

416
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,600
Wait.

417
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
What does that say?

418
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,400
Tomas Ness.

419
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,600
What's wrong? What's happened?

420
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,000
Do you remember the fire
at the refugee centre in Berga?

421
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,480
-Not something you forget.
-No.

422
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,320
The girl in the container, Inas…

423
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,160
She stayed there
before she was moved to Sundsvall.

424
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,560
So there's a connection to Granås.

425
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,560
Are you fucking kidding?

426
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,040
How could Tomas have missed this?

427
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,880
Well…

428
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,280
Where is he, by the way?

429
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,080
I have no idea.

430
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,320
Come home
Let us start over

431
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,200
Let's forget the world

432
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,560
Outside it's so very cold

433
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,520
Come home

434
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,040
Alexandra!

435
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,840
Well done!

436
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,840
Can I have another round?

437
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,600
-Same again?
-Same again.

438
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,640
Said!

439
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,800
Said, come here.

440
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,320
Come here.

441
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,760
-Can I buy you a beer?
-No, I'm fine.

442
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,000
Cheers.

443
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,760
-What do you want?
-I know you're going through hell.

444
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,400
I see you.

445
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,640
Just so you know.

446
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,520
Right.

447
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,880
I've made one mistake.

448
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,760
I should never have said
I would bring Alicia back.

449
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,920
What do you mean?

450
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,680
Never make promises you can't keep.

451
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,200
It's the first thing you learn
in police academy.

452
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,920
It'll be better
now that Valter's taken over.

453
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,120
-Has Valter taken over the investigation?
-He's good.

454
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,280
He's a fucking great cop.

455
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
I thought I was a great cop,

456
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,480
but I'm nothing compared to him.

457
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,120
Nothing.

458
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,640
Nada.

459
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,360
-I have to go.
-No, Said…

460
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,400
We need to talk.

461
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,600
It was so fucking weird
when you came with that book. Coetzee.

462
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,360
It's my fucking book.

463
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,160
She said you were in a bad place
and getting a divorce.

464
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,040
But we were not in a bad place.
We were great.

465
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,960
The mystery man you're looking for

466
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
is me.

467
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,800
Louise and I were screwing!

468
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,000
You're no fucking cop, you're a rat!

469
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,920
What else are you lying about?
Fucking liar! Who do you think you are?

470
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,160
-Are we square now?
-Let go!

471
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,280
Sing!

472
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,720
Sing, for fuck's sake!

473
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,160
Let's continue with our next song.

474
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,400
Are you ready?

475
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,080
-Said, what is it?
-Did you know it was Tomas?

476
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,680
What are you talking about?

477
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,440
That Louise had an affair with?
Did you know?

478
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,880
Are you there?

479
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,400
-I'm here.
-So you knew.

480
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,280
This is misconduct. I'll report him!

481
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,360
He's lied to me this whole time.

482
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,120
What else has he lied about?

483
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,640
Why didn't you say anything?

484
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,960
I'm so sorry.

485
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,680
I'm sorry, I…

486
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,720
I'll follow you through fire and water

487
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,760
Over land and sea

488
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,920
I will love you
Until my heart it beats no more

489
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,960
Hello. Great night tonight.

490
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,880
Hi there.

491
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,960
Come on.

492
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,680
Are you taking over the bar too?

493
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,160
Get up. You're not as drunk as you think.

494
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,240
Come on, then.

495
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,160
Right.

496
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,920
Grab your jacket. Good.

497
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,120
I apologise on behalf of my brother
for making a fool of himself.

498
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,680
-He's here to save me.
-Come on, let's go.

499
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,560
It'll be fine. Let's go home to bed.

500
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,760
I thought you needed something to eat.

501
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,800
There we are.

502
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,600
Come on.

503
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,640
Hello.

504
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,480
When are you back? We need to talk, now.

505
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,440
Something's come up.
Tomas has been out drinking.

506
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,000
I have to get him home.

507
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,080
Right.

508
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,600
-Is Björn still there?
-Yes.

509
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,000
Could you ask him to stay the night?

510
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,560
We'll talk in the morning.

511
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,040
Right, then. Bye.

512
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,920
-There…
-There you go.

513
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,200
Is everything okay?

514
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,560
-Valter asked if you could stay the night.
-Sure, no problem.

515
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,160
Thank you.

516
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,320
How does it feel to be a good person?

517
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,960
There, there. You're fine.

518
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,560
I'm no good, right?

519
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,280
No, I'm no good.

520
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,160
Yes, you are.

521
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,640
I need a thrashing.

522
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,960
No.

523
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,200
I need a beating.

524
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,960
Don't you need a beating,
Mr. Fucking Perfect?

525
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,400
You sick bastard.

526
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,720
HI THERE, BETWEEN THE TREES

527
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,040
Do you remember the fox cubs
we found in the woods? Do you remember?

528
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,160
You put them in a plastic bag and…

529
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,440
But they didn't die,
so you just squ… squeezed.

530
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,600
You squeezed and squeezed…

531
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,960
IN FRONT OF THE OLD CABIN

532
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,320
THE BOYS READY TO WATCH THE CHRISTMAS SHOW

533
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,000
What a fucking beating Dad gave you.

534
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,640
What a fucking beating.

535
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,920
You need a fucking beating.

536
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,560
You sick bastard.

537
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,560
Are you trying to make a joke?

538
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,800
It's not funny.

539
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,080
I didn't kill those fox cubs.

540
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,720
You did.

541
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,840
