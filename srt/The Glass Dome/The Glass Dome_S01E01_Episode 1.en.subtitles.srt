00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,200
Hi, Lejla.

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,920
Cigarettes for Mum?

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,240
Have you been to school?

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,240
No, after-school care. Mum's working.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,760
-There you go.
-Thanks.

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,520
-Say hi to your mum.
-I will.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,880
Hello?

8
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,320
Mum?

9
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,080
Hello?

10
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,240
Hello?

11
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,000
Let me out!

12
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,600
Hello?!

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,400
THE GLASS DOME

14
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,480
-Hi. Hello. Hi.
-Hi.

15
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,960
Ann-Marie died last night.

16
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,440
-What?
-It happened really fast.

17
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,200
-It just feels…
-Okay.

18
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,800
But they said that she…

19
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,080
Can you just come home? Please?

20
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,280
Yes, sure. Of course.

21
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,760
I'll book immediately.

22
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,320
GRANÅS 7

23
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,440
Hi.

24
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,440
Hi.

25
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,720
Did you just get here?

26
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,400
I didn't hear a thing.
I didn't expect you for another hour.

27
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,120
-Hi.
-Hi.

28
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,000
For you.

29
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thank you.

30
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,560
How was your trip?

31
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,480
Fine.

32
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,440
It's nice to be here.

33
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,520
How does some coffee
and a cinnamon bun sound?

34
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,440
This one is nice.

35
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,480
It might become something.

36
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,120
Shouldn't you take all this down now?

37
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,720
Sure. It's just difficult to let go.

38
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,720
That we didn't catch the bastard.

39
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,360
Well…

40
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,840
And I bought these.

41
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
What are you listening to?

42
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah.

43
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,760
I read he's number one on some list
and I thought that's…

44
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,760
It could be something… to listen to.

45
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,640
Yeah. Do you like him?

46
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,160
Well, he's a bit crazy. You know.

47
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Shouty bastard.

48
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, there are plenty of crazy,
shouty Americans. You should know.

49
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,440
Yeah.

50
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
That's how it is.

51
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,560
Nice to have you home again.

52
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,880
Hey.

53
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,440
You wanna go out for a bit?

54
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,280
Do you remember
when you fell in over there?

55
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,200
The first winter after we adopted you.

56
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,840
Ann-Marie was worried sick
you'd freeze to death.

57
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,680
You meant everything to her, you know.

58
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,120
They're going to drain the entire channel

59
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
when they're expanding the mine.

60
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,640
What? Oh…

61
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,280
It's pure madness.

62
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,280
You'd think some things
could stay as they are.

63
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,000
Ann-Marie,

64
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
she saved absolutely everything.

65
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,960
This is not mine. It's yours,
so I thought you might want…

66
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,560
Yes.

67
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Thank you.

68
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,480
Tomorrow,

69
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,480
could you possibly say a few words?

70
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,960
Sure. I haven't prepared anything.

71
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,360
It would be nice.

72
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,560
Well…

73
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,640
Good night.

74
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,840
Good night.

I'll see you in a bit.

82
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Yes.

83
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,320

Stop it. Stop fiddling.

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,840
-Can I go with you?
-No, you can't.

87
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,200
-You said I could go with you.
-No.

-Hi.

91
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm picking up an order for Ness.

92
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,440
Valter. Of course.

93
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,120
I'm sorry for your loss.

94
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,440
There.

95
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
One moment.

96
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,320
Thanks.

97
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,560
Hi.

98
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,400
What…

99
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,400
Hi!

100
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,880
Hi. Damn, it's been a while.

101
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,280
Yeah.

102
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,800
I bumped into Valter. He said
you were coming home for the funeral.

103
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, exactly.

104
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,440
It's today, right?

105
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,640
Yes.

106
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,120
Aino is going. I'm working, but…

107
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,960
I'm sorry for your loss.

108
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,520
I mean,

109
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,520
how are things in America?

110
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,160
Good.

111
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,520
Okay.

112
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,440
-Okay.
-What about you?

113
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,240
How are you guys?

114
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,440
Aino and…

115
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,360
Isla.

116
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,280
We're good. Fine.

117
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,880
We're expecting another one.

118
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,600
Adde! Are you coming?

119
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,400
I'm… I'm talking to…

120
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,560
Hi.

121
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,120
Okay, but…

00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,320
Girl in the box, girl in the box

123
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,680

124
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,160
Sleeping?

125
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,640
Sleeping?

126
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,880
Same old song.

127
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,360
It was nice running into you.

128
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,480
Likewise.

129
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,280
Say hi to Aino and…

130
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,480
-Isla.
-Isla.

131
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,240
Sure. Will do.

132
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,920
-Are you done?
-Yes.

133
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,600
Bye.

134
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,720
Girl in the box
What are you doin'?

135
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,560
-Sandwich cakes for Valter Ness.
-Yes.

136
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,280

-Hi.

147

How the hell can you pay for this shit?

148
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,960
Look!

149
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,000
-It's completely useless.
-Hey, Tomas.

150
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,760
-No, not those. They're half dead.
-I know.

151
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,040
These.

152
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,320
-What's going on?
-I've made a mistake.

00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,000
How the hell could you buy
half-dead flowers?

154
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,560
What are you thinking… It's flowers.

155
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,320
I told you I'm sorry.

156
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,640
I… I could've been more careful.

157
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
-Should I go back and see if they've got…
-There's no time.

158
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,480
-Then there's not much I can do.
-I'll take this.

159
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,320
Looks like you have to
put up with a lot today.

160
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,520
Indeed.

161
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,600
You're home.

162
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,680
-Yes.
-How does that feel?

163
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,280
It feels… quite okay.

164
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,160
It's Granås, so it's quiet.

165
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,560
-It's a fucking disaster.
-I have a pensioner to take care of.

166
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,440
And he's convinced you
to take his place as commissioner?

167
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,480
No, that was decided earlier.

168
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,520
Valter is very stressed.

169
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,920
Hi.

170
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,080
Hi.

171
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,120
This is nice.

172
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,120
What a beautiful funeral.

173
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,240
And the sandwich cake was delicious.

174
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,160
Yes.

175
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,200
-Come on. I'm staying.
-Stop it!

176
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,240
No.

177
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,560
Lovely to see you.

178
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
I'll talk to her.

179
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,080
I should hope so.

180
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,680
-Call me later.
-For sure. Talk to you later.

181
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,680
Hi.

182
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,640
-Valter…
-Hi.

183
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,880
You know I'm always here for you.

184
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,800
Just like you and Ann-Marie
were there for me when Ulf died.

185
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
A lot of cars.

186
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,520
You know what it's like.

187
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,280
Yes, it takes a while.

188
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,080
Damn, what a relief!

189
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
How does it feel?

190
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,760
Okay, I guess.

191
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,880
I'm mostly worried about Valter.

192
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,880
Ann-Marie and I weren't exactly…

193
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,320
You know.

194
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,800
And you?

195
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,960
How is everything?

196
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,600
Me?

197
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,240
You want the truth? Or…

198
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,960
It's a big fucking mess.

199
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,920
-Of course. It's awful. It's terrible.
-What is?

200
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,240
-Moving back here? Are you kidding me?
-How long are you staying?

201
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,800
We said two years,

202
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,960
but I mean…

203
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,320
But just thinking about
staying another fucking second…

204
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,040
I'll shoot myself in the head.

205
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,160
We didn't really get it, growing up here.

206
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,160
People have zero perspective.

207
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,120
The fucking mine
is the only thing people talk about.

208
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,600
They are so damn angry.
It's like a fucking psychosis.

209
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,360
Look at this. Wait.

210
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,320
This is insane. Look at this.
They've egged Said's car.

211
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,760
You get the mood. It's…

212
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,560
People are so damn angry.

213
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,280
This is what happens here.
That's the situation.

214
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,120
People don't even say hello.

215
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
It's not my mine!

216
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,720
It's Mum's and Said's fucking project.

217
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,640
Don't drag me into this shit.
It's got nothing to do with me. So…

218
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,440
Never mind. Forget it.

219
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,040
Tell me everything.

220
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,000
How is America?

221
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,240
It is…

222
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,400
It's really good.

223
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,960
I feel free.

224
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,320
I can breathe.

225
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,320
-It's a new feeling.
-Dammit.

226
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
-Hi.
-Hi.

227
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,240
-Have you been smoking?
-No, it's…

228
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,800
Well, it stinks of cigarettes.

229
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,120
But that… Come here.

230
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,080
The thing is…

231
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,040
Do you remember Mum's old friend?

232
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,360
-Remember her?
-Yes.

233
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,840
The thing is that Lejla lives in the US.

234
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,000
And… she brought special cigarettes
that aren't dangerous.

235
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
-That's the thing.
-Yeah.

236
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,400
Yes. It is…

237
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,680
But hey…

238
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,160
Why don't you come over for a bit tomorrow
before you leave?

239
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,360
Have a coffee or something.

240
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,960
I think I can do that.

241
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,240
I'll drop off Alicia at my mum's
and then we could…

242
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,360
have a chat.

243
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,640
Just you and me.

244
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,640
When did you say you're leaving tomorrow?

245
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,560
At nine.

246
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,360
I'm going to Louise's first.

247
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,120
It was beautiful today.

248
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,360
The flowers too.

249
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,920
They were also beautiful.

250
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,840
Very beautiful.

251
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,040
You want the lights on?

252
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
All right.

253
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,920
I don't understand!

254
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,400
I don't understand.

255
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,680
I'm so worried that I…

256
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,480
I'm so worried that I got…

257
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,120
That I got in between you and Ann-Marie.

258
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,840
-I already had a mum.
-Yes.

259
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,760
Yes.

260
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,800
I didn't have a dad.

261
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,760
-No.
-No.

262
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,800
Okay.

263
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,760
-I was longing for a dad.
-Yes, I…

264
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,160
I miss her.

265
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
I'll be in touch when I get there.

266
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,880
Safe travels.

267
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,920
-Tell Tomas I said bye when he wakes up.
-Yes.

268
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,080
I'll go and kick some life into him.

269
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
You do that.

270
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,800
Well, all right.

271
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,680
Hello?

272
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,600
Hello?

273
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,360
Hello?

274
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,200
No! No!

275
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,320
Damn!

276
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,400
Louise!

277
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,600
Hello!

278
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,200
-Hello?
-Can you hear me?

279
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,440
Louise is dead. There's blood everywhere.

280
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,160
Hello?

281
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,560
Lejla?

282
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,280
Dad, can you come?

283
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Please.

284
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,160
-Where is she?
-Upstairs. Bathroom.

285
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,000
No, Valter. You need to stay here.
Only the police are allowed inside.

286
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,960
We can't go in?

287
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,200
She's in the bathroom.

288
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,800
What is going on in there?

289
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,680
Ask the people who are working.

290
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,880
Where is she?

291
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,560
Where is she?

292
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,000
Is she in there?

293
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,760
-Kristina…
-Where is she?!

294
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,040
-Where is she? Let me go!
-Calm down.

295
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,400
-I have to go inside!
-Calm down.

296
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,760
-You can't go in.
-Let go of me!

297
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,240
I have to go inside. Let me go!

298
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,720
I have to go inside. Let me go!

299
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,560
-Where is Alicia?
-I don't know.

300
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,800
-She was supposed to be with you.
-What?

301
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,840
She was supposed to be with you!

302
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,520
This is Alicia.

303
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,440
She went missing
sometime during the night.

304
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,200
Possibly early this morning.

305
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,080
She is 140 cm tall and has dark hair.

306
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,120
Alicia is likely wearing pink rubber boots

307
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,800
and a purply pink raincoat.

308
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,600
Alicia, it's Dad!

309
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,440
Section 2 stops here.

310
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,000
Confirm, chief officer.

311
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,920
-Stop!
-Stop!

312
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,440
-Stop!
-Stop!

313
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,040
Let's take a break.

314
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,160
Are you okay?

315
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,320
There's blueberry soup.

316
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,640
Come!

317
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,920
POLICE

318
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,440
Sector 8 taking a break.

319
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,840
The search will continue in 15 minutes.

320
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,400
Yes, we're coming right away.

321
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,040
-Björn!
-Yes?

322
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,400
We've found something.

323
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,680
-Okay.
-Let's go.

324
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,880
Yes. Coming.

325
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,280
-Hi.
-Hi.

326
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,800
-Fancy seeing you here.
-Just thought I'd see how you're doing.

327
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,920
As an old policeman, I'm curious.

328
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,480
Yeah, well…

329
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,000
We think Alicia found
her mother's dead body and ran away.

330
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,560
The technicians
will be here in the morning.

331
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,440
These are leftovers from yesterday.
I thought if you'd…

332
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,000
Well…

333
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,880
Thank you.

334
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,960
I don't suppose I could come in
and have a look?

335
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,080
Sure. That's fine.

336
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,320
-But don't mention it to Tomas.
-No.

337
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,640
-So how's my brother doing?
-He has his own ways.

338
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,080
I'm sure he's good.

339
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,560
-Hello.
-Hi.

340
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,840
Funny how little you know about a person.

341
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,400
How we feel on the inside.

342
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,520
No, sometimes you don't know
how bad it is.

343
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,560
-Hi, Tomas.
-Listen.

344
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,720
Björn and I are at one of the entrances
to the mine and…

345
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,480
We've got something.

346
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,520
-Yes?
-I want you to cordon this off.

347
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,840
We need to treat Alicia's disappearance
as a crime.

348
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,040
Yes.

349
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,760
Thanks.

350
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,800
-Hi.
-Hi there.

351
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,960
I heard it was you who found Louise.

352
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah.

353
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,280
If you don't find a missing child
within 48 hours, it's over.

354
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,440
Not necessarily.

355
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Yes…

356
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,240
Said, come with us.

357
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,240
What's happened?

358
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,080
You're coming with us.

359
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,160
Why? What has happened?

360
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,640
Have you found her?

361
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,320
I want you to come with us.

362
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,040
Just tell me what's happened.
Have you found her?

363
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,920
-No, but you need to come with us.
-I want to stay and keep looking.

364
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,120
Either you come with us voluntarily
or we'll make you.

365
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,360
Said,

366
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
just come with us to the car, okay?

367
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,240
-Tomas, what is going on?
-Not now.

368
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,160
Hello you.

369
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,760
Hi. Were you asleep?

370
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,000
No. How are things going?

371
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,960
They've moved the search effort up north.
I'm headed there now.

372
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,520
Tomas picked up Said.
Do you know anything about that?

373
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,080
They've found Alicia's clothes and shoes.

374
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
What?

375
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,280
Where?

376
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,280
Åsdammen, at one of the entrances
to the mining area.

377
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,080
Jorun told me.

378
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,280
That means someone has taken her.

379
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,200
Open!
