1
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,160
THE GLASS DOME

2
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,480
They look so sad in the drawing.

3
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,760
-Here.
-Thank you.

4
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,200
Who are they?

5
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
Mummy, Daddy and me.

6
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,880
Right. You look nice.

7
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
This one is nice.

8
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
I didn't draw that one.

9
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,320
Okay.

10
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,040
So who drew it?

11
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
Ecki.

12
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,400
Why did Ecki draw this?

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Did he say?

14
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
No.

15
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,400
Which colour will you pick now?

16
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,360
Pink? That's my favourite colour.

17
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,560
Mine too.

18
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,080
And Grandma's.

19
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,760
But not Daddy's.

20
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,800
-His is blue.
-I see.

21
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
What's Ecki's favourite do you think?

22
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,960
I know. It's red.

23
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,640
How do you know?

24
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
Because he's painted on his arm.

25
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,440
Here.

26
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,360
In red.

27
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,360
Like a flower.

28
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,880
Could you look at something?

29
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,080
So many girls have gone missing
over the years.

30
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,560
Why did you link these to Ecki?
They were never found.

31
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,800
No.

32
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,960
But at the time you were adamant

33
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,040
there had been at least three victims
before you,

34
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,120
based on the drawings you found.

35
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,560
They fit.

36
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,760
In age and appearance.
They had the same build.

37
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,480
Same long, dark hair.

38
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,480
And you disappeared in the exact same way.

39
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,480
Near your homes. Zero physical evidence.

40
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,880
As if you vanished into thin air.

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
We weren't picked at random.

42
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,440
He knew who we were.

43
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,280
He knew our routines,
what our lives were like.

44
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,920
Let's play with the idea it was Ecki
who abducted Alicia.

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,600
In that case,
he's had a hiatus of over 20 years.

46
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,640
A hiatus is not uncommon.

47
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,480
It's like any addiction.

48
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,840
There are periods of active use
and periods of sobriety.

49
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,640
But the addiction is chronic.

50
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,520
What stands out is
that he's changed his MO.

51
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,560
It's like he wants to show off this time.

52
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,160
Something must have happened recently.

53
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,560
Something that's thrown everything off,
offended him.

54
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,200
-Like what, do you think?
-I don't know.

55
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,080
I just know
that if I didn't follow instructions or

56
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,040
ignored him in any way…

57
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
He hated that.

58
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
It was like a personal insult.

59
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,360
How could you tell?

60
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,040
He went crazy.

61
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,200
He banged the glass.

62
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,600
I screamed back.
It was like a power struggle between us.

63
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,200
Sometimes I would use that
to throw him off balance.

64
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,040
But I knew when to stop,
and I never crossed that line.

65
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,200
And then it was important
that I surrendered to his power again.

66
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,680
That I…

67
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,080
really showed remorse.

68
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,240
Boosted his ego.

69
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,200
Why have you never
talked about this before?

70
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,240
Can I borrow your car?

71
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,400
I returned the rental.

72
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,640
Take Ann-Marie's.

73
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,160
Consider it yours.

74
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,440
WELCOME TO GRANÅS

75
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,720
According to the police,
there may be a connection

76
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,080
between the abduction of Alicia

77
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,840
and the sabotage
against the Svea Vanadin mine

78
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,160
we have previously reported on.

79
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,680
On March 5th, ten-year-old Alicia
disappeared from her home.

80
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,840
The police are treating the disappearance
as a crime.

81
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,800
HAVE YOU SEEN ALICIA?

82
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,240
Hi, Tomas.

83
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,120
So how are you?

84
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,880
Well…

85
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Valter has bolted
every window in the house shut, so it's…

86
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,120
-Sounds like him.
-Yeah.

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,080
I'm short on time.
What did you want to discuss?

88
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,240
I have…

89
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,800
I've drawn up a profile on Ecki.

90
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Okay.

91
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,640
How academic.

92
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,000
"Lacks in attachment
and social interaction."

93
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,880
"Has been subjected to totalitarian power

94
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,480
with elements of sadistic violence."

95
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,960
"Clear preference
in the choice of victims."

96
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,160
"Specific fixation/fetish

97
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,160
related to early trauma,
experiences or fantasies."

98
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,880
It's based on me and the other girls
Valter linked to the case.

99
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,760
Have you gone over Valter's material?

100
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
No.

101
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,880
It must be at least ten years
since anyone looked at it.

102
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,040
You should.

103
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,520
Alicia fits the profile.

104
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,400
"Fixation/fetish"?

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
Girls with long, dark hair.

106
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
The hair is important.

107
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,480
It was like some sort of ritual for him
when he cut mine.

108
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,800
What's behind that?

109
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,600
Maybe someone had a big impact on him.

110
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,440
Someone he sees as unattainable.

111
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,720
Someone he wants to own, dominate…

112
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,080
Perhaps punish.

113
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,840
Is the motive sexual?

114
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,520
No, it's about power.

115
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,320
He enjoys it. And he enjoys
controlling this investigation.

116
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,080
-What do you mean?
-The clothes.

117
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,360
Sabotaging the mine. The video.
That he was in my room.

118
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,760
All of it is communication on his part.

119
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,520
And I think it's meant for you,
to obstruct the investigation.

120
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,040
-Like some sort of power trip?
-Yeah.

121
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
-More coffee?
-Yes, please.

122
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,120
-It's really nice.
-Thank you.

123
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,200
So you think it's this Ecki

124
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,000
who's behind the murder of Louise
and the abduction of Alicia?

125
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,680
What do you think?

126
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,240
That all the crap happening in Granås
is a coincidence?

127
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,080
Isla's given us a description.

128
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
A tattoo.

129
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,880
A red flower on his forearm.

130
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,240
Does it ring any bells?

131
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,040
Do you recognise this one?

132
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,840
No, it was bigger.

133
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,240
Maybe something like this?

134
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,720
No, it was more red.

135
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,280
Was it a flower you had seen before?

136
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,400
I didn't recognise it.

137
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,400
I'll be right back.

138
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,040
You can keep drawing if you like.

139
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,400
How's it going?

140
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,160
It's a nightmare.

141
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,680
-Aino?
-Yes?

142
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,560
I'll come out to you so we can talk.

143
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,560
-Okay.
-See you later.

144
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,480
-Hi, Isla.
-Hi.

145
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,080
What a nice drawing. Really nice.

146
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,080
-I'm not happy with it.
-Why not?

147
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,120
I'm trying to draw like him,
but it turns out bad.

148
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,560
No, this is not bad.

149
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Let me see. This is really nice.

150
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,720
But you have to practise, like you do now.

151
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,640
The more you practise, the better you get.

152
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Here you are.

153
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Thank you.

154
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,520
Got a minute to talk?

155
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,040
Right. What is it?

156
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,000
I think there is at least one more victim.

157
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,600
No, I wouldn't miss that.

158
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,320
Yes, because you focus on this.

159
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,920
But this is perfection.

160
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,160
Yeah.

161
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,040
No one manages perfection
on their first try.

162
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,840
If there's a failure, we have to find it.

163
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,840
The first victim
says most about the perpetrator.

164
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,680
-What's your point?
-We have to go much further back.

165
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,080
We need all investigations of murder
and abduction of girls in Scandinavia

166
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,320
from 1980 to 1995.

167
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,680
-Can you get that?
-I…

168
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,000
Good.

169
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,000
We've found a link between the attack
on the mine and Alicia's disappearance.

170
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,000
We also have a description,

171
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,320
and evidence in Lejla's room
has been sent to the lab.

172
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,800
So if he has a record, we will find him.

173
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,200
And if he doesn't?

174
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,040
-This is a good thing.
-That's what you said about the video.

175
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,600
It didn't lead anywhere.

176
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,560
What about the guy Louise was seeing?

177
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,360
Well, we…
We're looking into that too, of course,

178
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,560
but Louise's mobile is missing
and there's nothing in the phone records.

179
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,000
Where is her cell?

180
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
I don't know, it…

181
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,480
The last time it was on was in your house.

182
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,040
If I hadn't gone to Stockholm,
none of this would've happened.

183
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,320
It's all my fault.

184
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,920
You can't think like that.

185
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,080
Hey… Louise's cellphone records…

186
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,520
I'll go through them again.

187
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,880
-Why?
-In case you've missed something.

188
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,080
Like what?

189
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,600
There must be something
leading to her fling on the side.

190
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,320
It'd be damn weird if it doesn't.

191
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,360
Don't you think?

192
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,960
Knowing who he is should be
of interest to the investigation.

193
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,520
Sure, but there are other
lines of enquiry.

194
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,360
I find it strange he hasn't come forward.

195
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,720
Don't you?

196
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,240
It makes you think he's hiding something.

197
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,000
Mummy's sweetheart.

198
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,480
It's cold. Why don't you come inside?

199
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,280

PHOTO 3
GIRL'S FACE UNCOVERED

201
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,680
Valter.

202
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,040
Valter.

203
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,160
Look at this.

204
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,000
Long, dark hair.

205
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,760
Disappeared without a trace.

206
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,760
Yes, same age.

207
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,280
Inas Jović.

208
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,040
The execution is entirely different.

209
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,040
That's the point.
It didn't go the way he wanted.

210
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,080
-What do you mean? He killed her.
-Yes, but he didn't enjoy it.

211
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
-Well…
-She became too real to him.

212
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,800
Too human.

213
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,600
He had to cover her face
with a plastic bag.

214
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,480
That's why he cut my hair.

215
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,800
That's why he kept us trapped
like bugs in a glass jar.

216
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,160
-Okay.
-He dehumanised us.

217
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,960
To be able to kill us.

218
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,800
-I understand. I will look into it.
-Thank you.

219
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
-Bye.
-I'll email my summary.

220
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,320
Please do. Bye.

221
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,680
Dear God. Lejla…

222
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,880
I'll eat on the way.
I'm picking up some groceries for Aino.

223
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,880
Hey!

224
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Great work.

225
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,440
Thanks.

226
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,280
Let me know where you are.

227
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,240
Girl in the box!

228
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,640
How are you doing?

229
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,520
-I'm good. You?
-Fine.

230
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
But Adde isn't so damn good.

231
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,640
He's in custody.

232
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
While murderers and paedos run free.

233
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,960
Hope you're happy.

234
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,200
Fucking snitch.

235
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,920
-Are you done?
-Hi. Hello there.

236
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,120
Everything all right?

237
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,640
Fuck yeah. Of course.

238
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
Hi. Jim.

239
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,960
Martin.

240
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,200
So, what is Martin doing in Granås?

241
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,840
Helping out with the search.

242
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,080
Fuck me! Are you kidding?

243
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,720
That's amazing.
You're doing an awesome job.

244
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,560
People come from all over the country,
fixing things for us.

245
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,720
-What can you say but thanks?
-Well…

246
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,160
We're doing our bit.

247
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,600
You can't ask for more than that. Right?

248
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,480
See you.

249
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,000
-Who the fuck was that?
-Jim.

250
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,360
We grew up together.

251
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,520
Never mind him.

252
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,720
How's it going?

253
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,040
I heard you're out searching again.

254
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,800
Nothing new yet, I'm afraid.

255
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,240
But we're out again, finally. That's…

256
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,480
I'm in charge of refreshments today.

257
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
How are you?

258
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,360
I don't know, to be honest.

259
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,360
-I haven't ventured there.
-Right.

260
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
If you want…

261
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,640
If you want to talk sometime,
we could go grab a coffee.

262
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,880
I don't drink coffee.

263
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,840
We could go for a beer.

264
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,800
In that place everyone goes to.

265
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,480
I don't drink beer either.

266
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,240
But I'd love to grab
a glass of water or something.

267
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,440
Then it's on me.

268
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,440
-Half past six tonight?
-Sure.

269
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,320
-I might have a beer, if that's okay.
-Sure.

270
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,400
-Nice. Okay, that's great. Bye.
-Bye.

271
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,280
And he pointed like this
and looked me dead in the eye.

272
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,240
Imagine!

273
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,920
He should be locked up
before he hurts someone.

274
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,320
Isla, can you please stop jumping
on the couch?

275
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,640
Wasn't he normal before?

276
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,400
Didn't he go out with Louise?

277
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,160
No, they were never an item.

278
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,720
You were seeing Adde.

279
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
In ninth grade!

280
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,120
He was so in love with you.
He told me. Everyone was.

281
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,800
Everyone found you so intriguing.
You were so special.

282
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,720
That's not how I remember it.

283
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,000
Isla?

284
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,320
Did you hurt yourself?

285
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,760
What did you do? Huh?

286
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,200
I opened the window
so Ecki could come in and draw with me.

287
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,440
What the fuck are you saying? Ecki?!

288
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,080
You can't open the window!

289
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,360
-Look at me! Was he here?
-Let go!

290
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,800
Look at me!

291
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,960
Did you see him?

292
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,400
No, I said, look at me!

293
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,160
Why did you open the window?

294
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,520
-Have you seen anything unusual?
-No, nothing.

295
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,960
-Nothing?
-No.

296
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,640
-Have you seen anything?
-No, me neither.

297
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,520
Well, it's hard to ascertain
from her account if he really was here.

298
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,280
The kid's got a wild imagination.

299
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,360
Well, we'll still increase
our presence here.

300
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,320
Go in and talk to Aino. She seems shaken.

301
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,480
Sure.

302
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,480
Hey.

303
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,800
-I don't think he's after Isla.
-No?

304
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,600
She doesn't fit the profile, and he won't
take anyone when he has Alicia.

305
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,800
We don't even know if she's alive.

306
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,800
She's alive.

307
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,680
Great, then we can relax
and put our feet up.

308
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,840
Did you look into the girl
in the container? Inas Jović.

309
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,400
-She fits the profile.
-Came to Sweden '92.

310
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,760
Went missing from a refugee centre
outside Sundsvall six months later.

311
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,000
I've talked to every fucker who worked
or lived there. Found her parents.

312
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,960
There is no new information
that isn't in the file.

313
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,520
I can keep digging.

314
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,520
Hey!

315
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,440
Give me access to the archives!

316
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,440
So I can help!

317
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,680
Hello?

318
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Let me out!

319
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,240
Hello!

320
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,160
We need to get through.

321
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,240
-It's cordoned off.
-We'll sneak past.

322
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,400
-I was counting them and she was missing.
-Has she disappeared before?

323
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,040
Excuse me, what's going on?

324
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,280
A little girl

325
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,680
from my grandchild's class

326
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,680
came here for a swimming lesson.

327
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,480
Now she's missing.

328
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,600
Elma!

329
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,560
You'll have to wait here.

330
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,760
-Is it Elma who's missing?
-Yes, unfortunately, we think it's her.

331
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,880
Is it him? Is he the one who took her?

332
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,640
VALTER
8 MISSED CALLS

333
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,160
WATER WITH MARTIN
TODAY 6:30 PM

334
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,360
-Hi, Björn.
-Hey.

335
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,480
Has Lejla been here?

336
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,240
No, why… No.

337
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,960
I saw her by the cordon,
but that was a while ago.

338
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,320
-Is Tomas here?
-He's in a meeting with forensics.

339
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,840
Damn. Another girl's gone missing now.

340
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,280
Yes, I know.

341
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,280
You'll have to wait here.

342
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,440
-Take a seat. A cup of coffee?
-Please.

343
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,160
-Hi, Antonsson.
-Hi there!

344
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,640
-Hello, Peter.
-Hi, Valter.

345
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,080
Could I have a look at that?

346
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,680
-Sure.
-Thanks.

347
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,720
HAVE YOU SEEN ELMA?

348
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,160
-You have seven new messages.
-Seven missed calls.

349
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,720
-Received today at 3:04 p.m.
-Oops.

350
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,760
This is Jakobs-Jan. Is it okay
for livestock to drink the water?

351
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,920
For fuck's sake!

352
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,880
Someone better call me back.

353
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,320
Received today 4:05 p.m

354
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,800
Received today 4:30 p.m.

355
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,920
She's with Ecki.

356
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,640
Elma, say something.

357
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,800
Mummy, Daddy, I want to go home.

358
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,040
Mummy, Daddy, I want to go home.

359
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,720
What's that noise in the background?

360
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,800
Is it the mine?

361
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,720
Or a wind turbine?

362
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,720
Mummy, Daddy, I want to go home.

363
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,600
It sounds like water, right?

364
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,440
Yes. Rewind, so I can listen again.

365
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,680
-A dam.
-Yes, that's it.

366
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,440
-It sounds like a dam.
-Yeah.

367
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,480
-Mummy, Daddy…
-When did the girl go missing?

368
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,880
Around 4:00 p.m.

369
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,480
Right…

370
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,560
Check every water treatment plant
within a 50 km radius.

371
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,360
-Okay.
-I mean now!

372
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,160
-Of course.
-I'm calling Tomas.

373
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,760
-You coming?
-Sure.

374
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,880
Peter? Call!

375
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,280
I was sure he wouldn't take anyone else
while he has Alicia.

376
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,760
And now there's one more victim,
vanished without a trace.

377
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,000
So what does this mean? That she's…

378
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,000
Hi.

379
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,120
One more beer?

380
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,280
-No, I'm good. Thanks anyway.
-Just give me a shout.

381
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,680
What?

382
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,040
What?

383
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,040
Stop it.

384
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,040
Didn't you notice?

385
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,600
She'd just be disappointed
if she got to know me.

386
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,720
Why?

387
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,640
Because I'm a fucking oddball

388
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,920
who travels around the country
looking for people who've gone missing.

389
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,840
Plus, I'm almost 40 and still studying.

390
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,400
I'm not exactly a catch.

391
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,720
Why do you do it?

392
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,640
I'm taking a remote course
at Linneaeus University.

393
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,440
Look for missing people.

394
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,240
My… sister disappeared when we were young.

395
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,880
She was only seven.

396
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,560
I was ten. We lived in a small village.

397
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,920
I walked her
to and from school every day and…

398
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,240
One day… my friends had built
a new skateboard ramp.

399
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,040
And I wanted to tag along…

400
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,160
She knew the way.
I knew she'd find her way home.

401
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,600
But…

402
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,440
that was the last time anyone saw her.

403
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,800
I'm sorry that happened to you.

404
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,520
It was the guilt that

405
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,320
triggered something in me. I became manic.

406
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,960
How could someone do that
to another person?

407
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,440
What was your conclusion?

408
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,080
Some kind of resignation.

409
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,080
There's evil in this world
you can't be protected from.

410
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,800
This thing that I'm doing…

411
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,960
I guess I'm thinking that if I only once
could help someone

412
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,160
come home again,
it would fill a void inside of me.

413
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,840
Hi.

414
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,480
I think I've found something.

415
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,600
Check this out.

416
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,800
A car was captured by the security cameras
at Hälledammen at 4:30 p.m.

417
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,840
The same time we received the message.

418
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,960
Can you see the number plate at any point?

419
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,400
No, unfortunately not. But…

420
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,840
That's a Peugeot 205.

421
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,000
And that particular one
is a Roland Garros edition. A rarity.

422
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,920
I have a thing for cars.

423
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,880
I looked into it,
and there's only one in the entire county.

424
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,720
It's registered to a Vanja Frick, 84.

425
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,560
-Eighty-four?
-Yes.

426
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,840
She has dementia and moved to a care home
six months ago. But…

427
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,160
She's registered to an address in Mora.

428
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,960
A flat where an internet contract
has been active the last two weeks.

429
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,000
Here is the address.

430
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,480
Bergsätravägen 3A in Mora.

431
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,960
Listen up! We have an address in Mora.

432
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,560
There's a high chance
both girls are there.

433
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,280
We leave in five.
You'll be briefed in the cars.

434
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,040
Jorun, you hold the fort here.

435
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,240
Come on!

436
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,400
That was nice.

437
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,560
Yes, it was.

438
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,360
So where is the cabin you're renting?

439
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,280
It's up near Åsarna.

440
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,240
-Right.
-A lovely 18th-century wooden cabin.

441
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,120
Right by the river. It's beautiful.

442
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,800
Want to see it?
Or do you have to get back?

443
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,240
Oops.

444
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,600
There.

445
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,920
Watch your step.

446
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,920
It's beautiful.

447
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,480
Isn't it?

448
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,760
I could easily live here.

449
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,640
We have beans, tuna.

450
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,280
We have…

451
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,120
instant coffee on offer.

452
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,840
No, wait. How about some warm soup?

453
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,320
Sounds nice.

454
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,240
Let's see. It's over here…

455
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,360
There. No, wait.

456
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,040
We can also offer a shot.

457
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,640
If you want.

458
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,400
What the hell.

459
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,360
Give me a shot. A small one.

460
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,280
Okay.

461
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,560
-There. Say when.
-A tiny one.

462
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,760
Less!

463
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,520
-Less. Like this.
-I want a bit more.

464
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,960
-Right. Cheers.
-Cheers.

465
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,520
Cosy.

466
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,960
Hey, when…

467
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,360
When you were locked up…

468
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,680
What did you do?
How did you pass the time?

469
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,080
I'm sorry. Maybe you don't… You don't…

470
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,040
-Let's talk about something else. Sorry.
-No, it's fine.

471
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,960
-Are you sure?
-Mm.

472
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,720
He would give me small tasks.

473
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,200
He could tell me to read to him,
from a book.

474
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,360
He always gave me something.

475
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,560
Chewing gum, sweeties, crayons.

476
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,600
I guess it was some kind of barter.

477
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,800
So he gave you like, small rewards?

478
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,280
-Yes, I did something and…
-Yeah.

479
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
Isn't that what he's doing now?

480
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,400
How do you mean?

481
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,360
I'm thinking about what you told me about
the clothes, the video, and the drawings.

482
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,400
Maybe it's for you.

483
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,680
You mean that he wants me
to do something for him now?

484
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,040
I have no fucking clue.

485
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,200
I just… It was just a thought.

486
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,120
Pour me another one.

487
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,440
-Sure?
-Yes! Pour me another one.

488
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,160
Okay.

489
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,320
Thank you.

490
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,200
So fucking gross.

491
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,040
Is it possible it's not him?

492
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,080
But someone else who wants to be like him?

493
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,160
A copycat?

494
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,040
I've read a bit about it and…

495
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,200
You know more than me,
but don't they want to imitate

496
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,840
but also put their own stamp on it,
somehow?

497
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,440
Yes, but mainly
they're suckers for attention.

498
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,920
If you can't kidnap or murder someone
with your own plan,

499
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,320
don't fucking do it.

500
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Right…

501
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,280
Sorry. I've got a dark sense of humour.

502
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,720
Oops.

503
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,920
I really need to get this.

504
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,680
Answer, it's okay.

505
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,080
I'm going to… Stay here.

506
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,000
-Sure?
-Yeah.

507
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,120
I'll be quick.

508
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,560
-Yes?
-Where are you?

509
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,520
At Martin's.

510
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,200
From the search party.

511
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,040
He's renting a place by Åsarna.

512
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,040
Did you hear another girl's gone missing?

513
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,200
Yes, I heard.

514
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,920
-They have an address.
-What?

515
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,040
Are they sure?

516
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,640
Seems like it.

517
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,760
They are on their way to Mora,
some flat there.

518
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,840
I'm still at the station, so you know.

519
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,400
-Okay. Call me when you know more.
-Sure.

520
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,520
-Bye.
-Bye.

521
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,720
Did something happen?

522
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,720
They know who it is.

523
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,840
Police! Show yourself!

524
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,560
Police!

525
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,800
-Clear!
-Clear!

526
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,720
Clear!

527
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,360
LEJLA HOMEWORK

528
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,640
"I'll KILL HIM"

529
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,200
YOU ARE PRECIOUS

530
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,640
Tomas!

531
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,080
Here.

532
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,680
Listen. The lady who owns the flat,
Vanja Frick…

533
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Her brother's grandson was sentenced to
forensic psychiatric care three years ago

534
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,800
following a failed kidnapping attempt
of an 11-year-old girl.

535
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
What the hell?

536
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,600
He was granted leave four weeks ago,

537
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,240
but has not been in touch
with his support person,

538
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,400
so Säter Hospital reported it.

539
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,440
What's his name?

540
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,000
Daniel Frick.

541
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,400
This is him.

542
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,680
39 years old.

543
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,000
Unlawful imprisonment, assault of a girl…

544
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,320
I've had a really nice time, but…

545
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,240
-I have to go now.
-Okay.

546
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,240
-I have to be with Valter.
-Yes, of course.

547
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,440
Did he say anything else?

548
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,320
No, just that they were going to…

549
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,280
Falun.

550
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,720
Can I have a glass of water?

551
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,440
Thank you.

552
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,240
Why Falun?

553
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,000
No, it was Mora. It was Mora.

554
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,200
Right.

555
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,720
I've had it since I was born.

556
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,800
Are you disgusted now?

557
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,440
It looks like a flower.

558
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,720
Yes, I guess it does.
