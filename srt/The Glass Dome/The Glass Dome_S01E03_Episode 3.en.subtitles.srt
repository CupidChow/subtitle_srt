1
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,880
Mummy's sweetheart.

2
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,200
It's cold. Why don't you come inside?

3
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,040
DEAR MUM

4
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,600
Hey. Come back!

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,920
I'm gonna kill you! Come back!

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,160
Take the letter!

7
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,480
THE GLASS DOME

8
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,320
Did you listen to the news?

9
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,200
-No.
-About the leak.

10
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
-What?
-Waste water is leaking from the mine.

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,080
That's why that goddamn alarm
sounded last night.

12
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,080
-What?
-The council has called a meeting.

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,400
We can't even drink
from our own damn well.

14
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,720
So that's that.

15
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,160
POTABLE WATER

16
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,920
Can't you just drive me home?

17
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,080
Tomas needs to go over something
with you first.

18
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,160
And we haven't finished at your house, so…

19
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,240
Yeah.

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
Wait here.

21
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,680
I'll get you some water.

22
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,440
Please take a seat.

23
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
-There you are.
-Thank you.

24
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,680
You're no longer a suspect.
You know that, right?

25
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
Yeah.

26
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,640
Your phone was in Stockholm
when Louise died, so…

27
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,760
Do you need any help
in terms of crisis support?

28
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,200
It's your right.

29
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,640
No, I'm fine.

30
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,040
Well…

31
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,520
And I guess an apology
for yesterday is in order.

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,760
It was… a mess.

33
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,120
The thing is that…

34
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,760
When you were in custody,

35
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,280
someone made contact about Alicia.

36
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,760
Made contact how?

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,280
He has sent an email with a video clip.

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
What kind of video clip?

39
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,600
-To Kristina. She seems unharmed.
-What clip?

40
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
What…

41
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,800
It was sent from an encrypted server.
We're trying to trace it, but…

42
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,520
Sweetheart.

43
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,680
This is a positive thing.

44
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,960
That the kidnapper makes contact
wanting to communicate.

45
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,040
It gives us more to go on.

46
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,280
Who the fuck is it?

47
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,000
Some fucker's got her!

48
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,800
Is he the one who killed Louise too?

49
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,360
Who the fuck is it? We have to find him!

50
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,080
Could someone have a personal motive
to harm you and your family?

51
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,360
Stop the mine.

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,760
Stop the mine.

53
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,960
POTABLE WATER

54
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,240
Here. Stop the mine.

55
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,720
Take the flyer.

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,200
Take it and read it.

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,840
Stop the mine.

58
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,040
We're on the right side, you and me.

59
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,520
Stop the mine. Take it.

60
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
What do you need
all that ass-paper for, Kjell?

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,120
You've sold yourself to the mine.
Why don't you wipe your ass with money?

62
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,000
Well said.

63
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,240
Vanadin, pure swine!

64
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,600
Vanadin, pure swine!

65
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,120
What are you saying?

66
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,320
She appeared to be asleep,
but might as well have been drugged.

67
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,320
At least she was alive.

68
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,760
And they've let Said go.

69
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,480
What the hell?

70
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,400
The search for the 10-year-old girl

71
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,680
who went missing in Granås
last Tuesday is cancelled.

72
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,520
What are they saying?

73
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,360
Wastewater contaminated with lead
has leaked from a nearby mine,

74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,520
and the authorities cannot guarantee
the safety of the search and rescue team…

75
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,160
They can't do that!

76
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,560
I'm sure it's just temporary.

77
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,960
And the police are continuing their work,
of course.

78
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,600
-Kristina…
-Yeah?

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,240
Why don't you let someone else do this?

80
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,800
Absolutely not.

81
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,480
This is my job.

82
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,760
It is possible that both the murder
and the kidnapping

83
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,360
are linked to the mine.

84
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,000
Both you and Kristina have received
a lot of harassment.

85
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,680
Especially after
the projecting of Norrtjärn.

86
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,800
We found Alicia's clothes
by one of the entrances to the mine.

87
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,280
The clip was sent at the same time
the alarm sounded last night.

88
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,560
It could be a coincidence, but…

89
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,720
Are you saying people opposed to the mine
have taken Alicia?

90
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,560
It's possible this is

91
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,360
an act of revenge or a blackmail attempt.

92
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,560
Hi.

93
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,160
Kristina was sent a video clip last night.

94
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,400
Okay?

95
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,600
Of Alicia, sleeping.

96
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,960
Right, then.

97
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
-Can you hear me?
-Yes.

98
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,040
I'm delighted so many of you are here.

99
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,080
We want to avoid misunderstandings
and speculation.

100
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,400
I have activated
the municipality's crisis management plan

101
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,040
and we have declared a state of readiness.

102
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,040
The county administrative board

103
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,480
is carrying out
thorough groundwater testing.

104
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,840
Groundwater?

105
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,200
-What are you saying?
-How long will it take?

106
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,160
Has the mine poisoned the groundwater?

107
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,040
No, we don't know
exactly what's happened yet.

108
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,640
What if you've already used the water?
We have been drinking…

109
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,280
What about fishing tourism? The fish in…

110
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,520
Should we discard
everything baked in the bakery?

111
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,960
Anything to bear in mind
if you're pregnant?

112
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,080
Will we get sick?

113
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,520
I fully understand
and respect your concerns.

114
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,400
-But please be reasonable and listen.
-We have to be able to shower!

115
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,480
We're fucking done
listening to you, Kristina!

116
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,960
-Yes!
-Well said, Tage.

117
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,320
We've warned you about the risks
of the mine for a long time now.

118
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,080
You're putting
the mining industries' profits

119
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,720
before our lives
and the lives of our children!

120
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,480
-Yes!
-That's right.

121
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,280
Is anyone from Svea Vanadin present?

122
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,640
-Not one fucker!
-They're too afraid.

123
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,920
No one!

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,400
This meeting was summoned by the council.

125
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,520
Why don't you answer the question?

126
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,240
Where is Vanadin?

127
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,960
Huh? Only one guy is jailed for murder
and kidnapping, right?

128
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,600
-And the rest? They could've sent someone.
-That's enough.

129
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,600
You're not the only people here.

130
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,640
And we want to hear
what Kristina has to say.

131
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,560
You're not in charge anymore.

132
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,440
Hold your tongue.

133
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,600
And you, Tage. Point as much as you like.

134
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,120
Turn that finger on your son
and look yourself in the mirror.

135
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,960
You are the bloody same.

136
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080
Grow up, both of you!

137
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,120
Nobody wanted this.

138
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,840
Upon consultation with Svea Vanadin,

139
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,400
this morning we made the decision

140
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,040
to cease all mining operations
until further notice.

141
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
-Yes!
-Finally!

142
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,520
Great!

143
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
-Finally.
-Great!

144
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,440
The people here
who have been harassing us, they're trash.

145
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,880
Closet Nazis who egg cars
and do Nazi salutes on Snapchat.

146
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,080
They don't know
how to use an encrypted server.

147
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,280
Does Tomas really know what he's doing?

148
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,000
-What did he say about the video?
-That it's good they're making contact.

149
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,040
Is it? Or is he just saying that
to calm me down?

150
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,200
No, it's good.

151
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,720
So…

152
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,280
How common is it
for people who take children…

153
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,080
to violate them…

154
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,840
sexually?

155
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,800
It depends if the motive
is of a sexual nature.

156
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,040
How do you know?

157
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,040
If that were the case,
he would never have made contact.

158
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,960
-What is it?
-No, it's…

159
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,880
-What?
-Just…

160
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,440
Very mature.

161
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,520
Want one?

162
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,000
Do you believe anti-mine people
have taken Alicia?

163
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,880
I don't know.

164
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,800
If it is,
there will be demands or threats.

165
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,000
The man who took you as a child,

166
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
did he touch you?

167
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,480
I never even saw him.

168
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
-What did he want?
-I don't know.

169
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,680
Are you cool
with not knowing what he wanted?

170
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,440
Not knowing anything?

171
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,440
How can you let it go?

172
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,360
When I find the person who did this…

173
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,640
I'll kill him.

174
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,440
Mum!

175
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
It's cold.

176
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,320
Help me!

177
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,760
Are you working?

178
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,120
Yes.

179
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,680
You just left.

180
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,280
What…

181
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,640
I want us to start talking
about the funeral.

182
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,200
Yes, but not right now.

183
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,560
-So when?
-I don't know.

184
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,400
-We have to decide…
-Not now, please!

185
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,680
-Said, I'm just saying…
-I've been locked up for 48 hours.

186
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,120
I haven't slept, I haven't eaten.

187
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,680
Someone's taken my child.

188
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,840
I'm going fucking mad.

189
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,840
Okay?

190
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,400
I don't want to discuss my wife's funeral.

191
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,080
Do you understand?

192
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,720
Can you respect that?

193
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,200
She's my daughter,
and it's my grandchild who's missing.

194
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,360
Remember that.

195
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,320
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,880
It's madness
that we can't keep searching for the girl.

197
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,200
Everyone knows the first days are crucial.

198
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,480
I dreamed about Mum last night.

199
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,040
The first time for years.

200
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,240
Who told me that she had killed herself?

201
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,240
I did.

202
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,200
Why do you ask?

203
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,640
I don't know. I just couldn't remember.

204
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
It was just after you were found.

205
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,320
You wanted your mum to come pick you up.

206
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,760
But she didn't.

207
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,120
That made you very angry, so…

208
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,200
we had to tell you.

209
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,960
It's so weird I can't remember.

210
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,440
It's not that strange.

211
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,720
You of all people know
you can suffer memory loss after trauma.

212
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,680
Yes, I know.

213
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,280
It's just that
half my life has been erased

214
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,480
'cause I don't function the way I should.

215
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
There's nothing wrong with you.

216
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,280
Yes, there is.

217
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,360
Do you have the interviews?

218
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,840
With your mum?

219
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,640
They should be here somewhere.

220
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,320
But they were conducted
by the Stockholm police, because…

221
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,920
I want to read them.

222
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,920
Sure.

223
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,160
"Delić"…

224
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,720
"Delić, Milena".

225
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,080
-Here.
-Thanks.

226
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,400
MILENA PLEADS:
LET MY DAUGHTER COME HOME

227
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,320
Do you mind if I look at this on my own?

228
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,880
Alone.

229
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,000
Right.

230
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,320
Okay. Sure. Of course.

231
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm right outside if you need anything.

232
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,360
MILENA DOESN'T GIVE UP HOPE

233
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,120
MISSING LEJLA'S MOTHER
DEMANDS ACTION FROM THE POLICE

234
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,960
MISSING LEJLA'S MOTHER FOUND DEAD

235
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,560
MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES
SEARCHING FOR RELATIVES

236
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,800
Mummy's darling.

237
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,960
Take the letter!

238
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,240
CRIME: SOMEBODY HAS TAKEN LEJLA
AGAINST HER WILL

239
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,200
Mum!

240
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,400
Mummy's sweetheart.

241
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,320
Come!

242
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,240
Come and let me hug you.

243
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,880
DO NOT CROSS

244
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,880
J.M. COETZEE
DISGRACE

245
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,000
TO LOUISE
YOU MAKE ME FEEL ALIVE - AND HORNY!

246
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,360
You are the police.

247
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,840
It's your job to find her.

248
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,120
-My only child.
-I understand it's difficult…

249
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,160
It's all I can think of.
I can't take it anymore.

250
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,360
-Try to calm down.
-Calm down?

251
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,680
How can I be calm?

252
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,520
Have you lost a child?

253
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,600
-Did someone take your daughter?
-No.

254
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,480
For fuck's sake…

255
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Get out.

256
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,800
Get out of here.

257
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,560
What's so damn hard to understand?

258
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
What do you want?

259
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,240
What's your fucking problem?

260
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,080
Get out of here. Go!

261
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Fucking wimps. What do you want?

262
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,720
I'll kill you.

263
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,000
Put that away.

264
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Out of the way.

265
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Shut down the mine and get lost!

266
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,040
No one wants you here.

267
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,080
Please, help me.

268
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,440
Don't just sit here.
I'm panicking. Go out and look.

269
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,760
What are you doing?

270
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,160
We are looking, and we will not stop.

271
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,880
But you're not finding her.

272
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,040
You have to search better. More!

273
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,200
We're doing everything we can.

274
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,680
I need her.

275
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,960
We are not giving up.

276
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,600
Don't attack me. I'm here to help.

277
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,600
You have to be patient.

278
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,920
Hello?

279
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,000
Only a few more steps.

280
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,120
Get the door.

281
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,360
-What's happened?
-Where is Tomas?

282
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,480
-In there, I think.
-Okay.

283
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,240
What on earth happened?

284
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,320
-How are you doing?
-I'm fine.

285
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,520
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

286
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,200
Did you know Louise was seeing someone?

287
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,720
They had a relationship.

288
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,120
-She didn't say anything to you?
-No.

289
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,600
You can come in now.

290
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,680
No!

291
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm sorry, Björn.

292
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
-Typical.
-I told you, didn't I?

293
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,600
I didn't mean to.

294
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,760
It doesn't matter. I shouldn't
have to tell you more than once.

295
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,200
Go to the break room.
This is Björn's table.

296
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,440
I said, go sit in the break room!

297
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
Come.

298
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,160
I have no one to watch her,
with the leak and everything.

299
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,000
Preschool is closed. It's chaos.

300
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,760
Can't Adde take her?

301
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,600
Hey.

302
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,800
Are you okay?

303
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,200
No… No, he can't.

304
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,800
I don't know where he is.

305
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,400
-What?
-I don't know where Adde is.

306
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,200
About a week ago he came home with money.

307
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,440
35,000 in an envelope.

308
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,920
He told me not to ask questions,
just enjoy the money.

309
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,960
He was so happy.

310
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,400
And we're going to build
a porch and stuff.

311
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,560
Mum told us this morning

312
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,480
the mining company
believe the leak to be sabotage.

313
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,480
And that there might be a connection
between the mine, Alicia and Louise.

314
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,080
And Adde just froze.

315
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,600
And after the council meeting
he just left.

316
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,640
Said he had to fix something with Jim.

317
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,440
And…

318
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,640
And Jim,

319
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,880
when I called he just laughed and hung up.

320
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,040
I can't reach Adde. He's not at home.

321
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,360
I have to be here
and manage the reception.

322
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,000
And take care of Isla.

323
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,600
-Where could he be?
-I don't know.

324
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,920
He and his dad have a hunting cabin.

325
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,320
Up by Bodarna.

326
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,880
Adde wouldn't hurt anyone, would he?

327
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,680
Turn around.

328
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,240
Thank you.

329
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,520
-How many were they?
-Four or five.

330
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,160
And you didn't recognise anyone?

331
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,000
No, but that guy…

332
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,600
-Tage's son.
-Jim?

333
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm pretty sure it was him,
but they were masked.

334
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,600
Did they say anything?

335
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,640
Something along the lines of,
"Get out of here. Close the mine."

336
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,240
They had a knife.

337
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,200
It's clearly aimed at your business.

338
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,800
Listen, I…

339
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,400
I found this.

340
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,040
It is…

341
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,080
It is… Louise seems to have
been involved with someone.

342
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,400
Any idea who it might be?

343
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,600
No, but I thought about
what you said, that it…

344
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,440
If someone has a personal reason
to want to hurt us.

345
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,160
It's great that you brought this in.

346
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,200
-Can I keep it?
-Yeah, sure.

347
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,080
The first thing we do now is bring in Jim.

348
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,760
Right.

349
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,440
Jorun, take Björn with you
and go up there.

350
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,680
Well, well. Looks like Jim
has something to do with this.

351
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,240
We'll see.

352
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,760
Could you take Isla
to our place for a bit?

353
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,360
Why?

354
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,080
We have something to do
and can't bring her.

355
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,040
Okay. And what's that?

356
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,600
Can you take her, or…?

357
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,800
Yeah, sure.

358
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,040
Are you coming home with me for a while?

359
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,480
-Are you done working for the day?
-Yes.

360
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,480
Let's go, then.

361
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,720
Right.

362
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,880
Hi, this is Adde. Send a text message…

363
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,520
Hello?

364
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,240
-Check the front, I'll go round back.
-Right.

365
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,920
This fucking place.

366
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,200
Hi.

367
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,000
What is it?

368
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,640
You need to come with us to the station.

369
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,160
-Come on.
-The boys in blue want me to come.

370
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,080
-What the fuck is it now?
-We'll talk about it there.

371
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,320
I'm busy. I'm telling the story about
when I killed a fat fucking boar.

372
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,080
With nothing but my knife!

373
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,080
-Knock it off.
-Enough!

374
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,320
Go in and get dressed.

375
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,280
Come on.

376
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,640
I want you to look at this video clip.

377
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,280
So what do I really think
about this Said guy?

378
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,720
I think it's time to send him back
to Mohammed country.

379
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,840
That's what I think!

380
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,760
Send him back in a body bag.

381
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,360
Good morning!

382
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,320
Good morning!

383
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,160
-Do you have reason to hurt Said?
-If I have…

384
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,640
He's poisoned the whole town.

385
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,080
But unlike him,
I'm a law-abiding Swedish citizen

386
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,720
waiting for the authorities
to do their job.

387
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,400
I'm asking because Said was assaulted.

388
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,160
I'm afraid I can't take credit for that.

389
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,480
What do you know about the mine sabotage?

390
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,640
Was the mine sabotaged?

391
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,680
How awful!

392
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,400
Cut it out, Jim.

393
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,040
You cut it out, for fuck's sake!
Why did you let the Arab go?

394
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,640
You'll find his daughter
as dead as his wife.

395
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,840
And then he'll kill the whole town
with his poison.

396
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,160
Maybe we should've talked
to Mum and Tomas.

397
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,120
You don't have to finish it
if you're full.

398
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,920
-When is Mummy coming?
-I'm sure she'll be here soon.

399
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,400
Do you want to draw?

400
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,360
Let's go to Lejla's room.
We might find some old pads and crayons.

401
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,280
Come on.

402
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,000
What is this place?

403
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,600
I know, I don't like it here.

404
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,800
I don't think he's here.

405
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,480
I'm sorry I dragged you up here.

406
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,480
Let's go back.

407
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,240
-I'll have a look around.
-Okay.

408
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,320
Adde, please open up if you're here.

409
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,680
Hello?

410
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,840
You're lying here?

411
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,800
-What?
-What have you done?

412
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,680
-I… I'm hiding.
-What?

413
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,480
Sit up.

414
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,440
I said, sit up!

415
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,280
What the fuck have you done?

416
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,040
What have you done?

417
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,840
Aino…

418
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,440
Look at me!

419
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,480
Look at me!

420
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,880
-What have you done?
-I wanted…

421
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,800
I just wanted the money.

422
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,120
I just wanted the money.

423
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,000
It was just a hole.

424
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,720
…in Granås to continue to avoid drinking
the water from taps and wells

425
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,680
citing the risk of poisoning identified

426
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,880
in connection with a leak
from the local Vanadin mine…

427
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,120
Yep…

428
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,600
Thank you.

429
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,880
There.

430
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Someone gave him 35,000
to make a hole in a pipe.

431
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,520
The only contact was via email.

432
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,640
The email Adrian received and the Alicia
video clip came from the same server.

433
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,040
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

434
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,000
I don't understand.

435
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,840
Did Adde take money
from the person who took Alicia?

436
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Excuse me.

437
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,560
Oh God…

438
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,680
It's encrypted,
so we don't have a lot to go on.

439
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,760
How do you want to proceed?

440
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Hi.

441
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,000
-Did something happen?
-Where is Isla?

442
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,320
In your room, drawing.

443
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,000
She might be asleep.
I haven't heard her for a while.

444
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,200
I'll go get her.

445
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,240
Can you help me get my shoes off?

446
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,440
What?

447
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,200
Right…

448
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Hello.

449
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,120
Hi.

450
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,240
It's cold in here.

451
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,640
-Where is Mummy?
-Downstairs.

452
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,240
-She's talking to Valter.
-Okay.

453
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,040
Do you enjoy drawing?

454
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,040
Yes, I do.

455
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,360
What are you drawing? What is it?

456
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,360
It's going to be like this one.

457
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,560
Who drew this?

458
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,000
-Did Valter draw it?
-No.

459
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,520
Who was it?

460
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,800
The man who climbed in through the window.

461
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,120
His name is Ecki.

462
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,240
He was really good at drawing.
