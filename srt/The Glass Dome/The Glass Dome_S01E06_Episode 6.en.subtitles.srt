1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,280
Valter, where are you?

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,600
I need to talk to you
about Tomas and your mum.

3
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,360
Hi.

4
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,200
Where's Valter?

5
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
I don't know.

6
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,360
Didn't he sleep here?

7
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,480
I guess he left.

8
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,440
To go where?

9
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,600
-He's not getting back to me.
-The police station? Home?

10
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
I have no idea.

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,960
You want a cup of tea?

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,120
I assume

13
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,680
Valter told you about yesterday.

14
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,240
Why did you stay at Daniela's campsite
in the spring of '01?

15
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,320
Mum's funeral.

16
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,760
I wasn't welcome at the farm.

17
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,880
Why not?

18
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
The old man.

19
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,880
He was the way he was.

20
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,760
And Mum was the way she was.

21
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
How was she?

22
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
A coward.

23
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,160
She shut her eyes and covered her ears
when Pop got started.

24
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,480
She's here.

25
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,080
Calm down. I just said she's here.

26
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,080
Apparently he slept here.

27
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,520
The st…

28
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,240
What about the station?

29
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,800
Look.

30
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,640
Why don't you call him?

31
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,160
Why did you want to talk about all that?

32
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,280
THE GLASS DOME

33
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,040
Hello?

34
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,000
You've reached Said Kamran
at Svea Vanadin.

35
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,600
Leave a message.

36
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,720
Hi.

37
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,680
I need to talk to you.

38
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,360
Call me when you get this.

39
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,000
I have Louise's phone.

40
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,200
Do not call Tomas or the police.

41
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,960
Bye.

42
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,440
We need to talk.

43
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
Hey?

44
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,800
Fuck!

45
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,640
Emergency services, what's happened?

46
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,520
Help me.

47
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,640
-You need help. What's happened?
-Send a patrol car to--

48
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,320
Hello?

49
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,960
Where are you calling from?

50
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,040
Can you hear me?

51
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,920
Are you there?

52
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
Hello?

53
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,640
Hello?

54
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,080
Here.

55
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,520
You have to eat.

56
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,680
Thanks.

57
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,240
Who called you earlier?

58
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,280
-What did she want?
-Don't know.

59
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,760
I'll check.

60
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,880
You have one new message.

61
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,800
I need to talk to you.

62
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,560
Call me when you get this.

63
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,680
I have Louise's phone.

64
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Do not call Tomas or the police.

65
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,480
Bye.

66
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,920
No.

67
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,240
No…!

68
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,840
No!

69
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,080
I watched over you when you were sleeping.

70
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,600
What?

71
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,680
Where are you?

72
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,600
Why?

73
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,720
Said just came in.
He wants to talk to you about something.

74
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,880
All right.

75
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,560
Now, Tomas.

76
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm on my way.

77
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,720
I don't want to be here any more.
I want Mummy and Daddy.

78
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,280
Don't be scared.

79
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,160
I'll get us out of here. Okay?

80
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,360
Are you cold?

81
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,320
Is that Mum's?

82
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,560
Alicia, do you know the code?

83
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,240
Yes. But why do you have it?

84
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,280
All right.

85
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,200
Very good.

86
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,640
Thank you.

87
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,400
Come on…

88
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,920
Valter Ness.

89
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,560
It's me. I'm captured.

90
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,240
I'm with Alicia. It's Tomas that…

91
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,400
Hello?

92
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
Hello?

93
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,840
Hi. I really need to ask you something.

94
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,440
Where is Jorun?

95
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,240
-In your office.
-Right.

96
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,120
Have you talked to Lejla?

97
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,360
Said received one hell
of a worrying message from her.

98
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,080
She said she has Louise's phone.

99
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,120
And that Said shouldn't talk to us.
Specifically not to you, Tomas.

100
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,960
And now I've found out
you and Louise had an affair.

101
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,360
Could you explain to me
what the fuck is going on?

102
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,320
We have to be able to talk to each other.

103
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,000
Whatever's happened.
I actually care about you.

104
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,080
For fuck's sake!

105
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,120
You know Valter is a policeman, right?

106
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,760
He knows lots of tricks to find people.

107
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,920
He can check the number we called from

108
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,080
and see on a map where we are.

109
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,440
Yes.

110
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
You know what?

111
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
When I was your age,

112
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,760
I was trapped in here too.

113
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,080
What?

114
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,200
Was it Valter who saved you?

115
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,960
Yes, it was, in a way.

116
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
Come here.

117
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,080
I understand you.

118
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,800
I understand you are

119
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,160
completely destroyed.

120
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,320
Coming back here must have brought back
so much stuff you haven't processed

121
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,640
from your childhood.

122
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,600
From your dad.

123
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,280
And your mum.

124
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,680
I'm not her.

125
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,120
I am your friend.

126
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,640
Right?

127
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,840
Do you remember?

128
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
We can stay friends on the outside.

129
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,280
I can help you.

130
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,280
I promise.

131
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,240
I can make the pain go away.

132
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,800
I can show you how.

133
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,800
Let Alicia go home.

134
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,160
Give it to me.

135
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,240
The phone.

136
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,160
Good.

137
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,960
Who did Lejla call with this?

138
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,880
You.

139
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,240
Only me?

140
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,160
-Come here.
-No.

141
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,880
You go sit in the corner.

142
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,240
The corner.

143
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,600
Good.

144
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,920
THE DWARF

145
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,240
Doesn't she look
like a butterfly in there?

146
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,360
A moth.

147
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,280
Lejla means "night".

148
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,600
Now you know.

149
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,040
Come on.

150
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,000
Take a seat here.

151
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,400
There.

152
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,040
Aren't you going to let Lejla out?

153
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,840
Your hair…

154
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,200
It's so nice.

155
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,720
Leave her alone. Please.

156
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,880
Don't be afraid, Alicia.

157
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
I'm here.

158
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,160
I want to go home now.

159
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,760
To Mummy?

160
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,240
Then we'll arrange that.

161
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,760
But we have to play a game first.

162
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,280
I give something to you,

163
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,640
and you give something to me.

164
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Sound fun?

165
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Do you know what I want from you?

166
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,800
A tuft of your hair.

167
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,840
Do you know who else likes hair a lot?

168
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,160
Trout.

169
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,720
I make tiny fishing flies from hair.

170
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,160
When I fish with them…

171
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,000
it just goes "snap",

172
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,480
and the fish bite right away.

173
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,520
But it has to be this kind of…

174
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,960
nice, long

175
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,200
girls' hair.

176
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,360
My old man's hair won't do.

177
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,080
There.

178
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,240
I need you to sit completely still.

179
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,800
I don't want to hurt you.

180
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,400
Can I finish the book?

181
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,600
Look.

182
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,640
So pretty.

183
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,000
Can I go to Mummy and Daddy now?

184
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,880
Soon.

185
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,200
Where are you going?

186
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,360
Come.

187
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,400
I want you to stand here, quiet and still,

188
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,760
while I'm away.

189
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,200
And no speaking to Lejla.

190
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,400
No speaking to Lejla.

191
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,240
Don't even look at her.

192
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,960
Don't look at Lejla.

193
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,160
You know what?

194
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,160
We can't trust Lejla.

195
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,760
We can't trust Lejla.

196
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,680
No.

197
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,920
Please.

198
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,240
Well, good morning.

199
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,200
You're up.

200
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,360
-Is Lejla back?
-Yes. She's resting.

201
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,160
I need to talk to her.

202
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,360
Tomas, she's not well.

203
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,080
-I really need to talk to her.
-What could possibly be so important?

204
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,120
I've kept Louise's phone at home.

205
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,160
I think she took it this morning.

206
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,600
I need to sort it out.

207
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,320
I just… make a mess of things.

208
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,800
I'm her dad.

209
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,880
I'll handle it.

210
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,600
Is the coffee fresh?

211
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,040
Valter is very, very sick.

212
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,600
He has done this before,
and it's not okay.

213
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,200
Valter is really good at lying.

214
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,640
He has lied to me
for many, many, many years.

215
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,080
And I believed him.

216
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,840
But we have to trust in each other.

217
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,240
Then we'll go straight home.

218
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,080
To Mum and Dad?

219
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,040
Yes.

220
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
-Do you see the lock?
-Yes.

221
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,400
Try 2-0-0-2.

222
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,480
Throw it away.

223
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,360
Deny ever having it.

224
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,800
Then it'll be over.

225
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm going to hand it in to Jorun.

226
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,400
Right… Go ahead.

227
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,520
That'll be the end of your career.

228
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,280
What did she say?

229
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,640
Nothing.

230
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,760
Maybe the best thing would be

231
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,480
to book a ticket for her

232
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,560
back to the US.

233
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,520
And get her away from here

234
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,760
as soon as possible.

235
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,640
Ask her to give me a call
when she feels better.

236
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,840
I will.

237
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Hurry!

238
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,920
It's not working!

239
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,400
It's not working.

240
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,240
Forget about the lock.

241
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,120
I want you to hide.

242
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,160
I'll try to lure him over.

243
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,000
When I do, I want you to sneak out,

244
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,600
lock the door from the outside,

245
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,120
and run as fast as you can.

246
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,600
Now!

247
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,960
Hide, Alicia! Hide now!

248
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,720
You have me. You can let her go.

249
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,080
Stand still,
and soon you'll be with your mum.

250
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,240
Let me keep her, then.

251
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,000
I don't want her here.

252
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,280
She's served her purpose.

253
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,280
Why are you doing this…

254
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,960
Dad?

255
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,480
You're the expert.

256
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,080
Yes!

257
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,840
There it is.

258
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,080
That fire.

259
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,440
In your eyes.

260
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,640
Mummy's sweetheart.

261
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,960
It's cold. Why don't you come inside?

262
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,520
No, Mummy. I'm warm.

263
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,240
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

264
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
The fire.

265
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,600
I saw it straight away.

266
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,400
You were different from the others.

267
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,320
Remember what you promised.

268
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,640
You fascinated me.

269
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,920
In a way I had never experienced before.

270
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,920
Hello? Mum?

271
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,960
When you saw your chance to escape,

272
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
you took it.

273
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Of course.

274
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,160
That's who you are.

275
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
Yes…

276
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,800
And then you became mine.

277
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,160
For real.

278
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,880
You got a dad

279
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,480
who took care of you
in the best possible way.

280
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,080
No one can take that away from me.

281
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,120
When I had you, I needed nothing else.

282
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
And here we are.

283
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,200
Again.

284
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,640
You are mine, Lejla.

285
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
It's you and me.

286
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,880
Forever.

287
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,800
This time I can't let you go.

288
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,080
But you understand that.

289
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,080
Alicia, come here.

290
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,760
Jorun, send backup to Valter's farm.

291
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,880
Leave her alone, please.

292
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,120
I'm begging you.

293
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,720
You sound just like your mum.

294
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,400
And Louise.

295
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Difficult.

296
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,240
Right, then.

297
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,560
No!

298
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,080
No!

299
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,080
No!

300
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,920
Leave her alone!

301
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,040
No!

302
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,520
No!

303
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,480
No!

304
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,960
Leave her alone!

305
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,320
Leave her alone!

306
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,360
Stop it!

307
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,320
What the hell have you done?

308
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,240
Well…

309
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,480
Mummy's little girl.

310
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,360
Valter, what the hell?

311
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,600
You need to help me.

312
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Stop.

313
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,840
Shoot me.

314
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
Here.

315
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,640
No. Valter…

316
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
Good.

317
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,320
Hold your aim right there.

318
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,640
And squeeze the trigger,
slowly and carefully,

319
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,040
and everything will be all right.

320
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,040
No! Valter…

321
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,040
You know I love you.

322
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,160
Sweetie. Daddy's sweetie.

323
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,760
My dearest…

324
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,080
Through this checkpoint.

325
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,280
Bag.

326
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,480
I want you to tell me where the girls are.

327
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,160
They deserve to come home.

328
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,400
You know…

329
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,200
It doesn't matter which one of us
is behind the glass.

330
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,560
You'll always be

331
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,560
in here.

332
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,320
And I'll always be…

333
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,320
Remember when you fell into the river?

334
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,120
You were terrified it would take you.

335
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,160
Our favourite spot.

336
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,520
Our river.

337
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,920
My river.
