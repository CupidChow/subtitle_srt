Are you stupid?

177
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,910
She knows what we look like.

178
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,030
So what do you think we should do?

179
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,060
What should we do?

180
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,670
It's hard to escape anyway.

181
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,260
How about doing something to her first?

182
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,910
I'm on board.

183
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,380
There's no one here.

184
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,260
Little girl.

185
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,020
Don't struggle.

186
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,590
Someone! There are perverts here!

187
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,830
[Love the smooth feel]

188
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,310
[Love the smooth feel]

189
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,340
Are you okay?

190
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,340
Catch her up!

191
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,380
Run!

192
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,910
Wait, I'm in a novel.

193
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,580
Last time, I could fight two people.

194
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,990
Why should I be afraid of these two idiots?

195
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,620
Why do you stop?

196
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,060
No!

197
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,630
Get up.

198
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,460
Let go of me!

199
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:11,860
Move!

200
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,500
Stop it.

201
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,030
Get in.

202
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,140
It's him.

203
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:24,540
Behave yourself.

204
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,460
Why is it you?

205
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,940
Who else could it be?

206
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,980
Keep an eye on her.

207
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,260
It's you, so what?

208
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,500
One against one.

209
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,380
How can you beat us?

210
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,060
I'm not here to fight you.

211
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,780
I'm here to join you.

212
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,300
Join us?

213
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,220
Do we know you?

214
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,460
Think about it.

215
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,980
It's only good for me

216
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,260
if you kidnap Ye Wange.

217
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,620
If she disappears,

218
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,660
Ye's shares will be mine.

219
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,430
You two can

220
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,540
[Love the smooth feel]

221
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,790
have a share too.

222
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,270
Why not?

223
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,540
Besides,

224
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,190
ask around about her reputation.

225
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,180
Why should I save her?

226
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,020
Right?

227
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,100
I see, Feng Muchen.

228
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,220
I can't believe you.

229
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,340
Buddy, let go of me.

230
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,780
[Love the smooth feel]

231
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,850
I knew you had no good intentions to marry me.

232
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,780
I was blind to marrying you.

233
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,700
I'm blind to marrying you.

234
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,500
I'm blind.

235
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,460
Yes, you're blind.

236
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,140
Yes, I'm blind.

237
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,100
You're blind. You're blind.

238
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,940
Yes, you're blind.

239
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,770
It's you who's blind.

240
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,220
I'm blind, I'm blind.

241
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,860
What are you arguing about?

242
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,940
Fatty, shut up.

243
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,500
Why is she so mean to me?

244
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,180
That's right.

245
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,810
You're my husband.

246
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,900
But you don't care about your wife's life.

247
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,940
You came here in a hurry

248
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,500
just to watch the fun.

249
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,540
Divorce! I call for a divorce!

250
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,220
I'm going to the Civil Affairs Bureau right now.

251
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,740
Get out of the way!

252
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,260
She wants to divorce me.

253
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,780
Buddy, reason it out.

254
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,460
You have a family too.

255
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,260
You have a wife too.

256
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,100
Have you ever seen such a vulgar woman?

257
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,220
Absolutely not.

258
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,810
That's right.

259
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,340
Only a man can understand

260
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,530
a man's suffering.

261
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,180
A man must have dignity, not like this.

262
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,940
I'll reason with her.

263
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,370
Reason with her.

264
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,450
Find the dignity of a man.

265
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,100
Go!

266
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,380
Ye Wange.

267
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,260
Do you have a woman?

268
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,570
Yes.

269
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,250
Is your woman like this?

270
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:14,740
No.

271
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,700
Your woman is not like this.

272
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,860
My woman is not like this either.

273
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,010
Whose women are like this?

274
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,850
Wait a minute.

275
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,660
Are they going to run away?

276
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,610
After them!

277
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,740
Ye, I knew you'd come.

278
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,210
You guys go first.

279
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,140
I'll take care of this.

280
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,940
Okay.

281
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,970
Who are you?

282
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,140
Who are you?

283
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,620
Who do you care?

284
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,610
That's strange.

285
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,620
I sent my location to Chen Ye only.

286
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,410
Why did Feng Muchen come first?

287
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,940
Could he be

288
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,460
the real male lead?

289
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,660
Male lead? What do you mean?

290
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,980
I mean, you've been carrying me for so long.

291
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,890
You must be tired.

292
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,369
Why don't I get down and walk by myself?

293
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,290
Your leg is already hurt like this.

294
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,339
And you're not even wearing shoes.

295
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,579
Don't be stubborn.

296
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,170
I've always been like this.

297
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,490
I'm here now.

298
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,050
I'm carrying you now.

299
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,580
Don't think so much about it.

300
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,330
Li Yunsheng has crossed the line.

301
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,610
How dare he retaliate against me?

302
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,730
I have to call the police.

303
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,370
I want to call the police.

304
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:38,890
I want to…

305
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,380
You're so careless.

306
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,130
You're already hurt.

307
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,300
Don't hurt yourself again.

308
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,610
What should I do?

309
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,420
Do I have to put up with it?

310
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,570
You don't.

311
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,050
I'm here.

312
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,620
I'm going to fall.

313
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,020
The phone is ringing.

314
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,330
Can you take it for me?

315
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,010
Answer it?

316
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,700
It's Yun Yi.

317
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,610
Answer it.

318
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,940
I'm going to fall.

319
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,090
Boss, Chen Ye gave them to me.

320
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,580
[I shouldn't do anything to the boss's woman]

321
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,210
Miss Ye,

322
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,650
what do you think should we do next?

323
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,650
Miss Ye, we're wrong.

324
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,410
It's our fault.

325
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,290
Li Yunsheng told us to do it.

326
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,140
We had nothing to do with it.

327
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,730
Yes, yes.

328
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,090
Miss Ye, we had nothing to do with it.

329
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,770
He and your mother even know each other.

330
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,850
He was going to work with your mother on a project.

331
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,890
But your mother left all of a sudden.

332
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,330
You're not worthy to mention my mother.

333
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,450
Yes, Miss Ye.

334
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,450
We're not worthy.

335
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,250
If you can spare us,

336
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,410
I'll do whatever you want.

337
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,290
No, no, no.

338
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,050
Yun Yi, give the evidence of their and Li Yunsheng's crime

339
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,370
to the police.

340
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,410
Okay.

341
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,890
It's a great pleasure.

342
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,660
Thank you for coming to my rescue

343
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,970
and taking out my anger.

344
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,490
I didn't come here to save you.

345
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,050
I did it for your Ye's stock.

346
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,090
I'm going to fall.

347
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,730

It's good. It doesn't smell that bad.
