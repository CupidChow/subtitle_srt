What happened just now?

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,170
Something is wrong with the system.

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,410
How did he know I hate yolk?

7
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,260
This is so unusual.

8
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,610
What?

9
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,440
Do you feel the special treat from your husband?

10
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,370
You know I hate yolk?

11
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,820
Of course.

12
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,890
I know you look better without glasses.

13
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,340
How did he know I wore glasses before?

14
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,130
You didn't go to the party yesterday.

15
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,329
You just came back?

16
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,610
Yes.

17
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,890
Doesn't that affect your business?

18
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,810
Between the business and the beauty,

19
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,170
of course I choose you.

20
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,570
What's on your neck?

21
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,190
I've never seen it before.

22
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,450
This is

23
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,320
a happiness switch necklace.

24
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,710
It can switch to happiness every day.

25
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,020
Something's wrong. Something's wrong with you.

What's wrong with me?

27

I don't know you well,

28
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,570
but you suddenly know

29
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,770
many of my habits.

30
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,330
This is weird.

No, it's not.

32
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,090
I know many of your habits

33
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,570
because I care about you.

34
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,850
You don't know mine

35
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,600
because you don't care about me.

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,850
I care about you very much.

37
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,930
And you are very cold to me.

38
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,210
Am I cold?

39
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,570
You're ice cold.

40

Just kidding.

Yesterday, it was Yun Yi.

42
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:34,600
He broke the tire.

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,250
So we had no choice but to come back.

44
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,250
No, boss.

45
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,410
Yes, it's my fault. I was wrong.

Do you mean it, boss?

51
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,800
They are all your treasures.

52
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,120
I only have one treasure.

why didn't I know about the media interview?

What?

81

Balancing family and career

82
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,159

What is it this time?

99
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,770
I found this on the ground.

100

I thought it was a brooch.

101

After I checked it carefully,

102
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,130
I found it has a recording function.

Do you want to listen?

104

Isn't this the brooch my grandpa gave me?

105
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,330
Give it to me.

107

Boring.

Mom, why are you here?

109
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,200
I think it was

110
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,400
the one who knocked me out in front of the bar.

111
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,000
She said she'll give me a lot of money when it's done.

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,370
You don't have to serve her anymore.

113
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,160
You don't have to do this.

114

Miss, I'll pay with my life in the next life.

is Shen Lingzhu's loyal follower.

117
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,480
Shen Lingzhu,

118
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,320
you pretend to be innocent in front of me

119
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,960
and ask people to hurt me behind my back.

120
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,840
No, I won't let her go.

121
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,560
Wait.

122
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,960
Your dad is not home during the day.

123
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,290
No one will support you.

124
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,600
Besides, with Shen Lingzhu's capability,

125
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,200
she can't manipulate the whole situation.

126
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,800
That makes sense.

127
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,640
I think someone else is behind this.

128
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Feng Muchen has been acting weird these days.

129
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,360
There must be something wrong with him.

130
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,000
You've been taking care of me lately.

131

Your attitude has taken a dramatic turn.

132

I think you are

133

the one behind this.

Although this is a little ridiculous,

135
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,960
I shouldn't

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,880
exclude Feng Muchen.

137

Feng Muchen, you bastard.

142
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,920
It's a smoke alarm.

144
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,960

I found that

152
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,200
it was Shen Lingzhu who

153
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,870
ordered Ms. Chen's son to make you fall in the lake.

Mr. Jackson is too mysterious.

159
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,590
The information is limited.

160
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,510
We need more time to investigate.

have to do with Shen Lingzhu?

164

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,579
Ge, I'm doing this for your own good.

349
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,410
You don't want to let me go.

350
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,540
What do you mean?

351
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,460
Besides, Feng Muchen is the son-in-law of the Ye family.

352
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,540
He came to our house for dinner

353
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,810
and you didn't prepare the bowl and chopsticks for him.

354
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,450
Who do you think he is?

355
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,690
Ge, what do you mean?

356
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:31,730
Ge, what do you mean?

357
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,890
I want to ask what you mean.

358
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,250
Mom, why are you here?

359
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,970
She asked you to do this.

360
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,610
She said she'll give me a lot of money when it's done.

361
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,490
You don't have to serve her anymore.

362
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,410
We don't have to live in fear.

363
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,290
It sounds like Ms. Chen.

364
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,900
Didn't she go home?

365
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,660
What is this?

366
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,370
Aunt Zhu, you recognized it so quickly?

367
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,090
You seem to know it well.

368
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,580
Are you behind this?

369
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,570
I don't know what you're talking about.

370
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,730
What is it?

371
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,810
Calm down.

372
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,740
There's something more exciting.

373
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,370
Dad,

374
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,650
it wasn't an accident that I fell into the water.

375
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,050
It was this old witch's fault.

376
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,130
What's going on?

377
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,290
Honey, it's obvious that Ms. Chen framed me.

378
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,890
She wanted to blackmail me.

379
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,050
Ms. Chen has worked for you for many years.

380
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,780
Where is she?

381
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:24,810
She...

382
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,730
She said she was going back to her hometown.

383
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,930
So I let her go.

384
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,450
Besides, Ge,

385
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,410
where did you get the recording?

386
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,540
You can't accuse me without evidence.

387
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,170
Ge used to wear this brooch a lot.

388
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,010
No one knows it has a recording function.

389
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,290
She happened to wear it that day

390
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,850
and recorded what the murderer said.

391
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,780
Dad, do you want me to play it again?

392
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,240
Honey.

393
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,250
They must hold a grudge

394
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,250
because their cooperation failed.

395
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,720
Anyone can record this kind of thing.

396
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,050
You can't believe their false testimony.

397
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,130
Besides, don't slander me.

398
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,590
Do you have evidence? Do you have witnesses?

399
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,440
Will we bring the witness to you

400
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,370
rather than to the police?

401
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,650
People say it's hard to be a stepmother.

402
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,850
It's harder for me to be your stepmother.

403
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,890
I thought this family will be peaceful

404
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,050
after you got married.

405
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,730
You ganged up to set me up with outsiders.

406
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,720
My poor baby.

407
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,050
Are you going to send me and my baby

408
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,930
to prison?

409
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,970
You said baby?

410
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,360
I know

411
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,090
you've always wanted

412
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,810
your own son.

413
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,840
I have a son.

414
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,160
Great! Great!

415
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,330
Ge,

416
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,210
I think

417
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,280
you shouldn't make a big deal out of it.

418
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,250
I'll find someone to investigate it.

419
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,160
But dad, I...

420
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,360
All right, about this...

421
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,370
My belly hurts.

422
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,760
Okay. Have a rest.

423
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,770
That's all for now.

424
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,770
As for Muchen, I'll find a chance

425
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,930
to start the cooperation with the Ye's Group for you.

426
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,720
It's late. Go back after dinner.

427
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,730
Go back to bed and lie down.

428
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,130
The most important thing is to keep the baby safe.

429
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,480
What's going on?

430
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,170
I didn't expect her to save her ultimate move.

431
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm so angry.

432
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,160
That old witch held it back.

433
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,880
Let's call the police.

434
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,200
Good idea.

435
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,810
Let them investigate Ms. Chen and her son first.

436
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,130
But Shen Lingzhu is a little difficult to deal with.

437
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,930
It's all because of my silly dad.

438
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,730
He always wants to have a son.

439
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,050
This is great.

440
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,280
I can't touch the old witch.

441
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,570

443
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,820
I will find out what happened.

519
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,730
Boss, everything is ready.

520
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,910
Okay, go ahead.

521
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,070
Feng Muchen.

522
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,910
You're giving me a surprise early in the morning.

523
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,240
Did you do something wrong?

524
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,080
No.

525
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,910
Why do I have a bad feeling?

526
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,160
Stop.

527
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,030
Don't take it off.

528
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,270
Are they cute?

529
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,470
Yes.

530
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,270
But...

531
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,680
That's it?

532
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,560
Of course not.

533
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,360
Close your eyes.

534
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,600
There's a bigger surprise.

535
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,390
Don't open your eyes.

536
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,200
Three, two, one.

537
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,270
Feng Muchen, al...

538
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,870
Alpaca.

539
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,030
So cute.

540
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,270
So cute.

541
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,790
Whose are they?

542
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,150
They are yours.

543
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,990
Mine?

544
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,870
I have alpacas.

545
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,230
Honey.

546
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,090
Check this out.

547
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,510
I didn't know

548
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,870
you're so sweet.

549
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,940
You prepared such a delicate bowknot for it.

550
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,830
Of course.

551
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,030
After all, I'm their dad from now on.

552
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,630
You are their mom.

553
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,550
Right?

554
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,600
It ignores me.

555
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,150
Look, even the alpaca thinks you're talking nonsense.

556
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,270
They don't want to talk to you.

557
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,510
That's because they're new here

558
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,150
and haven't adapted to this place yet.

559
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,550
Let's name them.

560
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:20,990
Okay.

561
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,070
I think this silly one

562
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,230
looks like you.

563
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,630
It's reserved and beautiful.

564
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,830
Let's call it Meihan.

565
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,590
This one doesn't look smart.

566
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,740
Let's call it Yunze.

567
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,750
Okay.

568
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,430
Since we have two new members,

569
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,470
you should spend more time with them.

570
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,950
You think I don't know what you did?

571
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,860
I put it there.

572
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,310
I'm leaving. Bye.

573
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,510
Good night.

574
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,590
Good night.

575
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,590
You want to play tricks with me?

576
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,330
You're not qualified.

577
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,150
[Love life and free yourself.]

578
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,270
[Applied successfully]

579
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:02,990
Done.

580
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,190
Yes.

581
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,640
But I'm not free today.

582
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,310
I'm going to the summer camp.

583
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,990
If you can't go to the summer camp,

584
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,870
will you feel sad?

585
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,910
Are you hiding something from me?

586
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,060
No, I'm not.

587
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,380
Fine, I'll be honest with you.

588
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,660
I don't want you to go to the summer camp

589
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,950
I don't want you to be in danger.

590
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,750
So I secretly

591
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,830
canceled your application.

592
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,430
I'm sorry.

593
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,190
Feng Muchen, you've gone too far.

594
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,380
I'm just worried that you might be in danger.

595
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,640
So I don't want you to take the risk to go to that summer camp.

596
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,370
I think what you said makes sense.

597
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,620
I should stay and spend more time with them.

598
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,110
I'm not going.

599
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,670
Really?

600
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,710
Yes

601
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,740
Ms. Zhang, go get some vegetables and fruits

602
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,870
to feed the alpacas.

603
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,020
Take care of the alpacas

604
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,500
and Ge.

605
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,220
Then

606
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,380
play with the alpacas at home.

607
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,550
Don't worry.

608
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,030
I'll get back to work.
