00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,980
Ge.

345
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,730
I'll be able to take you back tomorrow.

346
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,200
You won't blame me for not telling you, will you?

347
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,710
The most important thing between people

348
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,110
is mutual trust, right?

349
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,740
Do you trust me?

350
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,010
Of course I do.

351
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,390
This is my first time

352
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,230
and the only time I've kept something from Miss.

353
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,590
Will she forgive me?

354
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,620
Don't worry.

355
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,440
She'll definitely forgive you.

356
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,590
She won't blame you.

357
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,190
Besides, it's a small thing.

358
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,850
A small thing?

I've seen it.

There's nothing wrong with it.

How's it going?

365
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,740
Yes, I'll try my best.

366
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,480
The light of love.

367
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,900
If you have any questions, feel free to tell me.

368
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,230
This feels like

369
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,080
a happy ending.

[Ye's]

This is beautiful.

Are you okay?

373
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,000
Has this been your taste lately?

374
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,860
Yin

375
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,380
watched it for 15 seconds.

376
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,600
I recorded it.

377
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,590
Ge.

378
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,210
I'm sorry about what happened several days ago. I misbehaved.

379
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,410
I can't believe the heroine has come to talk to me.

380
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,570
So the finale is really coming.

381
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,390
It's okay.

382
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,780
You're still so dignified and elegant.

383
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,080
Thank you and Feng Muchen for taking me home.

384
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,390
You're welcome.

385
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,000
We're sisters.

386
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,070
We're supposed to help each other.

387
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,270
You're right.

388
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,460
Girls should help girls.

389
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,340
Miss Lu.

Please come over.

391
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,300
Such a perfect person

392
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,740
only exists in novels.

393
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,590
Okay, you can go first.

394
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,410
Sister.

395
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,300
I have a problem now.

Only you can help me.

I'll do my best.

398
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,390
Isn't this the wedding dress for the finale?

399
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,450
Why does it look a bit strange today?

400
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,310
Something went wrong when the model tried it on.

401
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,580
But I just fixed it.

402
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,770
It's just...

403
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,620
It's just that the size has become smaller.

404
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,480
The original model couldn't fit.

405
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,200
Do you want me to wear this wedding dress

406
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,150
for the finale?

407

This show is very important to me.

Ge.

410
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,330
I know you're not used to

411
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,210
appearing in front of the public.

412
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,900
So don't force yourself.

No, it's for the greater good.

I asked you to marry me

not because I'm lonely.

455

And it's not because I'm used to it.

456

I love how you like to pretend to be weak

I love that you only take five minutes to wash your hair.

But it takes two hours to decide whether to wash it or not.
