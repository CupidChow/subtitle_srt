00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,789
Where is Ge?

5
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,509
She's at the beach.

6
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,620
Hold this for me.

7
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,530
Ge, come back.

8
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,260
Feng Muchen.

9
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,330
Look.

10
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,700
Ge.

11
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,130
Why did you go surfing alone?

12
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,850
And you went so far into the sea.

13
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,450
I ran into Chen Yuanyuan this morning, and she was going surfing.

14
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,350
It occurred to me that you told me to be brave.

15
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,650
So where's Chen Yuanyuan?

16
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,250
Why were you alone in the sea?

17
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,450
I don't know.

18
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,290
But it's not her fault.

19
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,010
I asked her to bring me along.

20
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,930
I've told you many times that it's dangerous at the beach.

21
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,610
I came here to protect you.

22
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,030
And what happened?

23
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,810
If I hadn't arrived in time,

24
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,210
something would have happened to you, right?

25
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,770
Alright. Enough.

26
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,490
I got it.

27
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,420
Drink the water.

28
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,740
So disobedient.

29
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,170
Darn it.

30
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,010
There's really no mosaic anymore.

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
What's wrong?

32
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,370
Why are you giggling?

33
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
You're drooling.

34
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,010
Am I?

35
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,260
I'm hungry.

36
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,240
I'll take you to dinner then.

37
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,430
What do you want to eat?

38
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,200
I haven't decided yet.

39
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,710
Go pick up the ball.

42
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,650
I'm fixing the motorcycle.

43
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,680
Teach us.

44
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,400
Teach us how to ride.

45
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,290
Come on, handsome.

46
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,570
Come on, don't be shy.

Get on. Hurry up.

Hurry up.

50
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,050
Sit tight.

51
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,140
Where did he go?

52
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,800
Find someone else please.

53
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,930
Put your hands here.

54
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,920
I really can't.

55
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,490
How should I ride it?

56
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,409
I'm really not good at it.

57
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,770
Turn this.

58
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,159
Just teach us, handsome.

59
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,920
You're quite handsome.

60
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,330
I really don't know how to ride it.

61
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,990

62

Come to me.

63

Teach us how to ride.

67
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,160
Why?

68
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,170

thank you for that.

No need.

73
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,840
Take it. Nice.

Are you okay?

77
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,409
I'm alright.

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,360
Then get off.

79
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,290
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,000
It's okay.

81
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,170
Zou Chengji,

82
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,640
don't you know how to say no?

83
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:48,320
You didn't want to teach them how to ride a motorcycle,

84
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,090
but you still tried to teach them no matter what.

85
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,150
Then, when I waved,

86
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,200
you got on my motorcycle without a word.

87
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,880
No.

88
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,000
No?

89
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,160
So you were willing to teach them?

90
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,640
No.

91
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,440
I taught them how to ride

92
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,400
because I didn't know how to say no.

93
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,600
But I got on your motorcycle because...

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,530
Because of what?

95
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,780
Because...

96
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,640
Because you're my friend.

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,360
Friend?

98
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,920
Actually, when I saw you the first time

99
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,270
at the bar,

100
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,200
I thought you were extraordinary.

101
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,480
Although it was because I thought

102
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,080
you look like one of my idols,

103
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,280
after spending time with you at the summer camp,

104
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,040
I find you very forthright and sincere.

105
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,560
So...

106
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,390
So I've taken you

107
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,960
as my friend.

108
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,510
It's not wrong.

109
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
But

110
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,850
I think you should still have your character.

111
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,560
At first,

112
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,920
you were urged to go to the bar, right?

113
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,980
And those two girls

114
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,490
were obviously taking advantage of you.

115
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,690
But you still didn't know how to say no.

116
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,790
But I think

117
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,300
since they are my friends,

118
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm happy as long as they're happy.

119
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,200
Maybe everyone has a different way of treating their friends.

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,240
I think I'm comfortable with my way.

121
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,280
I see.

122
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,160
So you are the "server" type they talk about.

123
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,150
What are you waiting for?

124
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,680
Get on.

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,110
Time flies.

126
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,080
The camp closing ceremony is around the corner.

127
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,720

128
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,980

[HAPPY LUCKY]

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,470
But since the budget is limited,

131
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,630
you need to go buy the ingredients yourselves

132
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,430
and cook the dinner yourselves.

133
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,520
You also need to clean up after that.

134
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,110
The money

135
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,320
will be transferred to your account soon.

136
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,980
Dismissed.

137
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,040
Is the budget really so limited?

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,160
I don't mind the living condition,

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,090
but we can't have good food either.

140
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,610
I'm already used to it.

141
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,030
What are we having for dinner?

142
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,230
Let's have

143
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,220
barbecue by the beach.

144
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,040
Barbecue? It's not healthy.

145
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,870
How's that unhealthy?

146
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,190
It's high-temperature sterilized.

147
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,790
It's much healthier than the raw food you usually eat.

148
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,190
I wonder if the budget is enough though.

149
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,270
Hold on.

150
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,080
According to the survey,

151
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,070
the profit of a barbecue stall with fewer than five tables

152
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,200
is 3,000 yuan per day.

153
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,750
Without manpower cost and rent,

154
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,830
the profit will be higher.

155
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,710
We can combine kebabs with seafood

156
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,390
and sell them together.

157
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,080
There's a large market within a kilometer.

158
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,950
The ingredients are fresh.

159
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,750
When you search the keyword,

160
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,120
the one that matches with the beach the most is barbecue.

161
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,030
All in all,

162
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,390
barbecue is totally feasible.

163
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,870
We are having dinner,

164
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,190

I'll send yours over later.

176
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,960
♫I'll hold your hand when I find you♫

177
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,830
Smells so good.

178
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,310
Yes.

179
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,040
Are you thirsty?

180
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,790
♫I'll jump into the cold ocean with you♫

181
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,110
Not now, thanks.

182
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,320
♫I miss you♫

183
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,960
Would you like some kebabs?

184
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,950
Kebabs?

185
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,190
This way.

186
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:21,830
This way.

187
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,280
Here.

188
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,350
Stop following me.

189
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,630
The kebabs will be overcooked. Get over there.

190
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,030
Do you want the umbrella?

191
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,230
No. Just go.

192
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,590
I'll go then.

193
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,510
Hello.

194
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,110
Hold on. It'll be ready soon.

195
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,950
Hello.

196
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,830
Miss, Grandpa is not well.

197
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,560
Something happened to grandpa?

198
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,220
Wait for me.

199
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,350
Something urgent came up. I have to go.

200
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,030
Ge.

201
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,010
Where are you going?

202
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,830
Something happened to grandpa.

203
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,830
I have to go back now.

204
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,430
Wait.

205
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,430
Let's pack up,

206
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,870
get changed and go together.

207
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,270
No, you have to stay.

208
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,350
Mr. Jackson is definitely coming to the closing ceremony.

209
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,880
You have to stall him for me.

210
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,630
But I...

211
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,510
Okay. Be careful on your way back.

212
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,370
Come back soon.

213
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,100
Okay.

214
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,550
Call me if anything comes up.

215
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,030
OK.

216
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,110
Miss.

217
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,510
Ge, why are you back so early?

218
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,390
Grandpa.

219
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,060
Dad.

220
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,070
Baby.

221
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,330
Grandpa, are you okay?

222
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,540
Ge, why are you back?

223
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,790
Nothing.

224
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,060
I just miss you.

225
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,960
Grandpa, you smell so good.

226
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,440
Ge surely knows how to act cute.

227
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,150
I want to talk to Grandpa.

228
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,370
You don't have to be here, Auntie Zhu.

229
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,990
OK.

230
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,350
Dad, you guys talk.

231
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,880
I'll go get you some drinks.

232
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,020
Listen.

233
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,700
This time, you can't fail.

234
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,990
Alright, that's it.

235
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,140
Ning Yuan, send Ge back.

236
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:11,790
Okay.

237
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,830
I'm not going anywhere.

238
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,270
Silly girl.

239
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,700
I'm all good.

240
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,870
I eat and sleep well every day.

241
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,110
I only came to this hospital

242
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,910
for regular examinations.

243
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,670
Go back.

244
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,460
It's rare for Mr. Jackson to show up.

245
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,140
You still have a lot of things to do.

246
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,350
Ning Yuan.

247
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,380
Grandpa, take care and wait for me.

248
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,390
No problem.

249
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,750
After I come back,

250
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,950
teach me how to do Tai Chi.

251
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,060
Okay, don't worry.

252
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,550
Bye.

253
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,510
Bye, Grandpa.

254
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,710
Bye.

255
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,620
Go.

256
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,700
Everyone, gather around.

257
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,140
Hurry up.

258
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,100
Mr. Jackson can't come to our camp

259
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,180
due to his schedule.

260
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,740
But all other activities will go on as planned.

261
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,140
Let's keep on having fun.

262
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,260
Why didn't you tell me earlier

263
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,460
that Grandpa is sick?

264
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,990
He didn't want you to worry.

265
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,870
It's just that his condition has deteriorated a bit fast recently.

266
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,030
Deteriorated a bit fast?

267
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,720
Go check it.

268
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,030
Okay.

269
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,880
[Feng Muchen]

270
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,880
[Refuse] [Answer]

271
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,380
Hello?

272
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,220
I have something to tell you.

273
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,680
Mr. Jackson isn't coming.

274
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,940
What?

275
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,980
Mr. Jackson is not coming?

276
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Where are you now?

277
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,790
Yuewan Road.

278
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,270
Yuewan Road?

279
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,180
Don't come back after this.

280
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,020
I'll go find you after I'm done.

281
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,500
No.

282
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,400
I have to finish what I started.

283
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,460
I have to go.

284
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,270
Wait for me there.

285
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:04,900
Bye.

286
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,420
Yuewan Road? Why does it sound so familiar?

287
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,390
[He wants to pull Ye Wange up. Ye Wange dodged quickly.]

288
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,340
Why is there no Internet?

289
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,150
Can I borrow your phone?

290
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,060
No Internet either.

291
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,550
Maybe the signal is bad.

292
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,780
Miss, sit tight.

293
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,260
What happened?

294
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,250
Miss, are you alright?

295
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:03,780
I'm fine.

296
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,920
What about you?

297
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,630
Let's get off first.

298
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,100
Is this it?

299
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,900
Oh my!

300
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,940
Where did this square spike come from?

301
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,620
Luckily I honked and saved your life.

302
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,340
You have to think about how to make it up to me.

303
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,460
Do you have any common sense?

304
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,500
The tires don't blow out easily nowadays.

305
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,930
I think even if it got punctured by this,

306
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,100
it should be fine.

307
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,300
Miss, this is a specially made square spike.

308
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,660
Specially made?

309
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,040
So someone deliberately put it here,

310
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,780
wanting to hurt us.

311
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,540
Yun Yi, take Miss back first.

312
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,460
To be safe,

313
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,920
I'll stay here for a check.

314
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,300
Let's go, Miss Ye.

315
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,940
Be careful.

316
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,780
Let's go, Miss Ye.

317
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,270
Remember, think about how to make it up to me.

318
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,780
Get in.

319
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,420
It's okay.

320
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,860
Yun Yi, why did you come here without notice?

321
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,910
You knew someone wanted to hurt me?

322
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,210
Boss told me to.

323
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,020
He told me you're at Yuewan Road.

324
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,290
Boss?

325
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,780
So Feng Muchen predicted it?

326
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,500
Yes, I also think he's godlike.

327
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,770
That's what they call telepathy.

328
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,660
But if it weren't for him,

329
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,260
Ning Yuan and I would have been in the hospital.

330
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,170
But it doesn't make sense.

331
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,780
You're awake.

332
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,500
How many times have I told you

333
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,550
if you want to change the plot,

334
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,490
do it

335
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,580
before the new chapter of the novel is uploaded.

336
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,970
Why didn't you listen?

337
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,850
It's you.

338
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,100
How did you become like this?

339
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,170
Why making a fuss out of this?

340
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,830
Everyone has the right to pursue beauty.

341
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,570
I'm not used to

342
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,250
you looking like this.

343
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,890
Let me tell you.

344
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,410
The medicine I'm giving you now

345
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,850
won't last long.

346
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,250
You can't give Ge hints.

347
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,690
You can't change the plot in the world of telencephalon

348
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,490
against the author's will.

349
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,250
Don't push me to handle it forcibly.

350
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,140
OK?

351
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,130
It's not okay.

352
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,250
I have to stay.

353
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,690
Someone in the summer camp wants to hurt her.

354
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,370
Don't make more trouble.

355
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,650
I have to ensure your safety, bro.

356
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,770
The telencephalon technology is not stable.

357
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,230
I've already made an exception to let you in.

358
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,010
If it goes on like this,

359
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,050
you'll become a vegetable yourself.

360
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,930
But I really have to stay.

361
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,250
Shut up.

362
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,089
You...

363
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,329
Why does this stethoscope make me feel numb?

364
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,410
Who told you this is a stethoscope?

365
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,440
Alright.

366
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,410
Someone is coming. I'm leaving.

367
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:15,849
Hurry.

368
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:17,690
Wait for me.

369
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,849
What's the hurry?

370
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,650
I don't know why Muchen fainted.

371
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,290
Fainted?

372
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:22,730
Yes.

373
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,420
Feng Muchen.

374
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,450
Are you okay?

375
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,730
I'm fine.

376
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,130
Why did you faint?

377
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,360
It was all because of you.

378
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,650
Why was it because of me?

379
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,760
I starved all day

380
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,090
trying to help you with the barbecue stall.

381
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,950
That's why I fainted from hunger.

382
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,080
Fine.

383
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,410
What's in this drip?

384
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,330
The drip of thinking about you for 365 days.

385
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,870
You're sick and you're still so loquacious?

386
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,570
By the way,

387
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,090
how did you know

388
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,150
someone wanted to hurt me on the road?

389
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,850
It just occurred to me.

390
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,770
A brainwave. Quick-witted.

391
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,250
All of a sudden...

392
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,400
I've got a call.

393
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,570
You're lying. The screen is not on.

394
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,840
There it is.

395
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,600
Yun Yi.

396
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,760
What's wrong?

397
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,370
Boss, have you seen Miss Ye?

398
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,930
Yes.

399
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,770
How's that thing

400
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,970
I asked you to prepare going?

401
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,890
Don't worry.

402
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,480
Trust me with it.

403
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,120
Okay.

404
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,210
What are you preparing?

405
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,240
Just something in the company.

406
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,760
I'm suddenly thirsty.

407
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,600
How about you buy me an iced

408
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,560
Diet Coke?

409
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,330
You have a lot to ask.

410
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,650
Yes, Mr. Feng.

411
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,400
[HAPPY LUCKY]

412
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,120
It's quite cold after the nap.

413
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,210
Why did you run?

414
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,940
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?

415
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,720
Take this medicine.

416
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,250
Take it when you feel uncomfortable.

417
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,980
It can only last for three days.

418
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,000
Is there any difference if I take it before or after meals?

419
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,410
What are you talking about?

420
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,120
I told you to

421
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,180
take it when you feel uncomfortable.

422
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,960
OK?

423
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,520
OK.

424
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,000
I have another question.

425
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,530
Why don't I have that skill?

426
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,290
Because I'm a doctor.

427
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,730
All right, I'm leaving.

428
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,120
Go mind your business.

429
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,330
So the doctors have that skill.

430
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,130
[HAPPY LUCKY]

431
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,810
I'm back.

432
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,400
Where's Feng Muchen?

433
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,240
I saw someone came in just now.

434
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,760
Where is he?

435
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,720
Did I see a ghost?

436
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,450
That must have been an illusion

437
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,710
since I'm so hungry.

438
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,680
I was dazzled.

439
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,230
Let me introduce myself.

440
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,360
My name is Chen Ye.

441
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,510
Since I've made some achievements

442
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,320
in business,

443
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,080
the organizer invited me here

444
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,510
as your closing guest.

445
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,170
I wish you a happy graduation.

446
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,640
Let's go have snacks.

447
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,800
Miss Ye.

448
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,900
Happy graduation.

449
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,440
This is for me?

450
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,480
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

451
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,320
But my wife

452
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,380
is allergic to pollen.

453
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,920
Let's go for a walk.

454
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,480
I'm not allergic to pollen.

455
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,270
I know.

456
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,600
I said it on purpose.

457
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,950
Did you arrange these?

458
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,800
Yes.

459
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,630
Just in a casual way.

460
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,990
I did prepare the sunset though.

461
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,260
How do you know I like platycodon grandiflorus?

462
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,950
Of course I know.

463
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,720
Does Ye Wange in the novel also like it?

464
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,830
Do you know

465
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,360
the meaning of this flower?

466
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,710
Sincere and unchanging love.

467
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,560
Ge, I know you have your concerns.

468
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,230
But it's okay.

469
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,280
I just want to tell you

470
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,710
what I think.

471
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,600
If life is like this sea,

472
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,470
then you're a small boat.

473
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,720
You have a place you want to go.

474
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,430
And I'm willing to be the trestle under your feet,

475
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,830
waiting for you to come back.

476
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,160
I was too selfish before.

477
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,000
I only cared about my feelings for you.

478
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,510
But I neglected

479
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,920
what you really like,

480
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,910
what you care about,

481
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,640
and what you want.

482
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,800
So, thank you

483
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,120
for making me change

484
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,790
and grow.

485
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,200
No matter where you are,

486
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,670
whether you remember

487
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,430
it or not,

488
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,390
I'll always be here.

489
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,150
Gosh.

490
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,110
Who can resist such a sweet confession?

491
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,350
No, Ye Wange.

492
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,350
Come on.

493
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,280
You have a mission to complete.

494
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,240
Why are you suddenly so cheesy?

495
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,910
But recently,

496
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,470
you seem a little different from who you used to be.

497
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,790
It seems like no matter what I was doing,

498
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,390
you were always there when I looked for you.

499
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,710
It felt quite good.

500
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,190
Ge, I won't leave you again.

501
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,250
♫I'll jump into the cold ocean with you♫

502
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,070
Why does it sound like he once left me?

♫The world is not as good as you are♫

519
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,440
♫I just want to race with time♫

♫I'm going to love you until I'm old♫

♫I don't want to beat around the bush♫

♫The world is not as good as you are♫

Hello?

Grandpa...

00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,420
He's not well.

528
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,020
Let's go visit him.
