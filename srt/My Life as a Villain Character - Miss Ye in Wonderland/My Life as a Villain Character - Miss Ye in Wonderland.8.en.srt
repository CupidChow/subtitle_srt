This is a waste of her talent.

113
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,550

Wait.

157
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,270
Is it inappropriate

158

345
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,440
♫You travel through the parallel of time♫

346
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,510
♫And walk with me♫

347
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,900
♫Firmly♫

348
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,870
♫Embrace you♫

349
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,310
♫Our destined meeting♫

350
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,660
♫Made me realize♫

351
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,660
♫That those once you guarded♫

352
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,060
♫Are the reason♫

353
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,570
♫Why happiness is not let down♫

354
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,860
Why is he sleeping here?

355
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,160
This guy

356
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,400
is easy to get along with.

357
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,030
Besides,

358
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,900
when I look at him, I find out that he is handsome.

359
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,490
You told me not to leave last night.

360
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,680
All these years,

361
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,640
I finally met someone

362
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,990
I can't let go of,

363
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,110
my man.

364
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,040
How could I leave?

365
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,880
Maybe you can't remember me now.

366
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,800
Ge, I believe.

367
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,560
One day you will remember me

368
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,950
and our past.

369
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,920
I will protect you

370
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,640
until that day.

371
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,670
What's wrong with your brain?

372
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,070
It’s my duty to protect you.

373
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,040
But I can't do it.

374
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,630
Your lady is fine now.

375
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,880
You have to punish yourself?

376
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,440
I wasn't there every time you're in danger.

377
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,630
It's my negligence.

378
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,580
What are you doing?

379
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,230
Speaking of negligence, I'm more.

380
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,270
I often forget my boss.

381
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,630
Should I throw water?

382
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,790
Are you crazy? It's all in the past.

383
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,680
I know.

384
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,410
What's the point of being late?

385
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,930
What are you waiting for? Go get changed.

386
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,590
Let's go.

387
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,950
In the novel,

388
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,400
hair gel is okay.

389
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,870
His hairstyle was still there.

390
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,630
His ring, his watch.

391
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,880
Too much.

392
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,150
Much better now.

393
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,790
Was he really staying all night by my bed?

394
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,150
Weird.

395
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,790
Feng Muchen is warm now.

396
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,590
He has turned good lately.

397
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,270
Did he see my bad habits?

398
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,790
Grinding, snoring,

399
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,630
or talking.

400
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,250
Why should I think about that?

401
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,640
Since last night,

402
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,310
I found out something strange,

403
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,880
me or him?

404
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,070
Of course. You.

405
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,950
The toothpaste is so small.

406
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,430
Your ex-boyfriend

407
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,750
didn't buy you toothpaste?

408
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,950
That's all you can do.

409
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,810
I've never had a boyfriend.

410
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,190
I guess she really forgot me.

411
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,910
Go ahead.

412
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,950
This toothpaste is good.

413
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,950
It won't be squeezed like before.

414
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,310
Keep it up.

415
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,550
Why do you suddenly talk like my mom?

416
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,360
Like your mom?

417
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,670
If you take me as your dad,

418
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,150
I'm willing.

419
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,870
You took advantage of me?

420
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,470
This is my room.

421
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,790
It's my room.

422
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,630
Of course I can use it.

423
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,060
Are you okay?

424
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,910
I didn't touch you. Don't extort me.

425
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,460
Do I have a heart disease?

426
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,550
How would I know?

427
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,740
Is my body still not used to it?

428
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,180
What are you murmuring about?

429
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,220
Go to see the doctor if you're sick.

430
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,460
What are you doing?

431
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,030
Not for now.

432
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,220
What happened?

433
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,830
The system has something wrong.
