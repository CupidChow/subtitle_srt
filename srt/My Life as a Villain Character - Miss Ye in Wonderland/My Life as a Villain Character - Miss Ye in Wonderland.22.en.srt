[Episode 22]

4
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,060
The offer to Ye's

5
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,539
is so much lower than those to other companies.

6
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,920
My wifie.

7
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,460
Have a sandwich.

8
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,729
I don't have the appetite.

9
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,240
You can eat it.

10
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,430
Are you upset with me last night?

11
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,340
No.

12
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,550
It's because the lead to bring down Ye Shuyuan is cut off again.

13
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,300
This BOSS is a tough one.

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,240
No matter how tough the BOSS is,

15
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,030
I will fight with you.

16
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:11,700
Don't be afraid.

17
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,320
By the way,

18
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,900
aren't we going to meet Wanqing at noon today?

19
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,520
Why don't we eat in the mall?

20
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,900
What's your plan again?

21
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,430
Nothing.

22
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,090
Feng's really broke.

23
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,710
My last mall

24
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,579
is going to be sold.

25
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,520
So

26
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,240
I'm going to the mall to see what it's like.

27
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,440
After all,

28
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,630
your husband

29
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,160
is becoming a househusband.

30
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,770
But that's okay.

31
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,460
I'm ready to lie flat.

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,220
My wifie.

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,120
Is that okay?

34
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,200
Yes.

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,680
It's fake anyway.

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,200
Bankruptcy doesn't really matter.

37
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,340
What if it's true in real life?

38
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,240
Are you okay?

39
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,780
Why are you so dazed?

40
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,580
I'm fine.

41
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,650
I just remembered something from the past.

42
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,590
I think I'm quite self-absorbed

43
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,260
in relationship.

44
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,590
I live a terrible life too.

45
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,320
Idiot.

46
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,370
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,870
No matter what happens,

48
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,050
I'm still here with you.

49
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,860
And

50
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,560
I always feel like

51
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,420
we've known each other for a long time.

52
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,490
Ge.

53
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,710
There are some answers

54
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,550
I can't tell you.

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,890
Then let me tell you

56
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,230
my answer.

57
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,910
Whether it's here

58
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,510
or when we get out,

59
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,390
I'm willing to trust you unconditionally.

60
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,840
From the time you came back to me in the rain,

61
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,080
to the fact that you pretended to be Mr. Jackson to help me,

62
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,710
no matter who you are,

63
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,190
I can see

64

your affection.

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,380
You

66
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,909
are going to be a real standup guy.

67
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,600
Stand up straight.

68
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,920
And you... and you.

69
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,510
Behave yourselves

70
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,960
when you go to your new home.

71
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,790
Don't make a fuss.

72
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,300
And you.

73
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,220
You're the one I'll miss the most.

74
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,610
What's wrong?

75
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,980
You always try to make a move on me.

76
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,500
Don't you think it's disgusting?

77
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,920
Hug me.

78
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,880
I'm leaving soon.

79
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:38,890
Why?

80
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,220
Feng's bankrupt.

81

Boss has no money either.

82
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,700

83
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,960
soon I'll have to find another job.

84
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,590

Fine.

86

That's enough.

87
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,960
Just pick one.

88

Pick the one you like the most.

89
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,560
Keep it as a souvenir.

90

Wait.

91
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,520
Do you want to sell these?

92
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,290

A lot.

100

Dad's here to give him some advice.

112

Do you mean his company's bankruptcy?

I'll take care of it.

Thank you, Dad.

117

What do you mean by coming to my dad about this

118
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,260
instead of me?

119

Yesterday was yesterday.

122

A man's career must be more important than his family.

young and proud.

143
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,530
After taking over the company,

144
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,200
she's always in a hurry to get things done.

145

It's okay.

I thought the owner's last name was Ye.

Don't mention it.

He used to be the live-in son-in-law of the Ye family.

Now he's on his own.

158

You don't have any worries about the Lu's now, do you?

163

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,390
I won't let you suffer a loss.

176
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,230
Thank you, Dad.

177
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,010
[Ye Shuyuan, Chairman]

178
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,370
[Ye Wange, Chairman]

179
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,550
Your department should try to recruit

180
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,070
a group of young designers.

181
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,470
They don't have to have a top degree,

182
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,020
but they must have their style and ideas.

183
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,680
Understood.

184
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,560
Understood.

185
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,980
Assign a group of positions in the Sales Department

186
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,420
to get access to e-commerce channels.

187
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,440
This will be the focus of our work afterward.

188
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,180
Understood?

189
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,770
Yes.

190
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,390
Good.

191
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,780
I haven't thought of

192
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,120
a good rectification solution

193
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,360
for the issues of the Production Department yet.

194
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,020
Well.

195
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,090
Let me think about it.

196
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,060
You guys, go on with your work.

197
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:12,820
Go for it.

198
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,580
Okay.

199
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,790
Money is hard to make.

200
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,180
Shit is hard to eat.

201
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,210
I know it's not easy to be a boss.

202
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,900
But I didn't expect it to be this hard.

203
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,750
It's fine Ye Shuyuan poached my staff.

204
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,300
He even poached my husband.

205
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,680
That bad old man.

206
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,460
Ye Wange.

207
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,660
Take a look.

208
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,240
Ye's employees are leaving.

209
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,050
I don't think it's your turn to interfere with this, you outsider.

210
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,760
It's Dad's intention.

211
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,380
I wondered why he was willing

212
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,880
to give me the chairmanship.

213
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,740
So he was prepared.

214
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,250
You should know

215
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,940
these executives

216
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,120
left voluntarily.

217
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,530
I think you should figure it out.

218
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,730
It's not them I'm angry with.

219
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,270
It's you who has been faithless.

220
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,830
These people are too good to be left with you.

221
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,940
It'll be a waste of talent.

222
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,640
What do you mean?

223
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,870
You insulted me.

224
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,400
I didn't insult you.

225
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,310
I'm just telling the truth.

226
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,300
Besides,

227
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,840
why do these people follow Dad?

228
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,470
Have you reflected on yourself?

229
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,710
I'm laughing my ass off.

230
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,200
Feng Muchen.

231
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,390
The Feng family is bankrupt.

232
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,260
Now you live off me.

233
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,180
Why do you have a say, gigolo?

234
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,620
Ye Wange, I've had enough of you for a long time.

235
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,580
We can divorce at any time.

236
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,940
Fine!

237
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,780
I've wanted to divorce for a long time

238
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,690
But I won't sign it.

239
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,410
It's okay.

240
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,800
Whether you sign it or not,

241
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,280
they can only apply for labor arbitration.

242
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:03,910
You…

243
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,690
Feng Muchen, I…

244
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,560
Sister.

245
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,320
Sister.

246
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,280
How can you do this to my brother-in-law?

247
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,760
It's between us.

248
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,830
I don't think you get a say in this.

249
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,340
I just can't stand it anymore.

250
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,940
Feng Muchen.

251
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,580
You regret it now, don't you?

252
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,340
If you had married me,

253
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,600
you wouldn't be in such trouble.

254
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,030
I'm so regretting it.

255
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,900
Take a piss and look at yourself.

256
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,160
Even if he hadn't met me,

257
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,520
he wouldn't have liked you.

258
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,460
Ye Wange.

259
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,090
In front of so many people,

260
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,670
I have to expose you today.

261
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,760
You drugged me in the first place

262
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,650
and tricked me into sleeping with you.

263
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,350
You even faked pregnancy.

264
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,580
You, you shut up!

265
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,550
You're a shrew.

266
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,730
Wait

267
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,260
to see her true face.

268
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,560
Lu Wanqing!

269
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,490
You!

270
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,860
Is it still too late

271
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,960
for me to turn back now?

272
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,830
Son of a bitch!

273
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,010
What are you looking at?

274
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,990
Go to your work!

275
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,490
I may fire you!

276
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,200
Feng Muchen.

277
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,090
Stop there!

278
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,510
Come and see.

279
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,500
Come and see.

280
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,010
Adulterous couple.

281
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,590
Scumbags.

282
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,570
What?

283
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,920
Did I hurt you?

284
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,270
This lady.

285
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,500
You can judge me.

286
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,630
But

287
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,900
I hope you can let go of my woman.

288
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,790
Wanqing, don't take it to heart.

289
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,040
It's okay.

290
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,840
Of course

291
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,350
neither of you is good.

292
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,220
They

293
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,450
will meet their nemesis.

294
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,110
Sister.

295
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,220
Our relationship

296
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,600
is close to the very core.

297
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,730
You'd better bless us.

298
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,790
Shut up!

299
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:15,990
Let's go.

300
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,020
Eww.

301
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,580
The alarm is off.

302
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,290
Sister.

303
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,780
You should have been less ruthless.

304
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,420
You know it was an act.

305
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,210
You're so protective of him.

306
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,840
Your father's men are watching.

307
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,660
If you didn't act like that,

308
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,010
we'd give ourselves away.

309
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,350
Hello.

310
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,990
I need two iced lattes.

311
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,210
Bring them over there for me.

312
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,720
Okay.

313
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,260
Thank you.

314
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,130
Scan the code here.

315
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,360
I'll pay.

316
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,630
Thank you for your treat, Yin.

317
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,190
Go.

318
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,320
Wait.

319
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,070
You have to say “bah, bah”.

320
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,740
So your words won't count.

321
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,200
Bah, bah.

322
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,700
I can always rely on you.

323
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,410
You have to remember.

324
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,200
You can change your husband a hundred times.

325
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,380
But I, Su Yinyin

326
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,340
will be the one who stays with you until the end.

327
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,360
But when I go back,

328
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,170
I won't be able to see you anymore.

329
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,560
What's wrong?

330
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,820
Why are you so dazed?

331
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,660
It occurred to me

332
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,960
that Feng Muchen and I had a date to...

333
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,450
You put a man over me.

334
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,380
Can't you learn from Lu Wanqing?

335
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,300
Treat men coldly

336
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,680
like she does.

337
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,940
Speaking of Lu Wanqing,

338
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,080
it came to me

339
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,110
there's something I want to ask you.

340
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,170
What? Say it.

341
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,110
Is it over between

342
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,640
Chen Ye and Wanqing?

343
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,810
I want them to get back together.

344
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,770
If you say so,

345
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,510
they indeed fought?

346
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,460
Wait a minute.

347
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,480
Since Chen Ye and your father are in cahoots,

348
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,340
why do you have to

349
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,340
set them up?

350
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,310
Actually,

351
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,420
it's a misunderstanding.

352
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,560
Chen Ye must have his own reasons.

353
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,310
Maybe he is our undercover agent.

354
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,730
But Wanqing just doesn't listen to me.

355
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,510
In my opinion,

356
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,690
Lu Wanqing

357
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,230
doesn't necessarily think that Chen Ye has lied to her.

358
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,680
Don't forget

359
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,310
she knows Chen Ye better than you do.

360
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,120
Maybe they can find a chance

361
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,850
to talk things out.

362
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,470
But Wanqing

363
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,080
won't give him the chance.

364
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,290
Hello, your coffee.

365
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,370
Put it here.

366
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:29,720
Thank you.

367
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,650
I have an idea.

368
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,410
There's a big business meeting

369
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
tomorrow at Ye's.

370
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,230
There will be a lot of big names in the industry.

371
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,090
They must both be there.

372
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,460
Will it work in a work situation?

373
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,760
Stupid.

374
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,650
You don't understand.

375
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,810
They have to stay together

376
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,930
in the workplace.

377
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,590
I'll find a way to make them stay,

378
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,540
so that they'll have the chance to talk.

379
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,390
That's it?

380
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,540
What if…

381
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,460
No, no, no.

382
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,620
There is no “What if”.

383
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,609
I got it.

384
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:07,930
Come on.

385
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,339
I wish you success.

386
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,020
Today

387
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,810
I want to take Wanqing to see her mother.

388
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:26,030
But it seems she's already out of the hospital.

389
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,950
I found a better nursing home for her

390
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,110
to stay.

391
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,910
It'll save you guys the trouble.

392
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,280
Mr. Ye.

393
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,010
After all, she's Wanqing's mother.

394
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,150
They should see each other more often.

395
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,720
Just mind your own business.

396
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,420
I'm just worried.

397
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,740
You're worried?

398
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,470
I thought you said you never get emotionally involved.

399
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,970
You can't even handle a woman?

400
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,840
Mr. Ye.

401
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,250
Please treat Mrs. Shen well.

402
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,090
Are you giving me a lesson?

403
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,880
What kind of person do you think am I?

404
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,700
That's an aggressive move.

405
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,490
Mr. Ye.

406
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,370
Wanqing

407
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,800
is innocent in this.

408
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,910
I don't want her to get hurt.

409
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,070
You should

410
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,900
leave it alone.

411
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,470
Just take care of your orders.

412
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:45,970
Goodbye.

413
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,280
How about

414
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,960
my acting skills?

415
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,940
Aren't they impressive?

416
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,160
You're

417
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,460
an expert actor.

418
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,660
It's just I didnt have enough time

419
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,000
to fully show off my skills.

420
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,720
I think you should become a screenwriter.

421
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,440
So

422
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,790
you can write a lot of characters

423
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,050
and think of many characters.

424
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,390
I've really thought about it.

425
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,680
For example, you could be

426
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,060
a eunuch.

427
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,910
I should at least be a prince.

428
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,450
What's wrong?

429
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,090
I suddenly remembered

430
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,700
something that happened during my school days.

431
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,140
I'm a little confused.

432
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,290
Then let's go home

433
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,450
after it's done.

434
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,350
Wait a minute.

435
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,940
We have to do the whole package.

436
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,110
You can't go home tonight.

437
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,310
Then where should I go?

438
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,830
Tonight, you're going to...

439
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,260
Understand?

440
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,490
Did you hear me?

441
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,510
Feng Muchen, you...

442
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,430
Let's go.

443
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,740
Of course I heard you.

444
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,950
Don't go.

445
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,410
Don't leave me alone

446
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,190
in the room.

447
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,050
No one will clean up my room.

448
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,120
I can't hear your snoring anymore.

449
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,580
You and Feng Muchen are in cahoots.

450
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,440
Miss suffered a huge injustice

451
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,040
at the company today.

452
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,350
Now there are all kinds of gossip.

453
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,460
Please don't.

454
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,610
I'm begging you.

455
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,060
What's going on?

456
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,590
Miss Ye.

457
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,090
Don't let Ning Yuan go.

458
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,120
Ning Yuan wants to leave.

459
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:55,550
He's leaving?

460
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,290
Men shouldn't kneel easily, Yun Yi.

461
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,130
I didn't expect

462
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,160
you could do this

463
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,120
to ask me to stay.

464
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,640
Don't let him go.

465
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,620
Let go.

466
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,740
Muchen.

467
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,360
They seem to have some serious illness.

468
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,830
They've always had.

469
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,150
So it's an act.

470
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,610
Keep an eye on them.

471
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
They may be

472
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,260
pretending to fight.

473
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,240
Muchen?

474
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,520
It's so late.

475
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,790
Why did you come to my place?

476
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,850
Is there something wrong?

477
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,950
Dad.

478
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,630
I'm afraid you have to take me in.

479
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,500
What's wrong?

480
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,040
Ge had a fight with him?

481
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,590
They had a big fight.

482
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,160
He was thrown out.

483
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,430
Ever since Ge became the president,

484
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,990
she's been a different person.

485
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,950
Now

486
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,370
it's hard to live under the same roof with her.

487
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,180
And my family position…

488
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,260
It's okay.

489
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,450
When your production line

490
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,950
is merged by my new company,

491
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,110
you'll be able to turn the tables.

492
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,330
You'll have a

493
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,210
different family position too.

494
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,190
Thank you, Dad.

495
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,690
I now declare

496
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,820
the great success of this meeting.

497
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,670
As the host,

498
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,040
we have prepared a sumptuous lunch for you

499
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,980
at the city's most luxurious restaurant.

500
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,720
The special cars are downstairs.

501
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,340
Wanqing, what's wrong with you today?

502
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,840
Why do you keep refusing to talk to me?

503
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,910
Talk to you about what?

504
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,810
That you put your career

505
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,410
over your feelings?

506
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,800
I did it on purpose to show your dad.

507
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,390
I had no choice but to say that.

508
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,460
Then you're focusing on the wrong thing.

509
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,120
Do you think I'm stupid enough to believe

510
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,990
what you said in front of my dad?

511
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,790
I'm just mad at you

512
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,640
for not talking to me

513
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,240
about the problem

514
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,700
and hiding things from me.

515
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,450
No, I'm not.

516
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,510
I just don't want you to worry.

517
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,340
What do you think

518
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,020
is the most important thing in a relationship?

519
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,720
Fine.

520
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,960
Here is the thing.

521
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,010
Well.

522
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,660
I'm sorry

523
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,870
about your mother.

524
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,050
Have you heard anything new from her?

525
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,830
No, not really.

526
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,730
Your father asked me to arrange for her to be transferred.

527
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,660
Transferred?

528
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,160
Yeah.

529
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,340
Why did she have to be transferred?

530
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,370
As far as I know, she had a miscarriage.

531
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,550
She was transferred to a maternity hospital so that she could be better taken care of.

532
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,630
Why did she suddenly have a miscarriage?

533
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,040
And how is she now?

534
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,110
I don't know.

535
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,420
She was no longer there

536
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,470
when I went to look for her.

537
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,610
But don't worry.

538
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,930
The attending doctor told me

539
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,390
the operation was a success.

540
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,060
You knew she had a miscarriage.

541
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,190
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

542
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:13,810
I…

543
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,870
I thought it was your father's test for me.

544
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,800
I was afraid you couldn't…

545
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,030
Wanting.

549
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,930
It seems to be getting worse.

550
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,330
Next, it's up to you.

554
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,070
Thank you, Dad.

555
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,300
Don't mention it.

556
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,290
Hold on.

557
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,470
Ge.

558
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,180
You've come to congratulate Dad too?

559
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,690

Dad.

563
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,090
What do you mean by that?

564
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,590
You don't want to sign with me?

565
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,540
Yes, I do.

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,220
I should be the company of Party A

on the contract.

569
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,990
I'll leave

570
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,580
the rest to you.

571
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,250
No problem.

572
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,730
Are you setting me up?
