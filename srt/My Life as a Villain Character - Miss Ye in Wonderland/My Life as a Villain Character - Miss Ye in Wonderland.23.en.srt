[Episode 23]

4
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,200
Mr. Liu.

5
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,910
It should be the main Party A company

6
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,229
on the contract.

7
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,160
I'll leave the rest

8
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,560
to you.

9
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:39,950
Okay.

10
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,070
You set me up.

11
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,050
You will definitely not disclose

12
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
the specific information of this company

13
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,270
until the time of signing the contract.

14
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,280
It seems that the assets of this company

15
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,600
are not legitimate.

16
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,820
We're just paying you back

17
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,340
in kind.

18
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,310
Mr. Liu,

19
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,230
this bill is for all the projects my dad has handled

20
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,860
since the company went public.

21
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,060
Each project

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,790
has an unverifiable unforeseen fee.

23
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,220
What's wrong with that?

24
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,330
Nothing is wrong.

25
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,460
But the money went to the same person every time.

26
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,330
Mr. Liu,

27
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,980
go check the financial transactions

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,610
between this person and this company,

29
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,140
and you will know the truth.

30
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,420
Now,

31
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,340
it seems that the abnormal quotation of this account

32
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,450
has reached the standard of applying for investigation.

33
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,180
Mr. Ye,

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,470
please cooperate with us.

35
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,730
How could this happen?

36
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,650
These were all handled by my subordinates.

37
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,940
I'll go get them.

38
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,840
Do you want me to go with you?

39
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,230
You two ungrateful people

40
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,030
are really made for each other!

41
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,630
Thank you for your blessing.

42
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,180
Mr. Ye,

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,140
come with us.

44
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,320
You came just in time.

45
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,510
Miss Ye.

46
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,300
Let's go.

47
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,400
It will take time to get the evidence.

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,770
But it will be over soon.

49
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,010
Unfortunately, we haven't been able

50
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,860
to find sufficient evidence against him in my mother's case.

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,060
Ye Shuyuan

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,540
will definitely be punished by law.

53
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,670
I think now you should think about

54
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,520
what else

55
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,300
you want to do here.

56
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,750
So what do you want to do?

57
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,410
To stay with you, of course.

58
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,860
It's so terrible for me

59
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,810
to have such a controlling father.

60
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,820
By the way,

61
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,980
just pretend to be my boyfriend later.

62
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,329
Anyway, I don't want a blind date.

63
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,060
I...

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,780
pretend to be your boyfriend?

65
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,070
I don't think it's a good idea.

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,850
You don't want to help me?

67
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,560
I'll do it.

68
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,980
But

69
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,270
I think

70
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,780
it might be better

71
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,010
if you just admit that I'm your boyfriend.

72
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,650
Cut the crap.

73
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,700
Just pretend to be my boyfriend later.

74
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,430
Yin!

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,830
Yin!

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,120
What are you doing?

77
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,720
Sit down.

78
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,940
Just sit there. And you.

79
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,540
Hurry up.

80
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,480
Yes.

81
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,230
Those three punks at the door are your friends, right?

82
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,040
You want to be a punk?

83
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,570
Of course not!

84
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,829
Listen, old man!

85
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,040
I will never compromise.

86
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,810
I am in charge

87
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,790
of my life!

88
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,340
Listen.

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,960
This boy

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,550
looks decent.

91
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,350
And he's pretty handsome.

92
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,340
Most importantly,

93
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,680
he has a good family background.

94
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,540
So what?

95
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,240
You...

96
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,710
Mr. Su.

97
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:39,970
Who are you?

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,440
Mr. Su,

99
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,790
you may not know me.

100
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,020
It is also not appropriate for me

101
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,520
to get involved in your affair with Yin.

102
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,840
But as her friend,

103
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,140
I think

104
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,200
she is the most special

105
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,610
and kindest girl I have ever met.

106
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,880
In fact, she rides a motorcycle not for the pursuit of excitement,

107
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,050
but to overcome her timid character.

108
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,450
And although those few people

109
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,090
are quite like punks,

110
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,210
they are actually orphans.

111
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,160
Yin became friends with them

112
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,430
and even shared her living expenses

113
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,270
with them.

114
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,820
She's really not the kind of bad girl

115
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,970
who would only

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,170
have fun every day.

117
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,180
She has her own pursuit and ideal.

118
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,860
Mr. Su,

119
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,850
I think you should get to know her better.

120
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,090
You will be proud

121
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,140
of having such a child.

122
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,940
You don't need to explain to him.

123
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,770
I didn't expect you to say so much for me.

124
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,290
But it's useless to say so much!

125
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,780
You still won't understand me.

126
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,140
I understand you.

127
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,200
I'm your dad. Of course I understand you.

128
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,370
Where are you going?

129
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,900
Don't...

130
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,050
Calm down.

131
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,240
Sorry.

132
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,810
What's your name?

133
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,110
Mr. Su.

134
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,430
My name is Zou Chengji.

135
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,260
Cheng represents success

136
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,860
and Ji represents good luck.

137
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,020
Mr. Su.

138
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,490
I really like Yin.

139
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,890
Please don't let her go on any blind dates again.

140
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,460
You brat.

141
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,909
Don't think that you can win her love

142
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,770
by complimenting her a few words.

143
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,250
You will be responsible for her personal safety in the future.

144
00:05:59,250 --> 00:05:59,890
Also,

145
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,680
tell her to be careful when riding a motorcycle.

146
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,740
Don't worry, Mr. Su.

147
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,520
I will go to her first.

148
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,120
Hurry up.

149
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:05,820
Thank you.

150
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,710
Alright.

151
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,520
It seems that Yin has really grown up.

152
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,590
This young man

153
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,370
is not bad.

154
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,270
Right?

155
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,460
Excuse me.

156
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,820
Two more glasses of water.

157
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,460
Okay.

158
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,130
Hello?

159
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,220
What?

160
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,400
He ran away?

161
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,430
Wait for me.

162
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,730
What happened?

163
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,980
Who is it?

164
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,110
Ning Yuan said that Ye Huating was going to buy a plane ticket and run away.

165
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,380
But the flight was delayed.

166
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,400
We still have time.

167
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,020
He would definitely try to escape.

168
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,500
How do we find him?

169
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,620
I've prepared.

170
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,610
[Ye Shuyuan was caught in the suburban warehouse.]

171
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,320
I also asked Zou Chengji and Su Yinyin to help.

172
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,420
Let’s go.

173
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,050
Come here.

174
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:55,970
What?

175
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,450
Only I can see your shoulders.

176
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,380
Stop it.

177

Boss.

180
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,090
The flight was delayed.

181
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,420
Go to the train station.

182
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,570
Boss.

183
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,210
It's Feng Muchen's car.

184
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:15,950
Turn around.

185
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,680
Hurry up!

186
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,390
Their other car is behind us.

187
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,900
Pull over.

188
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,280
You're here.

Where are they?

Let's split up.

192

Yun Yi, Ning Yuan.

193
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,860
Go check over there.

194
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,490
OK.

197

198

and draw them away.

201
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,760
Then pick me up.

202
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,880
Boss,

203
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,980
they're out there looking for us.

204
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,780
Then we'll just hide here

205
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,020
and wait for them to catch...

206
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,950
Catch us?

207
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,680
What a fool!

208

Go, go, go.

209
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,600
Let's go.

210
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,740
I'm here!

211
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,990
I will deal with him.

212
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,790
Keep looking.

213
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,450
I'll go with her.

214
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,450
Yin, be careful.

215
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,669
He might be there.

216
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,500
Let's go.

217
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,610
You two losers.

218
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,690
I pay you such a high salary every month.

219
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,690
And this is what you're paying back?

220
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,549
See?

221
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,870
Dad.

222
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,430
The results of the investigation are not out yet.

223
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,460
Why are you running away?

224
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,520
Then why are you following me?

225
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,280
I'm trying to protect you.

226
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,700
So many people are looking for you.

227
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,490
What should I do

228
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,800
if something happens to you?

229
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,630

What are you talking about?

232
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,160
I'll repay you for the kindness of raising me.

233
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,890
You're just trying to kill me right now.

Go get a car for me

355
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,120
if you want to save her.

356
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,610
Don't call the police.

357
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,560
Calm down.

358
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,410
I'll do as you say right away.

359
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,080
Go.

360
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,100
Go.

361
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,250
Mr. Ye. Mr. Ye.

362
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,860
Dad, don't kill me.

363
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,580
Please don't...

364
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,060
Mr. Ye! Mr. Ye!

365
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,930
She is your daughter.

366
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,750
Just stand there and don't move,

367
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,790
or I will kill her.

368
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,580
Go back.

369
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:09,680
Dad.

370
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,910
Calm down.

371
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,030
I'm your daughter.

372
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,560
You can't...

373
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,520
My own daughter.

374
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,670
If it weren't for you,

375
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,600
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

376
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,850
Where's the car?

377
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,310
Why isn't the car here yet?

378
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,100
Ning Yuan.

379
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,130
Get down.

380
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,300
Step back.

381
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,940
Please calm down.

382
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,660
Calm down.

383
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,560
Let her go.

384
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,200
Why should I trust you?

385
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,100
Stop, Feng Muchen.

386
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,680
He won't do anything to me.

387
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,670
I'll be your hostage.

388
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,330
Mr. Feng.

389
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,960
Boss.

390
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,470
Hurry.

391
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,210
She's your daughter.

392
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,170
She will be a useless hostage

393
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,460
if you

394
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,790
confront the police.

395
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,010
But I'm different.

396
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,030
Don't try to pull any tricks.

397
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,630
Come here.

398
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,280
Don't come over, Feng Muchen.

399
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,830
Miss.

400
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,460
Why are you here?

401
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,870
Where is my mom?

402
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,780
As long as you promise to let me go abroad,

403
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,130
I will release her immediately.

404
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:08,790
Otherwise,

405
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,700
you'll never see her again.

406
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,340
Wanqing!

407
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,780
Mom!

408
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,930
What happened?

409
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:15,990
You...

410
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,070
I would have killed you

411
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,040
if I had known this.

412
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,680
Catch him.

413
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,760
Send him to the police station.

414
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,520
Let go of me!

415
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,800
Don't let him run away.

416
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,290
I'll go with you.

417
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:30,820
Are you okay?

418
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,700
I'm fine.

419
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,270
What about you?

420
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm fine too.

421
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,660
I have to tell the police

422
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,060
all those things you did.

423
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,990
You were involved in those things too.

424
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,260
I've figured it out.

425
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,410
Only if you go to jail

426
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,370
can I live the rest of my life in peace.

427
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:43,940
Mom.

428
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:44,770
Get in the car!

429
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,170
Get in!

430
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,740
Get in!

431
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,710
Sorry.

432
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,920
I was late.

433
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,520
Stop talking about that.

434
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,770
I was really worried about you.

435
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,680
What if he really hurts you?

436
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,850
I just want you to be safe and sound.

437
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,980
I'm going to check him out.

438
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,590
Wanqing.

439
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,520
Your mother needs to be investigated now.

440
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:09,940
Calm down.

441
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,960
Let me see

442
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,200
what I can do.

443
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,550
Let's go in first.

444
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,730
Chen Ye,

445
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,360
thank you for helping me find my mom.

446
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,270
I know it's hard for you.

447
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,740
For a long time,

448
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,700
my hesitation and contradictions

449
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,720
have made me lack the courage

450
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,520
to face my true self and you.

451
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,050
Wanqing.

452
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,860
At least

453
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,220
the result is not bad now.

454
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,170
I know

455
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,700
we all

456
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,570
have a gloomy past.

457
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,180
But I believe

458
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,360
the future must be bright.

459
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,770
Thank you for your persistence.

460
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,730
It's all because of me

461
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,150
that they are so happy now.

462
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,810
I should also take some credit for that.

463
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,320
So do I.

464
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,360
Are you talking about

465
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,100
those three slaps you gave me?

466
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,950
You...

467
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,640
I did that because I love you.

468
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,180
I love you too.

469
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,940
Thank you for your persistence.

470
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,260
Because you deserve it.

471
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,860
This is what a leading actor and a heroine should be like.

472
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,850
So romantic.

473

528
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,570
Ge!

529
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,360
♫The promise you keep♫

530
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,080
♫Shall also be inscribed♫

♫In the story about me♫

♫In my clear dream world♫

♫You travel through the parallel of time♫

535
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,090

♫Our destined meeting♫

539
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,010
Where am I?

540
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,390
Miss Ye.

541
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,830
I...

542
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,750
Why am I in the hospital?

543
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,610
Don't move.

544
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:32,940
Well...

545
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,790
You may...

546
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,020
Don't you remember?

547
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,590
You were in an accident

548
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,290
because

549
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,100
you were driving too fast.

550
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,030
Then...

551
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,820
We brought you to the hospital.

552
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
After that,

553
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,190
we resuscitated

554
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,140
you.

555
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,700
Then I treated you

556
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,180
with the telencephalon machine.

557
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,060
And then, I wrote a

558
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,190
novel...

559
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,370
about you.

560
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,030
Then...

561
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,350
You're recovered now.

562
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,290
That's all.

563
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,530
You are saying

564
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,540
that I was in a coma due to a car accident

565
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,220
and became a PVS.

566
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,060
Yes.

567
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,110
Then you guys used the telencephalon machine

568
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,670
in order to treat me.

569
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,680
Yes.

570
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,220
Then I entered the novel.

571
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,130
Now I'm out.

572
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,330
And then I recovered?

573
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,370
Yes.

574
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,550
You're amazing.

575
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,510
Your medical skills are really brilliant.

576
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,680
Not bad.

577
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,080
In fact, this treatment method

578
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,710
is equivalent to putting together a puzzle

579
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,440
in your brain.

580
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,650
But

581
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,140
you are only 50% done with your treatment now.

582
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,700
Only 50%?

583
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,940
What about the rest?

584
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,090
You're so smart

585
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,760
to remember him.

586
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,660
I'm going to check him out.

587
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,660
Wait here.

588
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,660
Let's go.

589
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,940
Wait a minute.

590
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,720
What's this?

591
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,110
What kind of nonsense did he just say?

592
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,790
How could I possibly believe that?

593
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,840
The rest?

594
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,680
The rest is in my head.

595
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,760
I don't need you.

596
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,410
What a fraud!

597
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,340
This looks kinda real.

598
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,240
There's even a picture of me here?

599
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,850
I'd better

600
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,150
get out of here.

601
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,580
I have to hurry up.
