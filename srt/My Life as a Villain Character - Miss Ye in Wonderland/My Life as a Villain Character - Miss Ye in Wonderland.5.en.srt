[Episode 05]

4
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,820
As long as you promise me one thing,

5
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,170
I'll let you stay here for a month

6
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,370
for free.

7
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,690
Don't try to do anything to me.

8
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,930
On the surface,

9
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,970
he said it was to let me visit my birth parents,

10
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,930
but he actually wanted to attend Lu Wanqing's birthday party.

11
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,740
He's married to me,

12
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,130
but he is still thinking about the heroine.

13
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,410
He's so ridiculous!

14
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,930
I can't believe he is so conceited!

15
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,570
Chen Ye will also be there.

16
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,970
Does it mean...

17
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,130
we are the assists?

18
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,650
This one is good.

19
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,970
After all, it's the heroine's birthday party.

20
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,090
It's not good if I'm more attractive than her.

21
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,930
The secondary leading actor's craft

22
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,170
is not bad.

23
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,810
Won't it affect the progress

24
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,450
if he becomes a competitor of the leading actor?

25
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,490
No.

26
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,660
I have to help the leading actor.

27
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,770
Experiments have shown that

28
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,330
recognition of physical appearance from the same gender

29
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,850
can bring relationships closer more quickly,

30
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,410
and physical contact can have unexpected effects.

31
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,690
I got it.

32
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,400
Wanqing,

33
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,410
you're so pretty today.

34
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,770
Where did you buy this dress?

35
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,650
It really suits your skin.

36
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,370
This is the haute couture of L store.

37
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,720
I'll send you the WeChat ID of that salesperson

38
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,210
if you like it.

39
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,010
No need.

40
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,730
I don't have to be as beautiful as you.

41
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,570
Dad.

42
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,730
This is a gift for you.

43
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,610
You will like it.

44
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,210
Thank you.

45
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,680
Cooperate with me.

46
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,130
Dad.

47
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,000
How have you been?

48
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,010
Mr. Ye.

49
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,120
Chen Ye is here.

50
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
Hello.

51
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,400
Happy birthday.

52
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,280
Thank you.

53
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,240
Miss Ye,

54
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,010
long time no see.

55
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,530
Hello, Mr. Chen.

56
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,160
Hello.

57
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,250
The secondary leading actor is indeed very average.

58
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,530
This is what a leading actor should look like.

59
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,450
I'm worried about you being cold.

60
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,159
Mr. Chen.

61
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,560
Look. Her birthday dress

62
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,920
is quite nice today, isn't it?

63
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,200
It's an extraordinary dress,

64
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,610
and it suits Miss Lu very well.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,800
Thank you.

66
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,730
Guys,

67
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,880
don't just stand here.

68
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,360
Let's go inside.

69
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,160
Muchen, let's go.

70
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,400
Okay. Dad.

71
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Tell me

72
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,880
if you are really not interested in Chen Ye.

73
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,360
Mom, don't take it upon yourself to make decisions.

74
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,890
I have my own plans.

75
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,720
Wanqing is so smart and beautiful.

76
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,440
She is a good match for Chen Ye.

77
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,120
Look.

78
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,640
Ge has such good taste in men.

79
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,330
Well...

80
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,840
You guys go ahead.

81
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,080
I'm off to do something.

82
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,880
Dad and mom did this.

83
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,530
It's good.

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,040
You don't mind?

85
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,360
I think

86
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
your taste is better.

87
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,050
Sister.

88
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,720
How come I didn't find you

89
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
so eloquent before?

90
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,320
You're flattering me.

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,480
You're already with Feng Muchen.

92
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,640
Why do you still want to meddle in my life

93
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,800
and set me up with Chen Ye?

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,640
I swear

95
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,480
I really think

96
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,600
you two are a good match.

97
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,680
If you think that I stole Feng Muchen from you,

98
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,720
then I am too wronged.

99
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,360
He doesn't deserve you at all.

100
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,760
The rest of your life will be very unhappy

101
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,440
if you marry him.

102
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,400
Just let me

103
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,320
bear this pain alone.

104
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,720
Sister,

105
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,440
there is no need for you to tell me over and over

106
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,920
that you and Feng Muchen are together.

107
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,560
I don't care.

108
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,040
You misunderstood me.

109
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,440
Recognition of physical appearance from the same gender

110
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,360
can bring relationships closer more quickly.

111
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,400
Look.

112
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
You have such a beautiful face,

113
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,159
such a slender and beautiful neck,

114
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:57,400
and this silky smooth skin.

115
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,200
Even if I spend 10,000 yuan for face-lifting injections

116
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,880
and 30,000 yuan for Thermage...

[Recommendation][Following]

118
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,640
There are so many cosmetic cases on this app,

119
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,440
but they can't be as beautiful as you.

120
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,400
What are you doing?

121
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,280
I haven't seen you for too long,

122
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,320
so I miss you.

123
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,550
Don't you want to talk to me?

124
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,040
Fine.

125
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,150
It was my bad.

126
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,230
I used to try to steal everything from you.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,880
But right now,

128
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,240
I just want to tell you what I really think.

129
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
I'm glad you know that

130
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,120
you are the one who stole Feng Muchen from me.

131
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,110
Feng Mu Chen is a black sheep.

132
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,950
You should pay attention to Chen Ye who has potential.

133
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,110
Whether it's a black sheep or a potential person.

134
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,800
This is not how I choose my boyfriend.

135
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,190
Women should rely on themselves.

136
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,120
Sister, you...

137
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,830
knew that Feng Muchen is not good,

138
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,280
but you still wanted to be with him.

139
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,430
Aren't you just a love-struck person?

140
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,360
I...

141
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,480
Wanqing,

142
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,800
what are you doing here?

143
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,120
Let's wish the most beautiful Wanqing

144
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,870
a happy birthday!

145
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,440
Wanqing!

146
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,390
Let's go.

147
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,630
Let's go together.

148
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,830
Your nasty sister

149
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,200
can piss us off.

150
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,789
I feel so unfair for you!

151
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,830
I really want to get back at her for you.

152
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,150
Stop thinking about that.

153
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,230
Let's go singing.

154
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,190
Come on.

155
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,990
Let our birthday girl

156
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,870
sing a song for us all, okay?

157
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,430
OK.

158
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,190
It's all right.

159
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,670
Miss Lu,

160
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,950
happy birthday.

161
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,400
Thank you.

162
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,110
You're welcome.

163
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,710
The leading actor is taking the initiative?

164
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,590
Great!

165
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,590
God.

166
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,920
How does he sing...

167
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,440
He matches the heroine so well.

168
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,430
I can no longer sing a song

169
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,310
that makes me blush and want to hide when I hear it.

170
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,950
Wange, come on!

171
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,750
Whatever. I'll go in and see what happens.

172
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,990
It's Wanqing's birthday today.

173
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,870
Let's all toast together, shall we?

174
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,870
OK.

175
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,520
Wait a minute, I'll go get a drink.

176
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,150
Wange, here.

177
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:48,870
Thank you.

178
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,510
You're welcome.

179
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,310
Come on.

180
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,230
Let's wish the birthday girl

181
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,150
a happy birthday and a happy future.

182
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,710
Happy birthday.

183
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,860
This wine

184
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,190
is so strong.

185
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,710
Chengji,

186
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,310
I think I just saw

187
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,190
a girl outside who was drunk.

188
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,310
Go take a look.

189
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,550
Where?

190
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,910
Over there.

191
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,670
I'm not joking.

192
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,950
Go. Go.

193
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,140
Miss, let me help you.

194
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,590
Dad,

195
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,430
what do you have to worry about

196
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,980
at this price and quality?

197
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,140
Muchen,

198
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,700
Although the master has retired,

199
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,540
his subordinates are still here.

200
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,700
You and I are both sons-in-law.

201
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,870
You can understand this, right?

202
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,980
Don't worry.

203
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,950
I'm sure I can convince Mr. Ye.

204
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,230
This girl is so cute.

205
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,470
Wait a minute.

206
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,350
You are indeed my good son-in-law.

207
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,420
Here he comes.

208
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,230
Speak of the devil.

209
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,940
Answer it.

210
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,500
Mr. Ye.

211
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,630
Where's Ge?

212
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,580
She and I just got back to her parents' house.

213
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,190
We haven't had a chance to visit you yet.

214
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,110
Give the phone to her.

215
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,860
She's not with me right now.

216
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,940
How many times have I told you?

217
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,190
Don't let her out of your sight.

218
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,900
Don't you know her character?

219
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,100
Find her.

220
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,270
I have something to tell her.

221
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,340
OK, I'll go find her now.

222
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,940
Have you seen Ye Wange?

223
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,670
No.

224
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,230
Miss,

225
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,030
please sing me a song.

226
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,460
Don't drag me.

227
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,100
Mr. Feng.

228
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,710
Mr. Feng.

229
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,150
Are you looking for Ye Wange?

230
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,230
There is one thing

231
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,980
I am not sure if I should tell you.

232
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:30,940
What is it?

233
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,700
It's not a big deal.

234
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,500
It's just Miss Ye, she...

235
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,100
What's going on?

236
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,980
Miss Ye

237
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,830
and one of Wanqing's male friends

238
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,620
had just entered that room.

239
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,500
I think there's something not quite right

240
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,420
about them.

241
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,980
How about I sing a song for you?

242
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,140
Who are you? I don't know you.

243
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,820
Just sing me a song.

244
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,500
Ye Wange.

245
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,700
Miss, please sing a song for me.

246
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,580
I like you so much.

247
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,830
How about I sing for you?

248
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,020
Cousin?

249
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,310
Zou Chengji.

250
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,180
How much did you drink?

251
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,980
Take your clothes.

252
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,380
Cousin...

253
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:36,770
Sit up.

254
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,850
Cousin.

255
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,180
I can explain, cousin.

256
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,380
Please let me explain, cousin.

257
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,380
Cousin!

258
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,850
Ye Wange.

259
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,700
How come you don't have self-respect?

260
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,970
If I had come a little later you would have been in danger.

261
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,020
I didn't know anything, okay?

262
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,970
Stop lying.

263
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,540
Why would I lie?

264
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,290
And the boy didn't seem to

265
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,780
be trying to do anything to me.

266
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,020
He recognized me as that...

267
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,970
That idol.

268
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,330
So what do you think I should do?

269
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,300
It will be troublesome

270
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,580
for you and me,

271
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,780
if this matter is known to others.

272
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,100
Why are you yelling at me?

273
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,890
Shouldn't we focus on

274
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,060
why this would happen?

275
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,020
No.

276
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:03,850
This wine...

277
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,620
Something was wrong with that wine.

278
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,810
Stop messing around.

279
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,090
I'll take you home now.

280
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,170
I want to throw up.

281
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,420
Hold it.

282
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,180
Let me off.

283
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,140
What?

284
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,940
The heat is killing me.

285
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,250
I feel so bad.

286
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,620
I want some water.

287
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,580
Do you want more?

288
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,490
I miss my mom.

289
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,650
I want to go home.

290
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,540
I want to go home.

291
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,930
Go home...

292
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,570
I shouldn't have let you come.

293
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,050
Mr. Feng.

294
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,610
What happened to her?

295
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,290
She's drunk.

296
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,850
I've never seen her drink so much.

297
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,090
You didn't take good care of her.

298
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:40,970
Boss.

299
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,810
Just let him send her upstairs.

300
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,850
By the way, let Ms. Zhang come over.

301
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,810
Ye Wange.

302
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,210
How come you don't have self-respect?

303
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,730
I didn't know anything.

304
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,930
Why would I lie?

305
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,290
Something was wrong with that wine.

306
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,490
Did I misunderstand her?

307
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,609
She has changed so much

308
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,609
to be with me.

309
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:15,770
What?

310
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,650
She has become deliberately not interested in me now,

311
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,650
and is playing hard to get...

312
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,450
Then why should we get married?

313
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,329
Besides,

314
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,410
we don't know each other very well.

315
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,850
Let's forget about the marriage.

316
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,650
She used so many ploys

317
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,450
just to be with me.

318
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,810
I

319
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,360
agree that you are together.

320
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,610
She still loves me so much.

321
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,010
Should I be nice to her?

322
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,090
No.

323
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,530
She

324
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,010
is just a pawn for me to revive the Feng family.

325
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,080
I can't fall in love with her.

326
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,440
Hot milk should make her feel better.

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,520
I can take you home

349
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,880
if you don't want to stay here.

350
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,280
Home?

351
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,120
I want to go back too.

352
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,200
Then I'll pack your things now.

353
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,240
Let's go right away.

354
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,290
You can't take me back.

355
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,280
That home is really dangerous for you.

356
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,760
This matter today is my fault.

357
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,170
I will find out the truth.

358
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,880
But I don't think...

359
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,600
Lu Wanqing did it.

360
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,850
She's not so stupid

361
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,680
that she would screw up her birthday party.

362
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,720
Miss,

363
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,320
you're still so kind.

364
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,640
What happened to Ning Yuan?

365
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,290
The word kindness has nothing to do

366
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,720
with Ye Wange in the novel.

367
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,880
Maybe only Ye Wange in the novel

368
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,970
has such a loyal bodyguard.

369
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,450
Please take a break.

370
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm off to work now.

371
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,040
I'm still a little dizzy.

372
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,880
I didn't expect that

373
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
the fictional world would be more difficult

374
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,880
than the real world.

375
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,440
And I'm the unsupported

376
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,720
secondary leading actress.

377
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm so unlucky.

378
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,160
What's going on?

379
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,600
I'm not...

380
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,920
Go away. I don't need your help.

381
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,680
I'm going back then.

382
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,320
I won't...

383
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,040
Are you going to swim in it all day?

384
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,030
I'm in pain.

385
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,920
Hold me tight.

386
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,950
Are you okay?

387
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Ye Wange,

388
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,080
you did it on purpose, didn't you?

389
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,200
No.

390
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,240
It hurts.

391
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,360
Hold my neck tight.

392
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,070
Be careful.

393
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,400
Princess hug again.

394
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,680
Why is the author torturing me

395
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,750
with this cheesy plot again?

396
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,240
But

397
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,470
how come I didn't realize

398
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,960
that he was actually a bit handsome?

399
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,510
Don't stare at me.

400
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,750
Be gentle.

401
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,550
I didn't touch you.

402
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,480
I told you to be gentle.

403
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,120
You did it on purpose. Apologize to me.

404
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,670
Apologize!

405
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,670
It will hurt more

406
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,240
if you move again.

407
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,160
Boss.

408
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,600
My favorite scenery...

409
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,280
Let me tell you.

410
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,150
The more the two people who hate each other at the beginning,

411
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,560
the better their relationship later would be.

412
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,480
How do you know?

413
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,790
That's how it works in those dramas.

414
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,910
Usually they will kiss in the eighth episode.

415
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,230
Now it's only the fifth episode

416
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,680
and it's already happening.

417
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,120
Ms. Zhang, you're so professional.

418
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,600
Don't you two have anything to do?

419
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,830
Thank you.

420
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,230
You're welcome.

421
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,950
I mean,

422
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,310
isn't it time for you to get out?

423
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,870
Okay.

424
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,910
Go.

425
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,550
I'm so smart.

426
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,670
What?

427
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,600
Do it yourself.

428
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,190
I'll help you if you can't.

429
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,710
Don't peek.

430
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,630
I won't.

431
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,510
What's wrong?

432
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,750
Come here.

433
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,260
What do you want?

434
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,150
Head down please.

435
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,860
What did you put on me? So cold.

436
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,030
What is it?

437
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,420
What's wrong with that, boss?

438
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,860
Do you feel icy and sore on this side of your face?

439
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,660
No.

440
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,790
Maybe I have a thicker skin.

441
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,430
The company is expanding new business in Mars.

442
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,630
I think you're quite suitable.

443
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,350
Boss.

444
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,110
Boss!

445
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,430
I don't want to leave you, boss.

446
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,140
What are you looking at?

447
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,460
You are suitable

448
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,870
to go to Mars!
