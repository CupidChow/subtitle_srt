00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,750
Feng Muchen, you did this on purpose, didn't you?

178
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,390
The water is up to my neck.

179
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,840
Stand up.

180
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,380
The water level is only up to your ankles.

181
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,030
Right? So shallow.

182
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,030
Let's go.

183
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,510
The water is too deep here, isn't it?

184
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,070
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

185
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,990
No, no.

186
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,390
You knew I was afraid of getting into water,

187
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,190
and you brought me here.

188
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,510
What if I drift away?

189
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,760
I want to go back.

190
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,070
I'll protect you.

191
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,130
And think about it.

192
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,910
Will what you are afraid of

193
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,230
avoid you because of your fear?

194
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,590
Besides,

195
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,000
what if

196
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,790
you accidentally fall into the water

197
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,150
when I am not with you one day?

198
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,410
Can your fear save you?

199
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,280
Do you want to give it a try?

200
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,140
All right then.

201
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,990
No. I can't do it.

202
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,360
It's too deep.

203
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,550
Feng Muchen!

204
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,200
Stop moving.

205
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,710
I might not be able to control myself if you keep moving.

206
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,920
Feng Muchen, you rascal.

207
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,480
There's something.

208
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,280
Didn't you call me a rascal?

209
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,180
Now you are the one who took the initiative to hug me.

210
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,440
Then why did you just say that you might not be able to control yourself?

211
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,190
I was just talking about the sand at the bottom of the sea.

212
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,230
I can't control the balance

213
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,620
if you keep moving.

214
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,180
I was talking about sand, too.

215
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,070
Put me down.

216
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,710
Let's try again?

217
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,550
I have a gift for you.

218
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,510
What is it?

219
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,390
Facekini.

220
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,620
Put it on.

221
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,420
It's too ugly.

222
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,990
I'm not going to rob a bank.

223
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,140
Put this on,

224
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
and no one will stare at you.

225
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,630
No!

226
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,990
Come on, gather around.

227
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,980
Next, there are two pieces of news.

228
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,990
One good news

229
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,020
and one bad news.

230
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,750
The good news is that

231
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,550
there will be female group dances

232
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,280
at the music festival tonight.

233
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,100
Great.

234
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,750
However, due to the limited funds of the event organizer,

235
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,180
there are still two dances missing.

236
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,790
Therefore,

237
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,030
we have to organize two groups

238
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,510
to dance.

239
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,610
Raise your hand if you volunteer.

240
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,630
They won't ask me to do it, right?

241
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,310
Right?

242
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,030
We just need to cheer them on.

243
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,150
Anyone?

244
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,390
Anyone?

245
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,950
Everyone...

246
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,810
Yuan, how about we join together?

247
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,900
Great! Lu Waning.

248
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,550
Very good.

249
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,910
Anyone else?

250
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,110
I don't have to go now.

251
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,980
Anyone else?

252
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,100
Me!

253
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,260
Ye Wange.

254
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,270
Great. Ye Wange.

255
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,230
Lu Waning.

256
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,780
You can team up

257
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,630
and start rehearsing now.

258
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,540
I'll go back and check

259
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,700
in an hour.

260
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,100
No...

261
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,750
I...

262
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,190
All right.

263
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,710
Go ahead and get ready.

264
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,390
Mr. Yang.

265
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,740
Go have fun.

266
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,150
Hurry up and rehearse.

267
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
See you in an hour.

268
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,140
I'm done.

269
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,330
Are you going to dance?

270
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,460
Could she be controlled by the author?

271
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,700
Yin, you're the best.

272
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,380
Let's do it together

273
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,740
and I'll buy you the best helmet.

274
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,940
No way.

275
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,420
How can I face my helmet and motorcycle

276
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,860
if I join a girl group dance?

277
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,220
What?

278
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,980
What's next?

279
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,340
What are you two dancing?

280
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,700
You guys

281
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,100
are really bad at dancing.

282
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,500
I don't know how to dance.

283
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,020
We can still improve.

284
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,350
Progress takes time.

285
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,550
Have a drink, come on.

286
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,030
It's about to start.

287
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,280
How can you get on stage like this?

288
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
This is my cousin.

289
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,420
He knows some girl group dances.

290
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,060
Me?

291
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,900
I can't do it.

292
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,570
I only like to watch. But I don't know how to dance.

293
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,340
No, no, no.

294
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,100
I really don't know how to dance.

295
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,760
He can do it.

296
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,740
I can't do it!

297
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,460
Not bad.

298
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,980
Look at his flexibility.

299
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,310
Cousin, I really can't do it.

300
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,060
You can do it.

301
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,300
I have an idea.

302
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,380
Right?

303
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,190
That makes two of us.

304
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
Thank you.

305
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,210
Come on. Come on.

306
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,860
Ge.

307
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,860
No, you're dressing too scantily.

308
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,850
Your arms, belly

309
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,650
and thighs are exposed.

310
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,220
People will see.

311

[HAPPY LUCKY]

312
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,170
Put it on.

313
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,230
You can't be seen dressed like this.

314

You'd better worry about yourself.

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,260
♫No one is more important than you♫

350
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,920
♫The world is not as good as you are♫

351
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,060
I didn't understand

352
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,250
why you would fall in love with Feng Muchen.

353
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,850
Now I finally know.

354
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,410
What do you know?

355
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,940
I observed with my eyes.

356
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,330
He first asked me to dance with you,

357
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,770
and then asked Zou Chengji to join too.

358
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,380
In the end, he even participated in person.

359
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,650
What does this mean?

360
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,900
It shows that he cares about you.

361
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,050
He knew you were shy.

362
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,930
Feng Muchen is indeed very different from the way he used to be.

363
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,099
Here's the wine.

364
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,150
What are you talking about?

365
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,890
Why are you looking at me like that?

366
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,210
Are you okay?

367
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,849
Stay out of girls' business.

368
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,090
I remember one thing.

369
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,810
I haven't officially called her cousin-in-law yet.

370
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,650
That's it?

371
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,770
You have to call her that too.

372
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,570
Why should I?

373
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,890
You are my girlfriend.

374
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,730
Go away!

375
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,090
Stop!

376
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,040
Look how happy they are...

377
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,010
How about I take you to the beach for some fresh air

378
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,730
to sober up?

379
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,210
Look at the sea.

380
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,010
So beautiful.

381
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,090
Do you like it?

382
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,370
Yes.

383
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,170
Do you like it?

384
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,370
Yep.

385
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,130
Feng Muchen.

386
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,240
There are stars

387
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,490
in your eyes.

388
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,090
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,170
I can't...

390
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,370
Sorry.

391
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,370
It's my fault.

392
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,130
It's not your fault.

393
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,690
I want you to know that

394
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,170
I can't do that now

395
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,200
or ever.

396
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,730
Are you okay with that?

397
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,800
No.

398
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,970
There's no one here.

399
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,800
I mean

400
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,890
can you accept it

401
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,860
if I can't fall in love with you

402
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,650
for some reason?

403
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,720
Why would you suddenly say that?

404
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,960
Because

405
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,800
you've been so nice to me lately.

406
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,600
I want to make it clear to you.

407
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,050
Is that the reason?

408
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,040
Yes.

409
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,880
Feng Muchen is so nice to me.

410
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,330
How should I repay him?

411
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,410
Should I marry him?

412
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,520
So why is he being so nice to me?

413
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,040
He's nice to everyone.

414
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,480
Are you overthinking it?

415
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,480
It turns out he didn't do it

416
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,080
because he liked me.

417
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,560
You want me to like you?

418
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,360
No.

419
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't.

420
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,810
Why are you laughing?

421
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,040
Is it funny?

422
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,400
What are you doing?

423
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,960
Stop laughing.

424
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,690
It's so late!

425
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,440
Someone is here.

426
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,970
Hurry up!

427
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,560
Run!

428
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,680
Wait for me.

429
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,200
Run!

430
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:22,760
Go!

431
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,160
The bald bear is behind us. Run.

432
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,440
Hurry!

433
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,280
Go to sleep.

434
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,880
What's going on?

435
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,920
Go to sleep.

436
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,390
I'll just sit out here for the night.

437
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
I can protect you.

438
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,640
Go.

439
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,560
Anyway.

440
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,440
Come in and sleep.

441
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,400
I'm fine.

442
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,320
It's just a little cold.

443
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,720
Just leave me alone here.

444
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,520
Go.

445
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,760
Stop acting.

446
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,120
Come in.

447
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,960
Well,

448
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll do as you say.

449
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,110
I love chicken drumsticks.

450
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,150
We can finally

451
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,320
sleep together.

452
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,230
Shut up!

453
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,480
Go away!

454
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,440
You rascal!

455
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,990
Your head is on my hand.

456
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,720
Get up.

457
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,480
It's okay now.

458
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,640
Just sleep.

459
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,400
What are you doing?

460
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,060
Good night.

461
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,910
Good night.

462
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,970
You're pregnant and you're still drinking?

463
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,010
I do have to be careful.

464
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,550
How self-disciplined do you have to be?

465
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,200
Is this

466
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,030
okay?

467
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,110
Naughty girl.

468
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,030
By the way,

469
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,320
I think I was seen

470
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,370
driving you home last time.

471
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,350
That's Ge's grandpa.

472
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,750
That old man

473
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,030
has been in very poor health lately.

474
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,830
He's about to die.

475
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,070
And Ge.

476
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,030
They'll all be dead soon.

477
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,750
When all these people are dead,

478
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,790
the Ye's Group should change its name to the Shen's Group, right?

479
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,700
[Anyhike]

480
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,170
Yuan, morning.

481
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,350
The sun has just risen.

482
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,950
Why don't you get more sleep?

483
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,350
I'm not sleepy.

484
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,470
Are you going surfing?

485
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,550
Yes.

486
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,550
The waves are steady in the morning.

487
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,430
Will what you are afraid of

488
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,230
avoid you because of your fear?

489
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,770
Can your fear save you?

490
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,910
How about you take me with you?

491
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,640
You want to surf with me?

492
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:30,790
Sure.

493
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,940
Let's go.

494
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,870
The waves are small at this moment.

495
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,070
It doesn't seem that hard.

496
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,430
Yuan, come here.

497
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,030
It's comfortable there.

498
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,430
Hurry up.

499
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:56,940
Hello?

500
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:03,990
Okay.

501
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,520
I'll be right there.

502
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,030
All the information is here.

503
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,630
Ye Wange should not be in trouble, right?

504
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,910
Yuan.

505
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,190
Yes.

506
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,950
All the information you asked me to collect

507
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,510
is here.

508
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,710
Good.

509
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,190
This is not the company,

510
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,850
you don't have to be so formal.

511
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,000
Where is Ge?

512
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,540
She went to the beach.
