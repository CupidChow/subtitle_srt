5
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,940
Feng Muchen.

6
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,639
You're awake.

7
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,170
Why are we here?

8
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,230
Ge.

9
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,780
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,230
I thought too little.

11
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,520
I was too impatient and made you faint.

12
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,030
What did you do?

13
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,110
Lie down and take a rest.

14
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,030
I'm gonna call the doctor.

15
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,560
Wait for me.

16
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,310
Tuck your covers in. Don't catch a cold.

17
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,579
I went to the doctor.

18
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,690
Why am I here all of a sudden?

19
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,460
How long has it been since I've had skin management?

20
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,430
I have fine lines and blackheads.

21
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,640
Where did my eyelashes go?

22
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,820
I have a wedding to throw.

23
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,850
Well, I got you.

24
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,579
Can you get me some sexy lace pajamas

25
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,430
from the luxury store next door?

26
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,160
I want the black one. By the way,

27
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,560
I also want a perfume called the Morning After.

28
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,090
You know about this, right?

29
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,640
I'm talking to you.

30
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,010
Do you hear me?

31
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,630
Have dinner, please. After a concussion,

32
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,540
neurosis is normal.

33
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,100
It's okay.

34
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,220
How can you talk like that?

35
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,660
Who's insane?

36
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,829
Is this food for people?

37
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,890
This food looks awful. Throw it away.

38
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,120
Ge, I'm back.

39
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,430
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,430
Nothing.

41
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,640
I'm just a little hungry.

42
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,750
Mr. Feng.

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,370
Take her home and look after her.

44
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,300
Please call the doctor for me.

45
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,070
Okay.

46
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,210
Thank you.

47
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,970
You sit down and eat.

48
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,610
Honey, have some too.

49
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,670
What did you just call me?

50
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,040
What else am I suppose to call you?

51
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,320
Husband?

52
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,550
Have some rice.

53
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,860
The food here is terrible.

54
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,560
Let's eat out.

55
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,990
Let's wait.

56
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,800
The doctor hasn't been here

57
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,770
to look at it yet.

58
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,790
No.

59
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,460
I'm all right. Look.

60
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,250
I'm fine.

61
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,290
Then you put this suit on.

62
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,140
Whose clothes are these?

63
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,330
Ning Yuan, didn't you bring

64
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,480
my clothes?

65
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,190
I...

66
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,010
Feng, let's go out and buy some.

67
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,790
I haven't shopped in a while.

68
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,150
Okay, I'll take your bag.

69
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,250
You go change your clothes

70
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,150
and see which mall to go to.

71
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,780
Is there something wrong with her?

72
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,190
I think it's normal.

73
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,510
It makes her looks like Mr. Ye's daughter now,

74
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,750
not like us.

75
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,280
What are we like?

76
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,780
Grass roots.

77
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,630
Let's go.

78
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,850
When did you buy this necklace? So ugly.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,080
It gave me a neck line.

80
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,480
Don't leave the necklace lying around. Here.

81
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,550
I want you to buy me a new one.

82
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,110
I'll buy whatever you like.

83
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,010
Miss, how about I buy you some

84
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,500
health care products to nourish your brain?

85
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,800
Health care?

86
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,640
Health care products?

87
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,720
Nourish the brain.

88
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,420
Boss.

89
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,340
I kind of miss Miss Ye.

90
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,730
Ye, how addicted you are?

91
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,750
How did you come straight from the hospital to the mall?

92
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,190
Yin, when did you get back?

93
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,020
I miss you so much.

94
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,620
I can barely breathe.

95
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,710
Who is this?

96
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,990
He's kind of cute.

97
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,330
What about the other three boys?

98
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,650
Why is there only one left?

99
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,420
How come sister-in-law doesn't know me?

100
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,510
I don't know.

101
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,159
What did you just call me?

102
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,470
Sister-in-law?

103
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,760
You're so good at talking. You should talk more.

104
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,840
Okay, okay.

105
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,690
Did the doctor say why you fainted?

106
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,540
I think you're having trouble with your head.

107
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,490
First, you said no to Feng Muchen's proposal.

108
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,590
And then you came here do the shopping.

109
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,390
Wait a minute.

110
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,630
I turned down his proposal?

111
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,600
Yes. You forgot?

112
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,220
How's that possible?

113
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,990
Get out of the way. Feng.

114
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,080
How could I say no to you?

115
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,720
You're a little different than you used to be.

116
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,000
But I can't tell you

117
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,220
what's different.

118
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,380
You got kicked in the head by a donkey?

119
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,460
You got kicked in the head by a donkey.

120
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,790
Different? I don't think so.

121
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,940
You must be tired of shopping.

122
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,870
Have some water.

123
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,350
They like being lovey-dovey.

124
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,020
Be quiet.

125
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,440
Where else do you want to go?

126
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,960
I want to eat ice cream.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,580
Okay.

128
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,560
Ice cream.

129
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,520
Thank you.

130
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,280
Ge's supplementary card.

131
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,870
Why were the bells ringing so much?

132
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,280
Surprise, daddy.

133
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,470
I haven't seen you dressed like that for a long time.

134
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
This is for you.

135
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,360
Nice. You used my card to give me a gift.

136
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,680
You are so filial.

137
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,260
How is it going?

138
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,120
Did you quarrel with Feng Muchen?

139
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,160
No.

140
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,950
We've just finished shopping.

141
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,690
Then you can go back after your delivery.

142
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,770
Go back? Where am I going back?

143
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,060
Go back to Feng family.

144
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,480
Feng family?

145
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,450
Did I really have a concussion?

146
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,400
What did you say?

147
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,230
Dad.

148
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,020
There's something

149
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,680
I wanted to ask you.

150
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,720
Go ahead.

151
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,260
How did you handle

152
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,100
the whole fake pregnancy thing?

153
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,740
You lost your memory?

154
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,220
Maybe there's been so much acting.

155
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,940
I'm a little confused.

156
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,410
Why did Feng Muchen proposed to me

157
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,700
as soon as I woke up from the hospital?

158
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,870
You really lost your memory.

159
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,060
Let me ask you.

160
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,070
Do you remember that you own a stock?

161
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,310
A stock?

162
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,940
I don't suppose

163
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,230
Feng Muchen's marrying me for the stock.

164
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,470
That's possible.

165
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,930
I can get it back for you.

166
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,310
How about I take care of it for you?

167
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,350
No.

168
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,660
Feng Muchen is the man I consider my husband.

169
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,260
I'm gonna give him the stock.

170
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,140
Dad.

171
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,260
If I give him all my stock shares,

172
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,760
will he ask me to marry him a second time?

173
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,060
This is the family's misfortune.

174
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,690
Why would I buy

175
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,410
something so pink?

176
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,150
So rustic.

177
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,100
Well, miss.

178
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,750
You changed your dressing style

179
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,510
since you woke up from the coma.

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,280
And the way I speak and act?

181
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:20,930
Yes.

182
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,390
Wouldn't that be weird

183
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,160
for you and Feng Muchen?

184
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,470
I'm used to

185
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,150
your changing personality.

186
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,320
But Mr. Feng seems more comfortable with it than I am.

187
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,700
Comfortable?

188
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,500
After I passed out,

189
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,400
Feng Muchen was with me?

190
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,630
Yes.

191
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,590
Two days later, you were together.

192
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,380
Miss, what's wrong?

193
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,580
I think I got hurt and lost my memory.

194
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,440
I can't remember many things.

195
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,350
How about this?

196
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,220
Why don't you tell me

197
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,580
who I really am?

198
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,300
Okay.

199
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,210
I will

200
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,100
tell you

201
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,270
what happened in the meantime.

202
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,730
I'm sure you'll remember.

203
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,970
First you passed out.

204
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,260
When you woke up,

205
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,130
you had many changes

206
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,480
in your life habits.

207
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,870
For example, you wore before

208
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,640
were light in color.

209
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,140
Ye Wange.

210
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,180
Who called me?

211
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,380
First you passed out.

212
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,820
When you woke up,

213
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,720
you had many changes

214
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,230
in your life habits.

215
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,640
Is this the space of consciousness

216
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
that Feng Muchen was talking about?

217
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,250
Oh my God.

218
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,930
I...

219
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,470
I can't believe Feng Muchen likes cute girls.

220
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,740
But now that I'm back,

221
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,830
it's only right that

222
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,920
I return it to its rightful owner.

223
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,290
Well.

224
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,730
It's not me.

225
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,870
It's her.

226
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,050
Ye Wange from the novel is back.

227
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,160
I didn't mean to take over your life.

228
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,840
But... wearing my clothes,

229
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,670
imitating my expression...

230
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,350
What do you mean?

231
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,590
Ye Wange.

232
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,150
When did you buy this necklace?

233
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,390
It's ugly.

234
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,860
That's not true.

235
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,060
The author wants you to marry her,

236
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,620
but she's too resistant.

237
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,260
She doesn't want to marry me?

238
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,390
No.

239
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,220
She has her own considerations.

240
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,560
However, it was her refusal that

241
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,470
caused her to pass out unexpectedly.

242
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,260
Just like the last time

243
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,120
you took the liberty of changing the plot,

244
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,790
it also goes against the direction of the plot set by the author.

245
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,460
Now the author

246
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,490
forcibly follows Ye Wange's idea,

247
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,600
and the punishment for her isn't over yet.

248
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,030
Because she rejected my proposal,

249
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,290
she was punished.

250
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,630
But she's still here.

251
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,070
What kind of punishment is that?

252
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,100
Feng Muchen!

253
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,850
You're still up?

254
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,450
I... had a nightmare.

255
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,880
In my dream, everyone ignored me.

256
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,020
And you didn't like me anymore.

257
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,200
Feng Muchen, don't be fooled.

258
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,250
She's not me.

259
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,660
I'm right here.

260
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,500
How could I not like you?

261
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,080
Luckily it was a dream.

262
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,360
It's all right now.

263
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,780
Get some rest.

264
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,210
I'm going to bed, too.

265
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,400
Ge.

266
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
How about

267
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,320
sleeping here tonight?

268
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,310
I'm worried

269
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,760
you're gonna have nightmares later.

270
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,020
No.

271
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,470
Feng Muchen.

272
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,230
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

273
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,350
I don't want to.

274
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,240
Okay, okay.

275
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,340
Why would I take advantage of you?

276
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,180
You...

277
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,630
Just stay here and talk with me for a while.

278
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,100
When you get sleepy,

279
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,720
I'll get you back to your bed.

280
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,600
Okay?

281
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,230
Okay.

282
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,120
Just for a bit while.

283
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,950
But, don't cross the line.

284
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,850
In that way,

285
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,940
she is my Ge.

286
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,570
You bitch.

287
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,190
I can't believe you copied my face

288
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,470
and my movements.

289
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,340
Okay.

290
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,660
Feng Muchen, you...

291
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,760
I won't cross the line.

292
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,370
Feng Muchen, are you blind?

293
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,760
Feng Muchen.

294
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,910
Do you also think

295
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,740
I was weird during the day?

296
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,190
I don't know what's wrong with me.

297
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,040
Feng Muchen, don't you dare hold her.

298
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:30,730
You!

299
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,830
It's my fault I proposed to you today,

300
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,460
and you got punished.

301
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,520
But no matter what you become,

302
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,580
I will never leave you.

303
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,970
Really?

304
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,600
I...

305
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,740
I didn't mean to steal your life.

306
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,110
But why did you take away my Feng Muchen?

307
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,500
That's my Feng Muchen.

308
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,400
Well, that proposal,

309
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,370
I didn't want to reject you.

310
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,870
But for some reason,

311
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,860
I said something I didn't mean.

312
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,200
Really? You want to marry me?

313
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,210
Who wants to marry you?

314
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,410
There was no ceremony

315
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,319
in that proposal.

316
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,410
Ge,

317
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,940
I'm gonna give you

318
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,810
a super ceremonial proposal someday.

319
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:23,619
Okay.

320
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,980
It suddenly occurred to me that

321
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,430
the light in my room seemed to be broken.

322
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,130
I'm a little scared.

323
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,510
I wonder if I could sleep with you tonight.

324
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,700
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

325
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,570
Go to sleep.

326
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,700
Feng Muchen, you...

327
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,530
You're gonna sleep with her?

328
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,950
You're gonna ask her to marry you?

329
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,550
I...

330
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,140
No.

331
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:54,640
I...

332
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Why does it smell like pepper?

333
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,530
A pepper perfume?

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,010
Whether she's Ge or not?

348
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,510
What's wrong?

349
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,590
It suddenly occurred to me that

350
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,070
I had some work to finish.

351
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,620
I might have to stay up all night.

352
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,150
You can sleep here.

353
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,150
I'll get to work.

354
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,830
Come on, Feng.

355
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,030
Am I not being cute enough?

356
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,940
Feng Muchen.

357
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,590
You can't get away with it.

358
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,050
Feng.

359
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,230
Feng, the sun is shining today.

360
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,030
I'm so hot.

361
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,670
Help me, Feng!

362
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,180
It's so cold.

363
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,560
Are you hot too?

364
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,230
Let me help you.

365
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,430
No, no. I'm not hot.

366
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,500
Feng, you have a lot of strength.

367
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,710
Feng, let's go over there to cool off.

368
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,660
Feng, I want to play in the sea.

369
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,760
Come on. Come on.

370
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,080
Feng, hurry up.

371
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,220
Whether I should ask her to marry me?

372
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,240
Feng, am I beautiful?

373
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,380
You even

374
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,750
took her to the beach.

375
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,080
Feng,

376
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,270
why haven't you asked me to marry you?

377
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,530
Am I not being good enough?

378
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,550
I wonder

379
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,500
if this is the same ring you used to propose.

380
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,280
Yes.

381
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,790
I said something I didn't mean last time.

382
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,740
But I won't do it this time.

383
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,180
I won't turn you down this time,

384
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,670
and I'll give you all of Ye's shares.

385
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,130
I want you to have faith in me

386
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,070
and our lives.

387
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,240
Ye's shares?

388
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,340
Yes.

389
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,980
Don't you want it?

390
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,250
Feng Muchen, you can't marry her.

391
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,620
She's not me. She's not me.

392
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,980
Feng Muchen, you can't marry her.

393
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,750
You said I was the one you wanted to spend the rest of your life with.

394
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,540
I regret it.

395
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,760
I shouldn't have hesitated.

396
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,470
I shouldn't have thought so much.

397
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,800
And I shouldn't have said no to you.

398
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,060
I'll marry you.

399
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,440
I'm so scared

400
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,260
without you right now.

401
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,190
I just want to get back to you.

402
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,540
Feng Muchen, can you hear me?

403
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,640
Can you hear me?

404
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,900
Ge! Ge!

405
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,940
I'm here, Feng.

406
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,690
No.

407
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,000
She's not Ge.

408
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,990
I can't ask her to marry me.

409
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,970
I was thinking maybe this proposal

410
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,540
wasn't very ceremonial, you know.

411
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,170
I'll let Yun Yi take you home first.

412
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:53,760
Next time

413
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,340
I'll surprise you with a proposal.

414
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,060
Oh, I see, Feng.

415
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,560
You're the best.

416
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,470
Then I'll wait for you.

417
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,840
Ge.

418
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,780
I'm here, Feng Muchen.

419
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,540
Where are you, Ge?

420
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,780
