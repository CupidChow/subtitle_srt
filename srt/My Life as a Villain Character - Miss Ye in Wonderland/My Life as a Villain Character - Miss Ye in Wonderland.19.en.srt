00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,690
Let's go.

178
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,710
Who says I don't want to read?

179
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,000
I will read.

180
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,820
What a weirdo.

181
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,570
Isn't my lipstick pretty?

182
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,940
It's pretty.

183
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,810
This is a library book.

184
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,890
How can you do this?

185
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,970
It's just a book.

186
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,730
I'll just buy it.

187
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,330
Why are you yelling at me?

188
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,790
How about this?

189
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,390
I don't think you're interested in reading.

190
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,980
Let me take you to the mall.

191
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,310
Really?

192
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,340
I'm happy

193
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,360
as long as I'm with you.

194
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,640
Wait for me.

195
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,680
Feng, feed me.

196
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,550
What are you looking at?

197
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,650
Let's go.

198
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,900
I think it might be easier

199
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,370
to eat by yourself.

200
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,460
It's sweeter if you feed me.

201
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,260
Look at this.

202
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,750
Is there any lipstick or cosmetics

203
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,150
you like?

204
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,820
I like...

205
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,270
I think your makeup

206
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,660
is not pretty today.

207
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,760
I don't like it.

208
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,780
Buy some cosmetics.

209
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,770
Really?

210
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,550
It's hard to choose if you hold my hand.

211
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,670
How can I help you?

212
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,470
We are seeing if there's

213
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,820
any cosmetics suitable

214
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,050
for this lady.

215
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,130
You can talk about it.

216
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,820
We will buy them all.

217
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,020
Okay, wait a moment.

218
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,830
Feng, you're so nice to me.

219
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,620
I want you to draw for me.

220
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,180
That will make us a perfect couple.

221
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,960
I heard that thick lips are popular these days.

222
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,170
Done.

223
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,590
Looks really good.

224
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,060
How about I fix your eyebrows?

225
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,160
I also heard that broken brows are popular recently.

226
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,000
Do you want to give it a try?

227
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,350
I'll do it myself, Feng.

228
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,240
Since you don't want to try,

229
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,270
I'll go check out.

230
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,000
You're the best.

231

What are you doing?

269
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,920
Silly girl, save him first.

270
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,090
I'm a nurse.

00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,390
He has a cardiac arrest.

272

What are you doing?

278

It's fine to touch his chest,

279
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,650
but now you want to kiss him?

280
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,820
Then you do it.

You are weak.

No wonder you went offline early.

Is my girlfriend awake?

289
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,260
I'll tell you when she wakes up.

290
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,360
But why did things that never appeared in the story

291
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,120
appear in the telencephalon world?

292
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,690
Did she regain her memory?

293
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,810
It's impossible.

294
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,260
If she regains her memory,

295
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,060
we will know it from the monitor.

296
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,030
Okay?

297
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,540
Did you tell Lu Wanqing's mother

298
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,690
about you?

299
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,240
Lu Wanqing is very sensitive to the outside world.

300
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,370
She can

301
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,750
hear your conversation.

302
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,480
She's the writer.

303
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,650
What she heard

304
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,080
may become her material.

305
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,980
She's going to wake up soon.

306
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,720
Can she do that?

307
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,150
By the way,

308
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,780
is there a woman

309
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,610
in your story

310
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,550
who is pregnant with her lover's child?

311
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,730
That's a plot from a Korean drama

312
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,330
which her mom is watching by her bed these days.

313
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,250
If that's the case,

314
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,170
the only place she could go

315
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,360
is the space of consciousness I've been to before.

316
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,730
I need to check it out.

317
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,620
I want to go too.

318
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,080
No.

319
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,370
Take a rest here.

320
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,620
Eat this.

321
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,090
Dr. Zhang.

322
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,850
How is she?

323
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,350
The patient's heart rate is low

324
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,810
and is continuously decreasing.

325
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,930
Have you used all the medicine?

326
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,420
Yes.

327
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,960
Ge!

328
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,270
Ge!

329
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,470
Dr. Zhang, what's wrong with her?

330
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,490
Maybe it's the rejection reaction to the telencephalon system.

331
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,320
Next,

332
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,250
we will restore her heart function first.

333
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,510
You'd better prepare yourself.

334
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,980
The situation is not optimistic.

335
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,870
Get ready for emergency treatment.

336
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,590
Ge.

337
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,290
No matter how difficult it is,

338
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,930
I will bring you back.

339
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,040
Please leave.

340
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,860
Dr. Zhang.

341
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,500
No matter what,

342
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,650
no matter what the price is,

343
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,480
you must bring Ge back.

I'm begging you.

350

Dr. Zhang.

351
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,870
[Ward 1]

352
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,330
Dr. Zhang.

353
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,350
Please.

354
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,910
Dr. Zhang.

355
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,550
Dr. Zhang, please.

356
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,220
[Ward 1]

357
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,480
Dr. Zhang. Dr. Zhang.

358
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,480
Ge.

359
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,160
No matter what it takes,

360
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,320
I'll bring you back.

361
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,660
[The moment that makes me flip]

362
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,660
[is the moment I see you in the crowd.]

363
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,660
[Only you.]

364
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,880
How is Ye recently?

365
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,160
Madam, she's safe for now.

366
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,310
But something happened.

367
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,560
So I'm trying to figure out a way to solve it.

368
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,000
It's great.

369
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,550
If my physical condition allows,

370
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,460
I want to go in with Wanqing.

371
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,020
Even if I can't do anything,

372
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,060
I will feel relieved to see her.

373
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,710
Madam, don't worry.

374
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,150
Your daughter is the author,

375
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,390
so she is dominant in the treatment.

376
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,020
She is relatively safer.

377
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,890
I heard from the doctor today

378
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,120
she will wake up soon.

379
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,470
The medical conditions are really advanced.

380
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,610
In the past,

381
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,060
my daughter

382
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,150
and your girlfriend

383
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,810
would not recover so quickly.

384
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,400
Lu Wanqing is very sensitive to the outside world.

385
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,520
What she heard

386
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,270
may become her material.

387
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,780
Madam,

388
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,350
would you like to watch

389
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,720
the drama with a happy ending?

390
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,620
Everyone lives a good life.

391
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,900
Aren't all dramas having a happy ending now?

392
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,690
The male lead and the female lead defeat the villains

393
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,230
and finally become a couple.

394
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,800
No.

395
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,870
The supporting roles should have a happy ending too.

396
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,670
Because your daughter

397
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,350
is writing the novel every day.

398
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,500
She will be influenced by the outside world.

399
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,230
If you sit by her side like this,

400
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,840
she may feel

401
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,730
what you watch and listen.

402
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,870
Every day?

403
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,170
No wonder I can't guess the ending

404
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,350
after she saves and uploads the novel.

405
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,790
The telencephalon system is unstable now

406
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,730
and the content is quite messy.

407
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,130
No wonder

408
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,310
she always frowns and has nightmares recently.

409
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,450
You're right.

410
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,720
I should watch another drama.

411
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,260
With a happy ending.

412
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,910
Listen.

413
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,230
You can't go online now.

414
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,700
I'm fine.

415
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,810
I was just too hungry.

416
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,580
Could you give me another supply package?

417
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,660
Miss Li, supply package.

418
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,730
Listen,

419
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,270
if anything goes wrong

420
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,760
in your current situation,

421
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,490
we can't take the responsibility.

422
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,410
I'll sign an exemption agreement.

423
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,730
Here's another thing.

424
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,370
Your girlfriend is not in a good condition.

425
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,030
I don't know if she can wake up.

426
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,490
If Miss Lu wakes up first,

427
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,240
we'll have to change her telencephalon machine.

428
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,560
That means

429
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,020
everything will start over.

430
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,690
[Home decoration]

431
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,800
[The moment that makes me flip]

432
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,800
[is the moment I see you in the crowd.]

433
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,800
[Only you.]

434
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,380
[The moment that makes me flip]

435
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,380
[is the moment I see you in the crowd.]

436
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,380
[Only you.]
