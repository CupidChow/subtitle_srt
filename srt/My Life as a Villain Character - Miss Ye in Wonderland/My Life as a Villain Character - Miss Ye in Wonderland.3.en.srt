348
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,830
Not this one. This is my boss's room.

349
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,550
Of course I know it's Mr. Feng's room.

350
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,360
Who else would have such a good taste?

351
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,550
Of course.

352
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,310
Don't move.

353
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,430
I just tidied it up.

354
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,710
These earrings are so ugly.

355
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,870
Rube.

356
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,510
This is a cufflink.

357
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,310
You don't even know cufflinks.

358
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,440
And you call me Rube?

359
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,790
You're sitting on my boss's bed.

360
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,990
Yun Yi, get her out of here.

361
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,670
You want to share my bed?

362
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,030
Feng Muchen.

363
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,750
I suggest you

364
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,270
think it through.

365
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,150
Although we are husband and wife now,

366
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,430
you still have to rely on our family.

367
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,100
What would my dad think

368
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,500
if he found out

369
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,990
I was staying in the guest room?
