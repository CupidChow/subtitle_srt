00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,370
Sorry.

Go on.

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,800
Miss.

10
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,560
Just tell me

11
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,960
what you want.

12
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,910
Give me the spring show proposal.

13
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,980
It's a thing of the past.

14
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,690
When the company has a new project,

15
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,720
I'll show it to you.

16
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,350
No.

17
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,120
Bring it to my desk later.

18
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,200
Desk?

19
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,790
Okay, okay, okay.

20
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,350
The spring show has been losing money for years.

21
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,700
It didn't drive sales,

22
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,829
and it didn't do massive branding.

23
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,230
There must be something wrong.

24
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,480
Well, I was wondering...

25
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,580
The design of spring show...

26
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,100
Was it...

27
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,500
I'm not sure.

28
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,740
Excuse me.

29
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,020
The design of spring show...

30
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,420

31
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,880
I don't know. I don't know.

32
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,870
This is not the way to go.

33
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,010
Looks like I'm gonna buy people off.

34
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,890
Good afternoon, everyone.

35
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,880
You have a hard day.

36
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,140

37

Come here. Come here.

39
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,300
Thank you, Miss Ye.

40
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,100
This is yours.

41
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,100
Thank you, Miss Ye.

42

You're welcome.

43
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,700
She doesn't seem that bossy.

44
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,340
She's trying to get us on board.

45
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,770
That's not true.

46
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,340
These days,

47
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,860
I think she's very good.

48
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,490
And she didn't give us a hard time.

49
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,130
But she's the daughter of Ye family.

50
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,220
We must

51
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,700
ride her coattails.

I went to the office these days.

75

First, home. And then, the office.

Oh, I found it at the door.

145
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,380
Maybe the ostrich next door lost its hair.

146

Take it.

Didn't Ge go to the company for a few days?

152
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,890
I've heard a lot of talks

153
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,660
about her being as bossy at work as she is at home.

154
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,030
She made it difficult for the leaders in the company

155

to do their work.

156

Really?

157
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,610
Why didn't I hear about that?

158
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,430
Maybe they didn't want to bother you.

159
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,930
But I think you should take care of it.

160

If you don't,

161

It's not easy for young people

The pace of society is too fast.

Only writing slowly

Mr. Ye, you're right.

Come here. Sit please.

From selecting the factory to directly labeling the style,

I've been planning this project for a long time.

In my opinion, he is too old-fashioned.

As the saying goes, different ways cannot work together.

205
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,550
For me, as long as

206
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,350
it's reasonable

207
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,730
and profitable,

208

I will do it.

Since you agree,

210
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,930
I’ll cancel the cooperation

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,770
with Feng's Group.

212
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,300
That would be the death blow for Feng's Group.

213

Some things happened in the group recently,

217
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,920
which made everyone a little impetuous

218
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,520
and caused some people to make mistakes.

219
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,620
One more thing,

220
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
you must be clear,

Ye's previous positioning

229

has been the offline high-end brand.

But now,

231

online shopping has become

a major consumption mode for young people.

233

So,

I'm going to open up a line

and our sales.

246

I'm going to add some creativity and practicality

That's my proposal.

349
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,970
You want to poison them?

350
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,720
Can you show me some respect?

351
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,410
Here, Zou Chengji, have one first.

352
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,640

353
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,770

Cousin.

387
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,820
I've noticed

388
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,180
something different about you lately.

389
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,440
Are you afraid of my sister-in-law to leave you?

390
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,350
You haven't been yourself lately.

391
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,770
Tell me honestly.

392
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,190
Did you have a problem

393
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,390
with Su Yinyin?

394
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,630
How long have you known each other?

395
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,160
Not long.

396
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,370
Then I'll have to teach you.

397
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,180
You. Do you know?

398
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,590
There's a term called backup.

399
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,250
You're a backup now.

400
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,380
You'll get nothing in the end.

401
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,150
I am not.

402
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,540
That's gentle.

403

Sometimes,

407
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,730
you have to show what you can do,

408
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,010

409
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,790
No.

00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,880
let's make a bet.

413
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,359

414
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,670
Okay.

417
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,150
has been asking you out a lot recently.

418
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,190
How is that possible?

419
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,160
That's not true, okay?

420
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,770
Are you still gonna deny it?

421
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,660
He came to me for advice.

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,160
Just admit it.

423
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,220
What are you talking about?

424
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,970
You've gone rogue?

425
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,420
Because someone

426
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,550
stole your heart.

427
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,200
That's because of you.
