I want to ask you.

7
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:46,050
Do you know the truth

8

about my mother's being put into prison?

9
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,380
I know

I modified the plot myself,

00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,690
You don't need to thank me.

170
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,790
I didn't get to know you through others' words.

171
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,440
You want to chase after her?

172
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,920
Found it.

173
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,700
Ye Wange saw Feng Muchen's handsome silhouette.

174
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,020
Stood still.

175
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,210
Copy.

176
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,480
Paste.

177
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,100
[Ye Wange looked at Feng Muchen's handsome silhouette and stood still.]

178
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,170
[Ye Wange looked at Feng Muchen's handsome silhouette and stood still.]

179
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,170
[With Ye Wange's help, Chen Ye finally took the initiative to approach Lu Wanqing.]

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,360
The author wants Ge

181
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,080
to be the stimulus of the relationship between the hero and heroine?

182
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,790
What's going on?

183
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,000
Does this mean that if the content I edit

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,950
follows the author's thought,

185
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,900
the alarm won't ring?

186
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,740
My body index is normal.

187
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,530
I didn't expect

188
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,750
there's this other side of you, Miss Lu.

189
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,870
How about this?

190
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,770
I'll take you to a place.

191
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,330
Let's go.

192
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,670
How do you know this place?

193
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,980
Right.

194
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,090
You must have watched that video.

195
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,280
Am I a joke?

196
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,350
After all the ups and downs,

197
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,250
I lost everything.

198
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,200
I lost my mom.

199
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,680
So

200
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,570
you got separated from your family too?

201
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,470
What is this?

202
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,140
This is called a bird whistle.

203
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,880
This is for you.

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,920
It's you.

205
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,590
It's me.

206
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,580
This time,

207
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,320
we don't have to look for our parents anymore.

208
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,200
Because we have become adults.

209
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,130
I'll go with you

210
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,240
wherever you want to go.

211
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,420
Yun Yi.

212
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,850
Ge.

213
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,650
Ge.

214
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,180
Ning Yuan.

215
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Handsome.

216
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,850
You must be Feng Muchen.

217
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,040
Come with me.

218
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,270
Sorry.

219
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,690
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected at the moment.

220
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,980
How dare you, Feng Muchen.

221
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,070
You didn't answer my calls,

222
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,710
reply to my messages,

223
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,710
and you didn't come back the whole night.

224
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,850
How dare you!

225
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,200
Mrs. Zhang,

226
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,460
have you seen Mr. Feng?

227
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,910
I've been busy this morning.

228
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,270
I didn't pay attention.

229
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,120
Okay, go ahead.

230
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,950
Thank you.

231
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,580
Okay.

232
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,800
Yun Yi.

233
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,120
Have you seen your boss?

234
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,970
No.

235
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,480
He said he had something to do, so he didn't let me follow him.

236
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,100
Something to do?

237
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,460
Don't worry, Miss Ye.

238
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,010
Boss is an adult.

239
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,240
He'll be fine.

240
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,470
I'm only worried because he's an adult.

241
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,640
Alright, Feng Muchen.

242
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,890
You must have done something bad behind my back.

243
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,820
Don't let me catch you.

244
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,110
If I catch you,

245
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,420
I'll skin you alive.

246
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,690
Good morning, Miss.

247
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,150
You...

248
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,650
Have you seen Feng Muchen?

249
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,130
No.

250
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,040
Have you seen Mr. Feng?

251
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,350
No.

252
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,360
How could you not see him?

253
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,610
Didn't he tell you anything before he left?

254
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,670
He said he wouldn't let me follow him.

255
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,540
Look how anxious Miss is.

256
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,300
It's 8:00 a.m. now.

257
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,090
He didn't let me follow him. If I followed him...

258
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,630
Why are you drinking coffee here like nothing happened?

259
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,990
You don't even know where your boss is.

260
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,780
Could it be something happened to Feng Muchen?

261
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,849
I don't even want to talk about it.

262
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,099
If you keep doing this, I really think...

263
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:13,950
Shut up!

264
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,710
Who are you?

265
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,360
What is he doing?

266
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,010
Mr. Feng.

267
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,330
Beautiful girls?

268
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,420
We'll take you to a nice place.

269
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,110
Feng.

270
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,330

271
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:03,780
Chen!

272
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,380
Stop spraying.

273
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,430
You've been spraying it all night.

274
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,890
The whole room smells like peach.

275
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,410
I won't run away, okay?

276
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,000
Your uncle ran away.

277
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,970
You should repay

278
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,870
the money he owes us.

279
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes, you should pay us.

280
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,890
Even if I want to,

281
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,050
you need to give me my phone, right?

282
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,730
If I can't reach my uncle,

283
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,700
you can't get the money.

284
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,100
Your uncle also owes us something else

285
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,280
besides money.

286
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,700
Yeah.

287
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,130
Tell me, what should we do?

288
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,080
Kid, sometimes,

289
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,990
choices are more important than hard work.

290
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,890
Just spray it on me.

291
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,950
Scumbag.

292
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,410
Just wait and see.

Boss's video call.

295
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,540

Who is Feng Fugui?

313
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,490
He's our boss's prodigal uncle,

314
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,100
Feng Fugui.

315

He is indulged in eating, drinking, hooking up and gambling.

When Boss became the chairman,

317
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,910
he asked Boss to give him one million yuan every month.

318
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,990
Boss had no choice.

319
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,370
He had to agree.

320
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,540
He agreed?

321
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,670
One million.

322
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,360
Feng Muchen is such a pushover.

323
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,950
It must be because the Feng family is having a hard time,

324
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,150
and Boss is short on money.

325
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,350
That's why he found two beautiful girls

326
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,380
to kidnap Boss.

327
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,800
Oh no.

328
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,660
Feng Muchen must not know about this.

329
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,990
Let's go.

330
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,270
I don't want it.

331
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,420
I want it, okay?

332
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,910
Stop dawdling.

333
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,320

You're having fun.

How about I join you?

337
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,580
You're finally here. Did you bring the money?

00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,330
to tell you that

341
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,560
I have no money.

342
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,660
If you want Feng Muchen,

343
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,010
I've brought this to add to the fun.

344
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,220
Don't listen to her nonsense.

345
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,370
My nephew is the president of Feng's Group.

346
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,660
Every girl likes him.

347
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,810
You can ask around if you don't believe me.

348
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,570
Feng Muchen is a deadbeat now.

349
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,370
Why should I care?

350
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,550
Let me tell you.

351
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,720
Our Miss won't take him over.

352
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,340
Don't say that.

353
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,260
Although Boss is a deadbeat,

354
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,630
he's been taking it for granted, right? Boss?

355
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,450
You are so good at summarizing.

356
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,810
There's a position open at Mars.

357
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,870
You should take it.

358
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,900
I will

359
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,250
continue to be a freeloader.

360
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,000
Look.

361
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,600
He admitted it himself.

362
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,520
But how does he deserve to be a freeloader?

363
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,030
Like uncle, like nephew.

364
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,420
The Feng family are all bad people.

Feng Fugui.

366
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,220
What are you looking at? Run!

367
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,200
Let's go.

368
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,740
Retreat!

369
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,390
Go beat them.

370
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,270
They have the money.

371
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,670
Go after them. Stop beating me.

Stop running. I can't run anymore.

Where did you go

00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,810
last night?

[Theater parking lot  Entrance]

378
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,110
Are you feeling uncomfortable because you ran too fast?

379
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,470
Do you want some water?

380
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,190
I'm fine.

381
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,590
I'll be fine after some rest.

Feng Muchen.

384
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,750
Ning Yuan, hurry up.

385
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,990
Call an ambulance.

386
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,930
What's going on?

387
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,500
Feng Muchen, don't scare me.

388
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,860
Feng Muchen.
