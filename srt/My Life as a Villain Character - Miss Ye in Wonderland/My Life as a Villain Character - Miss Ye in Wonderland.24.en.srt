[Episode 24]

4
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,300
Hello?

5
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,940
Police officer?

6
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,410
I'm at the Modern Hospital.

7
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,210
Cousin.

8
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,770
Go back.

9
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,450
Hurry up.

10
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,470
I'll be taken away if you don't come.

11
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,750
Cousin.

12
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,920
We got your girlfriend this time.

13
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,670
If you want to redeem the photo,

14
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,200
pay me at least this amount.

15
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,199
I'll give you this amount. Let's go.

16
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,540
This is my cousin.

17
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,590
Get out of the way!

18
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,260
Stop it!

19
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,290
This is my cousin.

20
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,360
Your cousin again?

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,160
Boring.

22
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,220
What a bad luck.

23
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,740
It is a waste of my films.

24
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,300
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,640
Don't go!

26
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,640
Come on.

27
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,310
Let's go.

28
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,500
You took me as your shield again.

29
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,620
I saw you on the street.

30
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,720
You look terrible.

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,680
Are you sick?

32
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,670
No.

33
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,890
Fine, I'm sick.

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,260
Let me take you to eat something.

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,390
Let's go.

36
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,530
Why is there no customer

37
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,850
and no waitress?

38
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,660
No wonder there's no business.

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,980
It's popular on the internet.

40
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,260
It's open at night.

41
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,060
On the internet?

42
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,210
The environment is good.

43
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,670
Cousin,

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,960
you're a superstar.

45
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,970
Why do you always go to this kind of popular restaurant?

46
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,170
Of course the paparazzi will stalk you.

47
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,350
Cousin,

48
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,850
do you

49
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,280
own this restaurant?

50
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,140
Yes.

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,760
Your sister-in-law owns it.

52
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,579
My sister-in-law?

53
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,440
That's not cool.

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,860
You didn't even tell me you're dating.

55
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,720
I have to be your shield every day.

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm afraid that the paparazzi may take photos of her.

57
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,460
How about this?

58
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,960
I'll introduce her to you in a few days, okay?

59
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,420
Take it slowly.

60
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,130
By the way,

61
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,410
what is

62
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,480
the swindler institution you were saying?

63
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,880
Cousin, you have no idea.

64
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,860
I was almost kidnapped

65
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,610
by that swindler institution.

66
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,510
Let me tell you.

67
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,829
I was sleeping there.

68
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,730
When I woke up,

69
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,579
I was wearing a patient uniform

70
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,910
and lying on a white bed

71
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,530
with many colorful patches

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,760
on my head.

73
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,579
Then a male doctor came

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,230
and told me a bunch of stuff.

75
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,710
Anyway, something weird.

76
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,860
Then I pulled out the needle.

77
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,780
I ran

78
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,590
and then I met you.

79
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,040
Then here I am.

80
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,900
Let me ask you.

81
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,940
If you were me,

82
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
you will call the police too, right?

83
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,500
Ge, here's the thing.

84
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,840
A few days ago,

85
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,770
your sister-in-law had an accident.

86
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,080
She said exactly what you told me.

87
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,000
She said there was

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,060
a medical institution.

89
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,700
And then?

90
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,170
There were colorful patches on her head.

91
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,720
And it's called telencephalon...

92
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,120
Yes.

93
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,950
Telencephalon therapy system.

94
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,370
I was working.

95
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,570
No one told me.

96
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,140
She told me later.

97
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,900
Let me show you something.

98
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,740
Look at this.

99
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,400
This is your sister-in-law's new book.

100
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,850
It's also my next movie.

101
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:34,830
Take a look.

102
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,870
[The Low-profile Miss Ye]

103
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,040
The Low-profile Miss Ye.

104
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,270
I seem to have read this book.

105
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,020
The engagement of the second daughter of the Ye family, Lu Wanqing

106
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,820
was wrecked by her sister, Ye Wange.

107
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,060
We have the same name.

108
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,250
What's weirder is that

109
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,460
the domineering sister

110
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,530
suddenly became considerate.

111
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,670
Not only did she try to set Ye Wange and Feng Muchen up,

112
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,160
but even her attitude towards Feng Muchen

113
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,730
changed dramatically.

114
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,680
Lu Wanqing.

115
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,460
Feng Muchen.

116
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,470
The names sound so familiar.

117
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,540
For the Feng family,

118
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,550
I'm willing to do anything,

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
including marrying the woman I don't love.

120
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,050
Do you want to sign an agreement?

121
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,260
Ge.

122
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,650
Don't be afraid.

123
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm coming.

124
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,270
the Feng Muchen now

125
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,150
is different from

126
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,409
the Feng Muchen who had an intention.

127
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,340
I found this on the ground.

128
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,290
Take your recording brooch.

129
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,370
Let's fight the monster tonight.

130
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,710
Will your fear

131
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,500
spare you because you fear it?

132
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,400
Besides,

133
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,960
if I'm with you one day,

134
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,170
what should you do

135
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,590
if you fall into the water?

136
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,940
Can the fear save you?

137
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,610
He seems to be helping her on purpose.

138
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,290
Let me show you something.

139
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,110
You can read the novel?

140
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,420
[Chapter 561 Bankruptcy of Feng's]

141
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,460
So...

142
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,280
You are...

143
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,950
just like her.

144
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,930
You are from the real world.

145
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,860
So...

146
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,600
So I understand.

147
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,340
Ge,

148
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,430
I want to be your superhero.

149
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,900
If life is like the sea,

150
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,760
you're a small boat.

151
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,720
You have a place you want to go.

152
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,810
And I

153
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,180
will be the bridge under your feet

154
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,080
to wait for your return.

155
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,770
This plot is so familiar.

156
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,950
Ge,

157
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,920
I want to propose to you.

158
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,580
I'm sorry.

159
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,930
I can't.

160
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,200
Why did she refuse?

161
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,540
She fell in love with him.

162
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,620
Cousin.

163
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,530
I feel weird.

164
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,670
I think I've experienced

165
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,030
these things.

166
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,710
Ge,

167
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,960
I think you should go back to that hospital.

168
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,160
It might not be a swindler institution.

169
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,380
You used the same telencephalon machine to upload the consciousness

170
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,110
with another patient in a car accident.

171
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,460
In the telencephalon world,

172
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,910
In the telencephalon world,

173
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,910
you live in the story

174
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,330
Lu Wanqing is writing.

175
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,240
Could it be...

176
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,980

He said he is waiting for someone.

334
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,470
He won't say what the person looks like,

335
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,730
and the person's name.

336
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,030
To be a great hero,

337
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,790
you must hide your feelings

338
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,330
and give up the memories in the world.

so heartless?

341
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,190

342
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,920
I shouldn't have come.

343
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,100
You just know it?

344
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,060
It's too late.

345
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,150
Can you leave some memories?

346
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,610
I don't want memories.

347
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,050
Stay.

348
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,860
Then you can only get my body

349
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,110
and not my soul.

350
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,920
I already have a lover.

351
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,000
It's not going to work for us.

352
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,220
Let me go.

353
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,920
Fine.

354
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,230
I'll let you go.

355
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,120
But before you leave, you have to kiss me.

356
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,460
Kiss her.

357
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,400
What are you waiting for?

358
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,760
Kiss her! Kiss her!

359
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,750
Be quiet.

360
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,770
Kiss her...

361
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,190
I'm a Prince Charming after all.

362
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,520
If I kiss you when you tell me to,

363
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,720
my image will be ruined.

364
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,870
You're lying.

365
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,290
You don't want to kiss me

366
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,440
because you like me.

367
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,350
Let me tell you.

368
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,480
If you turn me down this time,

369
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,710
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

370
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,640
I won't kiss you even if I regret it.

371
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,800
We're not suitable for each other.

372
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,490
I know you miss her.

373
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,210
But you also said

374
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,480
I look like her.

375
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,130
No one can replace her.

376
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,680
You can only blame that we met too late.

377
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,730
It's fate.

378
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,290
Your boyfriend has been waiting for you.

379
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,980
Only you can bring him out.

380
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,420
Happiness switch.

381
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,010

Let me help you.

467
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,430

it's been a long time since you took her out.

Wanqing,

472
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,120
I didn't expect you can grill meat

473
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,440
since you are a writer.

474
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,820
You can make money too, right?

475
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,020
I'll go get some meat.

476
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,010
Ji,

477
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,630

485
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,580
She is too clingy.

486
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,080
I'm not clingy.

487
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,910
Isn't it good to be clingy?

488

It's good for you.

489

493
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,030
Yes.

494
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,590

495
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,660
Fresh orange juice

496

498
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,500

499
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,220
Hold on.

500
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,370
It's a little cold.

501
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,150
Don't drink.

502
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,960
Just one sip.

503
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,160
Just one sip.

504
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,400
Drink slowly.

505
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,410
You just recovered

506
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,510
and you have to write and cook.

507
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,910
Don't tire yourself out.

508
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,710
That's because we have VIPs today.

509

511

512
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,420
Get back to work.

513
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,200
None of your business.

514
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,970
Let's go.

515
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,660

516
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,710
It turned out that you are Wanqing's ward-mate.

517
