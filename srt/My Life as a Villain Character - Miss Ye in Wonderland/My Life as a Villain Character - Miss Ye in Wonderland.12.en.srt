I will deliver your order as scheduled.

176
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,620
The commercial order contract for Greater China

177

It should be able to solve your liquidity problem.

180

Thank you, Mr. Chen.

181

What? You haven't been told yet?

183
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,100
I have to say.

184

It's a small industry.

185

We're all businessmen.

the two production lines you promised me.

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,620
And take care of Miss Ye.

You don't have to worry about that.

195
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,020
Wait a minute.

196
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,590
Did you release the news of Feng's bankruptcy

197
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,990
and forced them to leave?

198
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,300
These assholes.

199
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,760
I've wanted to get rid of them for a long time.

200
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,500
Now that they asked to resign,

201
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,830
it saves you a large amount of compensation.

202
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,740
Smart.

203
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,020
So you brought me here

204
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,900
to rub it in their face?

00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,390
Okay, I have to go.

I won't bother you guys.

208

I can't believe it.

212
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,940
You're quite clever about this.

213

Feng Muchen's desperate comeback?

216
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,660
So it means

217

even if the title seems irreversible,

218

as long as we make an effort

219
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,810
before the novel updates,

220
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,060
we can still save the day.

I can't hold on.

You're sleepy already?

225
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,940
I thought leaders only need four hours of sleep.

Are you pretending to be asleep?

When you wake up,

I must ask you where you came from.

234

Otherwise, what if I can't find you

235

when we get out?

236

Good.

Boss has always had trouble sleeping.

249

Why did he sleep so long this time?

250
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,620
Miss Ye, what did you do to our boss?

251

I didn't do anything.

Miss,

sleeping for too long

254

can also be dangerous.

Is that so?

256
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,050

Snow White's kiss.

Wasn't Snow White the one who was rescued?

It's not important.

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,330
Do you like it?

347
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,920
I almost forgot to prepare it.

348
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,610
But how come you can make clothes too?

349
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,850
Is it because you inherited the character's skills from the novel?

350
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,570
You can read it at a glance.

351
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,720
I can certainly

352
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,170
do this too.

353
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,360
Cheating in the novel.

354
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,120
Good for you.

355
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,720
Don't you think

356
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,960
we're like strange online friends in a game?

357
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,570
What strange online friends?

358
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,810
We are old folks.

359
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,270
I'll make you rolled noodles when we get out.

360
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,200
Will you turn out to be an ugly person

361
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,480
when we go out?

362
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,200
Just like this.

363
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,930
But this novel is so sneaky.

364
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,520
It doesn't give away a single clue.

365
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,520
Soon.

366
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,600
When the career line is finished,

367
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,860
we'll be able to go out.

368
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,410
After I go to work,

369
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,920
you'll be like a boy toy at home.

370
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,000
Seriously.

371
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,100
When you get to the new company,

372
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,100
you must pay attention to the people around you.

373
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,800
I'm not with you.

374
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,130
I can't help you in time.

375
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Don't worry.

376
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,160
I'd like to see

377
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,890
what kind of crap this author has arranged for me.

378
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,320
Mr. Chen, are you calling me?

379
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,320
Mr. Jackson

380
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,480
has recently contacted me.

381
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,840
He said he was returning to China

382
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
for a new big deal

383
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,920
with the Ye's.

384
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,680

Join the Ye Group

386
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,600

and take the position of deputy project leader.

388
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,920
I hope you can take care of the upcoming cooperation.

389
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,600
Okay, don't worry.

390
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:21,960
Good.

391
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,410
Go back to your work.

392
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,440
Hello, Miss Ye.

393
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,000
Hello, Miss Ye.

394
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,040
What are you doing here?

395
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,850
I'm part of Ye's family too.

396
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,280
We'll be working together from now on.

397
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,240
Great.

398
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,200
Hello, Miss Ye.

399
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,840
Hello.

400
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,120
I'm just an intern.

401
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,560
Keep it low profile.

402
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,520
Let's go.

403
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,700
This is your workstation.

404
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,040
Okay.

405
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,560
I'll get to work then.

406
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,150
Thank you.

407
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,010
Okay, call me if you need anything

408
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,470
Miss Ye.

409
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,710
How are you?

410
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,280
Hello, how are you?

411
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,750
It's my destiny to work.

412
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,720
But Miss Ye's work

413
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,830
is so high-profile.

414
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,320
Miss Ye.

415
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,210
I'm the project manager Chen Yin.

416
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,400
Director Chen.

417
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,560
Please sit down.

418
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,350
These are the snacks for you.

419
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,120
There is a room over there

420
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,030
for you to rest.

421
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,160
You can also leave work early

422
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,840
if you want to.

423
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,360
Director Chen, I'm here for an internship,

424
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,960
not to enjoy myself.

425
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,730
You don't have to give me any special treatment.

426
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,230
Besides, I have to follow the company's rules.

427
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,160
I don't think it's not good to be late and leave early.

428
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,120
Then get used to the environment first.

429
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,880
There's no hurry about the job.

430
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,160
Let's talk about it in a few days.

431
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,620
Come on.

432
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,410
I don't know what you like.

433
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,070
There's some in the drawer.

434
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,430
Thank you.

435
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,720
What is this about?

436
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,390
I have to get down to business.

Why is it empty?

441
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,990
There is nothing.

442
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,150
Why did I come?

443
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,430
It's obvious

444
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,210
they're treating me like a waste.

What are you doing?

447

Do you want me to help you?

448
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,360
No, I don't.

449
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,220
Is there anything I can do to help?

450
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,310
No, no.

No, no.

454
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,640
Miss Ye, no, I can do it myself.

455
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,390
I've been here for three days,

456
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,960
so idle that I'm clear of

457
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,150
the use time of each toilet in the ladies' room,

458
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,070
the use frequency of the pantry,

459
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,510
and how hard the canteen lady shakes her spoon.

460
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,600
But I can't learn

461
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,470
how to run a fashion brand by myself.

462
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,190
Can't I get a decent job?

463
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,830
Miss Ye.

464
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,590
Mr. Ye said

465
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,630
you are good at data analysis and management.

466
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,790
Why don't you follow some dramas?

467
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,350
Many new dramas have been on air recently.

468
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,350
You can help them analyze the stream's data.

469
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,450
How about this?

470
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,230
Give me a project first.

471
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,950
Watch and see

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,910
how much I can handle it.

473
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,030
The projects seem to have been arranged.

474
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,710
There are no vacancies for the time being.

475
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,110
Miss Ye, I'm afraid you have to wait.

476
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,500
But colleagues will gossip about

477
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,790

Your family pays the salaries.

How can the staff have a problem with it?

482
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,510
Besides, Mr. Ye has instructed me

483
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,830
not to make you tired.

484
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,270
I'm just a supervisor caught in the middle.

485
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,200
It's hard for me.

486
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,110
How could my father be so kind

487
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,950
and have someone take care of me?

488
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,500

No, no.

You have to understand me.
