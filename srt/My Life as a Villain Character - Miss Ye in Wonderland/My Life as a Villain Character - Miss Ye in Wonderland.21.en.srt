[Episode 21]

4
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,900
Is it okay if

5
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,100
I stay here today?

6
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,500
Sleep tight here.

7
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,950
I'll stay here with you.

8
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,060
Confession of love on the beach.

9
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,890
Was it your idea

10
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,900
or the author's?

11
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,020
It was...

12
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,870
I'm not telling you.

13
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,540
Did you recall anything today?

14
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,280
But I've been feeling that you're quite familiar recently,

15
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,930
as if we've met before.

16
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,820
But I can't remember who you are.

17
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,220
It's okay if you really can't remember.

18
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,510
You can

19
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,620
get to know me again.

20
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,500
Just like how I got to know you.

21
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,850
I know

22
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,740
you like the handmade noodles from your hometown.

23
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,150
I know you like walking on the left.

24
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,620
I know you like to go to the library,

25
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,040
and peep at the couples

26
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,850
there.

27
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,150
How do you know so much?

28
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,990
Who are you?

29
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,130
I've been thinking of a vague figure lately.

30
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,230
Every time that figure appears,

31
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,480
I have a headache

32
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,940
and chest pain.

33
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,410
Feng Muchen.

34
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,980
Who

35
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,410
are you?

36
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,790
Ge.

37
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,220
If you can't remember,

38
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,790
don't think about it.

39
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,790
I'll always stay here with you.

40
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,460
Thank you.

41
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:41,980
Wait.

42
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,300
You said you'd stay with me.

43
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,310
You mean

44
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,470
you could have gone back a long time ago,

45
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,150
but you stayed here because of me?

46
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,920
Feng Muchen.

47
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,320
Have you really been

48
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,340
staying here

49
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,270
because of me?

50
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,250
Don't think too much.

51
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,590
Go to bed.

52
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,310
I've become your burden.

53
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,350
I can't sleep.

54
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,490
I have my reasons

55
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,620
to be here.

56
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,640
And I'm not leaving

57
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,230
because I have my concerns.

58
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,790
But staying with you

59
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,230
is more important than all of this.

60
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,730
Let's enjoy

61
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
this moment that only belongs to us.

62
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,920
Miss.

63
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,920
This is the document Mr. Jackson just sent here.

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,240
He said there's a new clue

65
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,900
which is very useful for the investigation of your mother's case.

66
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,050
All the clues are in the safe.

67
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,300
We also found the location of the safe.

68
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,280
Hurry up.

69
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,480
Stop eating, you two.

70
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,840
Stop eating.

71
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,750
Let's go.

72
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,550
I'm afraid someone might beat us to the punch.

73
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,600
If the safe is taken away,

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,970
it'll be too late for us even if we have the password.

75
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go.

76
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,980
The key will be ready in the afternoon.

77
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,180
Come and get it then.

78
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,510
[Wanna cut a key?]

79
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:02,920
Thank you.

80
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,630
Bye.

81
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,900
Are you sure it's here?

82
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:18,510
[Wanna cut a key?]

83
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,060
Miss.

84
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,690
Mr. Jackson said

85
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,940
the most dangerous place

86
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,300
is the safest place.

87
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,350
Are you Ge?

88
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,550
You've grown up.

89
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,340
Don't you recognize me?

90
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,230
I...

91
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,440
I'm your mother's

92
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,100
seventh great-uncle's

93
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,659
auntie's brother's son.

94
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,100
[Wanna cut a key?]

95
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,640
In that case,

96
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,760
you should call me grandma.

97
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,360
Don't say that.

98
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,950
The seniority is wrong.

99
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,200
When you were little,

100
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,159
I once went to the city

101
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,810
[Wanna cut a key?]

102
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,140
and gave you a pink lion toy.

103
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,570
Yes, I remember.

104
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,300
My memory's been bad lately.

105
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:54,310
[Wanna cut a key?]

106
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,270
So casual?

107
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,700
Boss, most people wouldn't think of a place like this.

108
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,260
[Wanna cut a key?]

109
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,630
What do you know?

110
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,470
I'm a professional.

111
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,400
[Wanna cut a key?]

112
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,470
What you want is in here.

113
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,540
What can be locked

114
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,260
in such a shabby safe?

115
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,760
[Wanna cut a key?]

116
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,110
Miss.

117
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,190
The password is the stock trading account.

118
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,930
Trading account...

119
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,290
9986.

120
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,350
Boss.

121
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,120
You can't judge a safe by its cover.

122
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,620
Boss.

123
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,240
They seem to have found

124
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,120
the items Ye Fengyan left behind.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,760
Did you find out what's inside?

126
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,400
It seems to be related to you.

127
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,320
You look great together.

128
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,570
You are going to the countryside for the weekend.

129
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,620
Stay there for a few more days.

130
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,950
No need to come back in a hurry.

131
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,460
I'm not worried at all.

132
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,590
Dad.

133
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,980
I'll go upstairs first.

134
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,240
Chen Ye, take a seat.

135
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:35,980
Okay.

136
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,299
Here, try this tea.

137
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,900
Have a seat.

138
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
It's said that Miss Ye

139
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,270
has the most shares now.

140
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,390
She will be in charge of a large part of the business

141
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,790
in the future.

142
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,780
Although Miss Ye is outstanding,

143
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,120
she's still young

144
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,640
and a bit inexperienced.

145
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,820
Unlike you,

146
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,160
she's full of youthful vigor and all kinds of ideas.

147
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,030
She always wants to cut back on the traditional sales department

148
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,430
and increase new e-commerce channels.

149
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,110
Well,

150
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,740
it's the trend of the market.

151
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,910
Also, her mother is in the hospital recently.

152
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,670
She's quite worried.

153
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,860
So please spend more time with her

154
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,680
for the time being.

155
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,790
Of course.

156
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,460
It's all family matters.

157
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,750
It's hard for me too.

158
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,880
I'm worried that she can't let go.

159
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,880
Of course,

160
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,120
as her father,

161
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,960
you did everything for her good.

162
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,560
It's good that you understand.

163
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,660
However,

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,270
don't really fall in it.

165
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,800
Focus on your career.

166
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,820
Don't swoon over romance.

167
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,370
Yes.

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,800
You're right.

169
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,780
Women are just

170
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,170
stepping stones on our way to success.

171
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,260
That's right.

172
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,610
Only career and wealth are the most important.

173
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,220
Of course.

174
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,310
You seem to be

175
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,600

I have a question for you.

But I couldn't find out the truth.

What I'm sure about is that

Shen Lingzhu is a pawn at most.

Dad, why are you so sensitive today?

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,990
So lame.

347
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,930
I'm angry.

348
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,470
Do you need my comfort?

349
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,410
You're cute.

350
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,580
Taking it for granted as a deadbeat.

351
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,770
You are really something, Mr. Feng.

352
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,130
Don't you like me like that?

353
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,340
Narcissistic.

354
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,670
I need to work.

355
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,320
You've been working for so long.

356
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,720
Don't you want to take a break?

357
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,160
I don't have time to rest.

358
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,870
I still have a lot to do.

359
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,130
This position

360
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,590
is really inhuman.

361
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,030
I can't help much.

362
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,550
Ge.

363
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Tell me.

364
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,330
If I stay a deadbeat

365
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,960
for the rest of my life,

366
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,900
what do you think?

367
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,740
Well...

368
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,580
Although I like you,

369
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,530
and I can support you,

370
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,560
I still hope

371
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,470
you won't be trapped in trivial family affairs.

372
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,990
Why?

373
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,080
Because love changes.

374
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,370
If one day we break up...

375
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,220
Our love will never change.

376
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,370
This familiar feeling again.

377
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,450
Do you

378
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,870
have no confidence in me?

379
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,370
To be exact,

380
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,920
it's not that I have no confidence in you.

381
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,940
I just have no confidence in anyone,

382
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,710
including myself.

383
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,370
I think I've said that to someone.

384
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,500
You've been working for so long.

385
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,860
You must be tired.

386
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,440
Let me help you relax.

387
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,070
I'll give you a neck and shoulder massage.

388
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,240
You're good.

389
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,380
Of course.

390
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,140
How is it?

391
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,620
Here.

392
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,090
Mental therapy

393
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,390
can stimulate her nerves more gently.

394
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,690
What do you

395
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,040
want to do?

396
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,310
Hypnotherapy

397
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,730
is to relax and rest

398
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,070
your nerves and brain

399
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,110
in a short time.

400
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,860
Are you insane?

401
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,770
It's only 11 o'clock.

402
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,120
I still have accounts to check.

403
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,880
Miss.

404
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,230
Mr. Feng did it for your own good.

405
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,580
Staying up late makes people age.

406
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,470
Yun Yi.

407
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,540
Ning Yuan.

408
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,910
Start.

409
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,940
Are you all insane?

410
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,220
Ge.

411
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,850
Keep your eyes

412
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,400
focused on this clock.

413
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,240
Don't think about anything.

414
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,510
Relax slowly.

415
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:01,690
Relax.

416
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,530
Think about your previous life environment.

417
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,270
Think about your family who kept you company.

418
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,880
Your father,

419
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,170
your mother,

420
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,320
and your boyfriend.

421
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,130
What the hell?

422
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,020
It didn't work at all

423
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,900
I need to work.

424
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,830
Spa.

425
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,910
I believe it will work.

426
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,130
Spa.

427
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,690
This is your last chance.

428
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,870
Let's go.

429
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,490
See?

430
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,610
It works.

431
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,380
They are sleeping so soundly.

432
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,920
Let's go for a spa.

433
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,900
Don't worry.

434
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,760
I know you're afraid of water.

435
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,340
Do you feel anything?

436
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,900
What about now?

437
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,640
Have you thought of anything?

438
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,950
Have you?

439
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,250
Come on.

440
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,470
Feng Muchen.

441
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,390
Are you crazy?

442
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,570
What are you doing?

443
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,530
Do you remember anything?

444
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,120
What's wrong with you?

445
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,960
Is there anything else?

446
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,270
The ending is drawing near.

447
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,350
What are you doing?

448
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,390
I'm serious.

449
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,410
Me too.

450
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,590
I still have to check the accounts.

451
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,540
I don't have time to fool around with you.

452
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,200
Good night.

453
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,360
I have to seize every second.

454
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,270
I have to be faster than her.
