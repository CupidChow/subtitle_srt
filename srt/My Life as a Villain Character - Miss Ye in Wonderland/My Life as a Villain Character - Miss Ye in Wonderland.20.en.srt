[Miss Ye in Wonderland]

00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,520
[Episode 20]

4
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,350
If Miss Lu wakes up first,

5
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,330
we'll have to change her telencephalon machine.

6
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,600
That means

7
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,940
everything may have to start all over again?

8
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,000
Well, Lu...

9
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,830
How long

10
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,110
will it take Miss Lu to wake up?

11
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,050
Three days in the system.

12
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,750
Doctor, please start.

13
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,660
Listen.

14
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,980
Although this matter is urgent,

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,040
I still have to tell you something.

16
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,410
First...

17
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,070
First,

18
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,790
I can't mention anything

19
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,009
about the real world.

20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,560
Second,

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,830
I have to wait until

22
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,740
the new chapter of the novel is uploaded

23
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,410
if I want to change the plot.

24
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,140
Third,

25
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,570
I must follow the doctor's advice

26
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,230
and follow the instructions of the necklace to go offline.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,210
Doctor, please.

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,100
Fine.

29
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,270
Okay.

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,600
Feng Muchen, you're really risking your life!

31
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,840
Trust me, Ge. I will save you.

32
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,730
Ge.

33
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,970
Where are you?

34
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,860
I know you can hear me, Ge.

35
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,220
I...

36
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,110
I can.

37
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,670
Why did you disappear

38
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,010
when I came into this world?

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,690
Why would we always fail to meet?

40
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,210
I realized how important you were

41
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,100
after I lost you.

42
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,500
Ge,

43
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,079
please come back.

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,860
You rejected me,

45
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,030
but it doesn't matter.

46
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,960
What I want to tell you is that

47
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,870
the moment that I fell in love with you...

48
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,690
Is when I saw you in the crowd...

49
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,890
And I couldn't take my eyes off you.

50
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,360
Ye Wange.

51
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,470
In fact, I have the same feelings for you.

52
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,290
Then will you believe in love,

53
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,720
in me,

54
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,570
and in our future once more?

55
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,420
Yes.

56
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,720
I will.

57
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,140
Feng Muchen.

58
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,840
I do.

59
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,890
Ye Wange!

60
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,540
Where are you, Ye Wange?

61
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,320
I do.

62
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,730
[But what do we do after we get out of the book?]

We can't let Feng's Group

get out of this crisis so easily.

Dad, have some tea.

124
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,850
My good girl.

125
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,050
Sit down.

126
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,740
I just read the report.

127
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,100
Meilian has been run very well lately.

128
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,180
So,

129
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,420
you were not affected by what happened to your mother.

130
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,770
I won't let you down, dad.

131
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,750
It would be better

132
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,740
if the data of the previous short video could be more satisfactory.

133
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,740
I'd also like to start helping you as soon as possible.

134
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,360
It's okay.

135
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,350
Don't just focus on studying and working,

136
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,880
you should learn to enjoy life.

137
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,550
Wange has been doing so well lately.

138
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,940
So I have to try my best too.

139
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,890
You should learn

140
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,320
other aspects of her.

141
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,200
Ge's career

142
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,110
has been greatly supported by Feng Muchen.

143
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,430
Mr. Ye, Mr. Chen Ye is here.

144
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,330
Let him in.

145
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,660
Did you ask him to come?

146
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,550
Yes.

147
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,320
I have a date with Chen Ye.

148
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,510
He came to pick me up.

149
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,260
It seems

150
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,890
I shouldn't have criticized you just now.

151
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,460
Why did you suddenly start dating him?

152
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,140
I heard that you were trying to expand the market

153
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,600
and delegate design rights to downstream merchants.

154
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,040
Chen Ye has resources.

155
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,500
It might be helpful for your cooperation

156
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,670
if I get closer to him.

157
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,520
Not bad.

158
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:06,810
Mr. Ye.

159
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,760
Good to see you, Chen Ye.

160
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,590
Hello.

161
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,500
I'm here to pick Wanqing up.

162
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,880
This is the Pu'er tea I brought back from my last business trip.

163
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,150
Hope you like it.

164
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,160
Thank you so much.

165
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,980
Alright, I'll leave you to it.

166
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,100
Don't worry.

167
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,390
I will take good care of her.

168
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,580
If it was someone else,

169
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,700
I might worry about

170
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,460
Wanqing dating him.

171
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,500
Dad.

172
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,420
Alright, have fun.

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,350
Hope you have a good time.

Okay.

Let's go.

176
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,360
I'd better stay outside.

177
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,920
Have a nice chat with your mother.

178

I'll wait for you.

You have to lie down there.

Don't block my view. It's my turn.

I'm trying to get you to aim more accurately.

183
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,080
You are so ungrateful.

184
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,130
So annoying.

185

You are quite good this time.

Not bad.

Recently, the boss stopped coming to the company completely.

He accompanies Miss Ye every day,

there is something wrong with Miss Wange.

194
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,050
She is sometimes lively

195
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,440
and sometimes willful.

196
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,210
What kind of her do you like?

like her more when she is lively.

After all,

202
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,190
she was the one who changed the boss.

You don't have to thank me every time.

It's just that I probably don't have the time to think about this

So, we'll cook ourselves today.

Let's do it ourselves.

Too tight.

310
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,270
I'll loosen it up a bit.

311
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,540
You can't even tie a girl's hair.

312
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,100
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

313
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,510
But I'm willing to learn.

314
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,180
Would you like to teach me?

315
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,550
And me!

316
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,680
Play games together?

317
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,160
We can play together later.

318
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,590
They are dating.

319
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,600
Don't disturb them.

320
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,150
Go ahead.

321
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,900
What happened to you, Miss?

322
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,320
It was all Feng Muchen's fault.

323
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,120
He actually despised the cake I made.

324
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,160
It's pretty and delicious.

325
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,650
You really have become pretentious again.

326
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,410
And,

327
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,400
you two are closer now.

328
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,060
He's really good.

329
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
The people I trust the most here

330
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,620
are you two.

331
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,000
And Yin, Yun Yi, Zou Chengji,

332
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,370
Lu Wanqing, Chen Ye.

333
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,100
Anyway, you are all super nice.

334
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,690
That's because you're nice.

335
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,390
Ning Yuan.

336
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,980
What would you most like to do

337
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,780
if one day

338
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,180
you don't need to protect me anymore?

339

I'll do

340

whatever you want me to do.

341

How can you not have something you want to do?

342
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,500
You...

343
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,600
But it makes sense.

344
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,580
You are here

Miss, I exist only for you.

347
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,720
What happened?

348
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,540
Nothing.

349
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,260
I just hope

350
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,710
that wherever you are in the future,

351
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,310
and whatever happens,

352
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,140
you must be happy

353
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,260
and healthy.

354
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,760
And you have to take good care of yourself too.

355
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,140
I will.

356
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,130
I hope the same for you.

357
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,990
Dinner's ready. Let's go.

358
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,450
Happy birthday to you.

359
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,950
Happy birthday to you.

360
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:06,910
Happy birthday to you.

361
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,020
Happy birthday to you.

362
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,930
Thank you.

363
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,610
Make a wish.

364
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,740
First,

365
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,710
I wish this will end sooner.

366
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,500
Second,

367
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,110
I hope that when we get back to reality...

368
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,040
I want to be your superhero.

369
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,730
I can still meet with him.

370
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,470
And he'll still be my superhero.

371
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,280
The bald bear is behind. Run!

372
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,940
Third,

373
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,820
I hope they can still

374
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,820
be happy

375
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,140
and joyful

376
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,500
after I leave.
