6

This is for you.

9
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,550

You can leave now.

11

I changed the water in the bathroom for you.

12

13

Tell me if you need anything.

14

Why is he suddenly so nice to me?

15
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,250
Did his conscience smite him?

No matter how hard life is,

18

I'll still take my bath.

27

In my opinion,

Pamper her?

No way.

No, Boss.

Boss is having lunch. He'll be here soon.

43

When I called him the day before yesterday,

44
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,250
he was not with Ge either.

45

Does he remember that

46

47
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,400
Mr. Ye,

why are you here without notice?

49

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,770
That's not important.

52
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,630
I'm here to see my granddaughter.

53

I'll get her.

Lose weight?

65

No.

It's hard to have hot pot here.

72

179
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,590
But it's not worth it for him to come here.

180
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,910
He didn't get to drink ice cola,

181
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,550
but could only listen to you

182
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,590
complaining about me.

183
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,600
That means I'm super cute.

184
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,570
Grandpa is satisfied as long as he sees me.

185
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,160
I've paid off

186
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,640
the debt on your card.

187
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,910
So nice.

188
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,710
Seems like your performance

189
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,670
has lived up to the green feast I specially made for you.

190
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,430
Try it.

191
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,200
It won't poison you.

192
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,700
Miss.

193
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,830
Ning Yuan, you're back at the right time.

194
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,520
Come and try my green feast.

195
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,070
Okay.

196
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,650
Make yourself at home.

197
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,970
Eat whatever you like.

198
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,470
How is it?

199
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,710
Delicious.

200
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,510
Great.

201
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,350

Eat more.

204
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,520
Let's eat together.

205
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,790
Boss, by the way, there's something

206
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,910
I forgot to tell you about. About the event...

207
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,310
Let's eat together.

208
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,830
You don't wanna eat?

209
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,960
Let's eat together.

210
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,330
Forget it.

211
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,430
They don't want to eat. Let's eat.

212
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,470
Let's order takeout.

213
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,630
No, it's delicious.

214
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,070
No need, Miss.

215
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,510
No, Miss.

216
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,870
It's really delicious.

217
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,780
It's just a little salty.

218
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,950
By the way,

219
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,270
the media has

220
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,260
found out the source of the candid photos.

221
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,630
Let me see.

222
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,310
Take a look.

223
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,070
She has been taken away for investigation.

224
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,070
She seems to be Lu Wanqing's friend.

225
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,950
I've searched the lake where you fell into the water.

226
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,080
There's no new clue.

227
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,750
Lu Wanqing and Chen Ye are the characters of the love line.

228
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,310
Evil step-mother

229
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,510
is a villain who is neither cute nor charming.

230

[Click to check the mission]

231
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,860
Grandpa is like a systematic character

232
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,590
who guides me through the plot.

233
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,950
This Little Chicken is me.

234
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,230
The intrigue line

235
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,670
should be me finding the clues of Mom's case

236
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,070
under Grandpa's guidance.

237
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,900
My love line...

238
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,470
Is to be a couple with Feng Muchen.

239
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,580
But why did Lu Wanqing

240
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,260
send someone to take photos to smear me?

241
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,150
I didn't steal Chen Ye from her.

242
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,260
Could it be that Chen Ye

243
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,960
is the key to cracking the intrigue line?

244
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,270
Hello.

245
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,630
Hello, Miss Ye.

246
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,140
Hello, Mr. Chen.

247
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,980
Chen Ye.

248
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,440
Miss Ye, here's the thing.

249
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,900
There's a dinner party of the trust industry tonight.

250
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,310
Mr. Li Yunsheng, a guru in trust business,

251
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,740
is the host.

252
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,430
Li Yunsheng?

253
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,310
Do you have time to go with me?

254
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,340
Chen Ye is really resourceful.

255
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,020
But if I agree to go with him,

256
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,020
I would be fighting with Lu Wanqing for Chen Ye.

257
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,700
Will the readers complain about me?

258
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,420
Miss Ye.

259
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,140
Miss Ye?

260
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,830
Thank you for your invitation.

261
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,700
But I'm really sorry.

262
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,380
I...

263

He's like a plaster

264
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,490
that I can't get rid of.

265
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,300
I was too abrupt.

266
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,980
By the way, Mr. Chen,

267
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,190
do you know...

268
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,060
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

269
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,950
I'm hanging up.

270
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,400
You're going with Chen Ye?

271
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,460
This is my business.

272
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,260
Does it have anything to do with you?

273
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,180
Okay.

274
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,540
Are you jealous?

275
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,460
No.

276
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,950
So you like such lively occasions too.

277
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,140
You have double standards.

278
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,550
If I go with you, it won't count as "showing up in public".

279
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,220
But if I go with someone else, it will be.

280
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,020
Boring.

281
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,260
Boss, if you don't wanna go, don't go.

282
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,340
You've always disliked

283
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,680
this kind of activity.

284
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,740
Mr. Ye.

285
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,940
Feng, thank you for sending me home yesterday.

286
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,700
As for tonight's dinner party,

287
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,220
go with Ge.

288
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,500
I'm worried about her going there alone.

00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,180
Okay.

Boss.

295
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,080
I think it's time to teach you how to court your wife.

296
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,020
Sometimes when being with a girl,

297
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,140
you can be faster and act more like a "bad boy".

298
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,500
How so?

299
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,740
You can only win her heart over if you are faster than others.

300
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,810
Girls always speak with a forked tongue.

301
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,570
I saw Miss Ye getting changed downstairs.

302
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,900
Guess why she isn't getting changed

303
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,250
in her own room?

304
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,480
Of course she wanted to let you see it.

305
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,620
While Miss Ye is choosing clothes,

306
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,060
you can attract her with your profession.

307
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,900
Teach her how to match the dress for the banquet

308
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,900
so that she will be impressed by you.

309
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,140
Come closer.

310
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:42,690
Yes.

311
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,010
Ning Yuan, what do you think of this dress?

312
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:53,810

314
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,020
They're all beautiful.

315
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,460
Forget it.

316
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,860
It's useless to ask you.

317
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,940
Go back to your work.

318
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,540
I also think it's beautiful.

319
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,420
Boss, I'll get back to work too.

320
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,820
I'll give you some space.

321

The dresses you just tried on are no good.

322
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,500
You need to ask

a professional about the profession, right?

324
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,930
You're just a tailor.

325
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,130
What's to brag about?

326
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,570
Tailor?

327
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,410
I'm a fashion designer for haute couture.

328
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,670
Still a tailor, right?

329
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,730
The clothes I wear

330
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,140
are customized by famous designers.

331
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,170
What do you know?

332
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,690
You are just stupid and rich.

333
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,610
Muslin and lace need to be used cautiously.

334
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,770
The best material

335
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,490
is still silk and worsted texture.

336
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,610
The color should mainly be of low saturation.

337
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,410
High saturation can be used

338
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,330
to decorate locally.

339
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,540
This dress

340
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,970
is kind of approved by me,

00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,890

342
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,050
Go get ready.

343
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,730
I'll drive.

344
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,370
Who said I want to go with a tailor like you?

345
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,850
Bye.

346
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,010
She still doesn't understand

347
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,470
the difference between haute couture designers and tailors.

348
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,410
Stupid.

349
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,090
Thank you for picking me up, Mr. Chen.

350
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,530
Miss Ye, you're welcome.

351
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,130
Miss Ye, if I'm not mistaken,

352
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:25,610
this dress

353
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,690
is the designer's dress in the spring series

354
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,450
of Ye's fashion week this year.

355
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:30,960
Yes.

356
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,790
Since you know Ye's clothing so well,

357
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,220
have you worked with my mother?

358
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,490
You flatter me, Miss Ye.

359
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,210
Ye's is the top in the industry.

360
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,260
Unfortunately,

361
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,860
I haven't had a chance to work with your mother.

362
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,130
Be careful.

363
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,089
I have an appointment with the media.

364
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,079
Excuse me.

365
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,859
Friends from the media, this way please.

366
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,849
Indeed a business star.

367
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,569
Such massive turnout.

368
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:19,680
Wait.

369
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:22,800
He has my invitation letter.

370
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,800
Hello, Miss Ye.

371
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,700
Miss Su, we'll leave if there's nothing else.

372
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,120
Hello, Miss Su.

373
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,130
So distant.

374
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,410
It's only been six months since I went abroad.

375
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,320
You haven't forgotten about me, have you?

It's just I haven't seen you for a long time.

384
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,660
I missed you so much.

385
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,450
But I'm glad you're back.

386
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,880
Finally, I have someone to talk to.

387
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,120
So the people who video-called you

388
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,130
is a fake person?

389
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,560

Welcome to the business dinner party

hosted by me, Li Yunsheng.

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,840
So he is Li Yunsheng.

398
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,800
To show my sincerity,

399
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,280
I'm specially presenting this painting by Picasso

400
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,920
that I recently collected here.

401
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,360
I hope you can enjoy

402
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,560
appreciating it.

403
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,940
Hello, where are you?

404
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,440
We're here too.

405
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,160
Come here.

406
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,200
Who is it?

407
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,780
I promise it's the person you're looking forward to meeting the most.

408
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,960
Miss Ye, what can I do for you?

409
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,660
Do you need my help?

410
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,280
Why is it you?

411
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,640
Who needs your help?

412
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,130
Uncle Li.

413
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,800
You're here, Wanqing.

414
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,430
I had afternoon tea with your mother yesterday

415
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,490
and mentioned you.

416
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Wange is here too.

417
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,640
It's my honor

418
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,300
to have both of you here today.

419
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,510
He really knows my family well.

420
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,640
Uncle Li, you're welcome.

421
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,680
I heard that this painting is rarely shown in public.

422
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,040
And I heard there's some special connection between it

423
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,320
and Miss Ye Wange.

424
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,010
You two are highborn.

425
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,290
Ge, you are also a collector of this painting.

426
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,650
I'm sure you have a unique understanding.

427
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,360
Why don't you share it

428
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,120
so that we can learn more about it?

429
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,800
How's that?

430
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,680
I'm sorry, but I don't know much about this painting.

431
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,800
You really don't remember this painting?

432
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,990
This is a world-famous painting.

433
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,680
How could I not remember?

434
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,390
This is your mother's favorite painting

435
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,760
when she was alive.

436
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,290
You really don't remember?

437
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,920
It's just that I have too many paintings at home.

438
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,120
I may not remember this particular one.

439
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,880
Is Li Yunsheng related to my mom

440
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,340
because of this painting?

441
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,150
It suddenly occurred to me that

442
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,510
I forgot something.

443
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,360
Excuse me.

444
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,750
So, Shen Lingzhu sold my mom's painting

445
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,040
to Li Yunsheng?

446
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,320
Since Lu Wanqing could tell that I didn't know,

447
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,600
why did she tell me?

448
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,760
Is it out of justice?

449
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,490
The main character should have the sense of justice.

450
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,350
Good for you, Little Ye.

451
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,040
I'm leaving now.

452
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,990
See you at the bar later.

453
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,720
Doughnuts, I'm coming.

454
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,550
What a coincidence. You're hungry too.

455
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,050
I haven't got even with you yet.

456
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,840
Did you

457
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,360
make a fool of me on stage on purpose just now?

458
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,830
You're so ungrateful.

459
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,100
I finally decided to help you.

460
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,670
That painting is your mother's collection.

461
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,350
Your mother had to sell it to Li Yunsheng

462
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,110
because her business had some problems.

463
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,950
I wanted to avenge your mother on stage.

464
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,610
I didn't expect that you didn't know about this.

465
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,190
So I misunderstood you?

466
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,630
Take it as an apology.

467
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,110
Eat.

468
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,120
I forgive you.

469
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,230
Since I've provided you

470
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,160
with such important information,

471
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,950
and I did you such a big favor,

472
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,430
shouldn't you feed me till I'm full?

473
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,910
Hello, everyone.

474
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,670
Everyone, this is

475
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:27,080
a stable low-risk investment project.

476
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,880
Eat by yourself.

477
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,790
You can collect the principal anytime.

478
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,920
And it's mainly invested by the banks.

479
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,760
My investment concept is different from others.

480
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,270
I don't pursue high return rate.

481
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,990
I only promise you that

482
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,390
you'll get a fixed 10% interest every year.

483
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,270
10%?

484
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,070
High risk again.

485
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,880
It comes with high risks.

486
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,800
If you want to make big money fast,

487
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,830
you should invest in stocks.

488
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,670
It seems that the author

489
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,350
has a friend

490
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,910
who's the victim of P2P.

491
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,550
Can you give me a chance?

492
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,030
My project is not short of investment.

493
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,390
I don't know if everyone can invest.

494
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,380
It's hard for me to decide now.

495
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,590
How about this?

496
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,270
Wait for my reply, okay?

497
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,430
Playing hard to get.

498
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,020
Mr. Li, may I have your number?

499
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,830
Sure.

500
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,840
Listen to me.

501
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,550
I know many of you

502
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,620
know the risk of doing this,

503
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,350
and you know the meaning of this kind of deal

504
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,610
is to keep recruiting people to join you.

505
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,790
But I hope you can understand

506
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,110
as long as this kind of capital deals like passing the parcel

507
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,070
exist,

508
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,420
there will be victims.

509
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,950
Please think twice

510
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,790
before you do it.

511
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,580
Miss Ye.

512
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,110
I didn't expect

513
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,550
that you are already quite like your mom

514
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,220
at such a young age.

515
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,790
My respect.

516
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,110
Just so-so.
