They are not realistic at all.

18

If a man and a woman break up in real life,

19
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,590
the girl should be the one who's in tears.

everything will go back to normal.

515
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,870
Wanqing.

516
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,030
Do you want to go back with me?

517
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,710
How can you live here alone

518
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,190
if I go back?

519
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,520
Feel free to go crazy yourself.

520
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,910
Why don't you get me?

521
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,510
I'll lose my job if I don't go back.

522
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,190
What job?

523
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,030
It's...

524
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,520
You won't understand.

525
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,550
It has nothing to do with you.

526
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,670
Of course it has something to do with me.

527
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,990
Why don't you two both hold my hands?

528
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,420
No.

529
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,250
I've had enough of you.

530
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,150
Feng Muchen.

531
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,790
Remember

532
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,990
what you promised me.

533
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,430
The wall is so hard.

534
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,900
If I couldn't make it across the wall,

535
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,870
my face will be marred, right?

536
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,270
Forget it.

537
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,230
I remember

538
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,860
you can travel across walls.
