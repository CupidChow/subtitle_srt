Feng Muchen.

5
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,860
You'd better

6
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,380
think it over.

7
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,370
Although we are husband and wife now,

8
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,490
you still have to rely on our family.

9
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,170
If my dad

10
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,610
knows that I'm staying in a guest room,

11
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,100
what would he think?

12
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,410
Boss, she's right.

13
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,570
This is not a bathroom.

14
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,570
This is a swimming pool.

15
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,050
It's bigger than the house I rent.

16
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,770
It's heated.

17
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,980
This is so amazing.

18
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,210
I'll be the hostess here from now on.

19
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,410
I didn't expect

20
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,970
to get married with Feng Muchen

21
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,530
and moved into his house.

22
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,530
I have no choice.

23
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,570
It's all about the plot.

24
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,650
Let me introduce myself again.

25
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,680
I'm Mr. Feng's assistant, Yun Yi.

26
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,450
Please cooperate with the security check.

27
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,280
This is the rule of our Feng family.

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,650
Please cooperate.

29
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,420
What's wrong with you?

30
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,890
Leave the luggage here. You can go back now.

31
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,420
I'll be wherever Miss Ye is.

32
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,970
I'm her personal assistant.

33
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,630
I don't think it's necessary.

34
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,530
Yun Yi,

35
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,930
pay him.

36
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,770
Although my employer Miss Ye

37
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,450
is your wife,

38
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,010
I only listen to Miss Ye.

39
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,560
You can't fire me over her.

40
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,880
Take it easy.

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,250
Don't be so nervous.

42
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,450
After all, he has been Miss Ye's assistant

43
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,050
for more than ten years.

44
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,180
The Ye family sent him here,

45
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,990
so it's really inappropriate to let him go back.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,770
How about

47
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,650
letting him stay in my room?

48
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,920
My room is big.

49
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,570
No one else

50
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,640
is allowed to go upstairs except the nanny.

51
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,100
Since others are not allowed to go upstairs,

52
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,400
Mr. Feng,

53
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,050
you have to take these luggage upstairs.

54
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,330
Who is it?

55
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,640

56
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,240
Where's Ning Yuan?

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,920
He lives in my assistant's room downstairs.

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,050
No one is allowed to go upstairs

59

except you and Ms. Zhang.

60

Thank you.

61

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,260
I don't know much about your cooking tools,

177
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,380
but I know the price of the hostel.

178
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,260
I can sue you to the Consumers' Association.

179
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
Believe it or not.

180
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,280
You think it is unreasonable too, right?

181
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,340
The use of shower and bathtub is charged by time.

182
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,940
Which hostel does this?

183
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,180
The toilet is charged for a month?

184
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,820
What?

185
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,580
You're so considerate.

186
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,450
This is my house.

187
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,020
Then I must listen to you?

188
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,460
Right.

189
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,970
I'm your wife.

190
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,470
Give me a discount.

191
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,410
40% off.

192
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,340
Okay.

193
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,820
99% off.

194
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:44,780
Bah!

195
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,850
You are so stingy.

196
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,090
Do you look like

197
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,420
the sweet second leading actor?

198
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,950
What are you talking about?

199
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,260
If you don't want to live here,

200
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,460
no one will force you.

201
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,030
You can move out now.

202
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,020
If I move back,

203
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,250
it will affect Wanqing's love story.

204
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,260
I need to get along with this secondary leading actor.

205
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,010
Fine.

206
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,850
I have money anyway.

207
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,470
I'll transfer the money to you tomorrow.

208
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,610
How about

209
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,970
I make noodles for you?

210
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,010
No.

211
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,620
It's good.

212
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,970
Balance: Zero.

213
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,330
The payment is due on June 6.

214

219
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,930
Why do I owe so much money?

220
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,100
I finally inherited some money,

221
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,890
but I spent it all.

222
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,610
Why do I have to pay rent in the real world

223
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,850
and the virtual world?

224

you don't blame me, do you?

231
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,290
You're talking about my sister's marriage?

232
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,930
I don't mind.

233
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,370
And I want

234
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,230
to stay with you

235
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,890

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,010
I'm sorry.

239

Your birthday is in two days.

Let your mom prepare it for you.

Don't you know

246
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,330
you snore in your sleep?

247
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,440
It's like a DJ.

248
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,720
Let me tell you.

249
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,450
I've never snored since I was a kid.

250
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,780
Don't say I snore again.

251
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,680

252
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,850
Sit down.

Just two of us?

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,000
Miss Ye

255
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,970
usually gets up at noon.

256
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,410
That's a stereotype.

257
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,920
I get up at seven every day.

258
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,290
Sorry.

259
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,960
I'll make another one for you.

260
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:15,930
Okay.

Come here.

Ning Yuan.

263
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,520
When can I get the dividends

264
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,970
for the second issue?

265
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,050
Three months later.

266
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,160
Three months?

267
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,160
It's all my fault.

268
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,320
Why did I have to pretend to be rich?

269
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,450
Well.

270
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,730
It's all donated.

271
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,760
I don't have a penny now.

272
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,160
By the way,

273
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,660
besides dividends,

274
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,640
when can I get the shares?

275
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,520
You need to talk to the nominee.

276
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,490
But the nominee seems to be abroad.

277
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,550
Why do you need money so urgently?

278
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,820
It's all because of the landlord.

279
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,320
Grandet Feng.

280
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,920

Come here.

282
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,280
Follow me.

283
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,200
Split up.

284
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,960
One, two, three.

285
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,880

288
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,080

They are weird today.

293
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,800
Maybe the food is poisonous.

294
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Try it.

295
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,560
Please, boss.

296
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
Why don't you send me to Mars?

297
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,000
Those are all yours.

298
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,280
I have no money.

299
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,200
I only deserve this.

300
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,160
Wait.

301
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,280
I want the dish in your hand.

302
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,790
Sir, please enjoy.

303
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,640
It's not tasty enough.

304
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,670
Try again.

305
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,720
I wish you

306
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,270

There's no evidence left.

It's so delicious.

314

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,710
We have servants to do these.

352
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,640
It was

353
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,800
a futile effort.

354
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,030
Mr. Feng,

355

[Scan to pay]

356
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,510
you can't cheat.

357
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,470
Look, my hands are red

358
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,950
from playing.

359
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,550
My speaker is better.

360
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,620
The live performance is more interesting.

361
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,630
The performers in the streets

362
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,020
are better than you.

363
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,810
How about this?

364
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,360
Since you worked so hard

365
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,190
and did well today...

366
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,270
Thank you, boss.

367
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,310
Hurry up.

368
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,220
Scan it.

369
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,540
I'm not done yet.

370
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,680
As long as you promise me one thing,

371
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,560
I can let you stay here for one month

372
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,260
for free.

373
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,540
Don't try to take advantage of me.
