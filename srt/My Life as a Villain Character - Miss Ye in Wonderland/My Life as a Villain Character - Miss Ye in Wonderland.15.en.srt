174
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,370
that you have to obey

175
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,950
and listen to me.

176
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,180
I just accidentally heard it.

177
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,150
This...

178
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,880
It's not your fault.

179
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,840
Dad is also a victim.

180
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,500
If...

181
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,310
he has a right to know all this.

182
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,350
I will

183
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,230
leave this matter to him.

184
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,040
Dad, take off your jacket

185
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,660
if you feel hot.

186
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,030
Wanqing is so cruel.

187
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,810
She has told him everything?

188
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,020
Is Shen Lingzhu her biological mother?

189
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,810
You're all here?

190
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,350
Honey,

191
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,020
why do you seem to be in a bad mood?

192
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,180
You're sweating.

193
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,910
Why are you pulling me so hard?

194
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,310
You hurt me.

195
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,600
How dare you come back?

196
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,210
This is my home.

197
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,770
If I don't come back here...

198
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,140
Why did you hit me?

199
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,380
That's what I want to do!

200
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,740
You cheating slut!

201
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,300
I didn't cheat on you!

202
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,590
I love you.

203
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,880
Could it be that you made up this lie?

204
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,010
I treat you like my own child.

205
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,770
How could you do this to me?

206
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,150
Don't wrong me.

207
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,330
I didn't say anything.

208
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,130
It's you.

209
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,480
You set me up once again

210
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,260
for her.

211
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,320
It wasn't me.

212
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,010
I didn't say anything too.

213
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,110
I was the one who told him.

214
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,590
What you did with Chen Yin

215
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,120
was caught on camera.

216
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,580
It was you!

217
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,020
You bastard!

218
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,190
You hit her!

219
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,010
Honey,

220
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,840
I did it all for you.

221
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,320
When Ye Huating was alive,

222
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,430
you were always restrained in the company.

223
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,980
That's why I contacted people in the company

224
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,130
to get information for you.

225
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,480
Old witch.

226
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,730
How dare you mention my grandfather?

227
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,840
You had an affair with Chen Yin at home

228
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,300
and discussed how to transfer information about the company's property.

229
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,960
Do you want me to play the recording to my father?

230
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,200
Dad, this is the USB drive.

231
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,480
I've sorted it out.

232
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,020
The file name is your meadow and your home.

233
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,270
Wanqing.

234
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,340
You know

235
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,770
I did everything for this family.

236
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,750
Mom, you just did it wrong.

237
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,190
Everyone has to pay for the mistakes they make.

238
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,030
I can't let the fruits of dad's efforts

239
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,510
be taken by others.

240
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,100
You're going to keep messing around?

241
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,490
Ye Shuyuan.

242
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,370
We are both involved in this matter.

243
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,150
What I did

244
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,250
is nothing compared to what you did.

245
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,000
Enough!

246
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,720
I don't want to hear any more of this.

247
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,400
And I never want to see you again!

248
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,500
Dad, we can't just leave it like that.

249
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,500
You can continue to be a father to this child if you want.

250
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,770
But I don't want to be a sister to someone who is not related to me.

251
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,570
You're right.

252
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,910
Whose child is this?

253
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,130
Honey, this child is yours.

254
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,050
Don't you understand their minds?

255
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,040
They must be afraid that

256
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,940
our baby would steal their property.

257
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,140
How can you guarantee that?

258
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,950
What if this baby

259
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,310
is someone else's?

260
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,260
I swear to God

261
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,910
this baby is definitely yours!

262
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,330
Or I'll be damned.

263
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,930
Bring him over.

264
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,160
Shen Lingzhu,

265
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,790
you're such a slut!

266
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,440
Honey,

267
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,340
I don't have any feelings for him.

268
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,860
I still love you.

269
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,540
You are the mighty Mr. Ye outside,

270
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,270
but you are the father of my baby

271
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,920
to me.

272
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Shut up!

273
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:38,940
Dad.

274
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,590
Look.

275
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,200
Paternity testing is available for fetuses.

276
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,110
It only takes 10ml of blood

277
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,540
to find out whose baby it is.

278
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,840
You... You shut up too.

279
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,510
Stop it.

280
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,820
Dad is so angry!

281
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,760
I'll cut off only one of your legs

282
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,680
if this baby is mine.

283
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,800
If not,

284
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,880
I'll kill you!

285
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,190
Are you satisfied with my performance?

286
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,560
Honey, trust me.

287
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,740
Well done.

288
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,520
As for you,

289
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,550
I won't spare you!

290
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,030
Dad!

291
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,960
Don't use your own belt.

292
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,180
Use mine.

293
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,530
Here.

294
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,900
Mr. Ye.

295
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,630
Mr. Ye!

296
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,180
Dad.

297
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,970
Mom is pregnant.

298
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,300
Mom.

299
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,680
You can only go to the hospital for a paternity test now.

300
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,960
I'll do it.

301
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,220
The evil stepmother has finally been punished.

302
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,700
I'm so proud of myself.

303
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,660
I'm finally one step closer to the end.

304
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,020
Throw all this woman's stuff out.

305
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,190
This evil woman

306
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,270
is finally gone.

307
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,180
Yes.

308
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,010
I wonder if Miss Lu

309
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,020
will continue to live here.

310
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,540
She's just as annoying as her mother.

311
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,850
Miss Ye is Mr. Ye's biological daughter.

312
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,630
You're right.

313
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,760
Ms Lu is such a poser!

314
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,190
However,

315
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,850
she will definitely not give up her identity as a rich girl easily.

316
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,960
Mrs. Wang,

317
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,340
please get me a taxi

318
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,180
and send these to my mother.

319
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,920
Miss Lu,

320
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,210
have you forgotten?

321
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,290
It's not my job.

322
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,880
Since you still call me Miss Lu,

323
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,790
it means you haven't forgotten who you are.

324
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,900
Don't you know what you should do?

325
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,740
In fact, today's shooting has ended.

326
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,610
But I still want to

327
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,790
share a place

328
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,250
with you.

329
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,910
This is my secret base.

330
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,610
Once I ran away from home as a child

331
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,220
and I came here somehow.

332
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,490
I was standing here thinking,

333
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,650
since there were so many cars,

334
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,010
would there be one that could take me away?

335
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,240
Until I met a brother.

336
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,170
It's her.

337
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,310
Have you been separated from your family?

338
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,240
Thank you, brother.

339
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,270
What is this?

340
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,570
This is a bird whistle.

341
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,440
Take it.

342
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,900
Great.

343
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,600
I never thought I would be so popular.

344
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,300
You've got me speechless.

345
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,900
I can't believe you're working on this thing so early.

346
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,360
I'm just curious about

347
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,290
what the real or fake rich girl challenge

348
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,510
actually means.

349
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,180
It turns out it's about Lu Wanqing.

350
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,510
It seems that the heroine is designed as beautiful, capable, but unlucky.

351
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,310
It will all be over now if I fight back one more time.

352
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,600
Unfortunately, Shen Lingzhu got sick

353
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,200
and was sent to the hospital.

354
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,530
Sick?

355
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,220
Yun Yi found out that

356
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,470
this baby does not belong to Ye Shuyuan.

357
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,680
Your mother's case

358
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,670
may need a little more time.

359
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,570
What a clichéd story.

360
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,300
When will it end?

361
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,630
Hello?

362
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,340
I'm free.

363
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,460
Well,

364
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,620
see you tomorrow.

365
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,750
Bye.

366
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,380
It was Mr. Jackson.

367
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,900
He asked me to meet him at home tomorrow morning

368
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,250
to complete the handover of the entrusted shares.

369
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,110
It seems that everything is really coming to an end.

370
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,270
Mr. Jackson.

371
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,160
Feng Muchen.

372
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,360
You should be free tomorrow, right?

373
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,960
Can you

374
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,170
meet Mr. Jackson with me?

375
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,120
I can accompany you tomorrow.

376
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,510
How much

377
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,060
are these stocks worth?

378
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,160
Do you think

379
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,830
I should spend some of the money before I leave?

380
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,610
[Yun Yi]

381
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,610
[Reject] [Answer]

382
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,640
After all, I probably won't be able to make that much money

383
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,910
in my life.

384
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,190
Okay.

385
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,660
I have something to do.

386
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,610
I need to leave now.

387
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,360
Go ahead.

388
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,560
I'll plan it properly.

389
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,280
Feed it.

390
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,880
Here, Runze.

391
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,520
Eat.

392
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:24,900
Hello.

393
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,970
Hello, Mr. Jackson.

394
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,020
Hello, Lisa.

395
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,570
Thank you for coming all the way.

396
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,120
Hello.

397
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,730
You are really quite similar

398
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,420
to how I imagined you to be.

399
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,750
First of all, I have to apologize to you.

400
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,020
I pretended to be you at Ye's Group

401
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,780
when I was helping Ye Wange with the project.

402
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,330
But I definitely didn't do anything wrong.

403
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,910
Do you think I would

404
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,230
still meet with you in peace

405
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,120
if you had done something wrong?

406
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:03,930
Seriously.

407
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,640
Why are you trying so hard

408
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,410
to find me?

409
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,870
Could you keep the fact that I was pretending to be you a secret

410
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,030
when you meet Ge?

411
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,910
Because she doesn't really like asking for people's help.

412
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,680
Ge has better taste in men

413
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,050
than her mother.

414
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,850
The most important purpose of my return this time

415
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,800
is to complete the handover of Ye's shares with Ge.

416
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,180
At the behest of her mother,

417
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,220
I've been managing her shares for years.

418
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,330
This is very unfavorable

419
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,270
for Ye Shuyuan's shareholding.

420
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,670
So my current situation is very dangerous.

421
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,670
Ye Shuyuan wants to hurt you?

422
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,120
In fact, I have experienced a lot of difficulties

423
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,410
since the day I booked the flight.

424
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,010
My home abroad was constantly being harassed.

425
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,430
In order not to reveal my itinerary information,

426
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,350
I booked tickets for different time periods.

427
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,400
And all I told others was my fake return time.

428
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,030
No wonder Yun Yi...

429
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,390
He's also known as my assistant.

430
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,280
He found a lot of flight information

431
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,040
when he checked your flight.

432
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,490
So he had to keep waiting at the airport.

433
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,100
I never show my true face.

434
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,180
Now is the peak tourist season,

435
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,840
so it's safest for me to wear it like this.

436
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,230
But your assistant

437
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:18,960
is quite smart.

438
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,220
He spotted me right away.

439
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,790
He is much smarter than Ye Shuyuan's subordinates.

440
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,870
Thank you for complimenting him.

441
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,100
Although he is usually silly,

442
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,300
he is actually quite reliable when he is doing something.

443
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,680
I felt that this matter should be finished as soon as possible,

444
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,070
so I made an appointment with Ge to finish the handover tomorrow morning.

445
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,470
But before that,

446
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,300
you have to help me with one thing.

447
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,190
What is it?

448
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,060
Feng Muchen

449
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,120
went out so early in the morning

450
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,810
in disguise of Mr. Jackson.

451
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,980
Did he expect that I couldn't tell?

452
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,170
He made me happy yesterday for nothing.

453
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,400
I'll definitely punish him later.

454
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,570
Mr. Jackson.

455
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,470
My conspiracy line.

456
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,880
Hello, beautiful lady.

457
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,000
Hello.

458
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,430
Come in.

459
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,000
Okay.

460
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,770
Master Jackson,

461
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,550
how come your voice is not hoarse anymore?

462
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,280
I lost my voice before.

463
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,580
Now I'm fine.

464
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,070
Ning Yuan,

465
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,610
go make a cup of tea.

466
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,120
Okay.

467
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,200
Thank you, young man.

468
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,750
Haven't seen you in years,

469
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,270
and you've grown so tall.

470
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,760
You're looking more and more like your mother.

471
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,320
Ge.

472
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,090
Come to my place sometime,

473
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,810
I'll take you to have fun.

474
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,740
If there is a chance.

475
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,030
There must be a chance.

476
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,270
We're already home.

477
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,630
There are no outsiders.

478
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,670
Why don't you just take off your disguise?

479
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,100
OK.

480
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,540
Let me help you.

481
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,470
Take it off.

482
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,390
Why are you still as naughty

483
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,010
as when you were a child?

484
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,280
My hair.

485
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,380
Well...

486
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,110
Here you are.

487
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,550
You ripped

488
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,340
my hair out.

489
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,800
Ning Yuan, where's the tea?

490
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,580
Hurry up.

491
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,300
Coming.

492
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,650
Coming.

493
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,390
Your tea, please.

494
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,990
Thank you.

495
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,750
You have grown so big

496
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,600
from such a small little girl,

497
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,470
but why do you have to

498
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,970
trouble with my hair?

499
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,960
I'm getting old.

500
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,140
My hair is very fragile now.

501
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,720
It's my fault.

502
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,850
Sorry.

503
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,420
People say not to stare at your head,

504
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,360
so I thought you were...

505
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,120
Technology is improving every day.

506
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,360
Everyone wants to make their appearance look better.

507
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,560
If Feng encounters such a problem in the future,

508
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
let him come to me.

509
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,220
I know the best doctor.

510
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,980
Then do you know that Feng Muchen pretended to be you before?

511
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,280
I'm such a big mouth.

512
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,380
He didn't want me to tell you.

513
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,510
As soon as I landed,

514
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,400
he came to me

515
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,630
and apologized to me.

516
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,190
Feng is a nice guy.

517
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,120
Then why did he go out

518
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,080
pretending to be you this morning?

519
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
He has experience pretending to be me.

520
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
I asked him to attend an event for me.

521
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,920
Really?

522
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,680
Alright.

523
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,370
Let's get down to business.

524
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,700
Ge,

525
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,520
this is your shares

526
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,250
that your mother asked me to hold on your behalf.

527
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:30,910
Take a look.

528
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,410
Sign here,

529
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,830
if there's no problem.

530
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,120
Okay.

531
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,450
[Yep's Share Power of Attorney]

532

[Party B: (Personal) Ye Wange]

533
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,850
There is one more thing

534
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,610
I want to ask you.

535
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,540
Do you know

536
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,940
why my mom was in jail before?

537
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,900
I know.

538
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,580
You have been investigating for so many years,

539
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,990
and so have I.

540
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,870
And in the end, none of us found anything.

541
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,470
But I can be sure that

542
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,780
Shen Lingzhu is at most a pawn.

543
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,240
The person who killed your mother was someone else.
