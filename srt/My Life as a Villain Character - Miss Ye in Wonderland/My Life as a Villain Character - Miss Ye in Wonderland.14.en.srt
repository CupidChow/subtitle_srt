[Episode 14]

4
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,150
This is pretty.

5
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,570
This one too.

6
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,890
Give it to me.

7
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,420
That's all.

8
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,240
The one I'm wearing is a little large.

9
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,310
Let me see.

10
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,660
Yes, this dress

11
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,380
needs to be altered.

12
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,660
The shoulder

13
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,699
and the waist need to be altered.

14
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,900
You'll look good after that.

15
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,640
It feels so familiar.

16
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,790
Do you remember something?

17
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,320
You...

18
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,290
Why do you suddenly ask me that?

19
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,100
Maybe Ye Wange

20
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,900
in this novel

21
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,460
used to wear

22
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,690
custom-made clothes.

23
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,450
She still doesn't remember.

24
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,560
This way.

25
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,050
This way.

26
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,000
It's Aunt Zhu.

27
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,850
She's cheating on my dad.

28
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,670
Wait.

29
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,670
Who is this man?

30
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,860
He's the director.

31
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,190
Why are you here?

32
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,650
I miss you.

33
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,840
Your dad

34
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,310
is a cuckold.

35
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,790
Sad.

36
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,840
I thought she would behave

37
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,240
after she married my dad.

38
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,930
I never thought she would do it.

39
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,190
Hurry up. Phone.

40
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,450
Hurry up.

41
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,710
Here.

42
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,030
Don't turn it off. I need some fresh air.

43
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,310
Look how hot you are.

44
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm not.

45
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,990
I'm angry.

46
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,960
When I saw Ye Wange

47
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,020
was showing off,

48
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,760
I was so angry.

49
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,630
Don't worry.

50
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,880
If I cancel Ye Wange's work now,

51
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,250
I'm afraid my subordinates won't accept.

52
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,490
Just wait a few more days.

53
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,190
You have me.

54
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,420
What are you afraid of?

55
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,390
I'll protect you if anything happens.

56
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,600
Besides,

57
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,340
the new company will be ready soon.

58
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,920
Ye Huating is going to work there.

59
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,900
He will not have time to manage the work here.

60
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,400
By then,

61
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,480
we don't have to sneak around.

62
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,790
Then it's all us...

63
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,390
They left.

64
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,340
I didn't record anything.

65
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,680
It's for nothing.

66
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,580
Not really.

67
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,620
We learned something.

68
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,010
What did you learn?

69
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,010
What are you doing?

70
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,600
Wipe it under the window.

71
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,450
Hello.

72
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,470
Have you checked the surveillance?

73
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,390
Chen, how is it?

74
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,340
Director Chen.

75
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,350
Zhu.

76
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,830
My idol is coming. Hurry up.

77
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,020
Who's coming today?

78
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,100
Jackson is coming.

79
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,880
Well, I'll leave you to it.

80
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,110
I'm leaving.

81
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:38,490
Okay.

82
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Hurry up.

83
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,490
I didn't expect the director to be such a pervert.

84
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,270
I want to kiss you in the office.

85
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,150
Who's coming today?

86
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,670
Mr. Jackson is coming.

87
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,180
Mr. Jackson, that's great!

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,770
I must seize this chance

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
to find out the cause of mom's death.

90
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,240
That's too much

91
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,900
to welcome Mr. Jackson.

92
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,520
We have to get well prepared to welcome

93
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,720
such a superstar.

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,860
It is said that he has never failed

95
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,470
any projects.

96
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,360
How amazing!

97
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,680
Awesome.

98
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,030
What's his plan for coming back?

99
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,110
He seems to have a new project.

100
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,440
Let me remind you.

101
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,510
Don't keep staring at him.

102
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,160
Why?

103
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,530
I don't know. Someone told me.

104
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,210
By the way, your trial sales are so good.

105
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,750
Do we have enough products for the promotion festival?

106
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,720
Of course not.

107
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,780
I'll talk to the director.

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
-Okay. -Go ahead.

109
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,000
You can go home.

110
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,630
Okay.

111
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,570
Mr. Jackson.

112
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,930
The dressing room is messy.

113
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,100
Something must have dropped.

114
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,430
[Ye's]

115
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,380
Come in.

116
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,220
Miss Ye, have a seat.

117
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,020
I have good news for you.

118
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,010
Our new product is selling very well.

119
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,320
But I checked the stock and found it was not enough.

120
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,900
So I want to apply for an additional production line.

121
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,270
Well.

122
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,250
Although our sales are good every year,

123
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,710
it's also a heavy task to get rid of the stock.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,510
Since you have such outstanding performance in this field,

125
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,909
you should keep doing it.

126
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,800
At the end of this season,

127
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,260
I'll give you a special contribution award.

128
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,050
Think about it.

129
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,790
As long as we add one more production line,

130
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,980
we can make the discontinued products last year

131
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,840
into the popular style this year.

132
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,230
This new product has proved it.

133
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,000
At the same time, we can release the new product

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,650
in the third quarter press conference.

135
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,460
Isn't that perfect?

136
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,160
Miss Ye,

137
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,660
I promised to let you sell online

138
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,700
if your trial sales are good.

139
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,530
I didn't agree to add the production line.

140
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,170
But I think

141
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,260
we should develop our minds.

142
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,810
Famous brands are good,

143
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,390
but we need to expand the market, right?

144
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,550
I don't have the final say in making new products.

145
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,480
We need all departments to decide.

146
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,640
Besides, the promotion festival is coming

147
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,340
and we don't have enough people.

148
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,169
I promise

149
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,640
it is definitely a low investment with a high return.

150
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,799
Just wait for my Orange Cube proposal.

151
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,990
The third quarter meeting is tomorrow.

152
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,110
Can you make it?

153
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,670
Don't worry about that.

154
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,750
Ge.

155
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,700
Are you rejected for the production line?

156
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,950
How did you know?

157
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,320
The chapters are updated?

158
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,900
That's too easy to guess.

159
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,390
If they want to make things difficult for you,

160
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,720
there are only two ways.

161
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,350
Either reject your proposal

162
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,980
or don't support you.

163
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,370
Then help me, genius.

164
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,920
What I should do now?

165
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,670
Have some fruit.

166
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,620
How much money do you have?

167
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,670
Not enough at all.

168
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,890
How about this?

169
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,260
I can help you with two production lines from Feng's Group.

170
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,650
They are available now.

171
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,380
No.

172
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,860
I promised to support you.

173
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,190
How can I ask you to help me?

174
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,960
Besides,

175
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,600

Why are you still acting tough at this time?

177
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,510
Look.

178
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,930
Your plan has passed the test.

179
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,140
The data is good.

Be confident.

181
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,260
When the proposal is approved,

182
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,580
the production line needs to follow up.

183
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,140
Otherwise, you'll ask for help.

184
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,670
You will be worried by then.

185
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,420
You have a point.

186

Is Mr. Ye here?

195

He's on a business trip.

Let us know beforehand.

197
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,750
It would be awkward

198

for you to show up abruptly.

199

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,080
So I made you an iced Americano.

351
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,290
What's wrong?

352
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,750
No, it's not my perfume.

353
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,880
Looks like I have to use my ultimate skill.

354
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,520
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,210
It's my fault.

356
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,570
Let me wipe it for you.

357
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,790
What are you going to do now?

358
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,730
Did I make a mistake?

359
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,700
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,640
I...

361
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,290
Let me send it to dry cleaning.

362
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,890
What should I wear

363
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,360
then?

364
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,700
Wear...

365
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,550
Do you have my spare clothes?

366
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,990
There's tissue.

367
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,020
Wipe it for me.

368
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,600
Tissue.

369
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,490
Okay.

370
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,430
I think you're very nice.

371
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,860
So I forgive you.

372
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,690
But

373
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,480
when you bring coffee

374
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,500
to your boyfriend,

375
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,030
will you spill it on him?

376
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,480
Work hard.

377
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,240
Be good to your future husband.

378
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,730
Goodbye, Miss Ye.

379
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,620
Wait.

380
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,130
If he really is a big shot,

381
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,480
he wouldn't be angry?

382
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,600
After him!

383
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,030
Help me see if anyone is coming.

384
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,620
Okay.

385
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,200
Here.

386
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,250
Boss,

387
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,570
Your beard looks quite handsome.

388
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,800
Hurry up.

389
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,320
I didn't expect her to be so difficult.

390
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,460
Boss, Miss Ye is coming.

391
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,300
Let's go.

392
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,410
Miss Ye, you're here.

393
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,040
Are you here to meet Boss?

394
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,550
Yes.

395
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Boss.

396
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,010
Boss.

397
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,980
Boss.

398
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,790
Mr. Feng, are you busy?

399
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,270
Why are you here?

400
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,990
You are too busy, so I came

401
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,500
to send my love.

402
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,250
Miss Ye,

403
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,330
the puff here is very delicious.

404
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,010
Let's go. I'll take you there.

405
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,450
I don't want to eat.

406
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,600
Miss Ye! Miss Ye!

407
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,900
My goodness.

408
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,460
Your lips are so beautiful today.

409
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,240
I've always been beautiful.

410
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,800
Move.

411
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,960
You are working so hard.

412
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,100
So many books.

413
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,880
Yes, I've been busy lately.

414
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,630
How's your new product?

415
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,770
It's good.

416
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,310
It's just that I haven't seen you for a long time.

417
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,750
I'm a little worried.

418
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,330
Worried about what?

419
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,080
Why are you sitting?

420
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,940
Are you feeling unwell?

421
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,950
The sparrows outside the window

422
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,500
are twittering on the pole.

423
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,790
Yun YI, what's wrong with you?

424
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,750
No, Miss Ye.

425
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,940
Look, the weather is very clear today.

426
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,630
The sparrows outside the window

427
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,930
are twittering on the pole.

428
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,020
You said...

429
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,030
He has my perfume on him.

430
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,790
Are you suspecting that

431
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,220
I'm with other girls in the company these days?

432
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,890
Right?

433
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,800
No.

434
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,150
Then why did I feel like you want to get me on the spot?

435
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,860
