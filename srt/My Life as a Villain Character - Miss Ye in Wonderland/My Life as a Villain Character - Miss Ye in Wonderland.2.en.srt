176
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,790
if I set up Feng Muchen and Lu Wanqing?

177
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,510
[Done]

178
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,470
Ye Wange.

179
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,430
You're so smart.

180
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,540
You're a genius.

181
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,310
You're so clever.

182
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,150
Take a bath.

183
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,390
Go to sleep.

184
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,660
How can I make a person

185
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,780
who is all about career

186
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,220
believe in love?

187
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,470
Miss.

188
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,860
Your juice.

189
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,430
Thank you.

190
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,980
My dear boss.

191
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,710
You came yesterday.

192
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,700
And today, here you are again.

193
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,510
Don't you think

194
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,270
we seem a little too needy?

195
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,460
There are rumors

196
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,460
that Ye Wange refused my proposal and dumped me.

197
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,500
Feng's reputation is so tarnished

198
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,580
and our stock has plunged.

199
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,020
I must find out

200
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,740
what this woman is thinking.

201
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,180
Annoying.

202
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,420
Damn it.

203
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,820
Miss! Miss!

204
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,500
You hit the wall.

205
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,300
What are you doing?

206
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,660
You should take care of yourself.

207
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,030
That's not what I meant.

208
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,900
Miss, listen to me.

209
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,110
Miss...

210
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,860
Don't stop me.

211
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,300
Are you all right?

212
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,190
Ye Wange.

213
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,990
What are you doing?

214
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,910
Save him! Save him!

215
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,140
Boss, he doesn't seem to be able to swim.

216
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,500
Come on, come up.

217
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,270
Ye Wange.

218
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,300
Come up.

219
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,390
Stop milking it.

220
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,140
Yesterday you broke the marriage.

221
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,780
Today you sought to die,

222
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,060
and even pushed him into the water.

223
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,060
What are you doing?

224
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,820
Am I that smart…

225
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,140
vicious in your mind?

226
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
I don't have time for you.

227
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,420
Quickly.

228
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,220
Come on up.

229
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,660
It's okay.

230
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,670
Are you hurt?

231
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,110
I'm glad you're okay, Miss.

232
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,540
Ye Wange.

233
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,590
What the hell are you doing every day?

234
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,660
Excuse me?

235
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,230
This is my home.

236
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,140
You come here every day.

237
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,340
Don't you have your own home?

238
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,860
You do this

239
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,260
because you expect to see me, don't you?

240
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,540
Different-looking bosses

241
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,150

242
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,660
No way.

244
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,740
Why are you going again?

245
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,500
I haven't finished talking yet.

246

Ye Wange.

251
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,570
You've repeatedly upended my views.

252
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,460
Boss, are you okay?

253
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,980
Do I look like I'm okay?

254
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,420
So many clothes and cosmetics.

255
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,770

00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,540
Comfy.

260
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,540
I'm so embarrassed this time.

It's all because of you.

Let's talk about the wedding.

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,900
I think

273
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,770
you'd be better off with Wanqing.

274
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,930
You were already planning to get married.

How did she know you were here?

280
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,610
Maybe she just saw me.

281

Feng Muchen is here.

282

Is Muchen here?

283
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,370
Where is he?

284
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,010
Are you eager to let her see us flirting?

285
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,690
I heard from Mrs. Wang

that she saw Feng Muchen coming.

I mean.

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,810
Why do you always touch me up?

291

Don't you want me to do it?

292

I...

293
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,460
I'll continue with what I just said.

294
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,130
Your plan to marry Lu Wanqing

295
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,570
was interrupted because I was pregnant, right?

296
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,410
Now I don't want you to be responsible for it.

297
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,250
Everything is back to what it was.

What are you still dissatisfied with?

299

have other thoughts?

301
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,410
I think it's you who have other thoughts.

302
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,290
In the past,

303
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,290
you went to great lengths to court me.

304

You liked me.

305
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:10,420
And now?

306
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,490
You've got the shareholding, but you reject me.

307
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,640
What are you thinking?

308
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,609
I just think

309
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,760
that we don't need to rush into anything.

310
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,930
It's better to solve the misunderstanding

311
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,690
between you and Lu Wanqing first.

312
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,890
Is there a mechanism in your pool?

00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,090
How can you get a wound?

314

It's not good to wear them wet.

Wait.

Go on, go on.

329
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,410
Dry my clothes.

330
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,320
Go, go dry it.

331
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,050
Go on, go on.

332
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,970
You don't have to come back.

333
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,730
Go on, go on.

334
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,290
Go.

335
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,090
All right.

336
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,960

You promised to go there before.

339
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,770
Why did you make a dinner date with Miss Lu?

340
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,050
Tomorrow is the launch event,

341
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,720
where Ye Wange's shareholding will be announced.

342
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,650
But Mr. Ye didn't invite me.

343
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,840
That means he doesn't want me to marry Ye Wange.

344
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,770
So you're meeting Miss Lu today

345
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,530
so you can manage to attend it

346
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,890
and announce your marriage to Miss Ye.

347
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,530

you can handle all women

Do you need my help?

Don't you need me for anything, Miss Lu?

When I came in,

I saw a lot of reporters outside.

364
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,960
will it help with the public opinion against you

366

about the marriage proposal.

371
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,680
It seems that the Feng family

372
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,640
really needs to marry the Ye family

373

to survive this disaster.

374
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,160
Otherwise, you wouldn't have even married Ye Wange.
