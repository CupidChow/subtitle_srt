1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,800
Since you see lots of ghosts,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,240
have you seen Kai's ghost?

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,840
Where is he now?

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,520
Can you help us look for him?

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,800
Let her go and come with me!

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,160
They're here to help us. Let go!

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,200
Tip!

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,560
‪PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,040
Thank you to all of you as well.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,440
From now on, please take care
of each other in heaven.

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,640
It's time for us
to bid goodbye to Yod as well.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,720
I can't leave.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,880
Guys! Look.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Siriphon might be someone Yod knew.

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,640
In front of Siriphon's room,

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,360
I found the diamond bracelet
that she always wore.

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,400
I tried to return it to her myself.

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,040
After that, I heard

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,400
that Siriphon had already moved abroad.

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,960
You want to talk to her

21
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,360
one more time, right?

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Is there something Yod wants to tell me?

23
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,400
Where is Yod right now?

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,160
He's right next to you at the moment.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,480
Yod.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,400
Is there still something bothering you?

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,680
You can tell me.

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,320
I never thought I'd meet you again.

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,440
Thank you for still waiting for me.

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,160
Even though this place might change,

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,160
I always feel at ease whenever I'm here,

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,400
because you're watching over this place.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,040
Thank you.

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
Siriphon.

35
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,160
Back then, I didn't have
the courage to confess my feelings.

36
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Even now, in death,

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,240
I still can't confess
for fear of upsetting you.

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,200
To me, you're like a beautiful flower,

39
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,080
a beautiful flower on a branch.

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,600
Even though you keep telling me

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,600
not to think less of myself,

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,200
I don't have the courage
to mess with a beautiful flower like you.

43
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,600
May I have your permission

44
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,720
to appreciate your beauty from afar?

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,960
Thank you.

46
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,120
You will also be
one of my beautiful friendships.

47
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,120
Thank you so much.

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,040
Goodbye.

49
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,720
Thank you both as well.

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,960
Goodbye.

51
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,240
Thank you everyone.

52
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,800
If you hadn't reached out to me,

53
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,360
I would never have known

54
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,200
that Yod was still waiting for me.

55
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,480
Thanks to your letter,

56
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,880
we were able to contact you.

57
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,120
But Yod's lucky

58
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,920
that you returned at the right time.

59
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,880
Right. Toop-Hom?

60
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,320
We cleaned up Yod's room and found this.

61
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,520
Looks like he's been keeping it very well,

62
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,000
waiting to give it back to you.

63
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,640
I'll keep him in
my memories forever as well.

64
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
And that concludes
the story of my first job

65
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,920
with SixSense Agency.

66
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,520
If anyone needs help,

67
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,360
you can direct message me.
We're here to help.

68
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,520
Who told you that?

69
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,680
Why are you sitting alone in our room?

70
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,720
Tom already said he'll work with us.

71
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,320
I really can help you.

72
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,240
How could you guys
manage to complete this task

73
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,920
and sell the land without me?

74
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,400
I can see his talent.

75
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,360
But our company is small.

76
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,600
I don't think
we can afford more employees.

77
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,320
Agreed.

78
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,040
You're here to lend a hand.

79
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,560
We don't have much salary to offer.

80
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,720
Then, I would like to intern
without any pay.

81
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,880
Welcome to SixSense Agency.

82
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
This might be good.

83
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,560
Right, good. As you said.

84
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,160
Hey!

85
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,440
-What's wrong?
-A mouse!

86
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,240
-Mouse, mouse!
-Mouse?

87
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,440
I think it's gone.
There's no mouse here anymore.

88
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,799
If Yod were still here,

89
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,960
he would surely
take better care of the resort.

90
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,840
Right, I agree.

91
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,280
I really admire him.

92
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,200
I mean, he's been stuck here for 30 years.

93
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,560
Yeah.

94
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,000
I also think that

95
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,760
if I have anything on my mind,
I won't hesitate anymore.

96
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,800
If I have feelings for someone,
I'll tell them right away.

97
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,960
Right.

98
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,160
But I can't remember
if I have feelings for anyone.

99
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,800
What about you?

100
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,800
What about you?

101
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,640
Do you have feelings for anyone?

102
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,360
Lt. Tip!

103
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,760
Lt. Tip, don't!

104
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,560
Tip?

105
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,360
I remember now.

106
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,440
Kai…

107
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,440
FELL OFF MOUNTAIN - BOON - HUNTED -
SEE GHOSTS - MEMORY LOSS

108
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,800
She fell off the cliff
and can't remember anything.

109
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,680
Before she lost consciousness,
she told me that

110
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,000
someone was trying to kill her.

111
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,600
SEE GHOSTS - MEMORY LOSS - TIP - SAFE
MAN IN BLACK TRIES TO KILL ME ON A CLIFF

112
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,080
Toop-Hom.

113
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,200
Did you hear that?
Tip said she can remember Kai.

114
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,720
-Yeah.
-If she can remember Kai,

115
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,280
she might remember
the whereabouts of the safe.

116
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,920
Remember only the whereabouts
of the safe or also about us?

117
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,920
TIP - SAFE -
MAN IN BLACK TRIES TO KILL ME - KAI

118
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,880
Kai.

119
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,680
If you can't repay the loan with interest,

120
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,640
we will have to sell the house
you put up as collateral.

121
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,920
What is the selling price set by the bank?

122
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,040
Around 20 million baht.

123
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,720
Can I have a bit more time?

124
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,760
I really want that building back.

125
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,120
Mr. Ong, please think carefully.

126
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,880
If we can sell the apartment
and deduct the loan

127
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,640
plus interest that you owe,

128
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,360
you will have millions of baht left over.

129
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,440
The only way you can prevent us
from selling the apartment

130
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,120
is to return the 14 million baht

131
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,600
to us on time.

132
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,560
Yes.

133
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,920
I understand.

134
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,920
Thank you.

135
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
Hey.

136
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Did something happen?

137
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,960
Huh?

138
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,560
I notice you look stressed, so I think I
might be able to help you with something.

139
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,520
Look at you.

140
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,440
It looks like
you're worried about something.

141
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,600
It's nothing. Work is going well.

142
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,720
What would I be worried about?

143
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,840
HOUSE FOR SALE URGENTLY

146
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,800
We're ready to deal with ghosts
for your property.

147
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,840
Contact us, SixSense Agency.

148
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,840
How was it?
The promo video I edited myself.

149
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,560
It's interesting.

150
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,360
You did a great job.

151
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,080
What do you think?

152
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,120
I think it's a bit scary.

153
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,360
Scary?

154
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,920
I find it trustworthy.

155
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,760
Hey.

156
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,680
Can you upload it online?

157
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,280
I already uploaded some of it
to a few free commercial groups,

158
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,320
mostly in buddha amulet and market groups.

159
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,240
I don't think these groups
match our target audience.

160
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,040
Contacted by Shining Buddha Amulet Shop.

161
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
We're reaching out
because we want to sell a building.

162
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,440
How?

163
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,160
I want to sell this building.

164
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,680
But the problem is that
the workers get haunted

165
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,680
every time they start renovating.

166
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,160
Mr. Sakda, you mean ghosts, right?

167
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,520
Yes.

168
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,080
Well… do you know what kind of ghost?

169
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,520
From what I heard,

170
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,880
they said they heard a ghost's voice.

171
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,200
I think it's the ghost of a woman who used
to rent this building for a restaurant.

172
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Her name is Chaba.

173
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,760
Don't worry.

174
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,680
We'll handle this.

175
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,720
Huh?

176
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,760
-He's already over there.
-So fast.

177
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,800
If you walk this close to Tip,

178
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,520
how can she work comfortably?

179
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,160
Am I making you feel uncomfortable?

180
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,120
I'm sorry.

181
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,520
Not at all. I'm fine.

182
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,760
I'm fine.

183
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
What?

184
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,480
It's full of dust inside.

185
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,280
Chang.

186
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,200
What should we do with Tip?

187
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,440
Or…

188
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,120
She already knows the truth
but pretended she doesn't.

189
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,400
-Pretend she didn't?
-Right.

190
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,560
For safety,

191
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,440
I think

192
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,720
we should only talk with Tip
about what's necessary,

193
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,240
-I see.
-or we should stay away from her.

194
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,560
Boss! You scared me.

195
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,480
How is it around the building?
Is there anything interesting?

196
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,640
We found nothing. Literally nothing.

197
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,120
Or maybe, the ghost is hiding from us?

198
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,720
We have to find a way to lure Chaba out.

199
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,800
But we don't know how
because we have no information.

200
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,760
Guys.

201
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,040
Look.

202
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,720
Huh?

203
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,000
He jumped from there,

204
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,960
so he's supposed to be here.

205
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,319
Where's the body?

206
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,160
Wait.

207
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,480
Was there someone who
jumped from the building?

208
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,079
Yeah. You didn't see?

209
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,560
No, I saw nothing.

210
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,720
Well… up there.

211
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Tip. Tip!

212
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,720
-Let's go!
-Wait, Toop!

213
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,280
Tom's the only one who can't see a ghost.

214
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,480
-Right.
-That means…

215
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,920
That is…

216
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
is…

217
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Hey you!

218
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
You.

219
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,120
Do you hear us?

220
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,400
Tip.

221
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
Is there someone here?

222
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,600
The reason Tom can't see him
is because he's a ghost!

223
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,720
A suicidal ghost?

224
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,840
Do you know how tired and suffering I was?

225
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,880
Everything is over. I have nothing left.

226
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,480
Everything is over.

227
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,560
It's all because of me.

228
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,040
I ruined everything.

229
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,400
Why does he keep repeating everything?

230
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,920
He died by suicide,

231
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,200
so we won't be able to communicate.
His mind was messed up before he died.

232
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,000
Then we shouldn't waste our time
talking to him.

233
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,520
Let's find Chaba's ghost.
Come on, let's go.

234
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,720
Come on.

235
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,320
Chaba opened an à la carte restaurant.

236
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,280
-Huh?
-What?

237
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,760
He just said Chaba's name.

238
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,800
You know Chaba?

239
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,640
Enough, I've had it.

240
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,960
We want to know about Chaba.

241
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,320
Do you know her?

242
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,040
Everything is over.

243
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,280
It's all because of me.

244
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,680
Toop. Could you tell me about this person?

245
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,880
Sure.

246
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,680
Are you close with Chaba?

247
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,600
If I endure a bit longer,

248
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,080
everything won't turn out like this.

249
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,400
He only said Chaba's name once,

250
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,000
the rest was just gibberish.

251
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,640
Give him some time.

252
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Guys.

253
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,400
I found the information about him.

254
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,400
What is it?

255
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,480
I looked up suicide news around here,

256
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,960
combined that with his age
and appearance that Toop told me.

257
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
His name is Suchart.

258
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,880
They said someone saw a man's ghost

259
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,240
absentminded, murmuring,
and jumping off this building

260
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,400
at 8:00 p.m. every day.

261
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,600
Suchart faced a business problem
and ended up heavily in debt.

262
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,320
So he decided to escape
by jumping off the building.

263
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,200
People shouldn't give up this easily.

264
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,880
Someone who has failed their whole life

265
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,840
doesn't have many choices.

266
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,680
Since it's come to this,

267
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,080
will we be able to find Chaba's ghost?

268
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,600
You guys, please comfort Suchart

269
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,000
so that he might be more coherent.

270
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,960
Roger that.

271
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,520
It's a job we're good at.
Come on, Toop and Tom.

272
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,120
You, come with me.

273
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,400
Come on.

274
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Suchart.

275
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,400
Please calm down Suchart.

276
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,720
You have to keep going.

277
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,880
I started from zero, but look at me now.

278
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,520
-You have money.
-I have debt!

279
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,280
Hah! You shouldn't brag.

280
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Funny, right Suchart?

281
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,400
I have nothing left.

282
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,160
It's all gone.

283
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,240
There's no need to keep fighting.

284
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,000
Chang, nothing has changed.

285
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,000
It's my turn next.

286
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,000
Give me the beat.

287
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,600
Go!

288
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,760
-Huh?!
-What?!

289
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,720
Toop-Hom, what did you do?

290
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,240
Look, he jumped off the building again.

291
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,440
He keeps jumping off.

292
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,840
Chang! Suchart, he's…

293
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,520
back again.

294
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,520
Thr ghost is back again?

295
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,560
Yes.

296
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,960
What should we do?

297
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,600
How about I try this time?

298
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,320
The reason you have sympathy for Suchart

299
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,200
is because you're also
stressed about your debt, right?

300
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,680
Just tell me what happened.

301
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,600
The bank called me this morning.

302
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,920
They suggested
that I sell my dad's apartment.

303
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,120
I'll even get a substantial fee.

304
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,600
But I don't want the money.

305
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,160
I want my dad's building back
more than anything.

306
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,840
What's important is that

307
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,960
I want to get rid of the scandal
that I'm a failure.

308
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,080
You know the difference between
those who are dead and alive, right?

309
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,840
You

310
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,280
are luckier than Suchart
because you're alive and can keep going.

311
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,480
And you have a chance to win.

312
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,520
No one loses for life.

313
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,840
Hello, Toop-Hom?

314
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,880
He keeps laughing.

315
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,240
How did you manage
to put him in a good mood?

316
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,120
I saw a piece of coal lying around here.

317
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,640
So I invited Chang for a makeover.

318
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,520
You didn't invite me.

319
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,320
You and Toop forced me.

320
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,320
No, I should be depressed!

321
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,040
-Because my life is ruined.
-Wait, please wait!

322
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,920
I have nothing left.

323
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,040
I have to take responsibility
for everything I did.

324
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,280
I can't keep on living!

325
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,520
Enough, Suchart!

326
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,880
You won't stop suffering
if you keep doing this.

327
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,640
But it's better than living like this!

328
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,800
I'm in debt. I'm a failure.

329
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,040
I was also a failure.

330
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,160
I owe millions in debt.

331
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,720
But I still believe

332
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,120
there are other solutions
besides the one you chose.

333
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,640
This is not a solution?

334
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,880
It's not.

335
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,400
In fact, I should thank you

336
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,440
for making me realize.

337
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,680
I also have a lot of problems
on my hands right now.

338
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,360
I'm feeling pressured,

339
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,800
overthinking,

340
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,960
and unsure of what to do next.

341
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,920
Even if we run away from one problem,

342
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,680
we'll inevitably face another.

343
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,640
NOTICE OF SEIZURE

344
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,360
The problem, is that

345
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,040
no matter how many times you jump,

346
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,680
you still can't escape it.

347
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,680
Are you okay now?

348
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,360
Have you found a solution?

349
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,320
But I still hope

350
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,240
there will be one.

351
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,720
I'm sorry.

352
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,120
I just don't want to end up like you.

353
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,200
You make me not want to jump anymore.

354
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,800
I understand you now.

355
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,640
I opened a clothing export company
and set up the office in this building.

356
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,840
After my business failed,
I committed suicide.

357
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,080
That's why I find myself
trapped in this cycle of suicide.

358
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,600
The reason I blame myself

359
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,840
is because I made things
difficult for my business partner.

360
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,320
I don't even have a chance to apologize.

361
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,280
If you had a chance to apologize,

362
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,600
do you think
it would bring you some relief?

363
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,200
Yes.

364
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,600
Because everything failed

365
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,560
due to my own wrong decisions.

366
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,120
Then I'll help you.

367
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,520
Calm down Boss.
I think we should work slowly, job by job.

368
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Tip.

369
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,280
Letting Ong help Suchart in exchange
for Chaba's information would be great.

370
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,920
So, why do you want to meet Chaba's ghost?

371
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,400
We're a real estate company

372
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,080
and we want to sell the next building.

373
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,240
But the owner said
there's a very nasty ghost named Chaba.

374
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,040
She doesn't allow the workers
to go inside and dismantle things.

375
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,640
We want to ask

376
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,520
if you know her reason?

377
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,440
I'm close to her since we lived next door.

378
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,920
But ever since she stopped selling food,

379
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,560
she has locked herself in the house.

380
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,040
She only came out

381
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,200
when the lottery tickets were being sold.
She has a lottery gambling addiction.

382
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,120
Gambling addiction to the lottery?!

383
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,800
I have an idea

384
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,440
on how to lure Chaba's ghost out.

385
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,800
Let's hurry up.

386
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,080
Let's go.

387
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,120
At least we know
how to lure Chaba out tomorrow.

388
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,520
Can I go find Suchart's friend first?

389
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,920
Don't go yet.

390
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,280
Let's all lure Chaba's ghost out first.

391
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,000
But I already promised him.

392
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,080
I'll be back to help you guys tomorrow.

393
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,640
I can go with you.

394
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,680
You can't.

395
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,840
If both of you go together,

396
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,240
how can we see the ghost?

397
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,280
I think you should take Chang with you.

398
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,560
I'll leave it to you.

399
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,040
You don't need to worry about Chaba,

400
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,880
we'll handle it ourselves.

401
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,840
NONTHAPIMOLCHAI SHOP

402
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,760
Based on the information we have,

403
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,760
Suchart's business partner, Mr. Chokchai

404
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,840
might be here.

405
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,520
Why does the company

406
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,520
look so big? I think it's weird.

407
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,720
How?

408
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,080
Suchart's business failed, so he committed
suicide by jumping off the building.

409
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,080
Chang, are you trying to say

410
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,720
that Chokchai was involved
in corrupting Suchart?

411
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,360
Look Boss,

412
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
it's possible.

413
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,800
Your hypothesis

414
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,120
is interesting.

415
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,240
-Are you looking for someone?
-Hello.

416
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,520
We're looking for Chokchai.

417
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,040
I'm Chokchai. Do you need something?

418
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,680
It seems like you're living comfortably,

419
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,480
unlike your ex-business partner Suchart.

420
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,600
What did you just say?

421
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,520
Suchart?

422
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,400
We're here to tell you
some important news.

423
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,080
It must be really important.

424
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,200
Yes.

425
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,240
Hey! Capture them.

426
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,800
Hey!

427
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,360
-Why are you detaining us?
-What?!

428
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,000
The only ones who know
about my business with Suchart

429
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,160
are me, him, and that douche Heng!

430
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,800
-Who's Heng?!
-Who's that?

431
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,280
Heng corrupted me and Suchart!
Did he send you guys here?

432
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,480
What?

433
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,600
NONTHAPIMOLCHAI SHOP

434
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,240
Tell me the truth.

435
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,920
What does your boss want?

436
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,840
He's not our boss!

437
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,080
We know Suchart!

438
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,120
He jumped off the building
and became a ghost.

439
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,680
It's because your boss Heng,
made him jump off the building!

440
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,280
Don't you dare mention Suchart's name,

441
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,680
whom I respect, ever again!

442
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,440
But Suchart really needs help!

443
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,800
I said, don't mention his name!
Beat him up!

444
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,080
-But Suchart--
-Please stop!

445
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,640
I'm all numb.

446
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,000
They won't believe us.

447
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,200
I'll keep telling you the truth anyway!

448
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,160
Every day,

449
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,520
Suchart has to suffer
and jump off the building.

450
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,880
And he always feels sorry towards you.

451
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,160
Please…

452
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,680
please help Suchart!

453
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,480
We're ready to deal
with ghosts for your property.

454
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,080
Contact us, SixSense Agency.

455
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,920
I'm truly sorry for misunderstanding you.

456
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,960
But I'm still curious about Heng.

457
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,480
When Suchart and I
first opened the company,

458
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,400
Suchart trusted Heng's company
to take care of the accounts.

459
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,320
However, Heng took all the money,

460
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,880
putting our company in debt.

461
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,360
I thought

462
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,520
you were the one betraying Suchart,
leading him to commit suicide.

463
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,760
I was busy asking for a loan
from the banks to help the company.

464
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,360
While waiting for approval,

465
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,639
Suchart committed suicide.

466
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,080
Please come with us.

467
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,280
I believe Suchart also has something
he wants to say to you.

468
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,040
Anyone want to buy a lottery ticket?

469
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,239
You'll get rich!

470
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,000
Rich for sure!

471
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,639
-Anyone want a lottery ticket?
-Very rich!

472
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,639
You'll become rich tomorrow!

473
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,000
You can pick any numbers you like!

474
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,480
We have lots of lottery numbers,
18, 56, 90. Come on!

475
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,239
-Lottery!
-We don't sell at inflated prices!

476
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,520
The weather is hot, and we have to shout.

477
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,840
It's so tiring.

478
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,920
I'm also tired. I almost fainted.

479
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,280
We didn't even catch
a glimpse of Chaba's ghost.

480
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,920
Tip, Toop, Tom, what are you guys wearing?

481
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,960
We thought of luring Chaba's ghost out
with a lottery ticket.

482
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,880
You really gave it your all.

483
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,240
Good, at least
you guys made some investment.

484
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,760
Good job!

485
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,480
Who's that?

486
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,960
He's Suchart's friend
and business partner.

487
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,000
Su?

488
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,640
Chok.

489
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,160
Suchart's sitting here.

490
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,760
Really?

491
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
Yes.

492
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,280
Chok.

493
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,920
I'm sorry,

494
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,320
that my wrong decision

495
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,480
got you in trouble.

496
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,320
Suchart said that he's sorry

497
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,200
for getting you in trouble.

498
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,720
I should be the one to apologize.

499
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Su.

500
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,880
Do you know

501
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,000
that one day after you committed suicide,

502
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,760
the bank approved the loan?

503
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,200
What did you say?

504
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,920
If you had kept fighting
with me for just one more day,

505
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,160
you would have seen our success.

506
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,920
I'm happy for you,

507
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,600
and I'm sorry

508
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,080
for leaving you.

509
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,560
I never blamed you.

510
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,960
Because I know how much you suffered.

511
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,800
Everything has passed,

512
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,880
you don't need to feel sorry for anything.

513
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,920
Today, I have made
our dream of business come true.

514
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,320
You don't need to worry about anything.

515
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
I truly want to thank you guys

516
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,240
for helping me apologize to Chokchai.

517
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,000
What are you going to do from now on?

518
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,480
As a ghost who committed suicide like me,
even though I have no worries left,

519
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,680
I still have to repay my sins.

520
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,960
But in the time I have left,

521
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,040
I'll jump without feeling bad like before.

522
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,400
Let's refocus on Chaba, shall we?

523
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,920
Tip, could you try asking him

524
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,800
if he knows anything more about Chaba?

525
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,400
Right.

526
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,960
So that we can
sell the building soon and get the money.

527
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,680
I remember something.

528
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,200
Every time I bought food
from her restaurant,

529
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,080
she always listened to Thai folk songs.

530
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,960
I think Thai folk songs

531
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,680
might help you to meet with Chaba.

532
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,880
I'm sorry I couldn't help with work today.

533
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,560
It's fine. You got to help Suchart,
so I'm okay with that.

534
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,160
-How?
-Well…

535
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,320
As an employee,
I might think you are slacking off.

536
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,720
But as a human being,

537
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,280
I think that you're generous
for helping others.

538
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,760
It might be because I know well,
how failure feels.

539
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,320
Maybe not every problem has a solution.

540
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,720
But if you try your best to solve it,

541
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,640
at least you won't regret

542
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,400
doing your best.

543
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,840
I know you can do it.

544
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,760
Tomorrow, I'll try to call and negotiate
my debt with the bank one more time.

545
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,000
Keep going! I'm here for you.

546
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,440
Thank you.

547
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,040
Lt. Tip, no need to worry.

548
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,160
Professional thieves like us won't fail.

549
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,320
Right.

550
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,240
Are you alright?

551
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,160
Tip?

552
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,840
I'm fine.

553
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,400
I think…

554
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,480
I used too much energy
communicating with Suchart.

555
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,240
I must be tired.

556
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,640
What are you doing?!

557
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,360
‪NEXT EPISODE

558
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,160
What are you stealing from me?!

559
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,360
Tom!

560
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,360
Don't mess with my millions of baht!

561
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,360
Hey, what did you do
to make Aunt Chaba so angry?

562
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,640
Back there, I saw a shelf
with lottery tickets scattered around it.

563
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,320
Maybe she won the lottery?

564
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,440
If it's millions, that means…

565
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,080
-She won the jackpot!
-She won the jackpot!
