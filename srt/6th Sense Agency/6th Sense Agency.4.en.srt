1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,880
This is the place they'd called us about.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,520
An orphanage that closed down long ago.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,760
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,560
So it's not a real estate company,

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,480
but a ghost exorcism company?

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,120
Sis?

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,520
Whatever you do,

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,240
can you please try not to
embarrass your two sisters?

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,600
Huh?

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,080
Don't look down on yourself
because of others.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,200
The orphanage manager is calling me.

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,280
He will only give us a week.

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,160
If we can't make it on time,
he'll find someone else.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,560
You're the one who won't stop.
You deserve it.

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,160
What kind of kid are you?

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,440
Didn't your mom teach you anything?

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,840
I don't have a mother, so what?

18
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,640
I'm sorry for what I said earlier.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,560
If my mom loved me,
she wouldn't have left me.

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,240
I just want to find my mom.

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,400
I want to meet my mom again.

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,000
Well,

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,880
we'll find your mom.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,680
Guys,

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,920
have you seen a woman
with long hair around here?

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,720
-There are plenty of women like that.
-True.

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,560
Well…

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,760
he's got a point.
Even you've got long hair.

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,040
But there is this one woman

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,720
who I clearly remember.

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,040
Who? Where?

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,040
Or should I say, one body?

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,960
‪Huh?

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,640
A body?

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,800
Over there.

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,120
She got hit by a car and died on the spot.

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,160
Listen, Toop-Hom,
I think we should go and see Tip.

38
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,040
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,640
Boss, where are you?

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,560
LIVE HERE, GET MERRIER

41
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,320
Found it!

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
Excuse me.

43
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,720
You can see me?

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,760
Yes.

45
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
Well…

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Are you Ball's mother?

47
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,440
I abandoned my son at the orphanage.

48
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,120
She's here?

49
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,760
I got goosebumps.

50
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,160
Can you keep quiet?
I'm trying to listen to her.

51
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,680
I was pregnant when I was in high school.

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,720
Ball's father left me.

53
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,920
I tried my best to raise him for years,

54
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,240
but couldn't in the end.

55
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,320
Because I thought if I kept raising him,

56
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,880
we'd both end up starving to death.

57
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,200
WELCOME

58
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,280
So I decided
to leave Ball at the orphanage.

59
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,960
Thinking I'll bring him home
when I have money.

60
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,160
I worked extremely hard.

61
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,960
And luckily, life was getting better.

62
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,640
So I intended to get my son back.

63
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,560
But in the end,
I died before I had a chance to.

64
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,840
Ball's so pitiful.

65
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,720
Don't cry Puppy. Don't cry.

66
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,960
It's okay.

67
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,200
How's Ball doing?

68
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,160
Your son has passed away.

69
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,960
My poor boy…

70
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,800
So unfortunate.

71
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,760
How much does he hate me?

72
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
You should ask him yourself.

73
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,240
I can't leave this place.

74
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,880
Then why is your soul stuck here?

75
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,760
Why didn't your soul go to your son
when you passed away?

76
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,440
Maybe because when I was about to die,

77
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,600
all I could think about was the gold
that fell into the sewer.

78
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,480
Because I didn't want anyone

79
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,440
to get their hands on my son's gold.

80
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,040
Please,

81
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,160
bring me back to my son.

82
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,600
Guys.

83
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,280
I have a request.

84
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,560
Got it!

85
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
-Got it?
-Yeah.

86
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,120
Be careful!

87
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,000
-Got it!
-Slowly.

88
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,160
Yay!

89
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,800
Finally!

90
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,080
Finally!

91
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,360
Open it.

92
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,080
-Is there really gold inside?
-Finally.

93
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,160
Open it.

94
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,120
Good job guys!

95
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,080
Great!

96
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,920
Look, Mali's smiling from ear to ear.

97
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,680
What's wrong?

98
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,240
Chang, Boss.

99
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,600
Do you see what I see?

100
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,360
We do.

101
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,600
How can we see the ghost?

102
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,640
Wait, what's wrong with you guys?

103
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,400
-Stop!
-Don't!

104
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,880
Don't get any closer!

105
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,120
Don't tell me…
All three of you can see the ghost?

106
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,360
Super clear.

107
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,120
I don't know.

108
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,560
Let's just get this issue resolved first,

109
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,040
then we can figure out the reason later.

110
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,840
Do we still need the lantern?

111
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,520
Not this time.

112
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,160
We just need to bring
the item she's clinging to.

113
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,440
So we can take her with us.

114
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,280
Ball.

115
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,360
Ball, it's Mommy.

116
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,640
Mommy, is that really you?

117
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,400
Why?

118
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,240
Why didn't you come to me?

119
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,960
Do you know how much I missed you?

120
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,200
I'm…

121
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,560
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

122
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,760
-I'm a bad mother.
-That's enough, Mommy.

123
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,440
It's fine.

124
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,360
That day…

125
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,840
You were coming to me.
Why didn't you come inside to pick me up?

126
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,520
Why are you sulking here alone?

127
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,080
You miss your mom?

128
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,520
Why would I? I hate my mom,

129
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,160
and I don't want to see her.

130
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,800
She's heartless to leave me here.

131
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,760
Why would I want to meet her?

132
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,280
Please don't hate your mom.
She must have her own reasons.

133
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,520
I heard you say that you hate me…

134
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,160
I was too ashamed to face you.

135
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,880
I thought I was too worthless

136
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,600
to take care of you.

137
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,200
I was too ashamed to face you.

138
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,320
Mommy… I'm sorry.

139
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,640
I didn't think before I spoke.

140
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,960
I still love you.

141
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,120
Mommy…

142
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,080
Hey!

143
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,520
Thank you so much…

144
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,960
for helping us
clear up the misunderstanding.

145
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,160
Please keep the gold.

146
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,000
We're going to make merit
by offering gold at the temple.

147
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
Hey.

148
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,640
Ready for reincarnation?

149
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,360
Can I make one more request?

150
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,560
Loving family, but somehow creepy.

151
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,840
He's my dad.

152
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,360
If you see a man who looks like this

153
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,720
around me,

154
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,760
please tell me.

155
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,000
Your dad must have no worries,
so he isn't around.

156
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,240
I want to be able to see my dad.

157
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,680
FAMILY REUNION
SUNDAY, JUNE 23 - 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM.

158
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,440
Hey.

159
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,720
What's wrong?

160
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,320
It's my family reunion notification.

161
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,160
Are you going?

162
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,080
I don't know.

163
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,400
I don't know what to think anymore.

164
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,280
Look over there.

165
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,640
We have limited time.

166
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,360
When you can't make a decision,

167
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,240
try thinking

168
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,680
as if today were your last day.

169
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,720
What would you do

170
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,400
to make sure you have no regrets?

171
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,280
We're ready.

172
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,720
Thank you so much.

173
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,760
Goodbye.

174
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,120
Goodbye.

175
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,240
SIGNATURE OF BUYER

176
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,760
Now,

177
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,840
how come we can see ghosts?

178
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,760
Oh, I already asked Muai about this.

179
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,240
She said,

180
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,359
maybe it's because
I send you guys a signal.

181
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,200
Like… a wifi signal?

182
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,160
Maybe.

183
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,079
That means…

184
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,480
Will we see ghosts all the time
from now on?

185
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,200
No way, I'm scared!

186
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,839
I'm scared!

187
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,920
Tip.

188
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,520
WANTA ORPHANAGE

189
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,800
-I'll help.
-Okay Golf.

190
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,040
Thank you.

191
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,040
Who's Golf?

192
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,200
Are you alright?

193
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah.

194
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,840
I'm fine.

195
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,800
Alright then, I think I should go home.

196
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,120
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

197
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,040
Where did you keep the stuff?

198
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,720
What stuff? I don't know. Who are you?!

199
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,440
Stop bullshitting!

200
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,480
Police, help!

201
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,160
Where are you going?!

202
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,600
MEMORY LOSS

203
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,160
GOLF

204
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,880
Tip, It's me. I'm going in.

205
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,360
Is everything alright?

206
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, Uncle Boon called this morning.

207
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,400
He said someone asked for you
in Chiang Rai.

208
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,720
Be cautious when you're out and about.

209
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,520
And… is your coworker trustworthy?

210
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,560
Let him know just in case,
so someone can keep an eye on you.

211
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
I will. Thank you.

212
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,720
Hey.

213
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,200
I brought you some food

214
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,160
from the family reunion.

215
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,440
Thanks.

216
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,320
How was your day?

217
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,480
It was… so-so.

218
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
My sister teased me a little.

219
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,640
But I told them that

220
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,600
I will take our Sixth Sense Agency

221
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,480
into the stock market.

222
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,080
What about you?

223
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,960
Are you alright?

224
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,680
Why the long face?

225
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,880
I have to tell you something.

226
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,600
I… lost my memory.

227
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,280
The reason I'm doing this job
is that every time I save a ghost,

228
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,040
I recall a little bit of my memory.

229
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,800
A name pops into my mind. It's Golf.

230
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,840
There are millions of Golfs.
How can I know which is the right one?

231
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,240
How can I help you Tip?

232
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,440
DREAM CATCHER

233
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,400
Hello, this is Six Sense Agency.

234
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,160
How can we assist you?

235
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,800
Apart from the weird things that happened,

236
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,640
did anyone stalk you today?

237
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,240
Except for the one sitting next to me,

238
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,000
there isn't anyone else.

239
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,640
I think…

240
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,560
your dreams sound more complex lately.

241
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,400
The running away,

242
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,800
getting hit by a car, and being shot.

243
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,600
They're all so complex.

244
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,600
But if you've already told Ong,

245
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,080
then I'm relieved.

246
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,120
Although he seems a bit confused,

247
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,880
he seems like a good person.

248
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,520
Let's discuss Kai.

249
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,120
How?

250
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,280
Look,

251
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,040
this is the map

252
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,320
from the house where we stole the safe.

253
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,000
For what?

254
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,280
So we can figure out

255
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,880
where Kai hid the safe.

256
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,680
We need to go back to the day

257
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,480
we stole the safe from this location.

258
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,400
JUNGLE - HOUSE - GAS STATION

259
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,720
Let's go, be careful.

260
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,560
The day we stole the safe from that house

261
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,080
as Lt. Tip hired us.

262
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,600
What's this?

263
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,080
A safe inside the safe?

264
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Huh?!

265
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,480
What's happening?

266
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
This is bad Chang! What should we do?

267
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,000
Just take the whole safe.

268
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
After that,

269
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,320
we took the safe out of the house
to the meeting point with Tip.

270
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,200
We got the safe, but Kai convinced us

271
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,040
not to hand it over to Tip.

272
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,760
What? What did you just say?

273
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,000
We're not handing this safe to the police?

274
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,440
Right.

275
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,000
I've looked into it,
and I know the owner of that house

276
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,320
and what's inside this safe.

277
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,720
Who?

278
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,040
The owner of that house

279
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,920
owned a large set
of Benjaphakee Buddha amulets

280
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,160
that were secretly being traded
on the black market.

281
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,120
The going rate
is currently one hundred million.

282
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,680
One hundred million?

283
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,120
But wait…

284
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,080
Lt. Tip worked really hard
to come up with the plan

285
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,440
to hire thieves like us
to catch the thief.

286
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,320
But if we don't hand the safe over to her,

287
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,360
will she come after us?

288
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,520
Right…

289
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,000
But if we don't give it to them,

290
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,360
we can get rich
without having to do any dirty work.

291
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,800
-You're right.
-Right.

292
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,040
A hundred million…

293
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,520
This is bad! What should we do?

294
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
How should we escape?

295
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,240
Split up and meet at the temple.

296
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,840
Chang… go.

297
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,400
Let's go!

298
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,320
Where's the safe?

299
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,640
We don't know!

300
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,360
Where's the safe?!

301
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,080
It's with Kai.

302
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,840
Let go of me Lt. Tip. It hurts!

303
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Don't be so brutal!

304
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,000
In the end,

305
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,640
Kai didn't make it to the temple.

306
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,160
JUNGLE - HOUSE - GAS STATION

307
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,640
From what I heard,
Kai died on his way to the temple,

308
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,520
but no one saw the safe.

309
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,840
It's possible that he hid the safe
before he died.

310
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,680
But Chiang Rai is 100 km wide.

311
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,840
How are we supposed to find the safe?

312
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,560
I know, I'm thinking.
Where could he hide the safe?

313
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,560
I think the best way

314
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,040
is for Tip to contact Kai's ghost.

315
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,160
-What ghost?
-Whoa!

316
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,160
Nothing.

317
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,080
We were just drawing to pass the time.

318
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,040
-Right.
-Yeah.

319
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,720
-Chang.
-Yes.

320
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,240
Why don't you look for a job

321
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,720
instead of drawing?

322
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,040
Yes.

323
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,600
It's fun.

324
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,240
Yeah.

325
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,840
Guys.

326
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,040
Let's prepare for a trip out of town.

327
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,880
Like a vacation?

328
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,680
That would be great!

329
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,200
We worked so hard.
We deserve some time to rest.

330
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,160
No.

331
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
It's not a vacation.

332
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,600
We're going to work.
Our next job is out of town.

333
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,040
Work?

334
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,080
Fine.

335
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,280
Right now, we're at an abandoned resort

336
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,960
that many say is haunted
by an evil spirit.

337
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,640
The atmosphere feels desolate,

338
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,320
and there are many huge trees.

339
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,760
Come follow me inside.

340
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,120
Everyone, do you hear
the mouth organ sound like I do?

341
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,560
How long have you guys been here?

342
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,440
Well, this ghost is…

343
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,760
tall, long, fair-skinned, and looks good.

344
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,240
He's cute.

345
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,840
You're wrong Toop-Hom.

346
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,240
The evil ghost,

347
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,000
is a ghost
of a recently deceased security guard.

348
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,280
He's very malevolent.

349
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,680
Anyone visiting this hotel
must be careful.

350
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,480
May all souls rest in peace.

351
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,760
Tip!

352
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,520
Tip…

353
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,880
This means the ghost we're about to meet

354
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,800
is the ghost of a deceased security guard?

355
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,040
Well then, we should hurry,
or we'll arrive there late at night.

356
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,160
Let's go.

357
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,880
The late owner tricked me

358
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,760
by selling the resort at a low price.
I thought I was lucky,

359
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,640
but there's a ghost here.

360
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,960
What should I do then?
If I open for business, no one shows up.

361
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,840
It's because of the YouTube video
about the evil security guard ghost.

362
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,720
I'll give you a 4% commission
if you can sell this place.

363
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,160
Sure. Then I'll…

364
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,280
Wait, since the ghost is very evil,

365
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,240
I don't think it's worth it.
We should leave.

366
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,640
What's wrong with you guys?

367
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,880
It's too big here.

368
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,320
It will take us ages to find a ghost.

369
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,240
It's not worth it, right Tip?

370
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,800
Right?

371
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,480
Right.

372
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Okay, fine.

373
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,000
I'll increase the commission to 5%.

374
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,200
Now this is worth our time.

375
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,600
-Hey.
-Yes?

376
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,720
Do you see the security guard's ghost
the YouTuber mentioned?

377
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,520
I can't sense any ghosts,

378
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,720
but I can sense
there's something wrong here.

379
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,800
Should we look inside that room?

380
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Yeah.

381
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,400
Wait, Toop-Hom.

382
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,720
I have a plan.

383
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,680
What plan?

384
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,760
I'm going to get Tip drunk

385
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,240
so we can ask her about Kai.

386
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,600
Why would she let us get her drunk?

387
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,480
It's impossible Chang.

388
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,360
There's nothing impossible for Chang.

389
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,760
Hey!

390
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,840
What are you talking about?
Why didn't you follow us inside?

391
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,360
There's nothing Tip.
We were just talking about

392
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,360
how we rarely go out of town.

393
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,480
I think we should

394
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,400
celebrate a bit at least.

395
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,320
Right!

396
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,600
We're here for work, not for vacation.

397
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,320
I agree.

398
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,240
I think we should focus on work.
We can discuss celebrating later.

399
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,480
Yes, Boss.

400
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,920
Hurry up, let's go.

401
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,240
Stop.

402
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,000
Did you hear something?

403
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,840
Laughter.

404
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,960
Where's it coming from?

405
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,880
That means the ghost is around here.

406
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,760
Guys.

407
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,400
Come closer to me.

408
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,160
So you'll be able
to see the ghost like last time.

409
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,240
Tip.

410
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,280
You don't need to send us a signal.
We don't want to see any ghosts.

411
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,720
Do you think I want to see a ghost?
We have a job to finish.

412
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,000
You're right. Guys…

413
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,040
Let's do it.

414
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,640
Maybe,

415
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,920
the signal is weak.

416
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,840
Should we try the traditional way?

417
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
Phut.

418
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,280
Tho.

419
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,320
Tha.

420
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,080
-Ya.
-Phut.

421
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,560
-Tho.
-Tha.

422
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,160
-Ya.
-Phut.

423
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,560
-Tho.
-Tha.

424
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,040
Ya.

425
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,520
May the spirit living in this place,

426
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,880
if you're here,

427
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,840
go to the word "yes."

428
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,480
PLACE OF RESIDENCE

429
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,280
Wait.

430
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,000
YES

431
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,440
Yes. Are you the security guard's ghost?

432
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,920
NO

433
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,120
No.

434
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,840
Mouth organ sounds.

435
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,920
Just like in the video.

436
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,360
We're the only ones here.

437
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,400
There's no one else.

438
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,400
Where did the sound come from?

439
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,640
Maybe it came
from the other resort nearby.

440
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,120
I think we should leave.
What do you say Boss?

441
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,080
Who's that?!

442
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,240
Are you… the security guard?

443
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,680
It's not.

444
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,600
I can't sense any ghosts.

445
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
The scent of incense.

446
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,360
I'm scared!

447
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,560
I'm scared!

448
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,120
Wait for me Toop-Hom!

449
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,920
What should we do?

450
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,480
We'll see what we can do tomorrow.

451
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,320
Tip!

452
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,360
Hey.

453
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,400
Still up?

454
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,840
I'm here to…

455
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,520
Not surprising,
they grew up in the temple.

456
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,360
They pay respect
to the guardian spirit before bed.

457
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,680
Good, so they won't be scared.

458
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,240
Right…

459
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,920
I ordered it online.
It just arrived this morning.

460
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,200
They say it will help catch bad dreams.

461
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,360
Here.

462
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,800
Thanks.

463
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,280
Hope you have a good dream tonight.

464
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,080
57,

465
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
58…

466
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,760
Hey.

467
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,080
59…

468
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,960
Do you have enough free time
to count mosquitoes?

469
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,480
Why don't you help me come up

470
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,960
with a way to remind Tip about Kai?

471
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,080
Chang, should we…

472
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,240
just ask her directly?

473
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,440
Are you mad?

474
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,600
If she remembers that we're with Kai,
we'll be put in jail.

475
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,240
Then what should we do?

476
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,720
The security guard ghost!

477
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,960
Everyone in this area

478
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,400
has already seen him! His name is Yod.

479
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,960
I heard he died from electrocution
while trying to help others.

480
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,000
Trying to help others?

481
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,720
Could you please tell us about him?

482
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,280
Like, who he was close with,
or what kind of person he was.

483
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,880
He was a good person.

484
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,240
Hardworking
and took good care of the guests.

485
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,920
He always helped others.

486
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,600
It's strange that after he passed away,

487
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,920
he turned out to be an evil ghost.

488
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,320
It's really weird.

489
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,600
I got goosebumps.

490
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,520
I saw the hammock moving on its own.

491
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,880
What are you talking about?

492
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,880
Comments on
the security guard ghost video.

493
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,800
Look.

494
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,000
Chang…

495
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,840
It's really moving on its own…

496
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,840
What are you doing?

497
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,520
The organ sound
just popped up out of nowhere.

498
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,040
And the hammock…

499
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,320
it's moving on its own.

500
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,040
Be careful.

501
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,000
It's a chopper.

502
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,240
A pack of incense.

503
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,320
Dry ice.

504
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,480
A log?

505
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,680
I'm leaving!

506
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,560
Wait for me Toop-Hom!

507
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,240
Who's there?!

508
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,480
A ghost can't run this fast.

509
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,600
Hey. Wait!

510
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,520
Tip!

511
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,800
-Let's go Chang!
-Let's go!

512
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,480
What?

513
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,160
Where's Tip?

514
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,760
I knew it wasn't a ghost.

515
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,800
Stop!

516
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,880
Hey!

517
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Tall, long, fair skin, and looks good.

518
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,000
You seem familiar.

519
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,920
You're…

520
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,400
that famous YouTuber!

521
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,080
I'm Tom, a ghost channel YouTuber.

522
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,600
Have you really seen Yod?

523
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,920
Yod…

524
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,080
NEXT EPISODE

525
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,320
Wait, don't go yet!

526
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,680
We're realtors.

527
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,320
We want to sell this property.

528
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,440
So, you work for that scumbag Bird

529
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,880
who only cares about his own benefit.

530
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,480
Run away now!

531
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,360
Tip!
