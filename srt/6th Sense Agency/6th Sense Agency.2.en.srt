1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,840
Are you with them?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,040
You can talk to ghosts?

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,480
Can you do me a favor?

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,040
Please?

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,000
He didn't let you sell the house
because he was afraid

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,520
he wouldn't get
to go back to his wife and kids.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,400
Without you,
I'd still be trying to sell it in vain.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,240
And I came here today

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,600
because I want to start
a business with you.

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,240
A real estate agency
selling only haunted houses.

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,480
That's the woman I told you about.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,840
-Lt. Tip!
-Lt. Tip!

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,800
Yes. Tip.

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,680
Yesterday, after I helped
the man talk to the ghost,

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,200
suddenly I could remember my name.

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,760
I accept. I'll work with you.

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,040
‪PREVIOUSLY

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,160
You're making a big move.
Your company can't just have two people.

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,840
Finally,
we've officially got ourselves a company.

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,280
WATTANA APARTMENT

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,440
I'm already dead.

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,200
Do you want me to die
of a broken heart again?

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,680
Fine. I'm taking you with me to death.

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,800
Dad, don't!

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,360
I'm dreaming of Dad again?

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,760
THE CRAPPINESS IN YOURSELF

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,160
I'm sorry Dad.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,520
I'll surely get the apartment back.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,280
This is Teng, my dad.

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,080
WATTANA APARTMENT

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,960
Smile, kids.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,640
And this is my eldest sister, Hong.

33
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,440
And Yok, the middle child.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
My sisters

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,800
have set the bar so high, that
I'm considered slow in both school life

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
and work life.

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,240
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,120
As for me, I can't even
pull off running an omelet restaurant.

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,080
Cameraman, gardener, barber, magician,

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,920
I've done it all. But not just yet,

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,320
I haven't got to the crappy part
about me yet.

42
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,280
Yes, I'm an ungrateful child.

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,240
I mortgaged the apartment my dad bought
for tens of millions, for an investment.

44
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,280
NOTICE OF SEIZURE

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,960
Becoming a realtor and
selling haunted homes is my only hope

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,240
to earn enough money
to repurchase my dad's apartment

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,640
before the bank puts it up for auction

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,640
and I'll never get
a chance to pay for my sin again.

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,520
How is Teacher Kanti doing?

50
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,360
He passed away yesterday.

51
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,880
Clean tomorrow immediately,

52
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,360
so we can find a new tenant.

53
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,720
But it's scary!

54
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,160
I'm scared!

55
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,400
Boss…

56
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,120
Thank you so much.

57
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,080
You're welcome.
If you need anything, feel free to call.

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,400
Thank you.

59
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,200
I've hired new movers countless times!

60
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,160
For crying out loud!

61
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,880
Is it that hard to find a cleaning lady?

62
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Fine, I'll just find someone myself.

63
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,840
What's the matter? Why the long face?

64
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,040
Teacher Kanti,
who was renting a house from me,

65
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,080
he died of a heart attack at home.

66
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,760
So I've been looking for a cleaner,
but they all ran.

67
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,120
They said his ghost wouldn't let them.

68
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,720
Who is Teacher Kanti?

69
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,560
KANTI PHUAMPHAI HONORARY TEACHER

70
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,160
-Teacher Kanti was an ethics teacher,
-Hello students.

71
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,280
one with the heart of a teacher.

72
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,600
He loved his students so much
that he swore to stay single and unmarried

73
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,000
so he could dedicate
all his time to his students.

74
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,960
Lately, he had been working so hard

75
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,560
that he had a heart attack.

76
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,000
But it seems like
his ghost won't leave the place.

77
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,200
But… you can see ghosts, right?

78
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,080
Would you talk to him for me?

79
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,280
Sure.

80
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,200
I'm hurt hearing
people ask for favors this way.

81
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,640
For this kind of job,

82
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,400
it should cost
at least hundreds of thousands.

83
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,160
Hey! I owe her a lot.

84
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,360
A little favor shouldn't hurt, huh?

85
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,760
Well, since it's you,
I won't charge you then.

86
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,400
But can we get a discount on our rent

87
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,040
of 50 percent for six months?

88
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
Think of it as our special promotion.

89
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,800
That sounds pretty good.

90
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,120
Six months is a little too much.

91
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,000
Then five.

92
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,440
Four.

93
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,280
Well, three then.

94
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,280
We're pretty close after all.

95
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,720
She already said four.
Why the heck are you going for less?

96
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,000
Four months it is.

97
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,720
She's not very good at math.

98
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,840
Fine. I accept.

99
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,200
Just take care of it for me would you?

100
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,680
But I've already lost the spare key.

101
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,680
Don't worry. That's no big deal.

102
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,200
Showing your professionalism!

103
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,840
Congrats on partnering with a thief.

104
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,840
It won't budge.

105
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,159
Maybe we have to ask
the teacher for permission first?

106
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,800
Teacher Kanti,

107
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,200
Muai…

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,920
she asked us to clean the room,

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,560
so she could lease it again.

110
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
You have no right to tell me to leave.

111
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,560
Is he… here already?

112
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm sorry,

113
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,640
but she's really in trouble.

114
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,080
If you would please move out.

115
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,880
I have the right to stay here.

116
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,040
He says he has the right to stay here

117
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,920
because he paid
two months' rent in advance.

118
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,480
Then… we come back in two months.

119
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,840
Goodbye.

120
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,120
Let's go. Come on.

121
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,080
Teacher!

122
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,440
Teacher Kanti…

123
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,160
Teacher!

124
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,560
Teacher…

125
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,280
What's going on?
Is he not talking to you anymore?

126
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,400
Yeah. Suddenly he disappeared.

127
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,200
I don't think we'll get anywhere today.

128
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,320
Let's leave.

129
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,680
Teacher,

130
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,800
if you have something bothering you,

131
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,240
troubling you, or discomforting you,

132
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,080
we can help.

133
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,600
Can you two really help?

134
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,320
Yes, Teacher.

135
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,040
How can we help you?

136
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,640
Then, would you take me to the school?

137
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,480
School?

138
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,240
MR. KANTI MISSION

139
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,480
He wants us to take him to the school.

140
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,920
He wants to finish writing
report cards for the tenth-grade students.

141
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,160
And he must go there by himself.

142
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,440
He's thinking about work even in death.
What a dedicated teacher.

143
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,360
But the problem is that…

144
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,600
ghosts can't leave their area.

145
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Yeah.

146
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,440
So what should we do then?

147
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,880
Whatever someone deeply cares about
during their last breath,

148
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,320
whether it is someone, something,

149
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,320
or somewhere,

150
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,880
their ghost will be
tethered to that thing.

151
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,960
I know how to drive
ghosts away from their area.

152
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,560
Once, when I was an altar boy,

153
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,800
I saw undertakers perform rituals

154
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,440
to drive ghosts to other places

155
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,600
by lighting this lantern.

156
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,520
Lighting a lantern,

157
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,680
burning incense,
and reciting incantations.

158
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,120
The one performing the ritual
must be someone who can talk to ghosts.

159
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,440
The lantern will then become the light

160
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,720
guiding the ghosts to follow us.

161
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,760
But there is one condition
to be met during the ritual.

162
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,000
Do not let the lantern go out.

163
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,480
I ask you to guide this spirit
to leave this place,

164
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,200
using this lantern as a guiding light.

165
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,400
Teacher! He's here!

166
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
Please get in the car.

167
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
He's walking here.

168
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,360
He's about to step outside the house area.

169
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,960
He's stepped outside!
Toop-Hom, get the door!

170
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,640
-The door!
-Teacher, please get in.

171
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,400
‪He's gone!

172
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,160
He's gone back inside the house.

173
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,680
Teacher, please get in the car.

174
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,800
He's getting in.

175
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,040
Teacher!

176
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,840
Excuse me, what are you doing?

177
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,400
Don't ask. Just go on and drive!

178
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,560
I'll turn on the AC.

179
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,840
Wait!

180
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I guarantee this time it won't go out.

181
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,160
Yeah, bravo.

182
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,240
Why didn't you bring that
in the first place?

183
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,360
At least he learned.
Just forget it and do the job.

184
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,920
IN MEMORY OF TEACHER KANTI PHUAMPHAI

185
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,000
If I could turn back time,
I would be good to you.

186
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,480
We are proud to be your students.

187
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,280
I want you to know,
you made me want to study.

188
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,080
He's helped me so much,

189
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,400
with studying and also
giving me advice on personal issues.

190
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,600
I regret never having thanked you.

191
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
I don't want you to die!

192
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,880
Who will teach me
now that you're not here?

193
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,360
I regret it too,

194
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,280
not getting to finish teaching you,

195
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,920
not getting to see all of you growing up.

196
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,040
We should leave now.

197
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,720
What are you doing here?!

198
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,319
Oh, we are just touring the school

199
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,599
for our child.

200
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,880
Alright.

201
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,680
But don't bring
lanterns here. It's dangerous.

202
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
-Oh, right.
-Oh.

203
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,720
Okay.

204
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,040
Wait, sir!

205
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,000
Sir, sir!

206
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,960
-Don't!
-Don't!

207
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,080
Let's leave it at that.

208
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm tired.

209
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,320
We'll try again tomorrow.

210
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,240
FELL OFF MOUNTAIN - BOON - HUNTED -
SEE GHOSTS - MEMORY LOSS - TIP

211
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Who are you thinking of?

212
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,120
Don't even know if he's resting in peace.

213
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,680
Man, I don't know.

214
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,000
Then should we take this photo to Lt. Tip?

215
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,600
So she can help us find Kai's ghost.

216
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,240
Then we can wrap this up quickly.

217
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,400
So we can leave this place.

218
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,920
You're being rash.

219
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,120
What if she sees Kai
and remembers us both?

220
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,640
But how can we be sure
she won't remember us even before that?

221
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,680
That's the hard part.

222
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,080
We have to stay
long enough for her to find Kai,

223
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,000
but not so long
that she remembers us both.

224
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,080
What's with all this chatter?
It's dark. Come on!

225
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,440
Yes, yes. Coming.

226
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,080
Yes, hello?

227
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,480
Hello.

228
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,160
Teacher Kittipan speaking.

229
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,000
I forgot to unplug and

230
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
turn off the lights
in the grade students' computer room.

231
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,680
-Alright.
-Can you check for me?

232
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,600
-Alright. Of course Teacher.
-Thank you.

233
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,240
He's gone. Chang, how clever!

234
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,680
Like the ex-felon you are.

235
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,880
How clever brother.

236
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,960
How did you know
the security's name and number?

237
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,680
Just Google of course.
Go to the school's page. That's it!

238
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,400
Boss, with sketchy things like this,
you can trust Chang!

239
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,000
Way to go Chang!

240
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,240
So sketchy!

241
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,400
-Super sketchy!
-True!

242
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,600
WAT TAN SCHOOL

243
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,000
You two, please be on the lookout.

244
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,240
-Sure Boss.
-Roger Boss.

245
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,040
The report cards
I need to write are over there.

246
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,040
You have to write all these reports.

247
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,240
Pakin, a cheerful, friendly kid.

248
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,480
But sometimes you talk too much.

249
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,040
I want you to think and act
more than you speak.

250
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,600
Kawee, you are a bright student.

251
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,440
But I also want you to go play
and spend time with your friends.

252
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,920
Because if you don't do it
while you still can,

253
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,440
you will regret
all the time that has passed.

254
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,520
Pete Pisitset,

255
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,640
as for you, I would scold you a lot

256
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,960
because I want you to be
a good member of society in the future.

257
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,200
They're all done.

258
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,960
You can rest in peace now.

259
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,000
Thank you.

260
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,560
Now I have nothing left to worry about.
I'm ready to go.

261
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,360
Right.

262
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Now a glowing door
will appear to pick you up.

263
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,960
I'm not seeing anything.

264
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,960
But when a ghost is worry-free
and ready to go,

265
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,880
there will appear a glowing door.

266
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,160
Is he not gone yet?

267
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,520
No.

268
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,120
Maybe he's still worried?

269
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,160
Teacher,

270
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,120
do you have any other worries?

271
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,000
No.

272
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,880
I only worry about my students.

273
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,000
I don't have a wife or kids either.
What would I worry about?

274
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,960
Try thinking harder,

275
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,760
have you done
anything that's left unfinished?

276
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,560
-Oh!
-Hm?

277
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,920
You told me ghosts are tied to the
area they're worried about,

278
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,120
and his ghost is tethered to his home.

279
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,960
So could it be that the thing
he's worried about… is at home?

280
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,040
Take me back home now!

281
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,880
How can I help you? Feel free to tell me.

282
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,160
I'd better tell that young man to do it.

283
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,480
He's no good. You should tell me.

284
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,280
I can't. It has to be that guy.

285
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,360
Hey you.

286
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
He wants you to do it.

287
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,440
-Me?
-Yeah.

288
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,600
-Why though?
-I don't know.

289
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,360
Tell your friend to go stand over there.

290
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,560
We both have to go stand over there.

291
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Why?

292
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,840
I don't know either.

293
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,960
Let's go.

294
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Just tell him what to do.
Listen and do exactly

295
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,520
as you're told, okay?

296
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,320
Open the folder titled Lesson Plans.

297
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,320
Go to the special subject.

298
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,280
Special subject.

299
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,360
Delete the folder of every teacher.

300
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,120
Open the folder of every teacher.

301
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,400
Wait, wait!

302
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,960
I said delete, not open!

303
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,320
Delete?!

304
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,440
Holy!

305
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Oh my!

306
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,040
Close it!

307
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,600
I… I confiscated these from the students.

308
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,800
So I watched them to see what kids
are into, so I can stay on-trend.

309
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,800
He said he confiscated these from students
to see what they're into these days.

310
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,000
Teacher Kanti doesn't want
anyone to remember him this way,

311
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,040
or to let down those who respect him.

312
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,760
Actually, it's a natural thing.

313
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,600
He's only human.

314
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,400
Plus, he kept it somewhere hidden,
not troubling anyone.

315
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,120
For real though,

316
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,320
don't dump these.

317
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,280
Chang!

318
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Dirty man! And you grew up
in a temple no less.

319
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,040
That's not what I meant!
I meant if we sell them,

320
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,240
we'll get good money.

321
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,720
You can't!

322
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,040
Burn them all, for real. Do it.

323
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,040
-What a shame though.
-Don't!

324
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,920
So that was it then, huh?

325
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,960
There really wasn't much
to think or stress about.

326
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Thank you all for not judging me.

327
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,680
This time,

328
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,240
I should be free of worry for sure.

329
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,320
Also, one more thing.

330
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,880
Muai asked me to ask you this.

331
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,480
What number will win the next lottery?

332
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,280
Teacher Kanti wanted to apologize
for causing you trouble.

333
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,360
As for the lottery number
you'd asked about,

334
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,680
he told me that when you stop scamming
your tenants by faking electric bills,

335
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,200
then you'll win the lotto.

336
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,920
I'm not scamming!

337
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,640
Just adding a little extra.
It's only natural!

338
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,560
Anyway, you can send cleaners
in there tomorrow. He's leaving soon.

339
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,560
And how did you make him agree to go?

340
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,160
It's the client's top secret.
I can't disclose it.

341
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,040
Ha. Top secret.

342
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,760
What are you doing?

343
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,120
Nothing! I'm not doing anything.

344
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,880
Have you

345
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,120
been inspired by Teacher Kanti?

346
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,440
No, I'm just…

347
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,760
I'm deleting all the photos
in case something happens to me

348
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,280
and someone looks through my phone.
That would be so embarrassing.

349
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,840
Teacher Kanti is here.

350
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,760
Where?

351
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,280
I'm leaving now.

352
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,560
I hope you both

353
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,920
spend the rest of your time wisely.

354
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,240
He's gone.

355
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,440
Tip!

356
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,560
Tip, are you okay?

357
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,760
Tip?

358
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,400
Careful!

359
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,320
I'm… probably just tired.

360
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,920
MAN IN BLACK TRIES TO KILL ME ON A CLIFF

361
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,200
MISSING PERSON

362
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,880
MS. JAREEPORN WONGWAI - TIP

363
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,600
How many more ghosts do I have to help

364
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,440
until I remember all about myself?

365
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,800
Running a business sure is troublesome.

366
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,520
Hey, Sis.

367
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,920
Ong, I heard you started
a business in real estate?

368
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
It's really nothing much. Just--

369
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,040
You don't have to be so humble.

370
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,280
I'm glad to hear you're better off.

371
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,360
Oh, and there's the family reunion soon.

372
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,480
You're coming, right?

373
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,800
I… Um…

374
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,840
Give me your address.

375
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,840
I'll order a suit for you
to wear to the reunion.

376
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,040
I want to brag to Aunt and Grandma

377
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,600
that you are the CEO
of a real estate company.

378
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,000
Wait, wait!

379
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
GHOUL TO SCHOOL

380
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,320
MON TO WED 7:00 P.M.

381
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,480
Chang! Toop-Hom!

382
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,920
Didn't you hear the delivery coming?!

383
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,880
The delivery guy was yelling for a while!

384
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,120
Are you full yet? No?

385
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,159
Wha--

386
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,400
Do you not plan to help at all?

387
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,800
There's no work yet.
What do you want us to do?

388
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,639
And you thought to sit here
and not help us find any work?

389
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,040
I've been waiting by the phone all day.

390
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,639
No one has called.

391
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,840
What's going on?

392
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,520
Your honorary staff,

393
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,360
watching TV and doing nothing!

394
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,520
Boss, we have been watching the TV

395
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,560
to gather information from it.

396
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,440
-Huh?
-Yeah!

397
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,320
Don't sweat it. They're doing their best.

398
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,360
Yeah, keep siding with them.

399
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,480
You're no better!

400
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,080
We've only just started
and you bought a suit?!

401
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,440
Why did she send it over so fast?

402
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,200
Here!

403
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,080
This is what I found online.

404
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,680
There are many
abandoned houses around here.

405
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,880
There's gotta be one
that's haunted and won't sell.

406
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,840
Let's each go look at the houses.
And take pictures of the contact number.

407
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,880
Hey, look!

408
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,000
Could this house be haunted?

409
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,800
It sure feels like it.

410
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
I don't see anything.

411
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,920
Did you look well enough?

412
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,640
I did.

413
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,840
There aren't even ghosts of ants here.

414
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,360
Why is it so hard
to find a house with a ghost?

415
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,440
Hello?

416
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,640
Yes, this is Sixth Sense Agency.

417
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,160
This is the place they called us about.

418
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,920
BLESSED HOME ORPHANAGE

419
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,600
An orphanage that closed down long ago.

420
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,640
Raruaysap alley,

421
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,720
a Seven-Eleven
at the entrance, a cafe nearby.

422
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,680
At the alley's intersection,
turn right and then left,

423
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,560
then make another left turn.

424
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,240
How familiar.
Even as I'm saying the directions.

425
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,000
Holy!

426
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,000
This is near Yok's company!

427
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,920
What's wrong with you?

428
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,280
Hello, welcome.

429
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,800
We used to take in dozens of children.

430
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,320
But the owner grew old

431
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,560
and he had to close it.

432
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,720
So we sent the children
to other foundations.

433
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,480
Now we would like to sell the place.

434
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,360
Don't get scared.
This place doesn't have ghosts.

435
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,160
But actually,

436
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,000
we announced the sale long ago,

437
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,720
and many were interested.
It's a great location,

438
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,160
and affordable too.

439
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,760
But the problem is that…

440
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,320
Ugh, Toop-Hom!

441
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,600
Getting scared by a ball?!

442
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,280
But where did it suddenly come from?

443
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,680
Excuse me, could you please move the car?

444
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Of course, I'll be right over.

445
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,040
I'll be right back then.

446
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,720
We always have issues
with the parking space.

447
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,280
So that woman always comes
to ask me to move a car.

448
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,000
Hey! What are you doing?

449
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,960
Let's not take this job.

450
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,720
What are you talking about? Why not?

451
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,800
I think this place is a bit spooky.

452
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,440
It's making me anxious.

453
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
Let's not. Let's go back.

454
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
What's the matter?

455
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,480
What's your problem? Tell me.

456
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,280
I want the truth.

457
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,120
I just feel this place is unsafe.

458
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,800
It all feels a little… scary.

459
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,640
What's scaring you…

460
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,000
is actually that lady, isn't it?

461
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,560
Ong?

462
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,000
Hey!

463
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,000
-Sis!
-It really is you!

464
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,640
I swore I saw you.

465
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,680
-Sis!
-Whatever you do,

466
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,560
please try not to
embarrass your two sisters.

467
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,960
NEXT EPISODE

468
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,120
A ghost, right?!

469
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,720
Mind your own business. Scram!

470
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,080
Toop-Hom got possessed by the kid!

471
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,440
-Huh, possessed?!
-Huh, possessed?!

472
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,680
What if the kid's ghost doesn't leave
her body? What do we do then?

473
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,040
I've never seen anything like this either.
