00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,520
Come on Ong.

2
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,480
Do it for Dad's apartment.

3
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,960
WATTANA APARTMENT

4
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,200
I had this place built just for you Ong.

5
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,120
And all I ask from you

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,400
is to take good care of it.

7
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,280
Yes Sir.
I will take good care of this building.

8
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,400
You're selling the place?

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,320
I'm just using it as collateral.

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,720
That's no different. If you can't pay up,

11
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,080
they'll just seize it.

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,840
‪No matter what,

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,040
I'll make sure the building remains ours.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,200
NOTICE OF SEIZURE

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,600
You got any work for me?

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,000
The kind that can help me
get my apartment back.

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,560
Help me sell the house then.
I'll pay you a 500K baht commission.

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,880
You mean the house that

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,000
you bought to flip,
but it turned out to be haunted?

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,840
THIS HOUSE IS HAUNTED

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Come on Ong.

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,720
Come on.

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200

‪HOME FOR SALE

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,240
Welcome Sir.

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,760
What makes it special,

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,000
is the classic design we gave the house.

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,240
Once you get home,
you can really feel the coziness inside.

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,000
We also used earth tones
for its paint colors, giving it

31
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,480
a warm, cozy vibe.

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,720
True. It really is as pretty as you said.

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,960
The air downstairs is nice too.

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,760
Are you alright Sir?

35
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,960
-Wait, Sir!
-Get lost!

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,200
Sir!

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,440
-What are your thoughts? Did you like it?
-Yes.

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,840
Nice and shady, isn't it Sir?

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,880
Huh?

40
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,920
Sir!

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,320
Ghost! There's a ghost!

42
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,400
MAIN TITLE

43
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,960
Muai!

44
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,480
You keep staring at her.
She's all scared now.

45
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,320
What's your name?

46
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
My name is Huai.

47
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,200
-Huh? Huai?
-That's right, Huai.

48
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,000
She fell off a mountain.
Her memory is gone.

49
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,000
I came across her on a lottery draw date,
so I call her Huai.

50
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,160
So anyway,

51
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,960
please take care of her.

52
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,400
You came all the way from the north

53
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,680
because of this?

54
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,320
Yeah.

55
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,800
And she's quite pretty too.
What a shame she has lost her memory.

56
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
You can leave her here with me,

57
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,760
but I can't afford that much of a salary.

58
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,400
That's okay.

59
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,200
I'd love to work in exchange
for just food and shelter.

60
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,120
Yeah.

61
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,960
I really have no one to rely on.

62
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,160
Well, that does work in my favor.

63
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,040
May I use the restroom please?

64
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,280
You've been standing there squirming

65
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,440
'cos you need to pee?

66
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,840
-Go ahead. It's back this way.
-Go.

67
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,840
-I owe you one.
-Go ahead.

68
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,840
Go.

69
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,920
-B-Back here?
-Yeah.

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,960
-Tha--
-Back here.

71
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,680
That way. Just head straight.

72
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,160
Why not just go to the police?

73
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,320
Before she passed out, she told me

74
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,280
someone is trying to kill her.

75
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,840
-Kill her?
-Right.

76
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,320
Are you bringing me a fugitive?

77
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,600
Hey! That can't be Muai.

78
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,320
She seems pretty trustworthy.

79
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,640
Look, just think of it
as one big charity. Yeah?

80
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,920
Just wait till she remembers,

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,560
then we'll go to the police
and look for her family.

82
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,760
Excuse me.
The restroom is inside there, right?

83
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,000
Kid. You can see me, can't you?

84
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,640
You can hear me too, right?

85
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,360
I know

86
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,720
that you can see me.

87
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,520
Please,

88
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,560
leave me alone. I'm scared.

89
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,760
Kid, can you do me a favor?

90
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,840
My child just ordered
a casket from this place,

91
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,200
but I like the pattern
of that other one better.

92
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,840
Just forget it, buddy.

93
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,720
You can't sell a haunted house.

94
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,520
If you want to sell the house,
there's only one way.

95
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,960
‪Who, me?

96
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,680
Who else would I be talking to?

97
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,920
You're here alone.
Of course I'm talking to you.

98
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,640
The house is haunted big time.

99
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,240
The ghost will kill any intruders.

100
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,480
If you want my help,

101
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,840
I can perform an exorcism
on the spirits in that house.

102
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,480
I assure you, in three days

103
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,600
it will be sold.

104
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,920
Don't doubt it till you see it.

105
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,960
SHAMAN PU

106
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,240
-Hong.
-Hm?

107
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
The plane ticket is so cheap!

108
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
-Let me see.
-Here!

109
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,360
Shall we take a family trip to Paris?

110
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,760
Oh right! Hold on.

111
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,640
They're releasing a new purse collection.

112
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,200
-A whole family trip though.
-Yeah.

113
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,920
Calm down. You'll freak Ong out.

114
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,880
He's jobless you know.
Can he really come with us?

115
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,800
-So compelling though.
-It is pretty good.

116
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,320
-The price sure is great.
-True!

117
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,880
‪It's so cheap!

118
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,800
‪True.

119
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,200
‪You want a bag?

120
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
‪Which one?

121
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,280
Hello?

122
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,080
You're buying the house?

123
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,400
HOME FOR SALE

124
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,080
‪The next client…

125
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,760
Female. Petite and fair-skinned.

126
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,640
Came from abroad.

127
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,440
Right! Female of mixed race, fair-skinned.

128
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,240
The house is really pretty!

129
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,440
It so happens I'm investing
in a business in Thailand,

130
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,920
so I'm looking for a place to film.

131
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,360
Film you say?

132
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,760
Yes. I just happened to sign a contract

133
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,080
to film a series in Thailand.

134
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,680
She works in entertainment?

135
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,400
Great!

136
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,080
Entertainment…

137
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,040
SHAMAN PU

138
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,120
He's incredibly accurate!

139
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,080
How is it Ms. Nabi? Do you like it?

140
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,120
It's so pretty.

141
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,800
Please, come inside.

142
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,960
Yes?

143
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,880
Oh no!

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,720
Oh no! What should I do?!

145
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,360
What is it?

146
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,080
I can sense

147
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,800
some sort of energy in this house.

148
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,560
It's a strange feeling.

149
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,920
May I

150
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,400
consult a spiritual counselor first?

151
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,680
Then I'll get back to you later.

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,160
Goodbye.

153
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,880
Please calm down. Ms. Nabi! Ms. Nabi!

154
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,040
Ms. Nab--

155
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Why did you get scared?

156
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
If you hear something,

157
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,360
don't mention it.

158
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Yes, Shaman Pu.

159
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,920
If someone calls you,

160
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,560
don't respond.

161
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,880
Yes, Shaman Pu.

162
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,000
-Ong!
-Yes?

163
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,720
Oh. Don't respond.

164
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,680
Alright.

165
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,320
Now keep your eyes focused straight ahead.

166
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,760
No matter what happens,

167
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,840
don't turn anywhere.

168
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay.

169
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,520
Shaman! The door!

170
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,240
Get out!

171
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,480
How's that?

172
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
The wind!

173
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,720
Storm!

174
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,880
Why did the door get heavier?

175
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,840
It's probably broken. Never mind.

176
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,160
I'll use this then.

177
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,240
Get out!

178
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,320
Who said that?

179
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,760
Get out!

180
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,640
Get out!

181
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,960
Get out!

182
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,400
Why is there a man speaking?

183
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,200
There are actual dogs too?!

184
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,400
Get out now!

185
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,440
Toop-Hom!

186
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,080
Why did you come? You'll ruin our plan!

187
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,920
‪-G-Ghost…
‪-Shaman Pu!

188
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,600
What is this?

189
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,840
Oh!

190
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,080
Who are you?!

191
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,040
-Ugh! You!
-Oh! Ms. Nabi!

192
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
How did you get here?

193
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,000
You two know each other?

194
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,400
No we don't. Who are you?! Tell me!

195
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,360
-Brother!
-What?!

196
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,920
Let's get out for real.

197
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,280
For real!

198
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,200
This house has ghosts for real!

199
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,040
Hold on.

200
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,880
You're working together to scam me?

201
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,360
Then you both--

202
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,840
Get out!

203
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,480
What was that?

204
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,400
All of you, get out!

205
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,360
All of you, get out of my house!

206
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,680
A ghost!

207
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,520
Help!

208
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,640
-Help!
-Ms. Nabi!

209
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,640
Help! What?

210
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,440
The ghost is pulling on my shirt!

211
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,920
Help!

212
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,640
-Help!
-Hey you! Don't go! The house is haunted.

213
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,200
Hey you! Hey!

214
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,960
Help!

215
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,280
I can't breathe.

216
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,440
I can't breathe!

217
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,640
The ghost is pulling on my shirt. Quick!

218
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,960
-Thank you!
-It's not a ghost. Your shirt got caught.

219
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,880
Stupid little nail!

220
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,280
You wouldn't want to go in there.

221
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,599
There are ghosts for real. For real!

222
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,400
Quick. Don't go.

223
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,200
Come on. Quick. Come with me.

224
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,119
Come with me!

225
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,800
Oh, snap!

226
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,640
Are you with them?

227
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Kid, you can see me, right?

228
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,680
Can you do me a favor?

229
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,760
I really can't help anyone at this point.

230
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,360
Ever since I started seeing you all,

231
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,520
I've had trouble sleeping.

232
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,920
Who is she talking to?

233
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,400
Or is it…

234
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Then why don't you stop
and listen for a bit

235
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,960
to hear what kind of help they need?

236
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,920
I'll make merit for your sake.
Just rest in peace, okay?

237
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,360
Hold on.

238
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,320
Hold on!

239
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,160
You…

240
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,960
can talk to ghosts?

241
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,400
Can you do me a favor? Please?

242
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,080
Hold on!

243
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,280
I just want to sell this house,
but it has ghosts in it.

244
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,920
Could you please tell them to leave?

245
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,400
I can't help you.
You should find someone else.

246
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,000
Hold on!

247
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,000
You…

248
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
What's the matter? Get up!

249
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Those two faked being a shaman
and took all my money.

250
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,280
Selling this house is my only way out.

251
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,400
Please help me. I beg you.

252
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,040
Then I'll promise to help you
with whatever you need.

253
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,760
‪Please help me.

254
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,000
A ghost!

255
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,680
Toop-Hom! It's just you?
I thought you were a ghost!

256
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,120
Let go! I can't breathe!

257
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,920
You coward!

258
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,920
Running away like a dog!
You didn't even bother to help me!

259
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,560
You said yourself it was a real ghost.

260
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,360
What could I have done then?

261
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,040
Alright!

262
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,080
I'm sorry! You happy now?

263
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,600
If we can't fool this one,

264
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,120
then just forget it.
We'll go find another one.

265
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,480
But Chang,

266
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,440
it's still bugging me.

267
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,280
What now?

268
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,960
Just now, when I got stuck at the house,

269
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,720
the woman who helped me…

270
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,720
her face is really familiar!

271
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,000
How did it go?

272
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,920
He will let you sell the house.

273
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,040
-Really?
-But with a condition.

274
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,720
What condition?

275
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,720
They are Ake's ashes.

276
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,680
On the day I moved, I forgot to check

277
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,280
to make sure I would bring him with me.

278
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,520
But how did you know

279
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,240
that I hadn't brought
his ashes back with me?

280
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,800
You might not believe this,

281
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,200
but there is this woman

282
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,320
who helped me talk to Ake's ghost.

283
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,920
On the day you moved, the movers
knocked over the urn by accident,

284
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,520
so his ashes remained there at the house.

285
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,320
Oh! I found it!

286
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,880
He didn't let you sell the house
because he was afraid he wouldn't

287
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,160
get to go back to his wife and kids,

288
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,760
since they had moved to another province.

289
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,360
Then why didn't his ghost
just follow his family there?

290
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,880
Because…

291
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,000
he couldn't really leave the area.

292
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,680
And is he here now?

293
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,760
I don't know,

294
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,880
and I don't know what the condition was.

295
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,000
That's why I wanted you
to come and pick his ashes up yourself.

296
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,880
Long time no see. Are you all doing fine?

297
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,360
Everyone's doing fine. Don't you worry.

298
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,680
We will miss you always.

299
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,440
Can you see him too?

300
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,360
No,

301
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,560
but I can feel him.

Please thank the woman
who helped talk to his ghost for me.

305
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,560
Of course.

It's like your dad is smiling.

308
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,480
He's probably proud. I think this was
the very first job you've pulled off.

309
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,520
Maybe I was born to do this…

310
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,560
To do what normal people can't.

A realtor for haunted houses.

312
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,760
Speaking of that woman,

313
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,320
can she really talk to ghosts?

314
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,560
You!

315
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,440
You…

316
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,400

00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,080
Thank you for helping me
see my wife again, Kid.

319
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,320
Tip!

320
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,800
Tip…

321
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,920
What?

322
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,440
Toop-Hom, look.

323
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,000
Chang,

324
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,000
that's the woman
I told you about. Ring any bells?

325
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,960
She's so familiar, as if

326
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,840
we've been together
at an event or something.

327
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,280
Or maybe we're just overthinking things.

328
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,640
Women these days all look similar.

329
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,520

You like giving alms, don't you?

335
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,320
Oh, I…

336
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,920
I'm doing it in the name of someone else.

337
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,280
I see.

338
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,160
How lovely. So well-behaved and devout.

339
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,720
That's great.
Your deceased relatives would be blessed.

340
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,440
I should go offer a libation now.

341
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,960
Right.

-You!

How did you get here?

344
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,440
Have you been following me?

00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,760

Your commission.

349
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,720
Take it.

350
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,480
You talked to Ake's ghost for me.

351
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,400
Without you, I'd still be…

352
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,560
trying to sell it in vain.

353
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,560
And I came here today

354
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,440
because I want to start
a business with you.

355
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,440
A real estate agency
selling only haunted houses.

356
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,360
Here's my number.

357
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,080
I'll wait for your call.

358
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,640
Gotta go now.

359
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,960
So you can communicate with ghosts!

360
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,360
But when did you start seeing them?

361
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,080
As soon as I came to.

362
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,480
But I really can't remember anything.

363
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,240
Until…

364
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,400
Can you do me a favor?

365
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,720
Thank you for helping me
see my wife again, Kid.

00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,560
Yes. Tip is my name.

Yesterday, after I helped
the man talk to the ghost,

369
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,600
suddenly I could remember my name.

370
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,720
Then it means that
as you keep helping ghosts…

371
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,120
you'll gradually remember?

372
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,840
ONG 084-224-3992

373
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,840
Back then, why was she hunting
us to the point

374
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,960
where we had to run away and hide?

375
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,480
And if we can remember her,

376
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,120
why can't she remember us? Think about it.

377
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,640
I think she's lost her memory.

378
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,080
What are you two doing?

379
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,640
Why did you come here?

380
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,440
To buy caskets of course! Let me measure.

381
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,120
-Here, how wide is it?
-My chest is 48 inches.

382
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,680
And your belly--

383
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,200
Hey! I'm not dead yet!

384
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,320
Come back here when I'm dead, yeah?
We should get going.

385
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,680
-Goodbye.
-Right.

386
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Hold on!

387
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,000
Do you think you can get away
just like that after scamming someone?

388
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,920
Think I can't remember you two? Huh?

389
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,680
Y-You can remember us?

390
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,520
The phony shaman gang
with the house sale scam, right?

391
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,080
What a relief.

392
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,640
Then we're going!

393
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,960
Where are you taking us?!

394
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,600
You reap what you sow. Come!

395
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,520
Chang!

396
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,440
Please forgive me.

397
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,400
I did it because

398
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,160
he told me to!

399
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,800
You got any work for me?

400
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,960
The kind that can help me
get my apartment back.

401
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,840
Help me sell the house.

402
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,400
If you can sell it,

403
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
I'll pay you a 500K baht commission.

404
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,520
Five hundred thousand?

405
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,960
Wait a second. You mean the house that

406
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,400
you bought to flip,
but it turned out to be haunted?

407
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,040
-Yeah.
-Then no!

408
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,600
You know I'm scared of ghosts.

409
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,400
You want your dad's apartment
back, don't you?

410
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,440
Fine. I'll do it.

411
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,679
Come on Ong. Do it for Dad's apartment.

412
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,000
We will lead that idiot to believe
we've expelled the ghosts.

413
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,840
Then we'll ask for a little fee

414
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,760
when he can sell the house.

415
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,600
THIS HOUSE IS HAUNTED

416
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,960
I'm sorry.

417
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,600
As for the money,
we don't have any to pay you back.

418
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,560
That's okay. You don't need to.

419
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,520
I already got money
from selling the house.

420
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,120
Hey you!

421
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,160
I brought these two
for you to deal with them.

422
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,680
Are you not going to at all?

423
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,000
It's fine.
They're probably in trouble too,

424
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,640
otherwise they wouldn't have to
scam people like this.

425
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
-May I be excused?
-Yes, yes.

426
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,840
Toop-Hom.

427
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,800
You heard that?
They must be plotting something.

428
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,320
Not only has Lt. Tip gone loopy,

429
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,640
now she has amnesia
and she's seeing ghosts.

430
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,920
We'll settle here

431
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,480
and have her help us find Kai's ring!

432
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,120
You're so smart!

433
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,760
I accept. I'll work with you.

434
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,600
-My name is Ong.
-I'm Tip.

435
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,400
-Hey!
-Hey!

436
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,440
You're making a big move.
Your company can't just have two people.

437
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,000
You need lots of people
so your company seems prestigious.

438
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,680
Don't tell me
you're letting them onto the team!

439
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,040
I didn't invite them!

440
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,080
Sorry I deceived you.

441
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,200
But I had to do it because…

442
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,320
Because…

443
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,520
is falling ill from kidney disease.

444
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,840
Quit it with all this drama!

445
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,560
Who on earth would believe you?

446
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,280
Please allow me to let them join.

447
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,680
Wait. You actually buy that?

448
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,160
Up to you then. Go ahead.

449
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Brother!

450
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
Boss,

451
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,280
thank you so much!

452
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,360
I promise never to let you down Boss.

453
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,000
What did you just call me?

454
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,720
-Our boss, our handsome boss.
-Our boss, our handsome boss.

455
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,640
Our super kind boss.

456
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,640
Come here Boss.

457
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,800
We can do it Boss.

458
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,800
To own a business, you need an office.

459
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,480
And Tip happens to be working with me,

460
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,320
so just rent my building, yeah?

461
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,760
Otherwise, I won't let her work with you.

462
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,960
Okay then. Thank you so much.

463
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,200
Right. Here's the key.

464
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,640
Thank you.

465
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,560
Thank you. You've brought me
both live and dead clients.

466
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,320
There are two rooms upstairs. The master
bedroom has AC and its own bathroom.

467
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,920
But what should we name the company?

468
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,560
Down.

469
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,440
-Down. Up, up!
-Up?

470
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,840
Up a bit more.

471
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,560
-Up more?
-Down.

472
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,000
-Down?
-Up.

473
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,400
-Up?
-Up. Up a bit more.

474
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,120
Is it up or down?!

475
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,760
Make up your mind!

476
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,280
Okay. Okay, there.

477
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,680
-Got it yet?
-Got it?

478
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,040
We got it Toop-Hom.

479
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,040
Finally, we've officially
got ourselves a company.

480
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:35,440
WATTANA APARTMENT

481
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,840
Dad!

482
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,200
Why are you in here? Get out!

483
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,280
Dad! I'm sorry.

484
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,320
You caused the apartment I gave you

485
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,680
to be seized.

486
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,880
You drove me to suicide.

487
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,280
Now you must pay!

488
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,120
Dad!

489
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,560
‪Dad…

490
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,440
I'm sorry Dad!

491
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,000
I promise I'll buy
the apartment you bought for me back.

492
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,680
I'm sorry Dad.

493
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,800
Ong, can someone like you
really afford to do so?

494
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,640
You only need to remember
the incantations to expel me,

495
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,080
and you can't even do that!

496
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,240
I'm already dead.

497
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,720
Do you want me to die
of a broken heart again?

498
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,000
Fine then.

499
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,280
I'm taking you with me to death.

500
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,600
Dad, I'm sorry! Don't!

501
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,640
Dad, don't!

502
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,400
For crying out loud!

503
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,080
Is it that hard to find a cleaning lady?

504
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,240
What's the matter?

505
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,200
Kanti, who was renting a house from me,

506
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,080
he suddenly had a heart attack at home.

507
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,200
So I've been looking for
a cleaner, but they all ran.

508
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,640
But… you can see ghosts, can't you?

509
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,640
Would you talk to him for me?

510
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,240
