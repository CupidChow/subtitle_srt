1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,360
Our next job is out of town.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,240
Right now, we're at an abandoned resort.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,920
Come follow me inside.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,240
The evil ghost,

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,200
is a security guard's ghost.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,360
Tip!

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,760
This means the ghost we're about to meet

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,680
is the ghost of a deceased security guard?

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,360
Yeah.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,720
The security guard ghost!
He was a good person.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,080
It's strange

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,720
that after he passed away,
he turned out to be an evil ghost.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,320
PREVIOUSLY

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,360
Who's there?!

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,120
A log?

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,520
Who's there?!

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,960
A ghost can't run this fast.

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,640
Where's Tip?

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,240
I knew it wasn't a ghost.

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,240
Stop!

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,720
Tall, long, fair skin, and looks good.

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,480
You seem familiar.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,320
You're that famous YouTuber!

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,040
I'm Tom, a ghost channel YouTuber.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,960
You're those YouTubers
who like scamming people.

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,880
Hey! Don't be too harsh on him.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,800
Hey. Have you really seen Yod?

28
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,680
Yod…

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,920
Who's that?

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,920
He's the malevolent ghost in your video.

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,480
No. Look, I'm just someone
who wants to see ghosts.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,720
The video is just
part of creating the content.

33
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,560
Don't you think someone
might be affected by your fake content?

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
‪What?

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Guys…

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,720
Look.

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,520
A ghost! It's a ghost!

38
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,680
Guys, wait. I'm the one setting that up.

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,040
I was going to use it
for filming the video.

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,040
It's just fake.

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,040
You were the first one screaming.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,840
I faked it.

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,680
Heads up, watch out!

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,840
Wait, don't leave!

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,600
You can see me?

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
Yes.

47
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,720
We really want to help you.

48
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,280
-Is she talking to a ghost?
-Yes.

49
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,720
Does that mean all of you can see a ghost?

50
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,120
Not yet. Tip hasn't sent a signal yet.

51
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,320
Come follow me inside.

52
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,560
Are you alright?

53
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,840
Life's funny.

54
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,320
They said I was a thief when I was alive.

55
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,960
When I'm dead, they say I'm an evil ghost.

56
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,480
In that video…

57
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,280
I wanted to help the guest
who was lost in the woods.

58
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,360
Hey! Yod felt bad because of your video.

59
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Yod…

60
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,880
If the pictures and comments in this video

61
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,680
made you feel bad,
I'll ask him to delete the video.

62
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,600
It's fine.

63
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,320
Just knowing what I'm doing is enough.

64
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,800
What's your reason for coming here?

65
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,440
Is there something I can help you with?

66
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,440
Yes. We're realtors.

67
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,440
We want to sell this property.

68
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
So, you work for that scumbag, Bird

69
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,000
who only cares about his own benefit.

70
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,760
Yod, wait!

71
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,280
When I told him we wanted
to sell this land, he just disappeared.

72
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,440
I read the comment

73
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,480
that people normally

74
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,160
saw him at the guard house.

75
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,320
There's nothing here.

76
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,920
Right.

77
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,720
There's nothing about Yod here.

78
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,360
I told you,
we shouldn't waste our time trusting Tom.

79
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,160
RESTAURANT 093-9589551
MOTORBIKE TAXI 097-1651959

80
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,360
Guys! Look.

81
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,360
SIRIPHON

82
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,480
Siriphon might be someone Yod knew.

83
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,920
Then we must find Siriphon.

84
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,480
SIRIPHON

85
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,160
I don't know her.

86
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,640
But, wait.

87
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,040
Do you have a list of names
of the guests who used to be here?

88
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,360
I rarely came here.

89
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
You should ask
the deceased security guard.

90
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,919
Our only choice

91
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,200
is to find Yod.

92
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,360
But please hurry up.

93
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,200
And you don't need to find Siriphon.

94
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,000
Just exorcise the ghost

95
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,640
and help me sell this place
as soon as possible.

96
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Since Yod didn’t come out,

97
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,760
we have to find a clue about Siriphon.

98
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,880
Is it possible

99
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,320
that Yod is Siriphon's boyfriend?

100
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,760
The only one who knows
the identity of Siriphon is Yod.

101
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,520
Yod. Yod!

102
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Yod!

103
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,800
Please come out and talk to us.

104
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,000
Yod!

105
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,640
We're here to help.
Why do you have to be so harsh?

106
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,960
It's not me!

107
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,400
There!

108
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,160
Leave!

109
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,760
‪Run!

110
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,600
Tip!

111
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,640
I really want to know
how Tip can see ghosts.

112
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,800
I really want to see ghosts.
Please help me.

113
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,800
Being able to see ghosts isn't much fun.

114
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,760
Tip!

115
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,080
Help, help!

116
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,000
Something's happening to them.
Let's go Toop-Hom.

117
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,880
Let go of her!

118
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,840
Pass through?

119
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,120
She can float?

120
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,040
It's real!

121
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
-Chang!
-This isn't the time to be happy.

122
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,200
Let’s hurry and find a way to help Tip.

123
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,360
How are we supposed to help her?
We can’t see a single ghost.

124
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,240
Can you see the ghost Toop?

125
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,360
I can't.

126
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,640
Where's Yod's ghost?!
I'm going to slap him!

127
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,920
Wait!

128
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,800
Yod is helping us!
The other ghost is choking Tip.

129
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,840
Let her go and come with me!

130
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,240
They're here to help us. Let go!

131
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,280
Tip!

132
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,160
Tip.

133
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,680
Tip, are you alright? Tip?

134
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,520
Tip? Are you okay? Please don't die.

135
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,400
Tip, please breathe. Please don't die.

136
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,720
Tip.

137
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,920
Did I die?

138
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Tip.

139
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,440
Why did you slap me?

140
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,120
You were about to…

141
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,040
To what?

142
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,880
Just now?

143
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,800
I was just swatting the bug for you.

144
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,680
I see… bug.

145
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,360
Fine.

146
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,200
About last night when you helped me…

147
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,080
How did you help me?

148
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,760
Last night… you were choked by the ghost
and passed out.

149
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,360
It looked like you couldn't breathe, so I…

150
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,240
Brought you an inhaler.

151
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,160
That's it?

152
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,320
Tip, you're awake!

153
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,720
I'm so happy!

154
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,800
You've been unconscious for a while.

155
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,080
She's right. For 12 hours.

156
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,240
You would be fully charged
if you were a phone.

157
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,240
Then Boss must be Tip's charger.

158
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,440
He didn't sleep
and was here with you all night.

159
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,120
-My name's Ong.
-I'm Tip.

160
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,080
You didn't sleep all night?

161
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,320
Well, it's not that dramatic.

162
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,920
Not only did he not sleep,

163
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,640
but he also refused to eat anything.

164
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,840
As far as I remember,

165
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,080
Yod said that the evil ghost
from last night made him look bad.

166
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,280
Is the evil ghost Siriphon?

167
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,280
Well, as Tip and I see it,

168
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,920
that ghost is a man.

169
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
Right.

170
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,760
But as I read from the comments,

171
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,560
there's no information
about any other ghosts.

172
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,720
Don't act innocent. This happened
because of you making up the story.

173
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,200
Now Yod is angry.
He doesn't show up anymore.

174
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,080
I think we should hurry up
and find the other ghost.

175
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,640
If we can help him,
I think we can sell this place easier.

176
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,320
But if the ghost is truly that evil,

177
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,480
can we really handle him Boss?

178
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,840
How can we find Yod?

179
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,240
I read in the comments

180
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,360
that they said

181
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,560
the security guard ghost will appear

182
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,520
when someone is asking for help.

183
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
I know what to do.

184
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,200
Chang, I understand
that you want to show off.

185
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,480
But why do we have to risk so much?

186
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,960
Since we're keeping an eye on Lt. Tip,

187
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,320
we should earn her trust.

188
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,960
By climbing the tree to ask Yod for help?

189
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,320
No, we're not just climbing the tree.

190
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,920
We're going to shoot the wasp's nest.

191
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,600
By risking ourselves like this,
the ghost will appear and help us.

192
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,080
Don't do it!

193
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,680
Just wait…

194
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,960
Chang, don't do it!

195
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,920
Chang!

196
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,920
Chang!

197
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,880
Chang!

198
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,560
-Chang!
-Are you alright?!

199
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,360
Did Yod appear?

200
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,000
-Chang, get up.
-Can you get up?

201
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,480
Yod! Don't you want to reincarnate?

202
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,840
If you have something in mind,

203
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,480
you can tell us. We can help you.

204
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,280
Yod…

205
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,560
your duty has already ended.

206
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,200
The owner is about to sell this place.

207
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
Do not sell!

208
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,480
I can see now. Tip…

209
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,680
Could you please ask Yod
to get off my shoulder?

210
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,240
He isn't Yod.

211
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,720
This is the evil ghost
who hurt me yesterday.

212
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,520
‪Evil ghost? Why's it gotta be me?

213
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,560
Leave!

214
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,240
Follow us if you dare!

215
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,920
Let's go!

216
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Chang!

217
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,960
Chang!

218
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
Hurry. Hurry up!

219
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,360
Leave! You can't sell this place!

220
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,800
Why can't you let us sell this place?

221
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,000
Don't bother!

222
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,720
Enough, Mr. Wit!

223
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,200
Yod.

224
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,320
Yod!

225
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,920
It's none of your business. Leave!

226
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,520
Guys! Let's split up.

227
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,320
Go, go!

228
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,680
Go after Chang.
If you don't, Chang will sell this place!

229
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,000
I said you can't sell this place!

230
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,520
Yod, please help us.

231
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,040
Please.

232
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,280
Let's go, Chang!

233
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,640
Let him go!

234
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,480
I can't.

235
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,920
Please let Chang go!

236
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,160
Please let him go!

237
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,200
We're sorry.
We won't be selling this place anymore.

238
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,240
Please let him go!

239
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,480
Please!

240
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,560
Chang!

241
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,000
Mr. Wit, what happened?

242
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,400
I traveled here alone.

243
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,640
because I had a fight with my wife.

244
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,000
She must be so mad,

245
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,560
she didn't pick up my call.

246
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
So I texted her

247
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,680
that I'll be waiting for her here.

248
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,840
What happened to Mr. Wit

249
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,920
is my fault.

250
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,480
If I had helped you in time,

251
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,080
this would never have happened.

252
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,800
Don't blame yourself Yod.

253
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,600
It's because of me that you died.

254
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,320
No one wanted this to happen.

255
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,040
She's right.

256
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,200
Are your wife and child

257
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,600
still alive?

258
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,840
I don't know. So I'm trying my best

259
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,360
to prevent them from selling this place.

260
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,520
So that I can meet
my family here once again.

261
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,000
Mr. Wit.

262
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,080
Do you remember your wife's phone number?

263
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,800
Sorry, there is no answer
from your requested number.

264
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,000
How about your best friend's number?

265
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,280
I have.

266
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,640
Thank you.

267
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,760
What did he say?

268
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,280
Well…

269
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,120
Your wife…

270
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,280
had an accident and
has been hospitalized for six months now.

271
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,120
Wow.

272
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,600
Tom, you're really good at social media.

273
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,760
He found out
which hospital Mr. Wit's wife is in.

274
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,400
Let's hurry up so we can help Mr. Wit.

275
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,280
-Let's go.
-Right.

276
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,880
Huh?

277
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,080
When did you get this?

278
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,960
I grabbed it from the counter
to help in our role.

279
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,240
Chang, you're really… let's go.

280
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,560
Hello.

281
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,480
We are Woralak's relatives.
We're here to see her.

282
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,880
‪Welcome.

283
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,600
Excuse me.

284
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,840
How are the patients doing?

285
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,160
Both are not doing well.
They've been like this since they arrived.

286
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,320
Well…

287
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,840
How much are they suffering?

288
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,480
Both sides are waiting
for the other to come.

289
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,040
Mrs. Woralak.

290
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,120
If you're waiting for Mr. Wit,

291
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,000
he has already passed away.

292
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,520
And…

293
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,680
His spirit is waiting for both of you

294
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,320
in the family room.

295
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,440
If you and your child
are feeling overwhelmed,

296
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,040
Please join Mr. Wit and rest.

297
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,520
‪Alright.

298
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,040
‪Thank you.

299
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,280
They have both passed away.

300
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,720
You two, can you please
help Mr. Wit one more time?

301
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,480
-Daddy!
-Kati!

302
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

303
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,360
Dear. I'm sorry.

304
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,160
How could this have happened?

305
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,880
Kati missed you so much
and kept sulking at me.

306
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,760
She kept asking me to bring her here.

307
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,080
Even though I was still mad at you.

308
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,680
Dad sent a message,

309
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,880
"Dear, I'm sorry. If you're not angry,
please follow me here.

310
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,720
I'll set up a campfire
and wait for you and Kati here."

311
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
TODAY 9:48 P.M.

312
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,480
I'll tell dad that we're on our way there.

313
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,760
I'll reply to his message myself.

314
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,880
WIT

315
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,480
I should have been the one
to come back to you.

316
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,360
I shouldn't have asked you and Kati

317
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,880
to follow me here.

318
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,720
It's also my fault
for talking harshly with you.

319
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,960
But it's fine
since we're back together now.

320
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,880
‪Right.

321
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,040
Hey. What's wrong?

322
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,840
We should be happy they have reunited.

323
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,240
Right.

324
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,520
Congratulations, Wit.

325
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,040
From now on,

326
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,200
please take care of each other in heaven.

327
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,440
I'm really sorry Yod.

328
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,680
And thank you so much

329
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,160
for always taking good care of my family

330
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,560
whenever we came here.

331
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,720
Even now,

332
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,560
you're still here for us.

333
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,080
Thank you to all of you as well.

334
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,480
Goodbye Mr. Wit.

335
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,760
Mrs. Woralak and Kati.

336
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,800
It's time for us
to bid goodbye to Yod as well.

337
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,840
I can't leave.

338
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,440
Why not?

339
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,000
-Yod? Wait!
-Yod?

340
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,440
Yod.

341
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,000
Yod!

342
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,280
What do you need help with?
Please tell us.

343
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,360
Don't worry about me.

344
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,680
Your mission is complete.

345
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,160
Mr. Wit's ghost is no longer here.

346
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,080
You can tell Mr. Bird to sell this place.

347
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,720
I won't haunt anyone anymore.

348
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,440
I'll leave when the time comes.

349
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,800
Yod, do you want us to help with Siriphon?

350
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,200
At 10:00 a.m., we've been waiting 24 hours
and no sign of the security guard's ghost.

351
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,120
This spot is where people say

352
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,840
he used to patrol
and rest in the bushes when he was alive.

353
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,560
‪Here he comes.

354
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,960
Toop-Hom!

355
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,440
I thought you were a security guard ghost!

356
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,480
Ghosts can't be this beautiful.

357
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,760
Are you going to upload another video?
Do you think it's a good idea?

358
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,720
Not anymore.

359
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,360
I just want to help find Yod.

360
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,840
I heard that he refused to reincarnate.

361
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,080
Love made you a better person?

362
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,920
Chang found Siriphon's letter.

363
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,040
SENDER'S NAME AND ADDRESS

364
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,560
This letter is 29 years old

365
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,000
and hasn't been opened.

366
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,280
I think we should open it
so we can know the truth.

367
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,800
Wait, shouldn't we ask for Yod's consent?

368
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,159
What if it's a breakup letter?

369
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,239
I don't think we should let him know.

370
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,640
But if it's a love letter,

371
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,840
it could change Yod's life.

372
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,240
Yod.

373
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,040
We want to talk to you.
Could you please come out?

374
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,320
DEAR YOD

375
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,040
"Yod, thank you so much

376
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,360
for keeping that diamond bracelet.

377
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,840
But I won't be back here anymore.

378
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,920
At least not in the near future.

379
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,800
Because I have to move to France.

380
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,720
So I want you to keep it.

381
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,160
I'll be very happy

382
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,040
if you make the best use
of the bracelet for yourself.

383
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,800
It's your treasure now.

384
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,560
Thank you so much for everything.

385
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,120
Siriphon."

386
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:37,080
Siriphon sent this letter to you
many years ago.

387
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,840
But this letter got mixed up
with other letters.

388
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,680
It's really Siriphon's handwriting.

389
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,640
Could you tell us

390
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,760
about Siriphon?

391
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,000
Almost 30 years ago,

392
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,280
at that time,
I was just beginning this job.

393
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,640
There's only one resort around here.

394
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,160
Even the town's millionaires

395
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,680
have to come here

396
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,800
if they pass by.

397
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,040
That's how I met Siriphon.

398
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,320
But then one day, something happened.

399
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,120
You stole my watch, right?

400
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,400
Yod, did you really steal it?

401
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,320
Don't lie. You're the only one here.

402
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,840
Call the police to arrest him.

403
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,120
Just go back to Dad's room and find it.
The watch is in there.

404
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,440
It's not.

405
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,840
This isn't the first time
you can't find your watch.

406
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,760
But I've never lost it here.
Besides, every time I'm here,

407
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,560
this security guard
always looks into my room.

408
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,480
He must have stolen it for sure.

409
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,000
Please go back and look one more time.

410
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,000
It's in the room. Believe me.

411
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,560
My dad found his watch.

412
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,480
I apologize on his behalf
for accusing you like that.

413
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,040
Why are you so sure
that I didn't steal the watch?

414
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,080
As my dad said,

415
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,880
you always check every guest's room

416
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,560
because you're watching out for them.

417
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
How could the watch have been stolen?

418
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,640
Thank you for watching out.

419
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,560
It's my duty Miss.

420
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,240
You can call me Siriphon.
Make yourself comfortable.

421
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,560
I can't. I'm just a security guard.

422
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,520
How can I compare myself to you?

423
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,520
Miss is the guest
I have to take the best care of.

424
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,120
What does that mean?
Just a security guard compared to what?

425
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,840
Being a security guard is a profession.

426
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,640
I'm a merchant,
and it's just another profession.

427
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Although our roles are different,
we both work.

428
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,840
Is it necessary for one profession
to be better than the other?

429
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,440
No matter what others think,

430
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,960
you can't think of yourself
as lower than them.

431
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,440
One day, in front of Siriphon's room,

432
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,160
I found the diamond bracelet
she always wore.

433
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,360
I tried to return it to her myself.

434
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,280
Because I don't trust anyone.
But Siriphon never returned.

435
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,320
After that, I heard

436
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,000
that Siriphon had already moved abroad.

437
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,120
What stuck in your mind

438
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,120
is returning that bracelet to Siriphon?

439
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,120
But in her letter, she clearly stated
that she gave the bracelet to you.

440
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,760
Does that mean
there is no need to worry anymore?

441
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,360
Or you want
to meet Siriphon one more time, right?

442
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,360
You want
to talk to her one more time, right?

443
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,240
I'm listening.

444
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,080
Is there something Yod wants to tell me?

445
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,080
I want to sell this building,
but the problem is that

446
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,880
the workers get haunted
every time they start renovating.

447
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,240
Look!

448
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,760
Enough, Suchart!

449
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,400
You won't stop suffering
if you keep doing this.

450
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,600
‪NEXT EPISODE

451
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,480
I remember now. Kai…

452
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,720
If she can remember Kai,

453
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,600
she might remember
the whereabouts of the safe.

454
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,840
Remember only the whereabouts
of the safe or also about us?
