1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,480
I'm leaving now.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,440
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,600
Tip.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,240
TIP - SEE GHOSTS - MEMORY LOSS -
MAN IN BLACK TRIES TO KILL ME ON A CLIFF

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,080
How many more ghosts do I have to help

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,240
until I remember all about myself?

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,880
Ong, I heard you've started
a business in real estate?

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,880
It's really nothing much. Just--

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,640
And there's the family reunion soon.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,920
You're coming, right?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,880
I… Um…

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,600
I want to brag to Aunt and Grandma

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,560
that you're a CEO
of a real estate company.

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,360
This is the place they called us about.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,280
An orphanage that closed down long ago.

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,720
Holy!

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,640
This is near Yok's company!

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,560
Let's not take on this job.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,160
BLESSED HOME ORPHANAGE

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,400
Come here.

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,760
What's the matter?

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,960
What's your problem? Tell me.

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,720
I want the truth.

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,600
I just feel this place is unsafe.

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,280
It all feels a little… scary.

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,080
What's scaring you…

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,480
is actually that lady, isn't it?

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,600
Ong!

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,840
-Hey!
-Sis!

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,800
It really is you!

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,920
I swore I saw you.

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Hey.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,800
What are you guys doing here?

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,320
Oh, I see.

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,480
You came to buy this place, right?

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,560
That's right.

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,880
I'm here with a coworker.

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,480
-Hello.
-Hello.

39
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,400
You've got keen eyes!

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,480
This place is in a prime location.

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,120
But wait,

42
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,880
I don't think buying this place
is a good idea.

43
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,880
The owner seems like a weirdo.

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,240
I saw him hire exorcists

45
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,880
to exorcise something here.

46
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,240
So superstitious and nonsensical.

47
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,160
In my opinion,
If you're looking to buy land,

48
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,680
you should go somewhere else.

49
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,760
Oh, did you get the suit I sent you?

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,320
I got it.

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,320
Good.

52
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,280
The calls keep coming in all day.

53
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,560
Hello.

54
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,160
It's Yok.

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,840
I have to go now.
See you at the family reunion.

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,360
Yes, this is Yok. I know…

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,960
The reason you hide from your sister,

58
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
is because you brag a lot, right?

59
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,400
I didn't brag about anything.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,840
She just misunderstood.

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Wait.

62
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,320
Don't tell me that
you didn't tell your sister

63
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,680
that you're a haunted real estate agent?

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,320
She can't know about this. If she knew…

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,520
I'd be bullied to death.

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,120
How do you know?

67
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,000
It's an honest job.

68
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,200
Or maybe it's you who hates this job.

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,560
Hey.

70
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,800
Boss.

71
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,800
The manager asked me to check

72
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,800
whether you'll accept this job or not.

73
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,000
Do you have any idea

74
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
why the boss doesn't
want to accept this job?

75
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,520
Maybe because
it's the company's first job.

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,080
He might be afraid of the loss.

77
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,520
Boss is so kind.
He only cares for the others.

78
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,520
I'll order a suit for you

79
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,040
so you can wear it to the reunion.

80
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,920
I want to brag to Aunt and Grandma

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
that you're a CEO
of a real estate company.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,320
Or maybe it's you who hates this job.

83
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,840
It's not that I hate this job.

84
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,960
But this kind of job

85
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
seems like a scam.

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,440
How can I make anyone believe in ghosts?

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Do you believe that I can see ghosts?

88
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,440
I'll make it one day Dad.

89
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,880
Please wait for me.

90
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,200
Don't look down on yourself
because of others.

91
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,320
Let's go do our first job
at the orphanage.

92
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Let's go.

93
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,760
Come on.

94
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,000
NO ENTRY WITHOUT PERMISSION

95
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,560
BLESSED HOME ORPHANAGE

96
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
It's just the wind.

97
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,200
Let's go already.

98
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Hurry up!

99
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Tip, you're looking for a ghost, right?

100
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,520
Seems like she is.

101
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,280
It's just the wind.

102
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,760
A ghost, right?!

103
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,760
Ghost!

104
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,720
Tip!

105
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,360
Chang!

106
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,480
Chang!

107
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,400
‪Chang!

108
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,960
Hey! Can't you calm down?

109
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,440
We have good intentions.

110
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
Look.

111
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,960
Is it a child ghost this time?

112
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,120
You're there, right?

113
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,680
How do you know?

114
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,880
I just know.

115
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,400
Why don't you talk nicely?

116
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,960
Whatever you want,

117
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,640
you can tell us.

118
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,200
Why don't you leave this place?

119
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,160
Mind your own business. Scram!

120
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,440
Leave!

121
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,720
Hey!

122
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,120
I think we should leave

123
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,280
and rest for today.

124
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,880
I agree.

125
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,960
I'm tired. I want to go home.

126
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,320
-Hey!
-What?

127
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,800
Please.

128
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,560
Let's leave and think of a way
to handle the child ghost.

129
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,040
None of your business.

130
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,880
Don't bother. Leave!

131
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,680
I'm Tip.

132
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,440
Why does my heart beat faster

133
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,680
every time I'm with him?

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,480
This isn't a romance movie!

135
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,040
Where is Kai's ghost?

136
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,520
If your ghost really exists, how are you?

137
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,160
Chang.

138
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,720
What if Kai has been reincarnated?

139
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,280
There's no way he will be reincarnated.
Kai has a lot of karma.

140
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,040
I'm already bored of this job.

141
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,400
The job is scary,
and the paycheck is small.

142
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,600
When can I debut in South Korea?

143
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,440
Even if you have money,

144
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,600
they won't let you into South Korea.

145
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,440
You've committed lots of crimes,
you won't pass immigration.

146
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,880
I can't take it anymore.
I won't wait any longer.

147
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,600
We should hurry up and look for Kai.

148
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,080
Let's get Tip to help.

149
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,280
-Let's go Chang.
-What?

150
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,920
What kind of coffin do you want?

151
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,000
You can try lying inside.

152
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,720
If you have something in mind,
feel free to let me know.

153
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,760
What are you doing?
You've been busy all morning.

154
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,320
Could you please step back a bit?

155
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,440
You're so close you could almost kiss him.

156
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,480
Wait.

157
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,960
He left.

158
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,480
He must have gone to another shop.

159
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,880
Oh, right.

160
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,160
Since you see lots of ghosts,

161
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,080
have you seen Kai's ghost?

162
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,120
Have you heard this name?

163
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,840
Kai.

164
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,680
I have.

165
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,160
I know him well.

166
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,280
Why did you ask?

167
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,920
Really?

168
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,320
You saw his ghost?

169
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,920
Where is he now?

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,400
Can you help us look for him?

171
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,400
Well…

172
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
He's at Wat Chedi in Nakhon Si Thammarat.

173
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,880
Why?
Are you going to ask for lottery numbers?

174
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,040
I knew it.

175
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
She means Egg Boy.

176
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,440
BLESSED HOME ORPHANAGE

177
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,160
Do we really have to go this far?

178
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,640
The kid will like this.

179
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,440
More energy. More!

180
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,800
Elephant, Elephant, Elephant.

181
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,120
Have you ever seen an elephant?

182
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,400
Nonsense.

183
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,600
You old hag acting like a child.

184
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,560
The child will like this for sure.

185
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,680
He said,

186
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,880
"Nonsense.
You old hag acting like a child."

187
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,120
-What?
-Come on.

188
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,320
You won't stop?

189
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,440
Fine.

190
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,680
You're the one who won't stop.
You deserve this.

191
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,160
-Stop!
-No!

192
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,840
I said stop!

193
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,080
What kind of kid are you?
Didn't your mom teach you anything?

194
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Stop!

195
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,280
I don't have a mother, so what?

196
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Don't butt in!

197
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,320
Aren't you being a bit too harsh?

198
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,040
Let's split up to look for him.

199
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,120
Hey!

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,120
Are you around here?

201
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,600
I bought you
the latest remote control car.

202
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,840
Do you want it?

203
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,080
Yikes!

204
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,160
Please don't haunt me.
I'm afraid of ghosts.

205
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,640
If we cooperate, it's a win-win for us.

206
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,760
You can reincarnate,
I can sell the land to earn a commission.

207
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,320
This is all I do!

208
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,440
So it's not a real estate company,

209
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,800
but a ghost exorcism company?

210
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,800
Sis?

211
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,000
Well, it's not a ghost exorcism company.

212
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,680
It's a real estate company

213
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,840
that sells haunted lands.

214
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,760
I knew it.

215
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,080
I knew something was wrong.

216
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,400
Ong.

217
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,440
I know you want to be successful.

218
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,000
But this is a scam.

219
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,800
It's not what you think.
I never scam anyone.

220
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,880
Haunted house real estate agent?

221
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,560
Ong.

222
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,760
Can you please try not to
embarrass your two sisters?

223
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,000
Especially Big Sis Hong.

224
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,920
She's a senior government official.

225
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,760
What if someone learns that her brother

226
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,800
is a scammer?

227
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,640
She would be really humiliated.

228
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,640
Before you do anything,

229
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,360
think carefully.

230
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,640
I think,

231
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,800
you shouldn't go

232
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,720
to the family reunion.

233
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,920
Chang! I'm scared!

234
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,640
Toop-Hom!

235
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,040
Why are you clinging to me?
We should split up and find the kid.

236
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,480
But honestly, the kid's situation is sad.

237
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,240
His mom must be heartless
to leave him here.

238
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,600
I agree, what a string of bad luck.

239
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,560
He even died at such a young age.

240
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,680
Where are you?

241
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,560
Come on, let's talk.

242
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,160
I'm sorry

243
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,480
for what I said earlier.

244
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,040
We are alike,

245
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,640
because I don't have a mother either.

246
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,160
Liar.

247
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm not lying.

248
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,880
Not only that,

249
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,560
I lost my memory.

250
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
I can't even remember

251
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,320
if I have a dad or mom.

252
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,560
Even myself,

253
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,880
I don't even know who I am.

254
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,040
What about you?

255
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,240
Is there something
you want to tell me about?

256
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,680
Do you need any help?

257
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't.

258
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,440
Don't be so stubborn.

259
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Please tell me about yourself.

260
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,280
How long have you been here?

261
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,640
Don't butt in.

262
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,040
If my mom loved me,
she wouldn't have left me.

263
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,480
Toop-Hom!

264
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,680
-Toop-Hom!
-Wake up!

265
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,840
-Toop-Hom!
-Come on!

266
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,000
Wake up!

267
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Toop-Hom.

268
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,240
What? Toop-Hom!

269
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,920
What happened?

270
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,400
What?

271
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,840
Why am I stuck here?

272
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,040
Let me go.

273
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
Let me go.

274
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,200
How did I get inside this body?

275
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,240
No!

276
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,440
Tip, why is Toop-Hom

277
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,800
acting so strange like a kid?

278
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
It's because…

279
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,160
Don't tell me…

280
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,400
She's role-playing again.

281
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,520
You're wasting our time.
Stop fooling around.

282
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,160
No! Toop-Hom got possessed by the kid!

283
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,800
-Huh, possessed?!
-Huh, possessed?!

284
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,440
I want to leave this body.

285
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,800
Toop-Hom!

286
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,920
-I want to leave.
-Toop-Hom!

287
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,360
I want to leave this body.

288
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,040
Toop-Hom.

289
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm going to get you.

290
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm going to catch you now.

291
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,400
Keep running.

292
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,880
I almost caught you.

293
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,320
I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat?

294
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,600
Sure.

295
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,320
Here it is.

296
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,280
Red Soda.

297
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,760
I'm not Kuman who drinks Red Soda.

298
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,240
We only have Red Soda.

299
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,760
Can you try it first?
I'll get you a yummy snack later.

300
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,920
Okay.

301
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,560
Tip, when will the ghost

302
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
leave Toop-Hom's body?

303
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,760
What if the ghost

304
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,600
eats her organs? What will we do?

305
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,600
He's not a ghoul.

306
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Hey.

307
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,000
What if the ghost refuses
to leave Toop-Hom's body?

308
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,320
What will we do next?

309
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,480
Well, I've never seen
anything like this either.

310
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,160
You and Chang

311
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,440
keep an eye on Toop-Hom tonight.

312
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,240
We'll see what we can do tomorrow.

313
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,640
Okay.

314
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,480
Boo!

315
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,000
Hey.

316
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,120
I'll walk you home.

317
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,440
MUAI'S CASKETS

318
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,080
Hey.

319
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,920
Are you okay?

320
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,840
I noticed that
you didn't look so good earlier.

321
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,520
I just met my sister.

322
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,640
She found out about my job,

323
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,640
so I got chewed out.

324
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,760
You must feel terrible.

325
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,280
She told me
not to attend the family reunion.

326
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,960
Maybe she's embarrassed that her brother

327
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,760
works as a haunted real estate agent.

328
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,400
Can I ask you something?

329
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,720
Why did you choose this job?

330
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,360
I--

331
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,320
My dad died because of me.

332
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,960
What?

333
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,760
But I'm not a murderer.

334
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,240
I see.

335
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
Well,

336
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,960
my dad had a heart attack

337
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,760
after finding out
I lost his apartment to foreclosure.

338
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,560
So I'm trying to buy it back.

339
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,240
Isn't it funny?

340
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,840
The more I say,

341
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,520
the dumber I must seem to you.

342
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,640
But still, I want to tell you.

343
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,280
Whenever you feel discouraged,

344
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,400
I want you to remember

345
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,160
the days you felt good about this job.

346
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,480
And I want you to stand your ground

347
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,960
and believe in yourself,
no matter what anyone says.

348
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Even though

349
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,640
I might seem confused about my life

350
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,480
I know what I'm doing

351
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,880
and also its consequences.

352
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,680
Even though

353
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,800
I might seem a bit pissed off at you,

354
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,560
deep down, I know

355
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,600
that you're a good person.

356
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Thank you.

357
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,720
You know,

358
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
here

359
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,640
and now…

360
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,200
is the best part of today.

361
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,920
I should get going.

362
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,160
Poor Chang,

363
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,840
he must be busy with the child ghost.

364
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,560
Bye.

365
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,120
I'm Tip.

366
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,560
Maybe Tip has a crush on me?

367
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,200
It sure seems like it.

368
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,240
Who would have a crush
on a goofball like me?

369
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,840
Toop!

370
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,120
I'm all soaked!

371
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,000
-What?
-Toop!

372
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,280
Enough!

373
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,480
-I'm soaked!
-My Office!

374
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,040
Hey!

375
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Let's play!

376
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,560
Play what? I don't want to!

377
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
What happened Chang?

378
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,640
Help me catch him.

379
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,760
What did you say? Toop-Hom--

380
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,760
I mean, the child ghost ran away?

381
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,040
Okay, I got it.

382
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,320
Did you find him?

383
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,120
No. What should we do?

384
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,720
Listen you guys.

385
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,680
Grandpa said he saw Toop-Hom

386
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,840
at the end of the market.

387
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,640
Shall we go there?

388
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,640
-Let's go.
-Mommy!

389
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,360
Mommy!

390
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,840
Mommy.

391
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,840
Mommy.

392
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,000
Mommy.

393
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,560
-I'm not.
-Mommy .

394
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,040
-I'm not your mother.
-Mommy.

395
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,680
Mommy.

396
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,000
Last night,

397
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,400
I heard you calling your mom
in your sleep.

398
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,280
The reason you refuse to reincarnate

399
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,440
is that you miss your mom, right?

400
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,920
I just

401
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,120
want to find my mom.

402
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,800
I want to meet my mom again.

403
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,640
WELCOME

404
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,160
Ball.

405
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,720
Wait for me here.
I'll come pick you up soon.

406
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,040
Let's get inside.

407
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,360
I'm sorry.

408
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,240
My mom told me she'd come pick me up

409
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,760
but she never returned.

410
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,280
I waited for her for ages

411
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,360
but I fell off the swing
and died before she returned.

412
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,360
She must have her own reasons.

413
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,640
I just want to ask her

414
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,000
why she didn't keep her promise.

415
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,480
Don't worry.

416
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,480
We'll find your mom.

417
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,480
Really?

418
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,560
Since we're acquainted now,

419
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,080
what should we call you?

420
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,920
My name's Ball.

421
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,360
-Ball.
-Yes .

422
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,720
Well,

423
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,320
we'll find your mom,

424
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,800
on the condition that
you leave my friend's body.

425
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,160
Sure.

426
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,320
Promise?

427
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Yes.

428
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,280
But…

429
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,320
But what?

430
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,720
I don't know how to leave this body.

431
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,800
I didn't mean to possess her.

432
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,800
What?

433
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,679
What's this?

434
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,840
It tastes weird.

435
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,840
What?

436
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,199
Gecko?

437
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,719
Gecko!

438
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,560
Don't come near me!

439
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,920
Don't come near me!

440
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,719
Look!

441
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
What's happening?

442
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,280
Did the ghost leave her body?

443
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,720
I think he went back to the orphanage.

444
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,440
Toop!

445
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,560
Toop-Hom.

446
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,240
How on earth can we find his mother?

447
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,600
Ball only told us

448
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,680
that his mom's name is Mali.

449
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,160
When we asked for his address,

450
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,360
he told us that
the main street has the best pork satay.

451
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,600
Let me see.

452
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,920
-Hey.
-What?

453
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,680
Here. I found it.

454
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,440
The list of the orphans

455
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,120
of Blessed Home Orphanage.

456
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,840
LIST OF THE ORPHANS
OF BLESSED HOME ORPHANAGE

457
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,680
Here! The name is Thanawat Kitcharoen.

458
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,440
Does it have the address?

459
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,240
Let me see.

460
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,520
Soi Prachasan 12.

461
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,960
House No.5.

462
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,680
Are you crazy?

463
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,320
I never had a child,
and my name isn't Mali!

464
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,560
My name is Mary!

465
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,040
Please calm down.

466
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,880
We're looking for a child's mother

467
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,640
and we got information
that the child lived here.

468
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,840
Mary! Do you secretly have a child?

469
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,400
What's wrong with you?

470
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,680
You're the douchebag
who got my daughter pregnant?

471
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,040
It's not me!

472
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
Let's get out of here!

473
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,040
You scumbags, nonsense!

474
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,280
Well,

475
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,520
I already asked around earlier

476
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,600
about that house.

477
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,000
They said that the house is being rented.

478
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,960
I think Ball's mom has already moved out.

479
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,800
Then what should we do next?

480
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,400
Hey. The orphanage manager is calling me.

481
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,440
Hello.

482
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,400
Yes.

483
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,000
Yes.

484
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,680
Thanks for calling.

485
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,800
How was it?

486
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,240
He said he only gives us a week.

487
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,280
If we can't make it on time,
he'll find someone else.

488
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,920
Do you see anything?

489
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,520
Grandpa, Grandma.

490
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,400
Are you here?

491
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,120
Hello.

492
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Grandpa,

493
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,400
Grandma, is there anyone here?

494
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,760
Grandpa, Grandma.

495
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,080
They're not here.

496
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,320
You must be a Thai Folk Dancer

497
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,440
that someone
offered to Grandpa and Grandma.

498
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,480
You saw a Thai Folk Dancer's ghost?

499
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,000
You can see me?

500
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,800
Well…

501
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,760
Well,

502
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,120
we're…

503
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,560
Well, we're looking

504
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,600
for the mother of the child-ghost
at the orphanage.

505
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,160
Since you're around here,
have you heard anything?

506
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,320
I see, you mean Ball?

507
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,480
You know him?

508
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,840
When he was still alive,

509
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,120
I saw a woman

510
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,320
secretly checking on her son every day.

511
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,920
Hey.

512
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,360
She said, "Ball's mother
used to check on him every day."

513
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,080
Then why didn't she pick him up?

514
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,320
I'm also wondering.

515
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
I thought eventually,

516
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,120
she would come pick up her son.

517
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,760
I saw her dressed beautifully in white.

518
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,120
Dressed in white?

519
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,600
Carrying a big doll?

520
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,360
And you haven't seen her after that?

521
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,560
I think so.

522
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,720
Have you seen a woman

523
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,560
with long hair around here?

524
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,520
There's a woman

525
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,840
who I clearly remember.

526
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,320
Over there.

527
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,360
She got hit by a car

528
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,920
and died on the spot.

529
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,880
Found it!

530
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
NEXT EPISODE

531
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,960
Excuse me.

532
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,240
Are you Ball's mother?

533
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,040
