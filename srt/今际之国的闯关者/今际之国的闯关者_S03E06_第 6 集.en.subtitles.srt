1
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,443
No one else is gonna die.

2
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,279
We'll make it out if we work together.

3
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,075
Let's all get to the exit.

4
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,494
Obviously.

5
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,291
Nobu, you'll be heading away
from the exit,

6
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,003
but can you return to C3
and meet up with Rei in C4?

7
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,673
The starting room has no point deduction,
so it's a safe bet.

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,515
Understood.

9
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,310
Usagi has the most points.

10
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,273
I have our baby's points as well.

11
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,319
Can you head west to A3?

12
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,864
It's a room that might have
a large point deduction.

13
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,827
Got it.

14
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,083
One of you will be forced to stay.

15
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:26,878
Stop it.

16
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,803
You all right?

17
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,304
I'll take over.

18
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,473
Thank you.

19
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,199
I'll stay.

20
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,493
Why?

21
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,872
I'm the oldest, so I'll stay.

22
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,709
Leave the dangerous work to an adult.

23
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,672
The future belongs to the youth.

24
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:22,559
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

25
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,352
Don't worry!

26
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,779
B4 is a minus-two-point room.

27
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,281
RYUJI: 6, YUNA: 11, ARISU: 3

28
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,951
Please select whose points to use.

29
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,578
Let's use my points here.

30
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,792
Point deduction confirmed.

31
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,721
A3 is a minus-eight-point room.

32
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,725
Please select whose points to use.

33
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,522
I will protect you.

34
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,195
Point deduction confirmed.

35
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,699
What about Tetsu?

36
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,751
Got it.

37
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,090
Tetsu!

38
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,139
Tetsu.

39
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,777
This is a minus-eight-point room.

40
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,571
We would've been history.

41
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,201
We can't pass through here again.

42
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,537
Eleventh turn.

43
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,622
Begin.

44
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,708
Let's get Sachiko out of there.

45
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,089
FORCED STAY

46
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:26,135
Usagi and Nobu need to stay put
to keep Sachiko's room between them.

47
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,223
But Nobu only has two points,
which will be reduced to zero

48
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,811
if he tries to meet up with Sachiko
after she's released.

49
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,191
Want me to meet up with Nobu in C3
and use my points?

50
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,275
No.

51
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,153
Even if you go to C3 to meet up with Nobu,

52
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,448
you'll never reach A5
with both of your points.

53
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,492
15TH TURN
MOVE -1

54
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,538
Rei, I want you to stay in C4
to save Sachiko.

55
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,124
Then meet up with Nobu there.

56
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,625
You got it.

57
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:03,131
If I'm in A2,
I can form a diagonal line with Rei in C4.

58
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,675
So our baby and I will go to A2.

59
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,804
But no one has entered A2 yet.

60
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,850
Our baby and I
still have seven points each.

61
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,437
We don't know whether A2
has a large point deduction.

62
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,107
No one can help you
if you're forced to stay in A2.

63
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,485
One mistake,
and we won't reach A5 in 15 turns.

64
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,449
Time's almost up.

65
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,367
What should we do?

66
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,455
How can we all make it home alive?

67
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,207
How?

68
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
There has to be a way.

69
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:49,302
We've battled many opponents.

70
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,101
I owe my life to all of you.

71
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,454
We've always found a way to survive.

72
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,158
The wristband.

73
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,080
Use the wristband.

74
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,790
What?

75
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,377
Put our baby's wristband in room A2.

76
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,673
The baby obviously can't wear it.

77
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,133
But it has functioned so far.

78
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,304
It should function
even without anyone accompanying it.

79
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,562
That's absurd.

80
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,733
What if the baby dies
while you're trying to save me?!

81
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,152
I realize that.

82
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,904
Even if we win,

83
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:36,284
Usagi might die if the baby's wristband
isn't retrieved and runs out of points!

84
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,289
What if there's a way to get it back?

85
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,623
How?

86
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,460
Entering the room defeats the purpose
of using the baby's wristband.

87
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,805
You shouldn't see this! Go with Rei!

88
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,473
Yuna, come back.

89
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,601
-Hurry!
-Yuna.

90
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:10,067
Rei's wristband didn't react when it was
outside while she leaned into this room.

91
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,489
Then I should be fine
as long as my wristband doesn't leave A3.

92
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,493
Only extend the other hand
to grab the wristband in A2.

93
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,872
Usagi, can you do it?

94
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,250
Yes.

95
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,254
Eight points will be deducted
when the wristband reenters A3.

96
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,424
Even if Usagi pulls it back from A2 to A3,

97
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,385
she and the baby
won't have enough points to survive.

98
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,524
YUNA ITSUKI: 11, RYOHEI ARISU: 6

99
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,161
Yuna.

100
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,998
I have a favor to ask.

101
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,546
Some of us won't survive without you.

102
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,551
Please save us.

103
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,225
Please.

104
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,207
Nobu, meet me in C4, okay?

105
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,333
Will do.

106
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:56,924
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

107
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,273
Forgive me.

108
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,651
I'll come get you, I promise.

109
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,713
B3 UNLOCKED

110
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,260
Room B3 has been unlocked.

111
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,892
Good.

112
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,608
A2 is a minus-five-point room.

113
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,321
Point deduction confirmed.

114
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,418
Twelfth turn. Begin.

115
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,386
Okay, let's get the wristband back.

116
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,763
Wait for me.

117
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:13,894
We'll open the door from our side.
Yuna will take the eight-point deduction.

118
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,189
She will?

119
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:22,903
Yes. And while I'm in there,
please get your baby's wristband.

120
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,447
Thank you.

121
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,032
There won't be much time.

122
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,827
We have to do it
before the doors close again.

123
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,245
How long?

124
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,456
The amount of time differs.

125
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,836
Doors stay open the longest
when there is someone in the doorway.

126
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,755
How many seconds max?

127
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,300
About ten seconds.

128
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,094
I can do it.

129
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,015
Okay, let's go with this plan.

130
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,225
Got it.

131
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,496
MOM, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

132
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,751
All right.

133
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,254
Ten seconds. I'll count.

134
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,346
I'm going in.

135
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,979
What happened?

136
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,440
Ten!

137
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,319
Nine!

138
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,616
Eight!

139
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,955
Seven!

140
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,625
Six!

141
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,588
Five!

142
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,924
Hurry!

143
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,594
Four!

144
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,602
Three!

145
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,986
Two!

146
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,280
This is a minus-eight-point room.

147
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,991
-Usagi!
-Point deduction confirmed.

148
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,314
Don't go!

149
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,609
Usagi!

150
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,820
One!

151
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,493
Jump!

152
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,353
Thank you.

153
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,336
Arisu…

154
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,881
what future did you see?

155
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,366
The players left in this room
will be forced to stay.

156
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,202
It's the last room.

157
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,634
Thank you.

158
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,227
STAY - RYUJI

159
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,479
Point deduction confirmed.

160
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,647
STAY - YUNA
STAY - ARISU

161
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,404
Fourteenth turn.

162
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,697
Begin.

163
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,476
It'll be okay, Yu.

164
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,895
Please wait here.

165
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,396
Yu…

166
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,614
You idiot!

167
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,922
How do you propose to fix this?

168
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,673
Please forgive me.

169
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,219
Bowing your head solves nothing!

170
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:23,972
Mom…

171
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,994
EXIT

172
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,087
Arisu.

173
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,965
What does this mean?

174
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,467
It said "exit" just now.

175
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,719
That's the last room, right?

176
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,055
What happens there?

177
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,398
Hold your wristband to the chosen door

178
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,942
and proceed to the next room.

179
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,492
Let's go.

180
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,341
Arisu.

181
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,676
Nobu.

182
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,428
What a relief.

183
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,184
15TH TURN

184
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,355
The last turn. We barely made it.

185
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,485
You have reached the exit room.

186
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:07,868
EXIT

187
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:54,790
Now that you have reached the exit,
it's time to roll one last time.

188
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,833
"Roll"?

189
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,387
Really?

190
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,145
I'll do it.

191
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,459
I take this fate

192
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,212
upon myself.

193
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,297
Arisu.

194
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:16,580
Seven players may now proceed to the exit.

195
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,134
"Seven."

196
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,761
One of us must stay.

197
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,822
Usagi.

198
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,909
I'll leave the rest to you.

199
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,535
Huh?

200
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,121
What do you mean?

201
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,331
You must live.

202
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,419
Along with everyone else.

203
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,007
One minute remaining.

204
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,301
-Please.
-Arisu.

205
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,929
-This is the future I saw.
-No.

206
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,597
-Absolutely not!
-Usagi.

207
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,849
-No! You can't!
-Please.

208
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,351
-No!
-Usagi!

209
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,435
-No way!
-Usagi!

210
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,229
No!

211
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,982
Everyone, please,
get her out of here alive.

212
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,150
No!

213
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,318
Don't!

214
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,694
Ryuji!

215
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,531
Ryuji, make sure
Usagi gets back to our world.

216
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,241
-No!
-Please.

217
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,993
-No!
-Thirty seconds remaining.

218
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,370
Everyone, hurry!

219
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,287
Arisu!

220
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,915
There's no time! Sachiko, hurry!

221
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,875
-Arisu, no!
-Hurry!

222
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,418
Arisu!

223
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,381
Ryuji, make sure
Usagi gets back to our world.

224
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,674
Promise me!

225
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,300
Ryuji, please.

226
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,303
Arisu!

227
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,723
No!

228
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,977
Arisu, wait!

229
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,563
Arisu!

230
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,276
No! Arisu!

231
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,351
Let's go to the world of death together.

232
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,984
Your wish will be granted

233
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,986
if you kill her.

234
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,199
You'll discover the true world of death

235
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,369
that lies beyond here.

236
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,684
What is he doing?

237
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,440
Usagi!

238
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,818
Hey! Ryuji!

239
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,778
Stop! Ryuji!

240
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,614
Hey! Don't do it, Ryuji!

241
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,990
What are you doing?

242
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,034
Usagi! Hey!

243
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,536
Ryuji!

244
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,913
Don't do it! Hey!

245
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,047
Don't! Hey!

246
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:36,965
No!

247
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,757
Congratulations.

248
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:25,805
You chose to remain in this room
so that others may live.

249
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,392
You have proven yourself
worthy of a future.

250
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,023
Whoever remains in this room
wins the game.

251
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:38,902
What?

252
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:02,986
Usagi!

253
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,948
Usagi!

254
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,517
Congratulations, Arisu.

255
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,908
You…

256
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:58,082
Your splendid victory earns you the right
to join our select group of citizens.

257
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,834
A citizen?

258
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,629
No way I'd join you!

259
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,798
Usagi, the rabbit you've been chasing,
will soon die.

260
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:11,012
So, Arisu, let's enjoy some more games
together in this land.

261
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,684
So I'm here to entertain you?

262
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,353
That's right.

263
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,939
You son of a bitch.

264
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,526
I knew it'd be difficult
to persuade you to come here.

265
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,113
So I used her as bait.

266
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,910
You played right into my hands.

267
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,246
Goddamn you!

268
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:45,922
Damn it!

269
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,975
-Are you all right?
-Arisu!

270
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,520
Ryuji!

271
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,065
Ryuji!

272
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,984
Grab on.

273
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,156
Sachiko!

274
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,533
Sachiko!

275
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,205
Yuna!

276
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,625
-You got this?
-Huh?

277
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:49,962
Usagi!

278
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,097
-Arisu!
-Arisu!

279
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,308
Get inside, quick!

280
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,395
Usagi!

281
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,275
Usagi!

282
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,446
Arisu!

283
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,243
Usagi!

284
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,611
Usagi!

285
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,294
It's over.

286
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,756
Wait a sec.

287
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,968
You can see me?

288
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,116
Damn you.

289
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,384
Arisu?

290
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,428
Arisu.

291
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,015
Arisu!

292
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,058
Bring Usagi back with you!

293
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,810
Arisu!

294
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,270
Very impressive, Arisu.

295
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,531
Ready to become a citizen?

296
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,786
Ask all you want,

297
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,414
but I'll never become a citizen.

298
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,337
You disappoint me.

299
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,802
Goodbye, Arisu.

300
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,986
It seems he wasn't
quite ready for this role.

301
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,584
Are you the Joker?

302
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,421
Who is the Joker, you ask?

303
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,715
A god, perhaps?

304
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,926
Or… is it me?

305
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,140
Let's play one last game.

306
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,187
Take a seat.

307
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,380
Choose one of these cards.

308
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,675
Your choice will seal your fate.

309
00:41:55,387 --> 00:42:00,100
I win if you draw the Joker.

310
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:04,730
Your fate will be in my hands.

311
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:58,909
Your fate now belongs to me.

312
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,913
They're both Jokers, aren't they?

313
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,421
Imagine that.

314
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,382
Cut the crap.

315
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,509
You cheated.

316
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,011
Listen.

317
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,849
A deck of cards
consists of four suits with 13 cards each.

318
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,562
Add them up, and you get 364.

319
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:31,400
Add a Joker, and it's 365.

320
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:35,863
That's right, the same number of days
as a year in the mortal realm.

321
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,161
Add another Joker, and it's 366.

322
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,121
A leap year.

323
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:52,880
They are indispensable cards tied to
the nature of time in the mortal realm.

324
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,302
They're jesters that fill
the gaps between cards,

325
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,137
the gaps in time,

326
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:05,225
and the gap between life and death.

327
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,480
Is that you?

328
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,231
The Joker

329
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,525
isn't a person.

330
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:20,824
It's neither the ruler of this world
nor the master of these games.

331
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,451
It's simply

332
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,536
a card.

333
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,753
You're an intriguing character.

334
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,674
I imagine it was no coincidence

335
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,094
that the two cards
that could seal your fate were Jokers.

336
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:47,142
Your fate is now mine to do as I please.

337
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,230
But…

338
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,900
I give thanks for that coincidence

339
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,278
by granting you the freedom to choose.

340
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,579
Behold.

341
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,624
That is death.

342
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:45,826
That vortex pulls you in, and you die.

343
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,921
In the other direction is life.

344
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,553
Life is hard, with countless ordeals.

345
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:10,851
But death comes easily
if you cast yourself into the flow.

346
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,147
Which will you choose?

347
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,526
Everyone eventually comes here.

348
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:24,531
It's the world between life and death.

349
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,160
Even if you return
to the world of the living,

350
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,332
you'll inevitably return here
within a few decades.

351
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,501
Ultimately,

352
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,046
all roads lead to death.

353
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:46,345
Do you still wish to return to your world,
even if it means pain and anguish?

354
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,893
Even if you return,

355
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:58,649
the woman and child you seek
may no longer be there.

356
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,402
Entering the world of death is easy.

357
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,907
Simply cast yourself into that vortex.

358
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,537
It's emptier than you imagine.

359
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,667
No suffering, no sadness.

360
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,419
No joy either.

361
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,721
Why are you here?

362
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:36,979
I'm no more than a watchman

363
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:40,148
watching over the rift
between life and death.

364
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,277
Everyone dies.

365
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,365
I merely keep watch here

366
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,786
so that I don't have to
pass through death's door.

367
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,165
You encourage others to die,

368
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,168
yet you're afraid of death?

369
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,965
Perhaps.

370
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,177
That's why you asked me?

371
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:15,642
I wanted to hear from someone
who survived many brushes with death.

372
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,693
Countless others will be arriving soon.

373
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,487
"Countless others"?

374
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,160
What's happening?

375
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,580
Who knows?

376
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:43,003
But it's bigger than
what brought you all here the last time.

377
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,174
Are many people going to die?

378
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,719
That's none of my concern.

379
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,032
Now, make your choice!

380
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,624
I'll take Usagi back to our world.

381
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,381
Usagi?

382
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,015
Usagi!

383
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,600
Well?

384
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:41,979
Now what?

385
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,868
You really are an intriguing character.

386
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,058
Usagi!

387
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:34,781
Arisu!

388
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:36,867
Usagi!

389
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,207
Let's go together!

390
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,460
Arisu!

391
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,671
Hey, Ryuji!

392
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,271
Let's go to the world of death together.

393
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,272
What?

394
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,816
No! Ryuji!

395
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,403
Usagi!

396
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,490
Ryuji! No!

397
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,413
Hey! Ryuji!

398
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:51,817
Arisu!

399
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,486
Arisu!

400
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,326
Usagi!

401
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:05,831
Usagi!

402
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,668
Arisu!

403
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,419
Arisu!

404
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,380
Usagi!

405
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,403
Arisu!

406
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,572
Arisu!

407
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,867
Arisu!

408
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,037
Ryuji, make sure
Usagi gets back to our world.

409
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,581
Promise me!

410
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,669
You must live, together.

411
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,469
Ryuji!

412
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,381
Yuzuha.

413
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,442
Yuzuha.

414
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,611
Dad.

415
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,803
I…

416
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,516
missed you so much.

417
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,398
I was

418
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,193
so happy.

419
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,656
Dad…

420
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,503
That's why I want

421
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,672
you to be happy too.

422
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,007
Arisu!

423
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,338
Arisu.

424
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,030
How long has it been?

425
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,659
Two minutes.

426
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,579
You barely made it.

427
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,375
You were seconds away from death.

428
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,712
What about Usagi?

429
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,505
What happened to her?

430
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,302
You should know better than anyone.

431
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:00,680
I gotta go.

432
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:03,725
I'm fine.

433
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,861
Thank you, Ann.

434
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,185
Usagi?

435
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,460
What a relief.

436
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,304
I'm hungry.

437
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:35,775
Arisu…

438
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,365
The baby will be born in summer, so…

439
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,117
It will be summer, so…

440
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,952
-Natsumi?
-"Natsumi"?

441
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,205
The kanji for "summer" and "beautiful."

442
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,373
"Beautiful."

443
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,167
RINKA, NATSUKI, KANADE, KOHARU, NATSUMI

444
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,212
What else is there?

445
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,923
How about this?

446
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,300
-Hiiro?
-Yeah.

447
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,052
That one's good too.

448
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:50,141
You keep saying that,
but it's time to narrow it down.

449
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:54,270
We'll never decide
if we keep writing down the ones you like.

450
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,315
What else is there?

451
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:03,112
Whatever you like is fine.

452
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,447
There it is.

453
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,991
So you'll be a lazy father?

454
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,409
No.

455
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,369
I am thinking about it,

456
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:17,293
but it feels like our names
shape our destiny, so I just can't choose.

457
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,171
You should be the one to--

458
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:22,423
No way! We'll decide together.

459
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,094
-I'm gonna be late!
-Huh?

460
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,095
I gotta go.

461
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,641
Hey, don't run away.

462
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:38,564
I'd never do that. I won't ever leave you.

463
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,401
I know.

464
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,657
So narrow it down to one name by tonight.

465
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,076
-What?
-We'll do the final vote tonight.

466
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,994
Now off you go.

467
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,080
See you later.

468
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,308
Thanks for coming.

469
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,395
I graduated, thanks to you, Mom.

470
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,480
That's not true.

471
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,400
Now it's my turn.

472
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:23,776
What?

473
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,613
It's my turn to make you happy.

474
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,451
It's game on.

475
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:36,122
-I was thinking…
-Yeah?

476
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,583
-Let's visit his grave together.
-Really?

477
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:42,295
Yeah, it's about time
I introduce you to my brother,

478
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,088
like, "This is my boyfriend."

479
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:45,339
-I see.
-Yeah.

480
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,551
-Then I better start thinking.
-About what?

481
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,387
-What to wear and say.
-It doesn't matter.

482
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,597
Just in case.

483
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,391
-So what will you wear?
-I don't know.

484
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:56,642
-A suit or…
-A suit?

485
01:04:56,726 --> 01:05:01,689
Don't forget your phone in the bathroom.
You start middle school, so act like it.

486
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:02,732
I know.

487
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,735
Seriously, where'd you get that from?

488
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:07,486
It could only be you, Mom.

489
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:09,280
What?

490
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:12,575
You're right.

491
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,328
I read your letter.

492
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,623
Thanks for watching it, Mom.

493
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:22,752
Yeah, I'll be working
on an anime again soon.

494
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:27,298
Yeah, this time it's for a movie.

495
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:30,134
See it with Dad when it comes out.

496
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,469
Okay.

497
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,890
ARISU

498
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,896
Thank you. Would you like to
schedule your next appointment?

499
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:45,608
Do you have any openings in mid-May?

500
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,234
One moment, please.

501
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:52,490
What makes you feel
like life is worth living?

502
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,450
"Worth living"?

503
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,292
I guess it's when I do karate.

504
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,586
Didn't you stop for a while?

505
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,923
I started teaching
at my dad's karate school.

506
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,510
The kids are so eager to practice.

507
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:16,138
Seeing that makes me so happy.

508
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,814
Do you ever have flashbacks?

509
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,693
I'm able to sleep better now.

510
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:30,945
I'm used to my job too.

511
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:32,697
That's good.

512
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:38,119
You said you've been thinking a lot
about the meaning of life.

513
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,749
I think, "Why am I alive?"

514
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:53,467
Maybe it's to work hard
so the hat shop won't go under.

515
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:06,564
What makes you feel
like life is worth living?

516
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:10,484
When everyone recognizes me
as an influencer, of course.

517
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:16,490
This is how I'll spread my wings
in this world.

518
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,123
I like your spirit.

519
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:32,048
What makes you feel
like life is worth living?

520
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:38,554
There was a time when I felt like
I shouldn't have gotten a second chance.

521
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:44,894
But maybe that's the point,
and I have to prove I can do better.

522
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,023
Now,

523
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,568
I work hard for the sake of my rug rat.

524
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:58,657
"Worth living"?

525
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:05,706
Good question.

526
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,137
Even if you don't know the answer,

527
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,556
it's not so bad, is it?

528
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,600
Life, I mean.

529
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,645
That's true.

530
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:31,941
How about you?

531
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:37,571
What makes you feel
like life is worth living?

532
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:39,490
Me?

533
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:42,910
Let me think.

534
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,705
Right now, it's…

535
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:51,043
when I'm thinking of names for my kid.

536
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:54,839
I see.

537
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,857
-I'll leave it here.
-Thanks.

538
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:24,869
Feel that?

539
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,078
Another earthquake?

540
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,594
It stopped, right?

541
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:42,553
Yep.

542
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:45,514
-That was a big one the other day.
-Yeah.

543
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,224
There have been a lot lately.

544
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:48,601
There have.

545
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,935
Let's check the news.

546
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:54,106
The Japan Meteorological Agency
says the epicenter

547
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:57,568
was off the southeast coast of Chiba,
at a depth of 61 km.

548
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,613
No tsunami warnings have been issued.

549
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:06,452
An earthquake with an intensity of 5 Lower
was recently recorded in the Kanto region.

550
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:12,499
The quake was also recorded in California,
among other locations worldwide.

551
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,963
Experts believe this could be
a sign of global tectonic activity…
