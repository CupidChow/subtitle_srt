1
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,698
Ryohei,
don't be late for your interview today.

2
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,079
Are killing games that much fun?

3
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,043
13 MINUTES EARLIER

4
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,683
There's still no game.

5
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,270
Has it been an hour yet?

6
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,982
They must have forgotten
to push the start button.

7
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,944
And what about
the explanation of the rules?

8
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,709
What's wrong?

9
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,756
I can hear something.

10
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,784
Those are cars from the Beach.

11
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,523
It's you guys.

12
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,109
What are you doing here?

13
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,485
We saw the blimps.

14
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,655
And we heard rumors that
the next stage was starting.

15
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,157
Well…

16
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,367
Actually…

17
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,626
A rifle.

18
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,210
Get out of here!

19
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,462
Hide behind the cars!

20
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,589
It's an anti-tank rifle.

21
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,677
Hiding behind a car is pointless.

22
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,012
Holy shit!

23
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,096
Oh, fuck!

24
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,891
Run!

25
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,563
Has the game started?

26
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,522
I don't know.

27
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,815
Did they explain the rules?

28
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,235
There aren't rules! It's just mass murder!

29
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,448
That rifle can fire from a kilometer away.

30
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,869
I've heard the sound of that gun before.

31
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,330
Now they're using an assault rifle.

32
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,998
We don't know how many there are.

33
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,875
Other players are arriving too!

34
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,961
There could be multiple shooters.

35
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,838
Look how many people still survived!

36
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,006
Run!

37
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,634
They're coming this way.

38
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,469
We have to go!

39
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,804
Seriously?

40
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,602
Let's go!

41
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,355
Arisu!

42
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,691
This is fucked up!

43
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,818
Split up and run!

44
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,161
Arisu, over here!

45
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,608
Crap!

46
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,321
-Shit.
-Skipped your interview again?

47
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,616
If only we could reset reality.

48
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,707
Arisu!

49
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,983
You'll die if you don't stay focused!

50
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,154
Where the fuck are they shooting from?

51
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,580
The King of Spades.

52
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,900
Here you go. A good luck charm.

53
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,403
What's this? A bomb?

54
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,364
Use it when you're in a pinch.

55
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,493
Arisu, we can make it now!

56
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:58,913
Let's go!

57
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,585
-Arisu!
-He's still alive!

58
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,005
Hey! Stay awake!

59
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,726
The King of Spades…

60
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,023
Hurry!

61
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,275
Stay awake!

62
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,818
Stand up!

63
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,957
You okay?

64
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,507
Are you guys hurt?

65
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,220
It's no good! Run!

66
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,225
The King of Spades…

67
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,811
He's alone?

68
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,232
We're screwed here!

69
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,900
We'll get shot if we run!

70
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,370
Get in!

71
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,371
Tatta!

72
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,081
-Hurry up and get in!
-Ann!

73
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,298
Run, would you?

74
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,468
Shit! Drive!

75
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,594
Step on it!

76
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,138
Chishiya!

77
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,239
Yes! We lost them!

78
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,158
You think Chishiya's okay?

79
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,701
He'll be fine on his own.

80
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,203
What's with this game?

81
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,622
What are the rules?
We didn't even register for it!

82
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,749
Maybe we have to defeat the enemies.

83
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,959
-How many?
-Probably just one.

84
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,171
The King of Spades alone.

85
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,216
It's a battle of strength.
He's the toughest last boss.

86
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,761
That blimp was on the move
while he was firing.

87
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,181
The game arena could be this whole city.

88
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,642
How can we fight
when we've got no weapons?

89
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,436
This next stage
is even tougher than the last.

90
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,605
The next stage…

91
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,819
Let's have some fun together!

92
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,655
Who the heck is Mira anyway?
Is she even human?

93
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,240
I don't know.

94
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,077
But one thing is for sure,
she's involved in making these games.

95
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,496
Mira? She's behind the games?

96
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,998
If that guy earlier
was the King of Spades,

97
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,335
then there must be a game master
for each face card.

98
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,214
Once all of them are defeated,
the next stage is cleared.

99
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,466
Once we do that…

100
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,717
What will happen?

101
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,010
We can go back?

102
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,265
I don't know.

103
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,267
But it's the only way to survive.

104
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,068
Hey, where the heck are we going?

105
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,029
What? I'm just following
that car up ahead.

106
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,073
What? Is that even a good idea?

107
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,408
Where are we supposed to go?

108
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,661
Quit arguing!
At least we got away from that game.

109
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,455
That was no damn game!

110
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,666
Hey, maybe we can just keep running.

111
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,334
We'd never win that game.

112
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,421
That's a good idea.
We've still got lots of time on our visas.

113
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:39,133
Good point.
Someone else can clear the game for us.

114
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,849
What the fuck?

115
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,110
Just because
all the face card games are cleared

116
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,446
doesn't mean we can go back.

117
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,073
You still believe Hatter's bullshit?

118
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,578
But the next stage started
after we got all 40 cards.

119
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,707
One day,
we all just ended up in this world.

120
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,876
When we cleared games,

121
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,504
we got days added to our visa
depending on the card number.

122
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,755
That's how we can stay alive.

123
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,258
When our visa runs out,
we're killed by that laser.

124
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,888
As Hatter said, we can go home
when we get all the cards.

125
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,641
It seems like a natural rule.

126
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,185
You just want to believe that's true.

127
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,480
All the games we've played
have stuck to their rules.

128
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,651
Even though they're absurd,
they followed simple rules.

129
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,621
It's the guys from the Beach.

130
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,584
Tatta, get away from him!

131
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,919
Hold on!

132
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,836
Tatta!

133
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,650
Tatta! Get us out of here!

134
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,734
-How?
-Tatta!

135
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,323
Let me drive.

136
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,950
-What?
-Now!

137
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,785
-Are you insane?
-Out of the way!

138
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,120
Ann, you sure about this?

139
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,456
Hold on tight!

140
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,966
We pulled away!

141
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,134
-Yes!
-Way to go, Ann!

142
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,806
He's back!

143
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,833
Hey, Ann! Why are you driving here?

144
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,060
You all right?

145
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,519
I twisted my neck.

146
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,354
My nails are broken.

147
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,773
He's coming back!

148
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,595
I can't take it anymore. I can't!

149
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,639
You'll get killed here. Let's go.

150
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,809
Even if I fight,
I'll just have to play another game!

151
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,310
I can't take it anymore!

152
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,104
I don't hear gunshots anymore.
He must be pretty far away.

153
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,108
-Let's stay here for a while.
-Yeah.

154
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,319
I sure hope Chishiya and Ann are okay.

155
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,613
Those two will be just fine.

156
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,157
They're super smart.

157
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,658
That's for sure.

158
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,118
At any rate,

159
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,080
let's gather what we need
so that we can survive the night.

160
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,707
Okay.

161
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,335
Dang, I could fall asleep here.

162
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,922
But who knows
when the King of Spades will come.

163
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,466
Why don't we find some food?

164
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,137
I'll go get us a car.

165
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,181
You come with me.

166
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,849
What? Why?

167
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,684
I know a good place near here.

168
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,686
Oh, all right.

169
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,193
Okay, you two. Get us some good food.

170
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,861
-Will do.
-Here.

171
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,196
Thanks.

172
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,448
-Okay, let's go.
-What are you doing?

173
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,284
Don't whine. I know you've never had
a hot babe on your arm.

174
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,285
Come on.

175
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,411
So what if I haven't?

176
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,880
This is the place. Cool, isn't it?

177
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,133
You're right.
There are a ton of old cars here.

178
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,552
They're called "classic cars."

179
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,887
Who cares what they're called.

180
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,895
Whoa! Holy shit!

181
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,856
This is freaking awesome!

182
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,524
What a perfect body!

183
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,945
Quit touching it!
Are you some kind of molester?

184
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,739
Damn! These body lines are incredible!

185
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,907
What a creep.

186
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:51,458
I bet the rich were hurt the most
when they were sent to this world.

187
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:56,088
They worked so hard to make money,
but now it's all worthless.

188
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,340
Good point.

189
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,550
This was probably good for me.

190
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,220
I got out of paying all my back rent.

191
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,974
Me too.
I was released from credit card hell.

192
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:13,855
But…

193
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,487
I'd still like to go back
even with all that debt.

194
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,118
That's true.

195
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,190
YAKISOBA KORE! BAN
SHORTCAKE FLAVOR

196
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,279
Shortcake-flavored yakisoba!

197
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,574
I saw the TV ad for this!

198
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,533
Me too!

199
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,161
Are you guys nuts?

200
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,121
Have those weird flavors
ever been any good?

201
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,707
This one might be.

202
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,127
No wonder you're a virgin.

203
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,254
What's that got to do with this?

204
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,132
-You'd better eat the whole thing!
-I will!

205
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,717
-Swear it!
-Don't worry. I will.

206
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,177
-You promised.
-Arisu will too.

207
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,261
I'll give it a try.

208
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,940
I wonder if I can finish one.

209
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,046
Welcome!

210
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,386
I like hearing that. It's been a while.

211
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,722
Here.

212
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,895
Is this any good?

213
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,064
Yeah… I'm pretty sure.

214
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,320
How many chopsticks would you like?

215
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,156
Four, please.

216
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,407
Certainly.

217
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,080
Thank you. Please come again.

218
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,708
You know,
your voice sounds an octave higher.

219
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,710
Makes you eager to return, right?

220
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,132
I bet a lot of guys would come to see you.

221
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:46,967
Because you're pretty.

222
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,385
What?

223
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,469
What?

224
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,890
Did you blush?

225
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,308
No.

226
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,018
I'm used to hearing that.

227
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,562
Really?

228
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,030
I wish I could have worked
at a convenience store.

229
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,032
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

230
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,077
I want to scan the barcodes.

231
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,582
You know those expert cashiers
who are very quick?

232
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,417
I admire them.

233
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,046
I'd like to go back.

234
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:32,554
I'd eat a steaming hot bowl of yakisoba
in a shop with the AC blasting

235
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,348
while reading the latest manga.

236
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,528
Cut that out.

237
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,740
Quit leering at that. You look creepy.

238
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,366
I can't help it.

239
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,661
-Just look at this, would you?
-What?

240
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,831
Look at her expression… and her boobs!

241
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,458
They're awesome!

242
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,210
That's a manga magazine.

243
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,378
The mangas are the main part,
not the pin-up girls.

244
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,964
-No, they aren't!
-Hey, hey. Let me see!

245
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,260
-See? Nice, aren't they?
-You choking on your food?

246
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,471
-Quit sounding like that.
-Karube. Look.

247
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,723
-Just look. Here. See?
-Arisu.

248
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,268
Keep doing that stuff,
and his virginity will rub off on you.

249
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,979
-Hey! Cut that out!
-Don't give it to me!

250
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,232
-You can't get it from me!
-Oh no! You've got it now!

251
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,275
Wait! I'm already a virgin!

252
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,785
Those were the best of times.

253
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,334
Usagi…

254
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,631
Let's go back for sure.

255
00:25:59,057 --> 00:25:59,891
What's wrong?

256
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,990
KENICHIRO SHIBASAKI ATTEMPTS SUICIDE
OVER FALSE ARTICLE

257
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,533
OKITA ARRESTED FOR COCAINE POSSESSION

258
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,536
Father?

259
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,669
-Mr. Usagi?
-You're Shigenori Usagi, right?

260
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,090
A famous Japanese male mountaineer
has gone missing

261
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:38,346
while climbing Mt. Tanigawa on the border
of Gunma and Niigata Prefectures.

262
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,601
According to authorities,
the missing man is Shigenori Usagi,

263
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,564
who has climbed Mt. Everest
and works as a mountaineering guide.

264
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,524
…but they still have
yet to find any leads.

265
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,694
Shigenori Usagi appears to have
had a mishap while climbing Mt. Tanigawa,

266
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:57,115
and though the search for him continues,
no useful leads…

267
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,116
Usagi?

268
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,372
What's wrong?

269
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,503
Arisu…

270
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,467
Was your life before that much fun?

271
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,053
What?

272
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,225
Before coming here,

273
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,148
my father died.

274
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,364
My father…

275
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,411
was called a liar by everyone.

276
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,790
He'd been driven to the edge.

277
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,213
He went to the mountains

278
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,549
and never came back.

279
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,433
He was a mountaineer,

280
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,357
but it wasn't a very high mountain…

281
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,945
so I never thought he could die there.

282
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,281
But…

283
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,993
I've learned something
living in this world.

284
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,582
I think my father…

285
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,546
also wanted…

286
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,218
to live in a different world.

287
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,932
His way of thinking…

288
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:52,897
Now…

289
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,651
I can understand it well.

290
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,656
Even now…

291
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,203
I'd hate that world if I went back.

292
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,005
I'm sorry.

293
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,760
I know everyone
is trying so hard to go back.

294
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,937
Usagi.

295
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,483
I understand that feeling too.

296
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,402
I really do.

297
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,826
I also thought that
the world was a bunch of crap.

298
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,871
But not anymore.

299
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,415
Now…

300
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,585
I want to go back to that world…

301
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,547
and start over again.

302
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,682
I'll protect you, Usagi,
even if it costs my life.

303
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,269
So let's go back together.

304
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:27,700
I'm sorry…

305
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,790
Everyone says…

306
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,126
they understand how I feel.

307
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,964
They tell me to
forget the past and cheer up.

308
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,348
But there's no way
people can understand it so easily.

309
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,018
I mean…

310
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,565
I can't see into your heart, Arisu.

311
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,489
I don't want you to
feel like you understand me.

312
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,410
It's just that…

313
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,166
when I'm asked if I want to go back…

314
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,795
I…

315
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,596
I think this place might be better.

316
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,434
But if you stay here, you'll never…

317
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,865
Let's go back.

318
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,076
They'll be waiting.

319
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,034
Arisu! Usagi! Hop in!

320
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,411
We're way too exposed like this.

321
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,996
It's the only one that runs.

322
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,499
Liar! You just fell in love with it.

323
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,001
You said it had a "sexy body."
God, that's weird!

324
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,170
I said "perfect body"!

325
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,463
What a creep!

326
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,840
"Creep"? How can you call me a creep?

327
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:51,928
Hop in.

328
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,228
Arisu.

329
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,688
Yeah.

330
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,880
The King of Spades is getting closer.

331
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,217
The whole city is his Game Arena.

332
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,724
Then we'll just have to
keep running from him.

333
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,687
There's one way
to keep from being attacked.

334
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:26,898
What is it?

335
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,817
Participate in another game.

336
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:31,819
What?

337
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,615
If I were one of them,

338
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,160
I would never interfere
in the others' games.

339
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,288
The bare minimum of manners among enemies.

340
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,125
They never interfere in other games.

341
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:51,380
All the games have
strict rules that they follow.

342
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:56,677
If games intruded on each other,
they would break down.

343
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,513
But…

344
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,432
I don't want to join any games.

345
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,645
Either way, the King of Spades
has forced us to join this one.

346
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,314
If we keep hiding like this,

347
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,609
either we'll eventually get found
and killed by the King of Spades

348
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,402
or our visas will run out.

349
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,990
Since they're the people
who make the games,

350
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,702
we might be able to find out
what this world is

351
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,038
or why we have to play these games.

352
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,500
I want to know why…

353
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,420
all these people have had to die.

354
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,767
Let's vote on it.

355
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,437
I'm with Arisu.

356
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,112
Okay. I am too.

357
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,115
What about you, Usagi?

358
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,370
Majority rules, right?

359
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,581
You've already got your answer.

360
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,878
If that's the case, where will we go?

361
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,469
Of all the cards I can see,
this one's the farthest away.

362
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,722
How about the King of Clubs?

363
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,766
Hold on! We're starting with a king?

364
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,103
A king probably has better information.

365
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,189
You've sure got guts.

366
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,568
What's more, club games require teamwork.

367
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,279
So we've got a chance of winning.

368
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,907
With us on the same team.

369
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,241
That's for sure!

370
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,993
I'm not so sure about you.

371
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:44,911
Hey!

372
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,071
Look.

373
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,157
NO WEAPONS ALLOWED

374
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,296
NO WEAPONS ALLOWED

375
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,925
PARTICIPANTS: 5
PUT ON A BRACELET AND WAIT

376
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,636
It says there are five participants.

377
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,805
But there are only four.

378
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,809
At last, we've got five people.

379
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,232
Niragi…

380
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,692
It's been a while.

381
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,365
You mean… you're alive?

382
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,329
I can't be on a team with that jerk!

383
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,748
We'll never clear this game.

384
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,835
He'll never cooperate with us.

385
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,837
This isn't coming off.

386
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,301
And my only goal is to enjoy these games.

387
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,180
If you don't want
to play this game with me,

388
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,182
then you can just fuck off.

389
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,438
Usagi?

390
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,483
Who cares what his goal is?

391
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,619
If we don't take part in a game,
we'll eventually die anyway.

392
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,580
In that case…

393
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,418
I've already made up my mind
to fight and survive.

394
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,841
Me too.

395
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,430
I want some answers.

396
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,324
You idiots.

397
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,285
Don't blame me for what will happen.

398
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,251
Don't hold us back.

399
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,379
Teamwork is key in this game.

400
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,509
I wouldn't be so sure
who will be holding who back.

401
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,394
Registration is complete.

402
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,313
Proceed to the Game Arena.

403
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,339
What is this place?

404
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,972
The King of Clubs team has arrived.

405
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,371
Welcome…

406
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,124
to our Game Arena.

407
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,836
I'm the King of Clubs…

408
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,256
Kyuma.

409
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,230
Okay.

410
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,984
I'll introduce the other members.
Starting over there, that's Shitara.

411
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,030
Uta.

412
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,241
Maki.

413
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,035
Goken.

414
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,498
Nice to meet you.

415
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,170
Why are you guys so quiet?

416
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,464
You're freaking them out.

417
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,924
Put on some pants, would you?

418
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,218
What? Why?

419
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,887
Nudists have been around for centuries.

420
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,973
It's a perfectly legit lifestyle.

421
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,935
Wearing clothes is a social construct.

422
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,771
But there's no biological need for them.

423
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:32,985
Living life in our natural state
is humanity's true form.

424
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,988
What is this dude's problem?

425
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,533
This is the King of Clubs?

426
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,869
He's lost his marbles.

427
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,663
Never mind that.

428
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,790
Who the heck are you people?

429
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,378
Who are we?

430
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,715
We're the citizens of this country.

431
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,427
The "citizens"?

432
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,013
That's right. The citizens.

433
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:53,936
