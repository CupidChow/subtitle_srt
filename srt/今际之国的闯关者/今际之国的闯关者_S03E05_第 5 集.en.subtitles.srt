1
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,143
Huh?

2
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,131
It's a monitor.

3
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,793
This is CGI, right?

4
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,336
"CGI"?

5
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,088
Really?

6
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,349
-Missed you.
-Same here.

7
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,684
-I picked this up.
-Thanks.

8
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,562
I'm so hungry.

9
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,285
Usagi?

10
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,038
Arisu.

11
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,136
At last,

12
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,763
I found you.

13
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,475
I'm sorry.

14
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,694
Let's go home.

15
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,365
Yeah.

16
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,909
Ouch.

17
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,911
Sorry.

18
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,870
You…

19
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,081
-Hey!
-Ryuji!

20
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,501
Why are you with Usagi?
She's dead because of you!

21
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,877
You son of a bitch!

22
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,170
Stop, Arisu!

23
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,213
-Arisu!
-Ryuji?

24
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,215
Ryuji, are you all right?

25
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,509
Okay, there you go.

26
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,515
-He's been fighting alongside me.
-Usagi…

27
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,810
I made it this far, thanks to him.

28
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,063
-Still--
-He saved my life.

29
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,358
I'm with you now, thanks to him.

30
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,162
Entry is now closed.

31
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,250
There are ten players.

32
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,044
"Ten players"?

33
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,131
There are only nine here.

34
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,133
I don't get it.

35
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,760
A child.

36
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,262
What?

37
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,266
There's a child.

38
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,358
You're pregnant, Usagi.

39
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,614
We're having a baby?

40
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,034
Yes, a baby.

41
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,540
I get it.

42
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,918
The baby in her belly makes it ten.

43
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,212
Congrats!

44
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,049
But a child in this situation is…

45
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,560
The game will now commence.

46
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,604
It's starting.

47
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,149
Please put on the wristbands and collars.

48
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,708
The game is Future Sugoroku.

49
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,132
Here are the rules.

50
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:59,932
There are a total of 25 rooms
arranged in five rows and five columns.

51
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,521
Roll the dice on the platform
in the center of each room.

52
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,859
The numbers you roll determine
how many people can advance to each room.

53
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:16,073
Repeat this as you try to reach
the exit room within 15 turns.

54
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,409
EXIT

55
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:24,540
However, if there are more people
than the numbers rolled,

56
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,960
the excess individuals
cannot leave the room.

57
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,464
The doors will be locked,
forcing them to stay.

58
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,507
FORCED STAY

59
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,137
To unlock the room,
use the transceiver on the wristband

60
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,142
to coordinate and position players
on opposite sides of the locked room.

61
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,520
UNLOCKED

62
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,483
You have each been allocated 15 points.

63
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,488
To pass through a door,

64
00:10:55,571 --> 00:11:01,369
one of you must use one point
by holding your wristband up to it.

65
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,417
To return to the previous room,
you must stay where you are for one turn.

66
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,504
The door will only be unlocked after that.

67
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,842
Whether you choose to
or are forced to stay,

68
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,054
one point will be used each turn.

69
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,683
It's game over if you run out of points.

70
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:34,944
The walls through which you can proceed
will display images of your future.

71
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,947
The one that you choose

72
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,119
is the future
that will come to pass once you exit.

73
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,125
"The future that will come to pass."

74
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:56,632
THE FUTURE THAT WILL COME TO PASS

75
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,219
Proceed according to the dice rolls

76
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:04,598
and choose your future
as you search for the exit.

77
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,145
So we need to work together
to find the exit?

78
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,985
May I ask your names?

79
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,909
I'm Sohta, and this is my sister--

80
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,994
I'm Yuna.

81
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,912
I'm Arisu.

82
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:34,628
This is Sachiko, Rei, Tetsu, and Nobu.

83
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:41,635
Now roll the dice,
and then choose which room to enter.

84
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,138
You have three minutes.

85
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,033
So the dice colors
correspond to the doors.

86
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,076
Okay!

87
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,662
Dice are my specialty.

88
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,248
Because you're a gambling addict?

89
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,419
First turn. Begin.

90
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,092
Okay.

91
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,084
Is this really the future?

92
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,463
Is this for real?

93
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,641
-Here it comes!
-You won again?

94
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,644
Bonus mode!

95
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,107
We give thanks for this meal.

96
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,483
What?

97
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,860
Really?

98
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,118
The future is different on each wall.

99
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,161
Goddamn machine!

100
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,125
Shit!

101
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,673
Your future changes depending on the door?

102
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,556
Please.

103
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,644
Matsuyama, it's time
to study something else.

104
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,064
Please, just a glance.
Please read it, Professor.

105
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,317
It'll all be for nothing if I quit now.

106
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:12,328
The Academy isn't going to
waste their time reading this nonsense.

107
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,539
Please read it, at least.

108
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,752
You should submit that
to occult magazines.

109
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,730
Okay, smile.

110
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,814
Smile.

111
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,817
Nice day, huh?

112
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,111
Yeah, feels great.

113
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,406
If I have my choice of futures,

114
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,825
I'll pick the blue door.

115
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,328
Me too.

116
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,832
But only seven people
can go through the blue door.

117
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,877
One person for the yellow door?

118
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,507
-All right!
-Nice shot, Hida!

119
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,925
Nice!

120
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,719
I prefer yellow.

121
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:17,977
No, the key to this game is minimizing
point loss as we make our way through.

122
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,855
So we should move together
whenever possible.

123
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:29,196
We should split into two groups
of the largest numbers, seven and five.

124
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,702
Sohta and Yuna,
would you go to room D3 with Rei?

125
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,705
You three…

126
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,210
will go to the room to the east, D3.

127
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,296
We'll go to the room to the north, C2.

128
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,843
Based on the diagram,
we can quickly regroup in D2.

129
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,886
D3.

130
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,682
-Do it.
-Yuna.

131
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,852
Ken? I didn't notice you were here!

132
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,936
This is my brother.

133
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,813
Ken is a college classmate…

134
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:03,939
Understood.

135
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,151
We're fine with the red door.

136
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,654
One minute remaining.

137
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,950
-Then, it's decided.
-Let's go.

138
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,369
Why do you trust him?

139
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,624
You're free to choose another door.

140
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:40,809
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

141
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,939
All right, let's go.

142
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,371
We'll regroup later.

143
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,664
Okay.

144
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,764
I'm Rei Morikage.

145
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,142
I've loved anime since I was a kid.

146
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,769
I draw a lot.

147
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,647
How quickly do you draw?

148
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,401
It currently takes me three days
to complete one drawing…

149
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,408
C2 is a minus-one-point room.

150
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,330
-Please select whose points to use.
-Why is it deducting a point?

151
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,126
Some rooms probably have a point penalty.

152
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,588
We won't know till we enter,
which makes it tricky.

153
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:56,969
We just used Arisu's points,
so let's use mine.

154
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,477
Second turn. Begin.

155
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:19,032
Now roll the dice,
and then choose which room to enter.

156
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,370
We can't return to the last room
without waiting a turn.

157
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,665
That leaves three rooms,
which explains the three dice.

158
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,917
All right!

159
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,177
Three, one, five?

160
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,026
If this really is the future,

161
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,529
I'd choose the blue door in this room too.

162
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,281
MOVIE TICKET
EVERYBODY LOVES FAMILY!

163
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,993
-We should do this now and then.
-I wanted to see this.

164
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,498
CLASS 1 ARCHITECT
DESIGN DRAWING EXAM

165
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,460
What?

166
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,755
You're gonna try to be an architect?

167
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,592
I am?

168
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,556
What would you do
if a student were bullied in your class?

169
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,391
Mr. Hida, what do you think?

170
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:30,270
-I wouldn't just stop it.
-The future that will come to pass.

171
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,939
I'd first listen to both…

172
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,191
I don't wanna choose the red door.

173
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,702
Hida, there's an interesting seminar.
Wanna go?

174
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,246
SKILL DEVELOPMENT SEMINAR

175
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,997
I don't have time.

176
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,292
Think of it as an investment
in your future self.

177
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,753
At least go hear what they have to say.

178
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,340
Please sign your name here.

179
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,884
Okay, thank you.

180
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,178
-Please take a seat.
-All right.

181
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,182
D2 is beyond the red door.
That's where we plan to regroup.

182
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:13,063
I'll go through the red door to the east
and meet up with Rei and the others.

183
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,898
I'll go too.

184
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:21,446
Can I ask the rest of you
to go through the blue door to room C1?

185
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,450
You did it, Matsuyama.
It's the research funding you wanted.

186
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,245
-Is this for real?
-Yes, congratulations.

187
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,163
Thank you very much.

188
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,084
Let's meet up later.

189
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,175
All right.

190
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,594
Let's go.

191
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,771
TO: YUZUHA ARISU

192
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,858
THANK YOU FOR THE OTHER DAY
CAN WE MEET?

193
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,157
This is getting weird.

194
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,370
Is this game peeking into our minds?

195
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:21,923
All twos.

196
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,856
I'll head north to D2.

197
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:43,528
I wish the three of us could go together,
but we have to split into two groups.

198
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,947
Got it.

199
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,786
We'll go east to E3.

200
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,120
Okay.

201
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,581
JOB OFFER CONFIRMATION

202
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,042
No way!

203
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,465
This is delicious!

204
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,258
Hey, are you listening to me?

205
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,684
Rei, let's meet up in room D2 as planned.

206
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,353
Roger that.

207
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,616
-Okay.
-Thank goodness.

208
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,534
Yeah.

209
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,495
Third turn. Begin.

210
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,749
Huh? One and two?

211
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:54,057
Usagi counts as two,
so she can only go to D1.

212
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,185
Only one can go to E2.

213
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,730
So one of us will be forced to stay.

214
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:07,154
Everyone, this is Morikage.
She'll be starting today.

215
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,948
I look forward to working with you.

216
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,074
I'm Rei Morikage.

217
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,993
It's nice to meet you.

218
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,830
I guess it can't be helped.

219
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,543
I'll stay this time.

220
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,794
What?

221
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,088
Keep your kid safe.

222
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,507
-But…
-Rei.

223
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,469
I owe you one from Zombie Hunt.

224
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,522
Meet up with Sachiko and the others.

225
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,568
Sachiko, are you there?

226
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,575
Yeah, I can hear you.

227
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,578
How many can go to D1?

228
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,332
Four. We all can.

229
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,834
That's great.

230
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,422
-Then please head east to D1.
-I'm sick of your nagging.

231
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,799
-Meet with Usagi there.
-Let's not fight here.

232
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,219
This place isn't good enough for you?

233
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,180
-That's not what I meant.
-Did I ask you to apologize?

234
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,307
Roger that.

235
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:23,230
Sohta and Yuna,
could you please stay where you are?

236
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,151
Usagi and I will move this turn,
and Rei will be forced to stay.

237
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,155
I want you to return to D3 after one turn.

238
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,617
That will end Rei's forced stay.

239
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,703
After that, let's meet at E3.

240
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,289
It's best to stay together.

241
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,375
So we should stay. Understood.

242
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,842
All right, let's all go to D1.

243
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,471
Because Arisu said
to move together whenever possible?

244
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,685
-I mean--
-Listen, we need to find the exit.

245
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,021
We might find it faster if we split up.

246
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,607
Besides,

247
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,653
shouldn't we give our futures
a little more thought?

248
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,965
Mr. Matsuyama!

249
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,384
Look at these numbers.

250
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:38,138
I think these results are enough
to prove your hypothesis.

251
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,473
You did it! This is amazing!

252
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:46,521
You'll go out there and sell this water
for 3,000 yen per bottle.

253
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:50,066
You're free to leave now if you want out.

254
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,778
If you're serious about
changing your life, come with me.

255
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,364
Why did you join this seminar?

256
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,700
To awaken my true potential.

257
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,535
That's right.

258
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,998
This time, you're going to sell this water
for 30,000 yen per bottle.

259
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,127
Do you understand why you have to sell it?

260
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,629
TRUE AWAKENING
LUCKY WATER

261
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,131
-Excuse me…
-No thanks.

262
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,967
No, thank you.

263
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,260
This is impossible.

264
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,596
-Please let me return them.
-Cut the crap!

265
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,015
It's in the contract you signed.

266
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,309
No returns allowed!

267
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,604
-I'm sorry.
-Huh?!

268
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,939
He's so drunk. I'm so sorry!

269
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,275
What do you mean, you're sorry?

270
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,654
-Why are you apologizing?
-Stop it!

271
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,738
Please, just…

272
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,615
REJECTION LETTER

273
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,245
You're hired.

274
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,246
Really?

275
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,582
We look forward to working with you.

276
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,292
Thank you very much.

277
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,003
-Thanks for coming.
-Thank you for hiring me.

278
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,845
The exit is likely
in one of the corner rooms,

279
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,348
as they are the furthest from the center.

280
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,395
It might be worth a shot.

281
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:10,939
Yeah.

282
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,985
So let's split into two groups
and head for the corner rooms.

283
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,823
But I don't want to ignore
what Arisu said.

284
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,660
So how about the two of us
go this way as a compromise?

285
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:29,165
I'll meet up with Usagi,
and you'll go towards the corner room.

286
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,751
Fine.

287
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,921
Okay, then.

288
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,382
We'll go to B1.

289
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,300
That okay?

290
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,803
I guess.

291
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,820
Let's break up.

292
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,406
I don't love you anymore.

293
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,033
Did I do something wrong?

294
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,410
Look, Sohta.

295
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:06,953
I'm sorry.

296
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,622
No, wait, Ken! Don't go!

297
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,208
Why?

298
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,962
We're going to get married.

299
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,506
Please give us your blessing.

300
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,050
Is that right?

301
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,386
-Yeah.
-Congratulations.

302
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,221
-Thanks.
-Thank you very much.

303
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,417
Wow! Look at that huge lake.

304
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,711
No, Yuna. It's a dam.

305
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,754
What? A dam?

306
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,381
-It's a lake formed by a dam.
-Like a reservoir?

307
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,550
Then she's half right!

308
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,844
See? I'm half right.

309
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,805
Yuna, you're so excited today.

310
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,350
Of course! It's been so long
since we went out as a family.

311
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,268
-It's so fun!
-That's right.

312
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,954
We did everything we could,

313
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,042
but I'm afraid
your parents didn't make it.

314
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:56,581
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

315
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,380
Sohta,

316
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,132
are you sure?

317
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,984
Forced stay.

318
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,572
You're completely useless!

319
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:35,828
What?

320
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,583
You're completely useless!

321
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,169
What is this?!

322
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,381
-1 ROOM

323
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,508
Point deduction confirmed.

324
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,761
Fourth turn. Begin.

325
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,681
-I'll roll the dice
-Okay.

326
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,709
Yellow to the west is a corner room.

327
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,836
But only one of us can go.

328
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,881
It's better not to split up now.

329
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,634
Let's go south to B2.

330
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,929
You did it. You got a job offer!

331
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,598
-A job offer, Nobu? Congrats.
-Congrats.

332
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,516
Well done!

333
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,434
Nobu!

334
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,603
You listening?

335
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,315
-Yeah.
-You did it. You got a job offer!

336
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,569
You got a job offer, Nobu? Congrats.

337
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,572
Let's stay here so we can get Rei out.

338
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,743
I'll check the corner room next door.

339
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,369
What if it's a trap?

340
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,079
I still have 15 points.

341
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,164
I'll be fine.

342
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,252
Sohta,

343
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,838
what numbers did you roll?

344
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,846
Sohta.

345
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,767
Sohta? Yuna?

346
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,770
You're currently staying at E3, right?

347
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,774
Can you move to D3? Please unlock Rei.

348
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,151
Understood.

349
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,653
Are you sure?

350
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,491
Look.

351
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,166
A corner room is behind the green door.

352
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,960
The exit might be there.

353
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,296
Arisu wouldn't try to save us

354
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:55,134
if it meant losing
Usagi and his unborn child.

355
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,973
For Mom and Dad's sake,

356
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,060
we need to head toward that future.

357
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,280
Let's go.

358
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,199
Okay.

359
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,788
I'll do it.

360
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,422
Rei, are you okay?

361
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,050
Hurry! I feel like I'm going insane!

362
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,095
Sohta and Yuna are heading to D3.

363
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,888
You should be unlocked soon.

364
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,143
Please!

365
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,997
-Congrats!
-Congrats!

366
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,207
Hey!

367
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,751
Let's go.

368
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,589
I'll use my points.

369
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,098
He sells weird water. It's Nobu!

370
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,561
Drink up, and I'll buy a bottle. Go on!

371
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:16,067
-Chug it!
-Chug it!

372
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,151
Go on, chug it!

373
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,529
Next one!

374
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,574
-Next one!
-Chug it!

375
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:27,078
-Why do you have that?
-Hey!

376
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,747
-I have it 'cause I wanna drink!
-Hey!

377
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,541
Drink!

378
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,335
Chug!

379
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,462
I can't drink anymore. I give up.

380
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,756
Got something to say?

381
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,177
Say it after drinking!

382
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,720
-Okay!
-Chug!

383
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:49,600
Say it after drinking!

384
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,559
Chug!

385
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,978
Say it after drinking!

386
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,690
-Disgusting!
-That's so gross!

387
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,774
I'm sorry.

388
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,901
Seriously, drop dead!

389
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:05,241
Drop dead!

390
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,620
Tetsu, I'm sorry.

391
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,414
Hey!

392
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,001
Nobu!

393
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,129
What the hell is he doing?

394
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,643
I'm all alone now.

395
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,603
-6 ROOM
NOBUAKI HIDA: 13

396
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:38,649
A1 is a minus-six-point room.

397
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,775
Seriously?

398
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,782
It wasn't the exit room.

399
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,119
And it's a corner room,
so there's only one door.

400
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:55,041
E5 is a minus-four-point room.

401
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:55,958
What?

402
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,503
-4 ROOM
SOHTA ITSUKI: 13, YUNA ITSUKI: 14

403
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,671
Damn it.

404
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,090
We'll use mine.

405
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,133
But…

406
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,970
Point deduction confirmed.

407
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:11,932
It's okay.

408
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,604
Fifth turn. Begin.

409
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,736
Rei, did you get out?

410
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,949
I'm still stuck here.
And I lost another point!

411
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:29,950
What?

412
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,249
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

413
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,628
-Here, Yuna.
-You shouldn't have.

414
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,172
Sohta, Yuna. Where are you?

415
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,590
You have great taste.

416
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,344
This is far from finished.

417
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,304
Sohta! Yuna!

418
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,557
Sohta! Yuna!

419
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,317
This is far from finished.

420
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:10,116
When push comes to shove,
people choose the future they want

421
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:15,538
instead of helping others.

422
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,087
FROM: MOM
PLEASE JUST CALL ONCE

423
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,718
This is far from finished.

424
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,179
You're completely useless.

425
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:37,268
Come to think of it,
I wonder how Mom is doing.

426
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,982
Shit.

427
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,780
Gimme one packet.

428
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,450
That stuff rocked, right?

429
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,348
No way in hell.

430
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,978
Didn't I just toss the drugs?

431
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,360
No!

432
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,655
Shit! No!

433
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,991
No!

434
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,505
Mom.

435
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,675
Your mother had
a severe cerebral hemorrhage.

436
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,843
No way.

437
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,012
Nobu…

438
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,352
Even if she recovers,
I doubt she'll return to the life she had.

439
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,937
This can't be true.

440
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,534
Usagi.

441
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:21,705
I'll go unlock Rei in D3,
so stay there again the next turn.

442
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,332
Got it.

443
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,501
Ryuji.

444
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,004
Ryuji, can you hear me?
How are things there?

445
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,925
Corner room E1 deducts one point.

446
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,802
So no exit?

447
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,387
Nope.

448
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,487
No.

449
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,115
It can't be.

450
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,584
No.

451
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:09,920
This can't be.

452
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,383
I'm screwed.

453
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,139
Mom.

454
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,059
It's my fault.

455
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,983
It's all my fault.

456
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,897
This is far from finished.

457
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,483
D2 UNLOCKED

458
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,366
Room D2 has been unlocked.

459
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,871
Rei, you should be able to move now.

460
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,124
See you next turn.

461
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,586
Roger that.

462
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,838
Thanks.

463
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,359
-4 ROOM
TETSU SHIMAZAKI: 12

464
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,737
B3 is a minus-four-point room.

465
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,532
Minus four?

466
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,619
Point deduction confirmed.

467
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,961
Tetsu? Nobu?

468
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,798
Nobu! Answer me.

469
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:25,222
There's nothing to worry about.
I still have points.

470
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,227
Point deduction confirmed.

471
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,741
Shit.

472
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,578
Goddammit!

473
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,751
Sorry I'm late.

474
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,173
No worries.

475
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,719
Yukiko.

476
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,435
Hey, Yukiko.

477
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,519
Yeah?

478
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,272
How about the aquarium
for our anniversary?

479
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:16,940
Why?

480
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,986
I've never been.

481
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,030
Never in your entire life?

482
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,448
Yeah.

483
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,076
Sure.

484
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,291
Long time no see. You look well.

485
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,660
Wow, look at you now.

486
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,373
I'm working at an architectural firm.

487
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,041
I can change.

488
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,669
What? Really?

489
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,464
I can change, Yukiko.

490
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,320
Goddammit!

491
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,799
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

492
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,384
Welcome.

493
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,434
I've been waiting.

494
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,935
Sorry I'm late.

495
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,812
I didn't think you'd come.

496
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,356
What? Why wouldn't I?

497
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,693
-Hey.
-What?

498
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,155
-Want me to build you a house?
-Really?

499
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,282
Yeah, what kind do you want?

500
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,828
Big and spacious.

501
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:38,035
A3 is a minus-eight-point room.

502
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,584
You now have zero points.

503
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,879
Game over.

504
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,510
And there it is.

505
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,518
Police. We have a search warrant.

506
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:07,898
I found it!

507
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,201
What's going on?

508
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,870
-It's nothing.
-You haven't changed at all!

509
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,455
Shut your mouth!

510
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,042
What about you? I thought you trusted me!

511
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,169
I did trust you!

512
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,171
I trusted you.

513
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,465
That's why it hurts even more!

514
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,766
I guess this is goodbye.

515
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,248
This seems about right.

516
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,305
It's my fault.

517
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,243
Nobu.

518
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,294
Tell me what happened.

519
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,631
Talk to me.

520
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,676
Leave me alone.

521
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,806
Tell me. I'm on your side.

522
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,410
Whatever happens, I want you to live.

523
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,324
Mom.

524
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,078
I will.

525
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,079
-Would you like to address the class?
-Of course.

526
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:54,457
My name is Nobuaki Hida.
I'm a new teacher here.

527
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,460
My mom was a teacher.

528
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,964
I admired her, so I became one too.

529
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:06,386
I'll try my best to be helpful
to you all as soon as possible.

530
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:14,602
NOBUAKI HIDA

531
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:20,483
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

532
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,154
I need to meet up with Tetsu.

533
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,052
Nobu?

534
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,264
Where are you? Nobu?

535
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:57,020
-1 ROOM
NOBUAKI HIDA: 4

536
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,104
Nobu?

537
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,941
I'm here, Sachiko.

538
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,361
Are you all right?

539
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,656
I just went back to B1.

540
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,201
But I got separated from Tetsu.

541
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:15,747
Did you go to corner room A1?
That might be the exit.

542
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,917
I did, but there wasn't an exit.

543
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,337
We're in C1, right next to you.

544
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,924
We can meet up next turn,
so stay where you are.

545
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,842
-Got it?
-Yeah.

546
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,264
Seventh turn. Begin.

547
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,237
No way.

548
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:49,739
One each.

549
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,742
We'll be split up.

550
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,838
Usagi, I'm now in D3.

551
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,589
I finally met up with Rei.

552
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:12,971
If there's no exit in corner room A1,
the remaining corners are A5 and E5.

553
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,057
I bet the exit is in one of them.

554
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:20,353
Let's look for Sohta and Yuna.
They may know something.

555
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,354
Understood.

556
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,368
Another interview?

557
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,036
Actually…

558
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,748
This is my research.

559
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,668
"Near-death experiences"?

560
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,505
I'm not sure my story helped you.

561
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,506
Don't be silly.

562
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,928
Let me thank you.
Anything you want to eat?

563
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,973
Let me think…

564
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:13,907
Let's go…

565
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,744
to the world of death together.

566
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,150
Kill her in the next game.

567
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,778
That's your final job.

568
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:11,381
Your wish will be granted if you kill her.

569
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:18,680
You'll discover the true world of death
that lies beyond here.

570
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,728
Ryuji, you there?

571
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,356
Ryuji?

572
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,859
-Ryuji!
-Hold your wristband to…

573
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:32,944
I can hear you.

574
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,363
Let's meet up later.

575
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,700
Let's meet up in B4.

576
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:46,624
Okay, thank you. Thanks.

577
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,071
-Nobu!
-I'm so glad to see you!

578
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,865
-Thank goodness!
-I'm so glad.

579
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:24,078
B1 is a minus-one-point room.

580
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,705
I'll use my points.

581
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,336
We need to find Tetsu.

582
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,756
Tetsu?

583
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,551
Tetsu? Answer me!

584
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,636
Tetsu?

585
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,430
Eighth turn. Begin.

586
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,278
Sohta.

587
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,948
Wow!

588
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,089
No.

589
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:33,815
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

590
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:42,740
Yuna.

591
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,118
Sohta!

592
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:50,331
Yuna?

593
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,126
Yuna!

594
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,672
Sohta. I can't get through!

595
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,048
Sohta!

596
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,258
Yuna!

597
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,930
B4 is a minus-two-point room.

598
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:06,848
What?

599
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:11,060
-2 ROOM

600
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,813
You now have zero points.

601
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,108
Game over.

602
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:23,424
Sohta?

603
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:32,767
Yuna.

604
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,979
This was a minus-two room.

605
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,108
What? It can't be.

606
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,362
No.

607
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:46,531
I'm sorry, Yuna.

608
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:51,828
I couldn't keep my promise.

609
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,915
No, Sohta. Open up!

610
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,084
Someone open this! Please!

611
01:03:58,960 --> 01:03:59,877
No!

612
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:03,631
No! Sohta, don't go!

613
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:06,050
No! Don't go!

614
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,134
No!

615
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:10,847
Please!

616
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,654
Promise me you'll be happy.

617
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:29,866
No! Don't go!

618
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,076
No! Please don't go!

619
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:32,994
No!

620
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:35,014
YUZUHA ARISU: 9, RYUJI MATSUYAMA: 7
NOBUAKI HIDA: 3, SACHIKO MAKINO: 11

621
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,223
Sohta has…

622
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,268
Yeah.

623
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,396
Tetsu isn't here either.

624
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,108
Tetsu.

625
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,528
Where are you, Tetsu?

626
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,161
It's because I left him.

627
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,329
We don't know

628
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,374
whether he's dead yet.

629
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,251
There's just no response.

630
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:10,716
B4 is a minus-two room.

631
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:12,802
Rei.

632
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:23,062
I want you to go south to C5 with Yuna.

633
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,525
Based on the turn count,
Yuna and her brother passed through E5.

634
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:33,447
If E5 wasn't the exit,
then the only corner room left is A5.

635
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:34,907
Right.

636
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,828
I'll join the others in B4
before heading to A5.

637
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,332
Corner room A5 has to be the exit.

638
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:57,847
Yuna.

639
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,183
Head to the exit with Rei.

640
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,397
Listen, Yuna.

641
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,899
Let's go, okay?

642
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:10,401
Yuna.

643
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:17,742
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

644
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,869
Let's go, Yuna.

645
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:43,517
Sohta!

646
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,061
-Yuna!
-Yuna!

647
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,438
You shouldn't see this! Go with Rei!

648
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,689
Yuna, come back.

649
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:51,233
Hurry! This door will close too!

650
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:53,194
Look out!

651
01:07:56,155 --> 01:08:00,451
The player left in this room
will be forced to stay.

652
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:10,252
B4 is a minus-two-point room.

653
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:14,423
Please select whose points to use.

654
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,890
Point deduction confirmed.

655
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:27,895
-4 ROOM

656
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:31,732
B3 is a minus-four-point room.

657
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,359
Minus four points.

658
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,112
Let's use mine.

659
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,992
Point deduction confirmed.

660
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,579
Tenth turn. Begin.

661
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:09,103
No…

662
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:19,238
Usagi, how's it going in there?

663
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,449
Everyone is in room B3 now.

664
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:26,996
But our dice roll is forcing us
to split in three directions.

665
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:30,749
Plus, one of us will be forced to stay.

666
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,294
And we still haven't met up with Tetsu.

667
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,090
Tetsu isn't here in B4 either,
which means…

668
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:43,721
Tetsu is in A3.

669
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,557
Tetsu…

670
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:52,354
That room might deduct a lot of points.

671
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,192
Then what should we do?

672
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,366
One of you goes
to the high-deduction room.

673
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,994
The second goes to the minus-two room.

674
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,622
The third moves away from the exit.

675
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:14,335
And the fourth will be forced to stay.

676
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,348
What the hell, you bitch?!

677
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:28,474
Stop it!

678
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:29,808
Stop!

679
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:31,894
Enough!

680
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,396
Stop it.

681
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:52,373
Let's go to the world of death together.

682
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,199
Think.

683
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:31,745
Come on.

684
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,332
I gotta think.

685
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:39,795
Think.

686
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,624
EXIT

687
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:08,003
