1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,342
Three minutes remaining in Round 13.

2
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,650
I couldn't care less about you.

3
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,308
Damn!

4
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,690
Two people remaining until checkmate.

5
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:51,986
Lady?

6
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,290
Everyone's more concerned
about their own lives than that kid

7
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,669
and has joined the Queen Team.

8
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,551
Nobody wants to kill a child, but…

9
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,180
it's different
when your own life's on the line.

10
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,016
We value our own lives over others'.

11
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,936
That's the way we humans are.

12
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,065
I can tell…

13
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,653
you've never known anyone

14
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,573
who was precious to you.

15
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,500
I despise hypocrites like you.

16
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,008
If this kid's that important to you,
then die together.

17
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,594
But I know

18
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,473
that you'll change your mind
sooner or later.

19
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,726
You'll see.

20
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,324
Are you okay?

21
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,119
I swear

22
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,581
I'll keep you alive.

23
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,671
Round 14, the Challenger Team's turn,
will now commence.

24
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,549
The round lasts for five minutes.

25
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,469
Start.

26
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,044
Usagi!

27
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,671
Wait there!

28
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,263
Are you okay?

29
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,765
I've got an idea. Come with me.

30
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,061
Ow!

31
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,041
-Are you okay?
-Any sign of them?

32
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,836
Not much time left.

33
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,338
Run!

34
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,517
Usagi, we need at least five more.
There's a bunch upstairs.

35
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,019
-Let's go!
-Wait!

36
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,229
We've got to hurry! There's no time!

37
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,355
Wait.

38
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:09,744
Do you guys really want
to be on the Queen Team and win?

39
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,747
You're damn right.

40
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,707
I don't want to die.

41
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,712
If we're on the Queen Team and win,
we can stay here forever.

42
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,132
Then we won't have to
participate in other games,

43
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,760
and we won't get shot at all the time.

44
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,806
Isn't there something more important
than winning this game?

45
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,974
Right now, winning this game
is what's important!

46
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,686
You're all wrong.

47
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,524
Right now,

48
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,821
what's most important
isn't winning this game.

49
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,617
It's returning to the real world.

50
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,666
If you're only worried
about winning the game

51
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,461
and then do as the tough Queen says,
you'll probably win.

52
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,881
And you may be able to survive
in this world forever.

53
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,802
But is that what you want?

54
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,098
If our team wins and we defeat the Queen,

55
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,767
as well as all the face cards,

56
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:19,397
we might be able to
return to the real world.

57
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,237
There's no way in hell
we'll be able to go back.

58
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,906
That other world

59
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,410
has ended.

60
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,413
The games always follow their rules.

61
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,959
When the face cards lose, they're killed.

62
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,546
So if we defeat all the face cards,

63
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,007
these games will end for sure.

64
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,551
There are no games after that.

65
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,722
That's just your fantasy.

66
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:54,974
Maybe so.

67
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,684
But…

68
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,398
the only people who survive
are the ones who hold onto that hope.

69
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,777
Even if you can continue
to survive here with the Queen,

70
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,779
it just means

71
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,451
you live forever in this game
where you're killing each other!

72
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,581
If you don't want that…

73
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,377
then take a chance with us.

74
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,512
This place is a lot like the real world.

75
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,850
Do you really want to return
to the real world that badly?

76
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,020
That place…

77
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,273
totally sucked.

78
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,152
I think this place
might actually be better.

79
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,373
I'll admit,

80
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,126
until now, I thought that way.

81
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,881
The real world may not be a bed of roses.

82
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,803
But…

83
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,474
I want to go back.

84
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,773
I want to go back to the real world.

85
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,904
Even though it was full of pain,

86
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,325
it was the world that gave me life

87
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,329
and raised me.

88
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,541
I miss it.

89
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,339
It's a cold and lonely place,

90
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,846
but because of my life there,

91
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,974
I was able to discover

92
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,853
the kindness in people here.

93
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,693
I'd forgotten about that until now.

94
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,286
I want to go back…

95
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,041
and start over again there.

96
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,433
I…

97
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,019
want to go back.

98
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,358
I also…

99
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,152
want go back.

100
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,904
I want to go back…

101
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,698
and be with my family.

102
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,550
Do you think

103
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,137
I can also start over again?

104
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,603
There are two rounds remaining.

105
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:32,441
Round 15, the Queen Team's final turn,
will now commence.

106
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,944
The round lasts for five minutes.

107
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,945
Start.

108
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,807
There are 14 of them.

109
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,809
To gain a majority,
we'll need to take back five.

110
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,311
That won't be easy in just one turn.

111
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,730
And they can win just by running away.

112
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,442
We'll just have to
go after them one by one.

113
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,527
No.

114
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,659
There's another way.

115
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,586
I swear I'll get that guy
on my team before the end.

116
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,546
What about the woman?

117
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,800
We don't need her.

118
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,763
I'll show her
that hypocrisy is pointless in this land.

119
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,641
-Let's go!
-Come on!

120
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,253
Over there!

121
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,006
-We'll get you!
-Stop!

122
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,016
We don't need you. Get out of the way!

123
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,314
Wait! Go after her!

124
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,530
-This way!
-All right!

125
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,250
Go up!

126
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,173
He's over there!

127
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,051
There he is!

128
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,681
Stop right there!

129
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,405
Round 15 will be ending soon.

130
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,407
Thirty seconds remaining.

131
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,561
The final round.

132
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,770
Start.

133
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,148
Go!

134
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,530
Arisu!

135
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,536
He went that way!

136
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,880
-Yes! We did it!
-We did it!

137
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,280
-Yes! We did it!
-Yahoo! We did it!

138
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,115
Thank god! We did it!

139
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,743
-Thank you!
-You too!

140
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,875
Thank goodness.

141
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,383
Lady.

142
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,523
I don't know how you persuaded everyone,

143
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,443
but well done, Miss Hypocrite.

144
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,114
I simply

145
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,369
want to get out of this land
with the people precious to me.

146
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:37,955
That's all.

147
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,625
Oh, really?

148
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,255
We're a hell of a lot freer here.

149
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,884
I like it here better
than in that rigid, repressive world.

150
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,679
Just as I thought,

151
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,309
you all were players like us
and have stayed in this world.

152
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,812
Isn't that right?

153
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,111
You'll find out
once all the games are over.

154
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,279
When they're all over?

155
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,033
What will we find out
when they're all over?

156
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:20,956
You'll know the answer to that
only after you've cleared the last one.

157
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,792
Will we know what this world is?

158
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,544
Will we be able to go back?

159
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,300
That's something
for you to look forward to.

160
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,387
-Time has run out.
-Hey!

161
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,475
The game is over
for all members of the Queen Team.

162
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,687
I want to live free until the very end.

163
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,566
Farewell.

164
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,951
I want to finish these games fast

165
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,703
and find out the answer.

166
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,458
But I want to survive

167
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,212
and return to the real world

168
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,216
with you, Usagi.

169
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,682
Me too.

170
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,279
Hey, look at that.

171
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,540
This smell…

172
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:29,960
Did you fart?

173
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,753
No.

174
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,007
It's hot!

175
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,430
Wow! It's a hot spring.

176
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,349
This is a hot spring!

177
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,309
Usagi!

178
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,685
This is awesome!

179
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,187
It's really a hot spring!

180
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,190
The water is just right here!

181
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,566
Seriously?

182
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,109
Let's take a bath!

183
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,570
I haven't had a bath in ages!

184
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,988
We can't let this chance go!

185
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,324
Together?

186
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,577
What? Oh…

187
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,849
You know, I wouldn't mind dying now.

188
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,438
If only…

189
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,693
we could wash away all the pain here too.

190
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,655
That's for sure.

191
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,370
What's wrong?

192
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,122
Usagi?

193
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,542
Usagi?

194
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,586
Hey!

195
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,797
Usagi!

196
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,052
No way.

197
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,681
Incredible.

198
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,161
The elephants are bathing too.

199
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,041
They must have escaped from the zoo.

200
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,754
If we hadn't come to this land…

201
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,673
We never would have seen this.

202
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,843
Yeah.

203
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,681
What's wrong with me?

204
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,517
Suddenly, I feel

205
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,812
incredibly moved.

206
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,526
Me too.

207
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,296
Sorry! I didn't see anything.

208
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,092
I was looking at the elephants.
I'm only interested in them.

209
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,802
I like elephants.

210
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,261
It's okay.

211
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,099
Stay here with me.

212
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,687
There it is.

213
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,751
KIMIKO KUINA
ADMITTED: JUNE 2, 2021

214
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,776
I want to see you, Mom.

215
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,309
She's so young. It's so heartbreaking.

216
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,896
All the results
of disgusting human desires.

217
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,235
Maybe there's no hope for this world.

218
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,988
Even though she knew she'd die,

219
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,617
she fought desperately until the end.

220
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,330
She never gave up hope.

221
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,021
I've still got hope.

222
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:28,016
SUPREME COURT

223
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,158
Well, well.

224
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,661
So, you were the King of Diamonds.

225
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,206
The former executive at the Beach

226
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:55,168
and Number 2, Kuzuryu.

227
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,590
Why was the King of Diamonds at the Beach?

228
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,969
I was interested in it.

229
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,222
You went undercover?

230
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,976
Difficulty level, King of Diamonds.

231
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,813
Game: Balance Scale.

232
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,733
Shall we begin?

233
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,951
BALANCE SCALE

234
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,961
Rules: Within the three-minute time limit,

235
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:42,090
select a number between 0 and 100.

236
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:47,220
The average of the numbers chosen
is then multiplied by 0.8.

237
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,766
The person who chooses
the number closest to this is the winner.

238
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,563
The average of the numbers
that everyone selects

239
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,648
is multiplied by 0.8.

240
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,695
And whoever gets closest to it wins.

241
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:09,242
What? Multiply the average by 0.8?

242
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,413
Why multiply by 0.8? What's with 0.8?

243
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,164
I get it.

244
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:20,920
By multiplying by the constant 0.8,
it tips the balance of the scale.

245
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,715
That's how it becomes a game.

246
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:29,137
The 0.8 is like a drop from heaven.

247
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:34,183
Everyone except for the winner
loses one point.

248
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,352
Then the round ends.

249
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:42,609
When a player reaches negative ten points,
the game is over for that player.

250
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:46,487
The one person who survives
until the end is the victor.

251
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:51,326
However, every time a player loses,
a new rule is introduced.

252
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,245
New rules? What's with that?

253
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,584
And no explanation
of the balance scales either?

254
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,172
Round 1 will now start.

255
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,421
Time has expired.

256
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,340
Here are the results for Round 1.

257
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,094
The average…

258
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,597
is 32.8.

259
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,600
This is multiplied by the constant 0.8.

260
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,352
RESULT: 26.24

261
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:02,438
This is the person who is closest.

262
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,942
The winner is Kuzuryu.

263
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,742
If everyone selects 40,

264
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,162
the average will obviously be 40.

265
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,958
When that's multiplied by 0.8,
it comes to 32.

266
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,879
If everyone made
the same assumption and chose 32,

267
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,298
the result will still be
multiplied by 0.8.

268
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:33,428
As long as that happens,
the result will continue to decrease.

269
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,056
Even if everyone chooses the same number,

270
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,393
there won't be a winner.

271
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,103
I get it now.

272
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:46,649
We need to predict what everyone chooses
and then predict again even lower.

273
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,278
This is actually more like a heart game.

274
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,697
It's a psychological battle?

275
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,826
Like chess, poker,
and all intellectual games,

276
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,619
you have to read your opponent.

277
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,875
But you don't read
your opponent psychologically.

278
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,793
You read their logic.

279
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,213
Isn't that right?

280
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,341
Logic?

281
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,641
You're ignoring me?

282
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,479
What's that?

283
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,147
Water?

284
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,319
It's sulfuric acid.

285
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:32,779
What?

286
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,530
So, you'll answer
those kinds of questions.

287
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,868
When you're at negative ten points,
the scale must tip.

288
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,913
Your body will melt,

289
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,541
and you'll turn to mush!

290
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,257
Balance scales.

291
00:34:55,009 --> 00:35:00,348
That must mean
the King of Diamonds was a lawyer, huh?

292
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,018
That's all in the past.

293
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,645
So it's complicated.

294
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,191
But you still chose this place.

295
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,821
The arena for this game is a court.

296
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,032
And these giant scales…

297
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,829
Like the symbol on a lawyer's pin,
they represent fairness and equality.

298
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:28,459
All lives have equal value,
including your own.

299
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,336
Is that what you want to say?

300
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,759
The scales always tip
to the side that has more gold.

301
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,346
All lives don't have equal value.

302
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,311
Round 2 will now start.

303
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,815
The last result was 26.

304
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,401
So if that's multiplied by 0.8…

305
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,155
Wait. If everyone has the same idea,
I'd have to look farther ahead

306
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,782
and multiply by 0.8 again.

307
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,662
If everyone chooses 100,
multiply that by 0.8 and you get 80.

308
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,206
There's no point
in ever choosing 80 or higher.

309
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,918
If nobody will ever choose 80 or higher,
the highest average is 80.

310
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,504
Multiply that by 0.8 and you get 64.

311
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,715
If the highest average is 64,

312
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,884
when you multiply that by 0.8,
you get 51.2.

313
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,260
In other words, 51.

314
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,347
The more steps you predict,
the closer the result gets to zero.

315
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,561
In the stock market, everyone invariably
invests in the brands everyone wants.

316
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,981
Now I just need to predict
what everyone will want.

317
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:36,235
Predicting how many steps ahead
everyone else will predict

318
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,446
is the key to this game.

319
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:42,825
I've already developed the formula
for reading everyone's logic.

320
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,785
Time has expired.

321
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,245
Here are the results for Round 2.

322
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,122
The average…

323
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,541
is 16.6.

324
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,253
This is multiplied by the constant 0.8.

325
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,088
RESULT: 13.28

326
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,883
This is the person who is closest.

327
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,303
The winner is Kuzuryu.

328
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,361
Everyone's gotten better at predicting.

329
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,031
The numbers keep getting smaller.

330
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,533
Should I just choose zero?

331
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,081
By logical prediction,
the result converges to zero.

332
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,541
Ultimately, everyone will choose zero.

333
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,463
The most logical choice is to choose zero.

334
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:41,968
But everyone's definition
of "logical" is different.

335
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,846
Kuzuryu.

336
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,557
What?

337
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,394
I have a pretty good idea now…

338
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,313
of what you're trying to measure.

339
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,609
The value of life, right?

340
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,322
No.

341
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,449
So what is it?

342
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,868
Tell me.

343
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,842
What if we submit
another settlement figure?

344
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,011
The truth is,

345
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,723
twenty people living near the factory died
from the damage done to the environment

346
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,142
caused by the waste
that the factory dumped.

347
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,436
Their diseases
could have been caused by anything.

348
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,897
Where's the proof
that our company is to blame?

349
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,695
I heard that
you're an extremely talented lawyer,

350
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,739
but you don't truly understand
the law, do you?

351
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,702
The law doesn't exist
to protect the weak from the powerful.

352
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,871
Everyone is equal under the law.

353
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,164
That's absurd idealism!

354
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,377
To save the starvation of the world,

355
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,506
one needs the power to
effortlessly propel the world's economy.

356
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,383
But with your idealism alone,

357
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,178
this incredibly unfair world
can't be changed.

358
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,346
So let me ask you this.

359
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,851
What do you think we should do
in order to maintain

360
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,145
a perfectly just modern society?

361
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:23,527
We must make it possible, on every level,
to implement a fair judicial system.

362
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,113
Just now,

363
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,742
you said one needs the power to
effortlessly propel the world's economy.

364
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,620
But by focusing only on
the growth of the economy,

365
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,121
-the wealth gap has widen--
-Listen!

366
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:39,335
As a lawyer,
it's not your duty to defend what's just.

367
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,796
Even idiots can defend the just!

368
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:46,884
Words like "fairness" and "equality"
are useless in a world filled with evil!

369
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,930
However, when something isn't "just,"

370
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,266
then it is your duty to use

371
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:59,772
the gift of imagination
that God gave you to make it "just."

372
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,826
Time has expired.

373
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,370
Here are the results for Round 3.

374
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,624
One hundred?

375
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:21,293
The average is 20.2.

376
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,130
This is multiplied by the constant 0.8.

377
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,757
This is the closest person.

378
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,592
The winner is Daimon.

379
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,804
What? I won?

380
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,721
Yes!

381
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,432
Hey, you!

382
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,809
What did you do that for?

383
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,520
If you choose 100, you'll lose!

384
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,731
There's a zero percent chance you'll win!

385
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,735
Everyone's dissecting this a little
too meticulously, don't you think?

386
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,698
That kind of thing
just makes my head hurt,

387
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,200
so I decided to blow it up.

388
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,753
You've lost your marbles.

389
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,133
ROUND 6

390
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,385
Here are the results for Round 6.

391
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,888
The winner is Chishiya.

392
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,896
Here are the results for Round 7.

393
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,814
RESULT: 23.04

394
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,400
The winner is Daimon.

395
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,863
Yes!

396
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,957
That sure won't be a pleasant way to die.

397
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,377
ROUND 10

398
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,796
I've only got one point left.

399
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,548
If I get this one wrong, I'll die.

400
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,926
I thought my formula was perfect!

401
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:01,769
Oh, dear! I've got no idea what to do!
I can't use the same tricks again.

402
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,355
I can't make any more wrong guesses!

403
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,857
If I lose the next one, it's all over!

404
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:12,988
If you think logically,
the numbers will get smaller and smaller.

405
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,245
You must have predicted this would happen.

406
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,341
Here are the results for Round 10.

407
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,801
RESULT: 1.6

408
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,345
The winner is Kuzuryu.

409
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:42,893
There are participants
who have negative ten points.

410
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,986
The game is over
for these two participants.

411
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,079
Let me out of here!
Please! Let me out of here!

412
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,583
No!

413
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,959
Let me out!

414
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,460
Hey! Let me out of this thing!

415
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,628
I'll do anything you want!

416
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,047
Is it money you want? Please!

417
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,133
Tell me!

418
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,344
-Let me out!
-I'll do anything you want!

419
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,317
Now, this is more like a face card game.

420
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,488
Is this what you call fairness?

421
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,745
Since two participants lost,
two new rules will be added.

422
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:29,583
Rule one: If two or more people
choose the same number,

423
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,836
their choice will be invalidated
and they will lose one point.

424
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:37,466
Rule two:
If the answer is guessed exactly,

425
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,469
the losers will lose two points.

426
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,347
ADDITIONAL RULES

427
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,040
Here are the results for Round 11.

428
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,756
Everybody chose zero…

429
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:23,137
Since everyone chose the same number,
their choices are invalidated.

430
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,764
Everyone loses one point.

431
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,015
What?

432
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,518
In the end, everyone chooses zero.

433
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,857
If that happens again,
it's game over for me.

434
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,151
ROUND 12

435
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,862
Round 12 will now start.

436
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,583
Here are the results for Round 12.

437
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,383
RESULT: 22.93

438
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:07,931
We have an exact winner,
so the losers lose two points.

439
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,103
No way…

440
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,939
No way! Impossible! How come?

441
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,193
You saw my choice, didn't you?

442
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,528
That's against the rules!

443
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,656
How else would you know
what the hell I chose?

444
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,742
When Round 12 began,

445
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,119
you were at negative eight points.

446
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,413
I was at negative nine points.

447
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,333
Even if you messed up,
you'd still have another chance.

448
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,294
So, instead of going for the win,

449
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,130
you bet that he and I
would invalidate each other.

450
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:44,468
So I figured
you would choose a random number.

451
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,430
But what are the chances
you'd get it right? Are you a psychic?

452
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:52,893
If he and I invalidate each other,
you thought we'd choose from the first 50.

453
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,396
He predicted my exact thoughts.

454
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:01,818
At the start of the round, the King
had more than a three-point lead over him.

455
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,119
If I chose the same as the King,

456
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,955
I couldn't make up
the three-point difference.

457
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:22,005
But if they chose the same numbers,
I thought I might win.

458
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,263
So you avoided choosing from the first 50.

459
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,015
If you're going to run away,

460
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,102
then it's only natural
that you want to run far.

461
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:40,440
But even so, 90 to 100 is too extreme
and doesn't feel right.

462
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,651
So you avoided those too.

463
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:48,031
Any doubles are too obvious,
so you avoided those as well.

464
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:52,035
The same goes for 60 and 70
and any easy numbers like that.

465
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,998
The numbers that people
often choose on a whim,

466
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,916
that is, 3, 5, and 8, were also out.

467
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,751
All prime numbers were also out.

468
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,170
It became easy after that.

469
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:08,885
Lastly, any numbers you often see in life
that can be easily imagined were out.

470
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,096
A game console.

471
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:12,806
A movie title.

472
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,433
A brand logo.

473
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:20,230
Then what we have left is either 62 or 74.

474
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,399
That's as far as I could get.

475
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,569
After that,

476
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,529
it was just luck.

477
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,659
I should have chosen 74.

478
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,206
There is a participant
who has negative ten points.

479
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,834
No…

480
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,919
No…

481
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,546
No!

482
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,050
No…

483
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,638
No!

484
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,097
No!

485
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,445
You know…

486
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:15,577
She said that the value
of everyone's life isn't equal.

487
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:21,667
I wonder if she still thought that
just before she died.

488
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,172
Have you

489
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:32,219
seen the underside of this world
with your own eyes?

490
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:39,351
Infants die because they can't get
antidiarrheics that cost mere pennies.

491
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,439
Little girls are sold
to pay off their parents' debts.

492
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,320
All the people who can't escape
the never-ending cycle of poverty.

493
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,244
A new rule will be added.

494
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,287
ADDITIONAL RULES

495
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:04,710
When someone chooses zero,
whoever chooses 100 will be the winner.

496
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,005
I see.

497
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,843
Since the result is always
the average multiplied by 0.8,

498
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:18,014
as long as there are just two of us,
whoever chooses the lower number will win.

499
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:23,895
In other words, if you keep choosing zero,
you'll win for sure.

500
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:29,151
But thanks to this new rule,
everything is fair now.

501
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,904
If one of us chooses zero,

502
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,074
then the other will win
if they choose 100.

503
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:41,037
But if a person predicts
that will happen and chooses 100,

504
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,541
then the other person will choose 1.

505
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,796
Those are the only three choices
if you want to win this game.

506
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,551
Now it's a fair and simple game

507
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:57,721
that's a toss-up between zero, 1, and 100.

508
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:06,021
But I can't choose the same number
as you even once if I want to win.

509
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,859
I'm still in a difficult bind.

510
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,279
ROUND 13

511
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:15,947
You know,

512
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,992
you seem desperate to make things fair.

513
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,412
What's making you do that?

514
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,042
Tell me…

515
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,921
If you had one million doses
of a life-saving vaccine,

516
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,925
which one million people would you save?

517
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,303
I see.

518
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,680
Now I understand.

519
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:47,145
It's not that you're trying
to measure the value of life.

520
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,816
You don't want
to have to decide the value of life.

521
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:55,904
Yes. I don't know what makes
one life more valuable than another.

522
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:01,493
A life that's worth saving
and a life that is not…

523
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,162
What is the difference between the two?

524
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:10,335
So, how would you answer my question?

525
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:15,048
I'd very much like to hear
the answer from someone like you.

526
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,970
I'd give them to children
without parents or money.

527
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:23,932
How unexpected.

528
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,600
That would be ideal.

529
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,228
But it's ultimately money that talks.

530
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:29,855
If you've got money,

531
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,733
then it's very easy
to end the lives of poor children.

532
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:39,823
I know you've seen that world
with your own eyes, haven't you?

533
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:40,907
Yes, I have.

534
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,536
Since a certain company
wouldn't pay a settlement,

535
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,373
people died because
they couldn't receive proper treatment.

536
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,292
Then you know

537
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,837
that there's no such thing
as fairness or equality in this world.

538
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,963
Because there isn't…

539
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,175
Isn't that why we should fight?

540
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,328
There.

541
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,497
It'll be next week.

542
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,041
Hang in there.

543
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,382
Doctor.

544
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:42,969
Thank you so much.

545
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,054
Not at all.

546
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,724
-I'll be going now.
-Goodbye.

547
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,614
Hayato's condition has stabilized,

548
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,741
so this operation should save him.

549
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,327
I need to talk to you about that.

550
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:11,039
The waiting list order
for transplants has changed.

551
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,917
-The order has changed?
-Yes.

552
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,382
This patient will get a transplant first.

553
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,012
REFERRAL

554
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,597
The grandson of a friend of the director.

555
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,598
DAIKI TAKAHASHI
ADDRESS: SETAGAYA CITY, TOKYO

556
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,684
-Then what about Hayato?
-He'll get his later.

557
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,561
They're a big financial donor.

558
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,815
That's how
this university hospital survives.

559
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,236
It can't be helped.

560
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,531
Everything has
an order of importance in this world.

561
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,493
You explain things
to that patient's parents.

562
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:50,996
What reason should I give?

563
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,001
Think of one.

564
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,669
You're his physician, right?

565
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:21,901
Well…

566
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,238
Even if he could've gotten
a transplant last week,

567
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,323
he probably would've died anyway.

568
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,370
Don't hold it against me.

569
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:37,459
To save people's lives,
you have to abandon your ideals.

570
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,466
I don't mind.

571
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,428
It doesn't bother me at all.

572
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,891
It's part of the job.

573
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,610
KINKI CHUO MEDICAL CENTER

574
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,742
SAKURAZAKA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

575
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,251
PHYSICIAN
PEDIATRIC CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY

576
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,927
Take care of it.

577
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,345
Got it.

578
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,610
Very interesting.

579
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,657
I think I may have come to this land

580
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,159
just so I could play this game with you.

581
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,959
I'm choosing 100.

582
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,424
What are you up to?

583
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,094
A little assistance.

584
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,721
Are you insane?

585
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,266
If I know you'll choose 100,

586
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,103
the only way
you can survive is if I choose zero!

587
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,733
Mine is a life

588
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,279
that is charging headlong toward death.

589
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,993
Does this life have value or not?

590
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,745
I'd like for you to decide.

591
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,293
Why have you done all this?

592
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,465
We live in a ludicrous world.

593
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,680
If we abandon our ideals, it's all over.

594
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,524
Ideals?

595
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,294
Let's go.

596
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,673
Forget me. You get going.

597
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,966
I can't do that.

598
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:17,178
In the last game I was in,
I was saved by a young man.

599
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,723
So now it's my turn to help someone else.

600
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,644
I won't regret it.

601
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,146
This is my way of living.

602
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,527
Your way of living?

603
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,572
Let's go together.

604
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,515
Time has expired.

605
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,101
Here are the results for Round 13.

606
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,938
The winner is Chishiya.

607
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,529
Did you seriously choose zero?

608
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,458
Round 14 will now start.

609
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,354
The winner is Chishiya.

610
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,826
Each of us has only one point left.

611
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,745
The next round will be the last one.

612
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,170
Round 15 will now start.

613
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,760
How about it?

614
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,845
Can you decide?

615
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,519
If you won't decide for yourself,

616
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,896
then just kill me.

617
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,524
That's a fair rule, right?

618
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,569
You think I am unable to decide.

619
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:45,410
Was that the reason
why you lured me into this tie?

620
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,496
I simply…

621
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,582
want to know…

622
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,628
what the last number you choose will be.

623
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:15,189
If you choose 1, you will win.

624
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:29,829
Momoka.

625
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,792
I'd like you to answer just a question.

626
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:41,549
You asked to play the role of the Witch
and take your own life.

627
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,182
What was your reason?

628
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:52,769
For my ideals.

629
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,067
People have beautiful hearts,

630
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,113
and life is precious.

631
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,574
I believe in those things.

632
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,579
It's because I have those ideals

633
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,625
that I've been able to survive
in this ludicrous world.

634
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,050
I will die as the Witch

635
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,805
not because I lost to your rules.

636
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:34,435
I did it to show you
that things won't go your way

637
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,773
and that there won't be a massacre.

638
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:49,450
If my life's going to end here
sometime anyway,

639
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:54,330
then I want it to end
while proving my ideals.

640
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,547
I don't understand

641
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:08,803
the value of life or its meaning.

642
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,350
I'm sure

643
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,937
I won't be able to make that decision
in the future either.

644
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,943
But what I need to decide now is…

645
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:52,096
Here are the results for Round 15.

646
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,770
I see you've decided

647
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:05,818
that determining the value of life
isn't your decision.

648
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,242
For my ideals.

649
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,581
The winner is Chishiya.

650
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,630
There is a participant
who has negative ten points.

651
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:29,300
The game is over for this participant.

652
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,557
What happened to your usual wry look?

653
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:39,393
At last,

654
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:46,025
I think I've been able to…

655
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:49,904
decide how I want to live.

656
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,754
It's thanks to you.

657
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,645
It's now time for our turn.

658
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:29,694
Oh, my.

659
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,530
You're not up for it?

660
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,411
At the very least,
I want the game that I run

661
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:41,998
to be fair.

662
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,785
It feels kind of unfair.

663
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,580
It's like you won and quit on me.

664
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:26,751
I envy you.

665
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:08,918
GAME CLEARED
CONGRATULATIONS

666
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,727
I wouldn't be surprised…

667
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,565
if we die soon.

668
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,153
But…

669
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,781
it's a miracle
we've made it this far anyway.

670
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,288
Since we have made it this far,

671
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,916
no matter what happens, let's fight…

672
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:34,712
to the very end.

673
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:38,549
Right.

674
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,459
I'll make it back, I swear.

675
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,887
For my future self.

676
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:53,053
