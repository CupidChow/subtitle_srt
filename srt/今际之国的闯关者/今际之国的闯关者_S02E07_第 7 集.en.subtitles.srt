1
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,259
Please…

2
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,566
You screwed up your own suicide, huh?

3
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,319
Kill me…

4
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,780
Please…

5
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,611
I bet you thought
I'd be glad to end your life.

6
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,659
You were wrong!

7
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,830
I hope you suffer in agony

8
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,083
until you die.

9
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,393
I will be despised until the very end

10
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,317
and proudly descend into hell.

11
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,733
Difficulty level, Queen of Clubs.

12
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,319
TARGET

13
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,071
Game: "Target."

14
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,866
Please wait until the game commences.

15
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,641
You thought I'd died.

16
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,727
No way.

17
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,605
You're tough, Ann,
so I was sure we'd meet again.

18
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,899
Tough, huh?

19
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,948
To be honest, I started to believe
it would be easier to wait for death.

20
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,534
Same here.

21
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,663
But we're here now.

22
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,665
Yeah.

23
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,834
Clubs are team competitions.

24
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,628
With the two of us together,
it'll be a breeze.

25
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,257
We're almost there. Let's win this.

26
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,177
Right. You'd better believe we will.

27
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,143
Registration has closed.

28
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,228
The game will now commence.

29
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,097
How long does this go on?

30
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,015
Yo!

31
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,895
So, you've come here too.

32
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,856
Chishiya.

33
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,025
There are just two games left.

34
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,986
All the players are gathering in Shibuya.

35
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,033
I was pretty sure
that you'd be one of the survivors.

36
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,962
You know, you've changed a lot.

37
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,006
You think?

38
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,424
Yeah.

39
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,802
You're mellower.

40
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,473
Mellower?

41
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,268
Yeah, well, I've been through a lot.

42
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:31,857
Say, Arisu…

43
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:38,322
Would you mind if I told you something
about myself I've never told anyone else?

44
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,078
Sure.

45
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,667
I…

46
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,711
Yo!

47
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,760
It makes me pretty damn happy
to run into you here.

48
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,096
Niragi…

49
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,266
You intentionally didn't kill me
with that shot.

50
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,560
I wasn't going to end this
with a surprise attack.

51
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,980
Okay, let's begin

52
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,315
a game of shootout.

53
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,652
Now that the three of us
are back together,

54
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,237
that seems most suitable.

55
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,157
A game between players?

56
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,993
The three of us are very similar.

57
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,204
We're oddballs
who can't fit in with society.

58
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,289
We're scum.

59
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,084
Even so, our need to feel alive
is greater than most people's.

60
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,095
I haven't got much time left.

61
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,223
So let's do this.

62
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,225
As kindred spirits,

63
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,020
join me in one final game!

64
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,829
I like it.

65
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,749
Join us, Arisu.

66
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,250
Chishiya?

67
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,378
I'm sure you despise me as well.

68
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,507
Use this opportunity to take revenge.

69
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,426
Let's play a game among the three of us.

70
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,345
Are you insane?

71
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,890
Come on. You've got a gun too. Take aim!

72
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,644
Do we really have to do this?

73
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,866
Niragi, stop this!

74
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,078
I'm simply doing
what I want the way I want!

75
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,372
You guys are the same way!

76
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,040
It's always "Me!" with you two!

77
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,000
It's always about what you want!

78
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,713
You aren't experts on life just because
you saw a bunch of people die!

79
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,383
"Living for others"? That's such bullshit!

80
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,594
All we really care about is
our own selves!

81
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,972
As long as it's good for us,
that's all we need!

82
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,935
And you said
it'll work out if we cooperate?

83
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,522
You just wanted to be
the only survivor in the first place!

84
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,358
I don't want it to end this way!

85
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,943
Do you want to kill us all?

86
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,653
Do it!

87
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,826
Yeah.

88
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,745
You may be right.

89
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,043
Killing each other here
just might be appropriate for us!

90
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,087
At last, you get the picture.

91
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,175
Niragi!

92
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,139
What you said makes the most sense!

93
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,893
You could almost convince me!

94
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,692
But…

95
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,154
I don't ever…

96
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,325
want to go back to being
the weak, selfish person I was!

97
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,171
I won't do this.

98
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,976
I won't pull this trigger
just to help myself.

99
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,122
At last…

100
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,917
I think I've been able to

101
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,754
decide how I want to live.

102
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,299
It's thanks to you.

103
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,937
That sure put a damper on things.

104
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,776
Arisu.

105
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,828
What are you doing?

106
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,628
Oh, yeah, there was you too.

107
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,048
Usagi!

108
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,633
Stop it!

109
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,176
Usagi has no part in this!

110
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,805
Every game needs a heroine
to make it exciting!

111
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,557
This is insane!

112
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,643
If you're dead,

113
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,063
then the three of us
can be kindred spirits again.

114
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,194
I can't stand to be alone anymore.

115
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,845
Chishiya!

116
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,264
Chishiya!

117
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,017
Chishiya! Why did you do that?

118
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,852
Why did you protect me?

119
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,148
I wanted to do something uncharacteristic.

120
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,195
It's probably because of
the people I met here

121
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,781
like Kuzuryu

122
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,492
and Arisu.

123
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,540
Hey, what were you
going to tell me earlier?

124
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,877
Oh, yeah…

125
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,552
To me,

126
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,141
people who live life
so seriously seem like fools.

127
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,647
Those people who strive so hard…

128
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,274
I just want to curse them.

129
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,695
All their goodwill was repugnant to me.

130
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,618
But I must have been jealous.

131
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,789
They had what I didn't.

132
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,628
It seemed like they were criticizing me

133
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,382
for being such a vain and vulgar person.

134
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,470
I was afraid of them.

135
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,476
I know what you mean.

136
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,607
I figured you would say that, Arisu.

137
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,992
Shotguns…

138
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,870
sure don't do a good job of killing.

139
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,212
Even by mistake,

140
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,300
don't you dare ever call me evil.

141
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,431
If there were seven billion of me,

142
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,854
then you'd be the ones who are evil.

143
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,861
It's good for you…

144
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,032
that you're on the side of the masses.

145
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,495
He's coming!

146
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,208
Run!

147
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,466
-Let's move them behind a car.
-Right.

148
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,613
The only blimps left are
the King of Spades and Queen of Hearts.

149
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,534
The surviving players have come
to Shibuya where the blimps are.

150
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,453
We can't go farther
unless the King of Spades is defeated.

151
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,332
Look!

152
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,381
Kuina! Ann!

153
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,967
It's Arisu!

154
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,766
It's been a while.

155
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,685
Thank goodness you're all right!

156
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,853
Good to see you again.

157
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,022
Did you see Chishiya?

158
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,691
Yeah.

159
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,945
He'll be fine.

160
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,447
You're right.

161
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,199
The King of Spades
is trying to end things here.

162
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,160
Let's defeat the King together.

163
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,108
Ann!

164
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:30,909
Yes!

165
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:36,206
-We did it!
-Yes!

166
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,416
We did it!

167
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,248
Arisu!

168
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,270
Damn!

169
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,836
-I can't hit him! Shit!
-Let's go!

170
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,599
Arisu!

171
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,106
Over here!

172
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,448
Arisu!

173
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,703
Heiya.

174
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,581
You're Usagi?

175
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,333
Yes.

176
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,169
Nice to meet you.

177
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,594
He's just about run out of
his spare magazines.

178
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,721
Aguni!

179
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,849
Aguni, how'd you get here?

180
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,728
I followed you.

181
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,606
You must like me.

182
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,655
He's still just a human.
He's not omnipotent.

183
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,784
His guns are the same.
They can't be fired forever.

184
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,245
When he's out of rounds, he reloads.

185
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,165
The blimp probably sends them down to him.

186
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,211
We've got weapons.

187
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,056
But these are all the rounds we've got.

188
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,574
Oh, yeah. I've got this.

189
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,659
A good luck charm.

190
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,287
It's a bomb Chishiya made.

191
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,205
Chishiya?

192
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,666
What good is that?

193
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,668
Lure him in and use it at close range.

194
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:15,175
Judging from the smell,
this bomb's got kerosene in it.

195
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,176
An ANFO bomb.

196
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,928
That won't make much of an explosion.

197
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,973
There's a drugstore over there.

198
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,018
If it's closed off
and filled with aerosol fumes,

199
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,811
the explosion can be amplified.

200
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,438
You sure of that?

201
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,066
Maybe.

202
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,778
In other words,
someone has to lure him in there?

203
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,279
Yeah.

204
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,866
I'll wait for him
in the store and set it off.

205
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,826
But then you'll die, Arisu.

206
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,329
No. I'll get away.

207
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,663
How?

208
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,166
On the second floor,

209
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,878
even if I'm blown outside,
I can still survive.

210
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,006
Maybe.

211
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,344
This is nothing but "maybes."

212
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,807
It's worth betting on his "maybes."

213
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,603
This time, I'll be the decoy.

214
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,940
It's reckless to lure him alone.

215
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,651
I'm enough.

216
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,905
Let's all be decoys.

217
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,908
You'd better believe it.
You can count on us.

218
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,422
Okay. Let's go.

219
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,199
We'll lure him into the alley
so the blimp can't send him ammo.

220
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,369
Then we'll lure him into the drugstore.

221
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,830
I'll sprint for it.

222
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,125
Then you guys enter that alley
and lure him in.

223
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,084
Got it.

224
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,963
Arisu, you fill the store
with aerosol fumes.

225
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,090
Right.

226
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,826
Can't you hit anything?

227
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,554
Watch where you're shooting!

228
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,890
Don't worry! I won't hit you!

229
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,358
Ann!

230
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,077
Shit!

231
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:11,956
Come on!

232
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,169
Come on.

233
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,728
Come on.

234
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:17,813
Come on.

235
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,610
Arisu! Do it!

236
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,280
Aguni!

237
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,699
You idiot!

238
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:14,787
Throw it in!

239
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,607
Aguni!

240
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:08,651
Go.

241
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,699
What about the others?

242
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,117
They'll be fine.

243
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,663
Go to the final game.

244
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:44,853
Usagi!

245
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,067
Usagi!

246
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,320
Usagi!

247
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,073
Usagi!

248
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,457
I'm sorry.

249
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,138
That was the only way

250
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:33,021
I knew how to save you.

251
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,001
I'm sorry.

252
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,766
I never once

253
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,520
hated you.

254
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,596
This isn't fair, you know?

255
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,502
Mori!

256
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,433
Why the hell are you here?

257
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,478
You want me to ask for forgiveness?

258
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,148
No.

259
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,652
I'm the one

260
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,655
who wanted your forgiveness.

261
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,245
For forcing my best buddy

262
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,707
to take on such a shitty role.

263
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,473
Take care of yourself.

264
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,281
Aguni…

265
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,169
Dammit…

266
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,631
I can't get up.

267
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,428
We were…

268
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,058
so close…

269
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,525
You're…

270
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,069
alive.

271
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,451
If we…

272
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,289
meet again…

273
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,755
let's be friends.

274
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:09,858
Ann…

275
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,278
Ann!

276
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,071
Ann…

277
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,532
Ann.

278
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,418
Usagi!

279
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,466
Usagi…

280
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,024
There is one final game.

281
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,529
All players wishing to register
must do so immediately.

282
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,566
If…

283
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,653
there's a rule that says
the players must kill each other…

284
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:24,034
I won't hesitate to protect you, Usagi.

285
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,786
You're just…

286
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:28,914
saying that now…

287
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,835
so you sound cool.

288
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:10,932
Welcome to the final Game Arena!

289
