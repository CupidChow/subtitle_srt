1
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:32,615
"You must be the change
you wish to see in the world."

2
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,243
That's what Gandhi said.

3
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,663
I…

4
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,792
will create a utopia here.

5
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,173
For those who have fallen into despair…

6
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,344
if we don't have hope,

7
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,555
we just need to make it!

8
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,186
This will be the land of hope.

9
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,776
I will make this place the second Beach!

10
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,450
BEACH

11
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,947
How long are you going to sleep?

12
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,869
Did you drink too much?

13
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,088
Did you get any information?

14
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,716
Not at all.

15
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,014
I should go gather some information now.

16
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,895
It seems like Hatter
has taken a liking to you.

17
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,066
The militants have their eye on you,
so be careful.

18
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,361
You don't know what they'll do to you.

19
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,622
I heard this from the guys who drove
all the way to the suburbs.

20
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,668
The further you get from the city,
the more run-down the streets are,

21
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,128
and beyond that,
it looks like a jungle of sorts.

22
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,382
And they didn't proceed further than that.

23
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,508
Seriously?

24
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,637
I heard that game arenas
are only within Tokyo!

25
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,515
Let's pump it up until the end!

26
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,769
There are rumors of those who tried
escaping from the country via a boat,

27
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,230
but those lasers from the sky

28
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,856
killed all of them.

29
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,857
Have you heard of that?

30
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:41,155
So does that mean only people
in Tokyo disappeared?

31
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,408
But if this only happened in Tokyo,

32
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,576
the SDF would have come
to our rescue, right?

33
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,498
The fact that they didn't come means
everyone in Japan disappeared, right?

34
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,083
Even the U.S. army didn't come for us.

35
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,129
Don't tell me…
everyone in the entire world disappeared?

36
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:02,093
Aliens inserted a chip into our brains
and are toying with us.

37
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,430
I'm sure no one would be able
to escape from this place.

38
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,389
Let me drink some.

39
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,313
The more I hear,
the more depressing it gets.

40
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,982
Perhaps…

41
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,027
our only hope really lies
in the playing cards.

42
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,456
I'll head to the annex basement now.

43
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,500
Don't overdo it.

44
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,837
I'll go get food supplies
and any weapons that we can use.

45
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,048
I'll also gather some information
in case we need it.

46
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,264
"In case we need it?" What does she mean?

47
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,566
Hey, can I ask both of you something?

48
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,112
Wait, I'm not trying to hit on you!

49
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,560
That is the true nature
of this utopia.

50
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,940
This is part of Beach's rule.

51
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,401
"Death to the traitors."

52
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,625
Arisu.

53
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,505
You and Usagi seem to have collected
a vast amount of information.

54
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,716
What are you both planning?

55
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,553
Nothing much.

56
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,767
I'll cut to the chase.

57
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,980
How will you live in this world
that's full of despair?

58
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,649
"How"?

59
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,497
I just want to know
the answers to my questions.

60
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,459
The ones behind this crazy game.

61
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,547
And who killed Karube and Chota.

62
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,930
I thought I'd be able to survive

63
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,225
and return to the original world
with everyone.

64
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,854
If that is not possible,

65
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,566
I want Usagi to return, at the very least.

66
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,654
This is the only reason
why I'm still alive.

67
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,283
What a tearjerker.

68
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,121
Your dream…

69
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,083
It's cool,

70
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,295
but it's not practical at all.

71
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:13,594
You'll have to win all the games
and become the next Number One,

72
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,304
but that's impossible.

73
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,224
It has nothing to do with you guys.

74
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,768
We think that you have potential.

75
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,481
-What?
-That's why we came to meet you.

76
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,776
What do you mean?

77
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,198
What if I said there's a way to change
the status quo all at once?

78
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,000
We're off to the game arena!

79
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,966
They gathered quite a number of firearms.

80
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,345
It was kept in the deepest room
in the annex, and there were patrols too.

81
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,682
As long as they have those firearms,

82
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,143
Hatter will be
in an advantageous position.

83
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,609
What's the matter?

84
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm off!

85
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,960
Hatter is trying to keep
the militants in check,

86
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,838
but it's only a matter of time
before they retaliate.

87
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,093
If that happens, this place will be
controlled by the militants

88
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,179
who don't know how to use their brains.

89
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,264
Then there'd be no point staying here.

90
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,726
What are you planning?

91
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,898
I'm planning
to steal all the playing cards

92
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,068
and leave the Beach.

93
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,205
The Beach.

94
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,917
A utopia built upon charisma.

95
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,421
However,

96
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,425
maybe that's just our imagination.

97
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,927
BEACH

98
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,263
A utopia doesn't exist in this world.

99
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,392
Usagi.

100
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,896
I'd like to talk to you about something.

101
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,656
KABUKICHO

102
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,074
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

103
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,757
This way.

104
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,848
Kabukicho, huh?

105
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,934
This takes me back.

106
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,242
BEACH

107
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,744
I can't wait.

108
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,454
-Hey!
-Excuse me, sorry!

109
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,721
Where the hell is the GPS chip?

110
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:52,146
-So you really were here!
-Hey, don't come in without my permission!

111
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:00,654
Well, something bad happened.
Please come with me!

112
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,406
Hurry!

113
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,915
Hey, wait up.

114
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,625
Where did you guys come from?

115
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,794
We didn't ask you guys to come here!

116
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,255
I called him over.

117
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,676
Hey, don't go gathering people
on your own.

118
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,013
There's something important
he has to hear.

119
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,516
Let's go in.

120
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,353
See you later.

121
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,569
What happened?

122
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,321
Who knows?

123
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,074
It must be something serious.

124
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,411
It seems like he couldn't clear the game.

125
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,081
The maintenance team
found him by chance in Shinjuku

126
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,958
while we were refilling gasoline.

127
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,464
Hey, don't touch him as you please.

128
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,133
You dissection maniac.

129
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,723
He was shot by a gun.

130
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,226
Did his game involve guns?

131
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,772
Most likely. Some of those
near the game area heard gunshots too.

132
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,611
Oh, my. He should have brought
the militants along with him!

133
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,625
What's going to happen to the Beach?

134
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,547
Keep this a secret from the rest.
They'll be shaken by this.

135
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,052
I'll be the next leader
since I'm Number two.

136
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,012
Wait a second.

137
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,475
Shouldn't the strongest person
be the leader?

138
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:39,521
We're the ones who have been
getting rid of the traitors,

139
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,816
yet we've been treated
as shadows the entire time.

140
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,902
This unfair treatment ends today!

141
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,779
If Number One dies,

142
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,365
everyone moves up by a number.
We agreed on this rule.

143
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,285
The snobbish dictator is dead.

144
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,371
The power has shifted, hasn't it?

145
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,750
Let's just be democratic
and go with the majority.

146
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,381
Who agrees that Aguni
should be the new leader?

147
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,935
What a bad reaction.

148
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,437
Last Boss.

149
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,790
I'll ask again.

150
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,710
Who agrees that Aguni
should be the new leader?

151
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,558
This…

152
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,019
is not a majority rule.

153
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,522
It is, isn't it?

154
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,359
You're free to vote after all.

155
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,456
What about the former Number Two
over there?

156
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,166
What will you do?

157
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,678
What about you?

158
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,688
Are you looking down on us, Chishiya?

159
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,774
But you guys really are stupid.

160
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,197
Those eyes of yours really piss me off.

161
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,867
It's so condescending.

162
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,042
I vote for Aguni to be the leader.

163
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,296
Are you all right with losing me
as a precious "yes" vote?

164
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,136
Well, I hope you reflect on
how you should act in the future.

165
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,225
Hey, what are you spacing out for?

166
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,270
Were you never taught
that you should reply to people?

167
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,190
Whose side are you on?

168
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,362
You were really scared
for a moment there, right?

169
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,031
That's so funny!

170
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,576
All right.

171
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:45,290
Suddenly everyone's voting "yes."
So the new leader is decided, right?

172
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,459
Hatter would not allow this.

173
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,171
If he were alive,
he would not have allowed this.

174
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,717
But he's dead.

175
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:02,391
The dead won't know what's going on.

176
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,229
See?

177
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,775
Enough.

178
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,159
From today onwards,

179
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,287
I will be the Beach's new king.

180
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,333
Isn't this wonderful?

181
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:37,134
Now, boss.
What's left is the succession ceremony.

182
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,304
Let's open the black envelope.

183
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,357
The black envelope.

184
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,153
The poker cards gathered
by all the members of Beach

185
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,657
are kept in the safe
in Hatter's royal suite room.

186
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,578
The passcode to the safe

187
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,374
is kept and sealed
inside the black envelope.

188
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:15,547
The envelope is opaque
and kept in utmost secrecy,

189
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,802
and can be opened
only when there is a new Number One.

190
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,353
The new Number One
will check the passcode alone

191
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,147
in front of all the executive members.

192
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,702
Then, he will place the paper
with the passcode written on it

193
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,206
into a new envelope and seal it again.

194
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,832
It will then be signed

195
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,043
by all executive members
before it's stashed away again.

196
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,889
First, Arisu will infiltrate
the royal suite.

197
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,267
Then he will search for the safe

198
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,644
and steal all the playing cards inside.

199
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,440
-What about the passcode?
-I have an idea of that.

200
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,152
I'll tell you
when you're in front of the safe.

201
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,115
You're really cautious.

202
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,575
I got it.

203
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,746
Usagi and Kuina will be on the lookout.

204
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,334
This is too dangerous.
If we're discovered, we'll be killed.

205
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,800
This is the only way
to change the current situation.

206
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,556
Now that Hatter is dead
and there's no unity at the Beach,

207
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,349
the time is right for this plan.

208
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,907
The leader has changed.

209
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,662
Hatter is no longer with us.

210
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:15,584
The new leader will be Aguni.

211
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,298
How noisy. Shut up!

212
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:28,055
It appears that Hatter failed
in his game and couldn't return.

213
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,267
Through majority vote
among the executive members,

214
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,395
it's been decided
that Aguni will be the new Number One.

215
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,609
Now, let's hear from Aguni.

216
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,196
You guys better listen properly.

217
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,580
Now,

218
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,416
what Niragi said is everything.

219
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,545
The new leader is making a speech
in the lobby.

220
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:08,053
All executive members
and the militants are at the annex.

221
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,680
We won't get another chance like this.

222
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,395
I'll let you guys know
if there are any changes.

223
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,647
I'm counting on you, Arisu.

224
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,942
Understood.

225
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,741
With Hatter gone
as the previous Number One,

226
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,370
I now have full control over the Beach.

227
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,082
Follow my orders, live for me,

228
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,544
and die for me.

229
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,017
I found it.

230
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,104
So, what's the passcode?

231
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,814
It's 8022.

232
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,233
Did you see the contents of the letter?

233
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,818
No.

234
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,029
But Aguni's expression told me everything.

235
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,657
That instant,

236
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,243
Aguni's face looked dark.

237
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,496
It was as if he was surprised

238
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,291
and perplexed.

239
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,628
I'm sure the contents must be empty.

240
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,715
Empty? Then what about
the passcode you told me?

241
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,760
The wax seal.

242
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,348
It was embossed with the Boss' ring,
and it formed numbers.

243
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,602
That was the code itself.

244
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,062
It's 8022.

245
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,610
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

246
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,455
It won't open!

247
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,209
Chishiya!

248
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,795
Hey! Chishiya!

249
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,301
You really came in so brazenly.

250
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,269
-Why?
-Let me go!

251
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,439
-Stay still!
-Usagi!

252
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,650
Arisu!

253
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,945
Stop shouting for Usagi, you idiot!

254
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,279
Arisu!

255
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,452
You saved me, Chishiya.

256
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,746
We caught them
thanks to your perceptiveness.

257
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,707
No problem. It was what I should do.

258
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,545
Let go! Arisu!

259
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,095
Arisu!

260
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,641
What?

261
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,642
Oh, my.

262
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,812
Are you sleepy already?

263
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,902
Bring him to that room!

264
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,632
I heard that your visa expires tomorrow.

265
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:41,141
You'll have no hearing, no sight,
and no clue what the time is.

266
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:47,439
I can't imagine the fear as you wait
for the laser to shoot through your head!

267
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,610
In the meantime,

268
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:56,781
we'll enjoy the best of our time
with your dear Usagi!

269
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,077
Bye!

270
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,765
How are things on your side, Kuina?

271
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,645
Aguni is still in his room.

272
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,565
I'm so bored now.

273
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,945
Then, shall we proceed with our plan?

274
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,033
I don't know if Arisu is clever or stupid.

275
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,412
There's no way the cards
would be kept in an ordinary safe.

276
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,541
Then where is the real safe?

277
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,545
When Arisu found the fake safe,

278
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,881
Aguni, who usually does not waver,

279
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,008
was looking toward a certain location.

280
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,307
I believe
that the contents of the envelope

281
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,477
did not contain a passcode
or an empty letter…

282
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,609
but instead, it might have been a drawing.

283
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,759
Found it.

284
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,386
So you used him for this?

285
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:28,808
To gain something,
you need to lose something.

286
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,979
He's just a sacrifice.
Things like this happen often, don't they?

287
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,441
No, not at all.

288
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,862
I really don't want to be your enemy.

289
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,615
People often tell me that.

290
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,348
-Let me go!
-You're too noisy!

291
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,266
Hurry up!

292
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,517
-Stop struggling.
-Let go!

293
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,185
-Heave-ho.
-Heave-ho. There you go!

294
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,274
-Stop moving.
-Let go of me!

295
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:35,602
Rape, assault, fraud, arson, murder…

296
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,314
Why do you think these crimes
are punishable by law?

297
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,240
Why is it that they are prohibited by law?

298
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,289
That's because they are part
of human nature.

299
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,377
Left to our own devices,

300
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,755
humans will rape,
steal, and kill each other.

301
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,010
That's just who we really are.

302
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,066
But there are no laws here.

303
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,111
Isn't it a waste
to not do all these things?

304
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:32,450
Such human nature empowers us!

305
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,022
Stop fucking around.

306
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,528
The fun is just beginning.

307
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,846
I guess it's time
to say goodbye to this, too.

308
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:40,143
Don't you feel sorry for him?
Arisu, I mean.

309
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,687
Feel sorry?

310
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,731
Yes.

311
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,191
I feel really sorry for him.

312
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,198
Is there anything
we can't do in order to survive?

313
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:03,666
If you're so worried,
then you should help him, Kuina.

314
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,095
Don't tell me…

315
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,141
Stop right there!

316
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,036
Seriously?

317
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,398
Thank you for staying
at Seaside Paradise Tokyo.

318
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,860
As a token of our appreciation,

319
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:18,032
we will now commence a game
for all the guests in the hotel.

320
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,118
ONE PER PERSON

321
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,539
THE GAME WILL NOW COMMENCE

322
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,837
The Beach

323
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,131
is a game arena?

324
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,632
Difficulty,

325
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,093
Ten of Hearts.

326
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,807
-"Ten of Hearts"!
-It finally appeared.

327
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,189
We will now be explaining the rules.

328
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,985
All players are to assemble in the lobby.

329
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:01,284
I repeat. All players
are to assemble in the lobby.

330
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,685
-Let's go!
-Hurry up!

331
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,937
-Quick!
-What game is it?

332
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,109
Hey!

333
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,026
Momoka!

334
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,570
Momoka!

335
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,405
Why…

336
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,706
Game, "Witch Hunt."

337
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,086
The evil witch who took the girl's life

338
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,255
is hiding among you.

339
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,884
The witch role is not limited to women.

340
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,637
Among us?

341
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:49,725
You clear the game if you find the witch
and burn them in the Fire of Judgment.

342
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,937
Time limit, two hours.

343
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,972
TIME LIMIT

344
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,768
