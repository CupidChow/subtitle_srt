1
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,978
There's a fire burning
at the back of the building!

2
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:29,195
Find the one who murdered Momoka,
then burn them in the Fire of Judgment.

3
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,282
A witch hunt? This sounds interesting.

4
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,368
The game has already begun.

5
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,662
Hey.

6
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,250
All right, let's search for the witch!

7
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,475
Hey, you.

8
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,020
Why weren't you with her today?

9
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:02,937
What?

10
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,441
Why were you late?
Weren't you always with her?

11
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,569
-Is she the witch?
-It's not me!

12
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,279
We'll know once we throw you in the fire!

13
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,989
I was in my room! I'm not lying!

14
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,284
You two were always together,
but today you happened to not be with her?

15
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,331
All right, it's decided. She's the witch!
Drag her to the fire!

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,917
-Come on!
-Hoist her up!

17
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,002
-Heave-ho!
-Stop it!

18
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,796
-Here we go!
-I didn't do anything!

19
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,422
Stop this!

20
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,965
Calm down.

21
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,134
Let go of Asahi.

22
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,762
There should be other suspects.

23
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,352
Where were you guys,
and what were you doing? Can you prove it?

24
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,562
Just say it!

25
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,485
Both of us were having
a good time in the same room, right?

26
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,907
Everyone will take turns reporting
what they've been doing in the past hour.

27
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,243
There's blood on her!

28
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,666
-Don't get the wrong idea.
-Now, this is getting interesting.

29
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,751
-Could she be the witch?
-You're wrong!

30
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,378
This is Hatter's blood.

31
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,630
-What?
-Hatter's blood?

32
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,509
I was checking Hatter's body.
That was when the blood got on it.

33
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,302
His body?

34
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,974
Hatter was murdered.

35
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,228
-Hatter was…
-Why did you keep it from us?

36
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,482
The executives believed
this would throw everyone into confusion.

37
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,528
Are you guys hiding
more things from us? Hey!

38
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,239
-Stop whispering among yourselves!
-Calm down!

39
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,370
This bullet was stuck
inside Hatter's body.

40
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,957
The firing marks align
with the firearms we have here.

41
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,625
What?

42
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,672
This means someone
at the Beach killed Hatter.

43
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:01,222
Hey. Could it be
that the witch killed Hatter?

44
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,477
I mean, doesn't that sound plausible
given the timing of the events?

45
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,646
The witch must be among them--

46
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,320
How troublesome.

47
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,906
Let's just burn everyone we find.

48
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,913
If someone among us is the witch,

49
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,374
then everyone

50
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,210
other than the militant member
is the witch.

51
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,214
Who's the witch?

52
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,840
Come forward.

53
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,806
If nobody does,

54
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,768
then I'll throw everyone into the fire.

55
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,654
-Oh, no!
-Run!

56
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,201
Hurry up!

57
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,248
ONE PER PERSON

58
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,458
Let's go!

59
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,504
Let's split up
and comb through the entire group!

60
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,922
Don't let anyone escape!

61
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,133
Are you really going to do this?
We were all allies!

62
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,051
What?

63
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,136
If the game doesn't end
after you hunt down everyone,

64
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,013
then we'll eventually
have to kill each other--

65
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,893
Burn him.
I have no need for useless people.

66
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,145
Let's go!

67
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,808
Suzuka, hurry up!

68
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,868
We have no time to waste
with these people.

69
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,884
Quick, hide inside this room.

70
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,636
Where are you going, Usagi?

71
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,721
I have to search for someone.

72
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,640
Please bring me along!

73
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,101
It's either Game Over or death for me
if I wait here.

74
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,646
Hey, it's me!

75
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,484
Let me help you!

76
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,861
You and Arisu helped me in a game before.

77
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,784
Help me search for Arisu!

78
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,540
Those guys are serious about that.

79
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,791
They're closing in.

80
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,084
Let's hurry!

81
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,967
Suzuka!

82
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,264
Stop it. Neither of us is the witch.

83
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,603
Hurry up and shoot.

84
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,274
Please.

85
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,818
Don't kill me.

86
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,404
I'll do anything!

87
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,491
Please. I beg you!

88
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,369
That is not human.

89
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,746
It's not a human!

90
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,524
All of them are nuts.

91
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,486
How unpleasant.

92
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,614
Why would they go so far just to survive?

93
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,993
There's no way
they'll find the witch like this!

94
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,833
The witch could be you, Kuina.

95
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,171
The same goes for you.

96
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,543
Lure them all out to the courtyard.

97
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,713
It's too troublesome
to move all the bodies.

98
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,174
There are still some
hiding inside the hotel, right?

99
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,053
I'll force them all out.

100
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,119
-Arisu!
-Arisu.

101
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,872
Arisu!

102
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,498
Arisu!

103
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,043
Arisu!

104
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,211
Arisu!

105
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,339
Arisu!

106
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:38,971
GASOLINE, KEROSENE

107
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,031
No!

108
00:10:59,033 --> 00:10:59,909
Asahi?

109
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,838
Are you all right?

110
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,926
I can't do this.

111
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,311
Where is Arisu?

112
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,358
He's in the main building.

113
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,614
-Arisu!
-Arisu!

114
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,453
Here we are!

115
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,968
Joe.

116
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,140
Fuck you, Saiko!

117
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,313
Where is Arisu?

118
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,650
Somewhere on…

119
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,319
the fourth floor.

120
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,072
You better be telling the truth.

121
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,450
I saw Niragi coming out of a room.

122
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,979
-Kuina?
-Hey.

123
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,981
What are you doing?

124
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,484
If you're free, can you lend me a hand?

125
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,570
Are you the witch?

126
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,363
Unfortunately, no.

127
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,366
What about you?

128
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,037
I guess not.

129
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,333
Anyone who's desperately trying
to identify the witch now

130
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,584
is not the witch.

131
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,044
If you were the witch,

132
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,962
you would have hidden yourself
to kill some time

133
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,839
or participated in the killings.

134
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,759
So what are you up to?

135
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,220
Searching for the witch.

136
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,057
Here it is.

137
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,600
What's that?

138
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,353
Cyanoacrylate glue.

139
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,313
In short, super glue.

140
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,856
What?

141
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,236
If we heat this up
and hold it over the murder weapon,

142
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:45,241
the cyanoacrylate vapors will fuse
with the moisture to show fingerprints.

143
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,784
Fingerprints?

144
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,205
Next, we'll use some cocoa powder
to dust for fingerprints

145
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,083
on things like cups that have been used
by the most likely suspects.

146
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,252
After we take the fingerprints with tape,

147
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,962
we'll be able to identify the culprit.

148
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,924
Just what did you do before coming here?

149
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,343
I was in Forensics
in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police.

150
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,639
I see. So we can clear the game like this.

151
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,901
You, go ahead.

152
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,736
What?

153
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,866
I'll leave it to you
to help us clear the game.

154
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,373
Fire!

155
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,840
Over here!

156
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,803
Someone, help us!

157
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,545
-Run!
-Hurry up!

158
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,880
Run to the annex!

159
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,471
Damn it!

160
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,083
Hey, aim properly!

161
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,463
Take your aim!

162
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,006
Take this!

163
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,884
-Did you see that?
-Hey!

164
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,304
I told you not to move!

165
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,222
Hey!

166
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,809
If you move again,
we'll make you eat that again.

167
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,436
Urine rice!

168
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,857
-Who's going next?
-I'll go!

169
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,403
Hey, stand up! Come on!

170
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,571
Are you listening, Niragi?

171
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:39,206
Aren't you sick
of bullying the weak already?

172
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,669
Where were you hiding?

173
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,922
There are tons of places for me to hide.

174
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,801
You really get on my nerves.

175
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,636
All the goddamn time!

176
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,556
You always act as if you're so clever.

177
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,767
But I am clever.

178
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,357
Perfect.

179
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,822
Let's put an end to this, shall we?

180
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,232
Not bad.

181
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,110
What did you do before coming here?

182
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,280
I worked in a clothes shop. Why?

183
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,707
Never hesitate to land the final blow.

184
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,251
-Damn junk!
-Stop it!

185
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,090
You're a boy,
so why do you need cosmetics?

186
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,685
Hikari.

187
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,479
Never come back.

188
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,375
Hikari? Hey!

189
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,314
Enough about me.

190
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,068
What about you?

191
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,535
The main power supply has changed
since the game started.

192
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,578
So?

193
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,039
Our electricity used to be
powered by generators.

194
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,708
Now it comes from the hotel's
main power source.

195
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:20,797
This means that the ones in charge
of the game snuck into the Beach

196
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,425
to control the power in the basement.

197
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,053
What are you trying to say?

198
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,972
I'm talking about
who the witch is, of course.

199
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,974
What else do we need to care for?

200
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,560
You're insinuating
that I'm the witch, right?

201
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,145
Sorry, but that's not possible.

202
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:40,942
Only the executives have information
on the main power supply management.

203
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:45,947
In the first place, only you guys
have the key to access the underground.

204
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,702
So I'll kill all executive members,
starting with you.

205
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,582
Do you think that I can't aim
at a short range with this rifle?

206
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,708
Yep.

207
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,003
You idiot!

208
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,884
What the hell was that?

209
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,784
Robert Edwin Peary.

210
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,913
He was an explorer who devoted
his entire life to reach the North Pole.

211
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,498
THE BOUND UNIVERSE

212
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:41,211
He failed many times, and even lost
eight of his toes to frostbite.

213
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,505
However, in 1909,

214
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,134
he became the first Westerner
to reach the North Pole.

215
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,390
I'm leaving your dinner here.

216
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,233
Ordinary people wouldn't understand

217
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,569
those like him, who embrace death.

218
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,740
However, I can tell
that they were shouting

219
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,660
about their freedom of living,
which includes such death.

220
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,329
What about me now?

221
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,289
Hey.

222
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,627
What should Mom do?

223
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:37,309
Born in a land where I can't even
eat raw liver through my own volition,

224
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,562
I was raised in an environment
that makes me unaware of death.

225
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,565
How can I feel truly alive?

226
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,030
Let me out of this temporary home.

227
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,993
I want to live in the real world.

228
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:12,010
And then, I came to this land.

229
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,241
Game cleared. Congratulations!

230
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,044
This is the first time
I have ever tasted it.

231
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,255
The freedom of living.

232
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:41,933
You.

233
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,729
I heard that you were a tattoo artist
in the original world.

234
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,190
Yes.

235
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,321
Tattoo something really awesome
all over my body.

236
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,869
Something so awesome that I won't be
able to live in the original world.

237
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,296
This is my declaration of will.

238
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,301
I will live in this land forever.

239
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,728
For me…

240
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,106
I have no past.

241
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,245
Oh, sorry.

242
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,873
I finally understand.

243
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,544
I've always thought
that you and I were similar.

244
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,880
Me and you?

245
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,011
Both of us despise our past.

246
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,976
I've finally decided because of you.

247
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,147
You just keep turning your back
on your past.

248
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,441
But I…

249
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,653
I will face my past once more
in order to survive!

250
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,545
Do you remember that arcade
that went down?

251
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,797
What was the name again?

252
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,673
It was in front of our high school, right?

253
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,343
-What was it again?
-Dream World?

254
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,386
It was Dream World!

255
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,348
Oh, right! It was Dream World!

256
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,853
I'd always skip classes to go there,
and Arisu would be there too.

257
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,439
He would be
reading out loud all the dirty articles.

258
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,400
The porn magazines from the '90s
were really the best.

259
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,903
Right, they had big dreams.

260
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,489
The reader submissions
were taken seriously.

261
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,032
They really sucked you in.

262
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,035
When the arcade went bankrupt,

263
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,038
Arisu stood
in front of the building and cried.

264
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,540
I didn't cry!

265
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,712
Those times were the best.

266
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,799
No matter how we complained,
high school life was awesome.

267
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,262
Arisu.

268
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,516
Live your life to the fullest.

269
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,230
Live your life for me, got it?

270
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,360
Someone…

271
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,112
Someone…

272
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,450
Smoke?

273
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,787
What? Is there a fire?

274
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,332
I hear someone.

275
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,341
Hey!

276
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,843
Someone, help me!

277
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,821
Someone, help me!

278
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:11,948
He's in there!

279
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,658
Arisu!

280
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,827
The door won't budge.

281
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,731
I did it.

282
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,107
I can't do this anymore.

283
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,831
Arisu!

284
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,709
Usagi.

285
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,708
Is that all you can do?

286
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,088
I knew it. You and I…

287
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,174
Our will to survive is too different.

288
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,470
"Will to survive."

289
00:34:58,888 --> 00:34:59,889
Was it?

290
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,414
Hikari.

291
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,516
You came back a totally different person.

292
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,108
But…

293
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,321
you look beautiful.

294
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,598
Mother.

295
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,832
"Never hesitate to deal the final blow."

296
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,210
I did as you told me,

297
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,254
Father.

298
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,559
I'm so glad.

299
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,311
You're safe.

300
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,813
Thanks.

301
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,068
I hate to break this to you now,
but we only have 30 minutes left.

302
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,780
Just explain the rule to me.

303
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,999
Out of ammo.

304
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,838
We killed so many
and still can't find the witch.

305
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,553
Just what have we done?

306
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,057
This is seriously the worst rule ever.

307
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,061
But just like those taggers
from the tag game,

308
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,607
who were made to participate
in the game with rules of their own.

309
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,236
I'm sure it's the same this time.

310
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,406
The witch has to kill the girl
to start the game

311
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,075
and survive
until the end of the time limit.

312
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,370
In other words, the witch clears the game
if everyone here gets a Game Over

313
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,955
or gets struck by the lasers.

314
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,082
Just who could be the witch?

315
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,626
If I were the witch,

316
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:02,715
I would join the others in the hunting
since it'll be Game Over if I'm caught.

317
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,302
So could it be someone from the militants?

318
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,472
Niragi, Last Boss, or Aguni?

319
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:13,726
No. If that's the case,
then the militants will kill one another.

320
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,812
But it doesn't feel like
the purpose of the game.

321
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,939
The purpose of the game?

322
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,441
This is a Ten of Hearts.

323
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,569
It's not just a physical game.

324
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,864
I know that
since I've cleared a Hearts game before.

325
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,283
Hearts games are utterly wicked.

326
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,452
You toy with people's feelings,

327
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,247
betray, and kill each other.

328
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,710
They're designed so that you can't win
without feeling disgusted.

329
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,466
If the militants win this way,
there will not be any conflict.

330
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,135
So what is it?

331
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,349
Something's weird.

332
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,435
What could it be?

333
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,899
If I were the witch,

334
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,028
how would I influence the game?

335
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,871
It doesn't suit you.

336
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,419
Who would've thought
that the best host in Kabukicho

337
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,795
would end up being a hatter?

338
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,257
I can't go against my father's dying wish.

339
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,428
You're an SDF officer too, right?

340
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,807
I thought
you could only belong to the yakuza.

341
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,644
Speaking of the yakuza,

342
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,899
Shogo was killed laying his hands
on the government's money.

343
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,992
You're the only old friend I have left.

344
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,536
Live long.

345
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,415
You too.

346
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,272
No.

347
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:11,028
I shouldn't be thinking like the witch.

348
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,156
I should be thinking like the game master!

349
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,325
Game master?

350
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,703
Don't you think this seems tailor-made

351
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,830
for the players, for this place,
and for this time?

352
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,542
After Hatter was killed,

353
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,876
Momoka was murdered.

354
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,712
Someone who knows
the ins and outs at the Beach

355
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,589
made this game
after calculating the timing.

356
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,551
They calculated the timing?

357
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,554
Their deaths did not just occur
at the same time by chance.

358
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,393
The game master had likely been
waiting for this moment.

359
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,478
Seriously?

360
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,523
Then who is the witch?

361
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:53,529
Hatter's death was made known
after Momoka died.

362
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,949
Those who knew of Hatter's death

363
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,452
were only the militants
and the executive members.

364
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:06,375
But the game master might have
known of Hatter's death somehow.

365
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,838
Then all the Beach members are suspects.

366
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,009
When I passed by the lobby
one hour before the game started,

367
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,761
Momoka's body wasn't there yet.

368
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,350
So someone moved her body
during that time frame.

369
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,854
There's no point in asking
since the witch can lie.

370
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,063
The question is…

371
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,152
Why did the game start now?

372
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,780
Why did they wait for Hatter's death

373
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,033
before they started the game?

374
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:44,705
It was to throw the Beach
into a state of chaos.

375
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:50,252
If that was the case,
if I were the game master…

376
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,029
Don't tell me…

377
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,240
I got it!

378
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,668
If we stop here,
then all we did would be pointless.

379
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:31,877
We can't stop now!

380
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,473
Time remaining, 20 minutes.

381
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,697
Arisu.

382
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,285
I think I know…

383
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,872
who the witch is.

384
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,542
