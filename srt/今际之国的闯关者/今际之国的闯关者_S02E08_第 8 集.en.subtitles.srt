1
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,733
Allow me to explain the rules.

2
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,696
Here's the game we are about to play.

3
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,407
Difficulty level, Queen of Hearts,

4
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,742
"Croquet."

5
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,786
"Croquet"?

6
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,663
Often called lawn billiards,

7
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,833
it's a ball game that was popularized
in 19th century England.

8
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,338
But I'm afraid
it's not very well-known in Japan.

9
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,882
I don't know the rules.

10
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,886
It's perfectly fine if you don't know
how to play croquet properly.

11
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,846
You see,

12
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,266
it doesn't matter if you win or lose.

13
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,310
What?

14
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,438
To clear this game,

15
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,360
you simply need to play
three rounds of croquet without quitting.

16
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,030
If you quit before we're done,
it's game over.

17
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,949
You can even have weapons.

18
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:01,329
The only rule is
to complete three rounds of croquet.

19
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,671
If we play until the end,
we clear the game even if we don't win?

20
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,715
That's right. Easy, isn't it?

21
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,720
Now, let's enjoy ourselves.

22
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:38,426
The game is played with
a wooden mallet and two balls.

23
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:42,722
You must hit both balls
through six hoops in a prearranged order

24
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,643
and then hit the finishing peg
before the other player to win.

25
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,881
Yes!

26
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,975
Round 1, I won.

27
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,231
If we play three full rounds
without quitting, we clear the game

28
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,900
and we win.

29
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,569
Just two more rounds.

30
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,656
What in the world is she thinking?

31
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,622
Okay, now for Round 2.

32
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,981
She's simply dragging the game out.

33
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,067
She's just entertaining herself.

34
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,986
We need to finish this game fast.

35
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,590
Oh, my! This is such fun!

36
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,344
Nice!

37
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,182
This is never going to end.

38
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,162
Yes!

39
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:44,862
I won.

40
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,578
Looks like I lost Round 2.

41
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,456
You've got talent for this.

42
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,668
Okay, let's play Round 3.

43
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,547
I'm feeling a bit weary.

44
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,466
Why don't we have some tea?

45
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,301
Tea?

46
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,354
Forget the tea.

47
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,981
Let's hurry up and play.

48
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:25,278
Enjoying tea during a match is
proper etiquette for ladies and gentlemen.

49
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,614
Please, enjoy your tea.

50
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,882
When this game is over,
can we go back to the real world?

51
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,594
You'll know when it's over.

52
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,264
Don't ask her any more questions.

53
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,309
Don't listen to what she says.

54
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:00,146
Just finish this game.
That's all we need to do.

55
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,024
Do you want to know the answer that badly?

56
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,073
My friends died
without knowing the answer.

57
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,496
I want to know the answer
for their sake as well.

58
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,290
That's why I've come this far.

59
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:23,211
And you want to return to the real world.

60
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,923
Can we?

61
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,760
Who knows?

62
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,971
I certainly can't tell you that.

63
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,230
Besides, this just might be
the ruins of that other world.

64
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,690
You talk like that,

65
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,527
but I bet you don't even know
the answer yourself.

66
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,904
I do know.

67
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,121
I guess I have no choice.

68
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,792
If you want to know that badly,

69
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,503
I'll just have to tell you

70
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,756
the truth about this land.

71
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,893
However, you must accept that
no matter what I tell you,

72
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,897
it was you who wanted to hear it.

73
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,276
Don't you forget that.

74
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,702
Have you sometimes wondered

75
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,246
what the world
would be like in the future?

76
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,123
In the future?

77
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,082
Yes.

78
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,460
Nanotechnology, renewable energy,

79
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:51,048
iPS cells, virtual reality,
cryonics, terraforming…

80
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:58,472
The technology of your era is
still filled with hopes and fantasies.

81
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,476
You should probably be happy.

82
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,188
All those things became a reality.

83
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:11,611
In fact, technology achieved
radical developments and advances.

84
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,740
In 30 years, the economies
of developing countries will grow,

85
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,076
and the barriers to improving
living standards will be demolished.

86
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:24,498
In 50 years, lives will be prolonged
thanks to genetic manipulation.

87
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,043
Hold on.

88
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,046
What's this all about?

89
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,883
Don't you understand?

90
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,762
I'm simply telling you

91
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,684
what the future will be like
1,000 years from now.

92
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,438
A thousand years?

93
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,815
In the future?

94
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,737
Since the human race obtained
even greater mental capacity,

95
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,699
perpetual discoveries will be made
in every field of knowledge.

96
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,997
Ten years after the present, that is,
the time you believe you live in,

97
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,875
avatars and virtual reality

98
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,961
will become the way that life is lived,
including how we work and have fun.

99
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,798
In 50 years,
genetic engineering will be used

100
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,301
to treat all diseases,
such as cancer and dementia.

101
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,677
In 100 years,

102
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,264
due to the development of weather control
and other environmental regulating tech,

103
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,933
natural disasters will be eliminated.

104
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:24,934
In 200 years,

105
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,561
due to a perfect understanding
of brain mechanisms,

106
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,064
it will be possible
to transfer memories and consciousness.

107
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,399
In 300 years,

108
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,026
humans will no longer die
from natural causes

109
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,237
and we will live an average of 300 years.

110
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,655
In 400 years,

111
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,033
due to a perfect understanding of physics,
we'll understand all laws of causality

112
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:46,122
and be able to scientifically explain
even things such as coincidence and fate.

113
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,459
In 500 years,
nothing unexpected will ever happen.

114
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,463
By achieving
perfect control over everything,

115
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,298
humanity will become nearly immortal.

116
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,552
For the next 500 years,

117
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,888
we'll be able to live
just by injecting pleasure compounds.

118
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,933
That is what the world will be like
1,000 years in the future.

119
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:10,372
In fact, right now, you are playing
this game in virtual reality.

120
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,876
You're in a deep sleep,
so you've forgotten that.

121
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,254
This kind of game tourism
is the most popular activity

122
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,256
a thousand years in the future.

123
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:25,471
Since we have become nearly immortal,
we have little reason to live.

124
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,723
The era of 1,000 years earlier,

125
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,602
where the threats of death
and the end of the world were a reality,

126
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,480
has captured our fascination.

127
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,073
Incidentally,
I am the administrator of this system.

128
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,167
Just kidding! I lied about all that.

129
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,336
What?

130
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,256
Cut the crap!

131
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,093
The truth is…

132
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,805
due to genetic manipulation,

133
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,808
massive amounts
of mutant vegetation appeared.

134
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,936
You saw it too, right?

135
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,941
The city has become overrun
with vegetation.

136
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:25,489
The city became surrounded by mountains.

137
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,373
It was aliens that brought this about.

138
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,459
Aliens?

139
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,088
They captured all of humanity
and wiped out our memories,

140
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:45,759
and forced us to play all these games
to conduct behavioral experiments on us.

141
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,806
Is that the truth?

142
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,268
Yes, it's the truth.

143
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,645
But…

144
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:02,985
there is this rumor circulating among
the humans forced to play these games.

145
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,448
In actuality, due to a nuclear war,

146
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,659
humans can no longer live
on the Earth's surface.

147
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,661
Now, the ultra-wealthy,
who live underground,

148
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,664
have put androids
implanted with artificial memories

149
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:20,836
on the surface to play games,
and are betting on which will survive.

150
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,270
You believe

151
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:43,859
that you're oppressed humans who are
being forced to play games by aliens.

152
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,194
But the truth is

153
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,783
you're nothing more than androids
that have been implanted

154
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,410
with artificial memories.

155
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,914
And that's the truth?

156
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,335
Just kidding.

157
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,088
We just need to finish one more round.

158
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,590
Stop listening to Mira.

159
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,135
I bet you don't even know the truth.

160
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,640
Maybe so.

161
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,728
Is the truth really that important?

162
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,651
You want to know
for the sake of your deceased friends?

163
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,867
You poor thing.

164
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,205
I can see that your deceased friends

165
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,209
were very, very precious to you,
weren't they?

166
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:52,428
Incidentally,
I made the Seven of Hearts game.

167
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,932
I mean, you were so close, I just had to.

168
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,769
Arisu!

169
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,104
It's all right.

170
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,023
Please don't stop him.

171
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,903
Having something to hate
is one of the greatest motivators in life.

172
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,097
This is also part of your plan, isn't it?

173
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,646
To have yourself killed

174
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,107
while the game's still going on.

175
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,528
If I kill you in this game,

176
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:56,950
I won't be able to clear the game
and there will be no game over for me.

177
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:01,997
In other words,
this game will continue forever.

178
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,500
If that happens,

179
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:09,379
then all the players in this land
will just wait until their visas run out.

180
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,175
That's exactly

181
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:19,264
the kind of extreme despair
that you wanted to thrust on us.

182
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,567
While you were playing the games,

183
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,947
didn't you also lose all interest
in what happens in the world?

184
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,952
Did you care about how the world works,
or what its grand purpose is?

185
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,206
Did you care about any of that?

186
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,210
Those things
didn't matter anymore, did they?

187
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,968
Then why does it even matter
what the real truth is?

188
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,430
Arisu, don't listen to Mira.

189
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,349
-I want to know the truth.
-Arisu!

190
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,433
You really want to know?

191
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,021
Yes.

192
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,864
Then I guess you're prepared
to accept the truth, aren't you?

193
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,538
All right.

194
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,042
I'll stop prevaricating
and reveal the real truth.

195
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,463
I'll start with the reality.

196
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,509
The world you can see now

197
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,720
is not real.

198
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,805
It's an illusion.

199
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,104
You're saying this is all an illusion?

200
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,317
Since you've been here, didn't you doubt
even just once that it was real?

201
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,652
The desolate city,

202
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,947
radical technology, and ludicrous games.

203
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,490
Is it aliens? People from the future?

204
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,701
Even if they were behind it all,

205
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,538
can you think of any serious reason
why they'd run these games?

206
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,420
Tag and hide-and-seek are
both children's ideas.

207
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,633
Nothing can happen here
that is beyond your own imagination.

208
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:30,979
It's only natural that a person
like yourself would survive until now.

209
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,691
You see, that's because…

210
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,737
these things are happening in a tiny world

211
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:44,409
that exists inside
the mere 1,500 grams of your own brain.

212
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,847
Arisu, don't pay attention to her.

213
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,892
If this were an illusion,

214
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,105
then it means you believe that
my life is something you imagined!

215
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,232
But I'm right here, alive!

216
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,441
That's right.

217
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,821
You do exist.

218
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:26,618
But that is not the reality
that Arisu sees.

219
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,161
What?

220
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,623
Arisu.

221
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,294
Don't you remember

222
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,213
what happened then?

223
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,552
When you lost

224
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,723
your precious friends.

225
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,061
The shock was so traumatic,
you lost all memory of what happened.

226
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:58,942
I am

227
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:06,241
your doctor, Mira Kano, a psychiatrist.

228
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,997
You are receiving counseling from me.

229
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,418
You simply

230
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,379
don't remember it.

231
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,175
You just don't remember.

232
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,849
So…

233
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,561
Do you remember now?

234
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,482
Are your memories

235
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,818
gradually returning?

236
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,873
How about it, Arisu?

237
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:43,004
Are your memories gradually returning?

238
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,678
Chota…

239
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,639
Karube…

240
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,819
You two sure are close.

241
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,072
She's always

242
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,826
worried about you.

243
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,917
She also lost someone precious to her

244
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,503
and has been hospitalized here.

245
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,304
Okay now.

246
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,639
Tell me.

247
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,603
Tell me what really happened

248
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,899
when you saw those fireworks.

249
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,157
Okay.

250
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,743
Try to remember.

251
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,790
At that time…

252
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,381
-Hey!
-Oh, shit!

253
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,136
-Yikes!
-That was close!

254
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,555
-Hurry up!
-Look, fireworks!

255
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,098
Run for your lives!

256
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,928
It was my fault…

257
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:57,973
that they died.

258
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,810
You remember it all now, don't you?

259
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,650
The one who killed them

260
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:10,986
was me.

261
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,739
What you wanted to know

262
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:20,078
wasn't why this world exists.

263
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,832
What you wanted to know was

264
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,003
what you are.

265
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,007
You want the answer

266
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,510
to why you live.

267
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,388
You want to know why you exist.

268
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,352
You grew up starving for love.

269
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,898
Long before you came here,

270
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,069
you've been looking for that answer.

271
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,116
That's why,

272
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,536
in your fantasies,

273
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:07,083
these ludicrous games appeared.

274
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,510
As you continued to survive these games,

275
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:23,433
your desire to know what this place is

276
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,854
and your desire to know why you exist

277
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,940
eventually became intertwined.

278
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,988
Does anyone

279
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,950
in this world

280
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,912
need you?

281
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,750
You think I can?

282
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,003
Come now. You're fully prepared, right?

283
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,630
I am, but…

284
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:02,305
Does your existence in this world

285
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,307
have any meaning?

286
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,616
What's your purpose in life?

287
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,333
How long are you
going to keep living this way?

288
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,673
Listen.

289
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,885
Is there a point in you being alive?

290
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,557
But now,

291
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,643
you're the one who survived.

292
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,818
My life is…

293
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,488
utterly pointless.

294
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:09,748
Those guys are the ones
who should have survived.

295
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,961
Karube…

296
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,589
Chota…

297
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,011
But instead,

298
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,307
it was me, whose life
is pointless, who survived.

299
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,442
I shouldn't be alive.

300
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,868
Arisu…

301
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,454
You wait outside.

302
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,790
I haven't called you yet.

303
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:54,793
Arisu!

304
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,710
Leave him be!

305
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:00,173
He's trying to remember everything now.

306
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,385
Listen! Listen to me! Wake up!

307
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,637
Stop it!

308
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,311
Arisu is trying
to remember his past and recover,

309
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,647
but you're preventing that.

310
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,525
-You're wrong!
-Get out.

311
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,322
Now then…

312
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,616
Arisu.

313
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,788
Let's bring this to an end.

314
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,293
If I can confirm your desire to quit,

315
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,464
the game will end.

316
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,679
The game will end?

317
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,145
I knew it. That wasn't…

318
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,107
an illusion.

319
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,492
I was participating in that game too.

320
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,140
Okay, now.

321
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,766
Arisu.

322
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,689
Let me confirm it with you.

323
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,192
You will…

324
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,071
quit the game, right?

325
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,138
You'll feel better
if you take this medicine.

326
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,142
Take it.

327
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,068
Then…

328
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,904
give me your answer.

329
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,716
Arisu… don't!

330
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,762
Arisu! Don't!

331
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,363
Put that down.

332
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,246
Arisu…

333
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,168
Remember what you said?

334
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,173
You said you'd risk your life to save me.

335
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,888
No matter what Mira says,

336
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,225
I am most definitely here with you!

337
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,854
I am alive!

338
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,319
If you still believe what Mira says,

339
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,951
then our time together will be…

340
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,623
nothing more than an illusion you created.

341
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,214
If it was all just an illusion,

342
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:19,766
then no matter what I do,
it shouldn't affect you, right?

343
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,650
Arisu…

344
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,154
Wake up.

345
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,593
Arisu…

346
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,304
Arisu…

347
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,440
Arisu…

348
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,443
Wake up.

349
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,864
Please!

350
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,289
What a beautiful sight.

351
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,791
But…

352
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,254
a person's love is ultimately powerless.

353
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,970
Arisu…

354
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,266
Please…

355
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,895
I…

356
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,357
shouldn't be alive.

357
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,652
I have no reason to live.

358
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,249
Come back…

359
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,544
Arisu!

360
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,432
The answer…

361
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,062
The reason for living…

362
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:00,152
Forget about those things, Arisu.

363
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,743
The answer

364
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,705
is different for everyone.

365
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,293
A reason for living…

366
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,382
It doesn't matter if you have one or not.

367
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,180
This whole time we've searched…

368
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,186
we've been searching together.

369
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,070
That alone was enough.

370
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,407
That alone…

371
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:58,044
The one who made me realize that…

372
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,800
was you.

373
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,014
It was you, Arisu.

374
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,762
You poor thing.

375
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,978
Looks like I've won.

376
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,655
You'll quit the game,

377
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,033
won't you, Arisu?

378
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,257
Then…

379
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,011
the game is over.

380
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,434
Usagi…

381
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,068
Usagi…

382
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,281
I want to

383
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,118
hold your hand again.

384
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,918
I want to

385
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,629
walk with you again.

386
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,887
I want to eat with you.

387
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,770
Me too.

388
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,116
I want to

389
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,748
say, "Good morning"

390
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,878
to you again tomorrow, Arisu.

391
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,218
I want to laugh with you every day.

392
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,097
Just once,

393
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,228
I'd like us to climb a mountain together.

394
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,648
Just being with you

395
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,902
is enough, Usagi.

396
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,615
And even

397
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,496
arguing sometimes would be nice.

398
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,836
I simply want you

399
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,382
to live, Usagi.

400
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,861
I want to protect you, Usagi.

401
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,632
Let's continue

402
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,802
the game.

403
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,646
Arisu…

404
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,358
It's all right now.

405
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,539
Use this.

406
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,219
How magnificent.

407
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,768
That was moving.

408
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,152
For her sake as well,

409
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,364
let's finish this game.

410
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:16,690
Yes!

411
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:32,789
Okay!

412
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:40,547
Yes!

413
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,218
Yes!

414
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,971
I won!

415
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,116
You played

416
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,452
three rounds

417
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,623
without quitting the game.

418
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,422
Congratulations, Arisu.

419
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,135
The game has ended.

420
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,099
At last.

421
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,270
Is it over?

422
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,195
Yeah.

423
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,907
We won.

424
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,551
So…

425
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,889
What is this place anyway?

426
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,103
Arisu…

427
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,566
You'll soon find out.

428
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,824
Of your two choices,

429
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,453
no matter which you choose,

430
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,539
you'll know the answer.

431
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,628
You'll know what kind of person you are.

432
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,215
You'll know.

433
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,969
Life is

434
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,515
like a game.

435
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,520
Enjoy it more.

436
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,885
Congratulations.

437
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:19,349
All the games have now been cleared.

438
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:35,801
Now, all the surviving players
will be given a choice.

439
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,263
Please select whether you will accept
permanent residence in this land

440
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,682
or if you will not accept it.

441
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,311
I repeat,

442
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:50,816
please select whether you will accept
permanent residence in this land

443
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,318
or if you will not accept it.

444
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,034
I don't want it.

445
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,359
I…

446
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,195
don't want it!

447
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,849
I don't want it.

448
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,416
Let's go back together.

449
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:39,382
PERMANENT RESIDENCE IN THIS LAND
ACCEPT. / DO NOT ACCEPT.

450
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,514
Of course, I'll take it.

451
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,476
I will gladly take it as well.

452
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,443
I…

453
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,864
don't want it, I think.

454
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,453
What will you do?

455
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,339
I don't want it.

456
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:52,872
I…

457
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,128
don't want permanent residence.

458
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:03,717
I also…

459
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,972
don't want it.

460
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,742
The usual?

461
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:32,829
Yeah.

462
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:34,831
Here.

463
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,586
What?

464
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,298
What?

465
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,261
Your nose hair is sticking out.

466
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,179
No way.

467
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:50,805
Seriously?

468
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,515
Just kidding.

469
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,267
You jerk! Cut it out!

470
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,357
You looked so depressed.

471
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:06,071
Hey, you know how you can put wax
on your nose hairs to remove them?

472
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,822
That must really hurt!

473
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,115
And they'll never come back?

474
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,909
Of course, they will.

475
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,078
A nose-hair cutter would be better.

476
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:17,165
But if something fell on your head
while doing that, it'd really hurt!

477
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,125
No. An explosion hurts more.

478
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,668
-It sure does.
-For sure.

479
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,426
I'm sorry.

480
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,513
I'm sorry.

481
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,432
It's all my fault.

482
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,227
I'm sorry.

483
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,396
"His fault," he says.

484
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,066
You're as overconfident as ever.

485
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:47,362
I bet you think you're alive because
you're special and a chosen one, right?

486
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,404
No, I don't.

487
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,323
It's all thanks to you guys.

488
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:55,120
It sounds like he believes
we sacrificed ourselves so he could live.

489
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,289
Dang, Chota.
That's a pretty cruel thing to say.

490
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,708
Can't you see?
Arisu doesn't get it at all.

491
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:03,670
What's with you guys?

492
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,381
What are you trying to say?

493
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,217
Make yourselves clear!

494
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,139
One thing I can say for sure is…

495
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:21,646
there wasn't a single game
that you cleared by your own effort alone.

496
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:26,359
If you thanked us forever,
it would never be enough.

497
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,111
Then…

498
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,698
should I apologize
for the rest of my life?

499
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,285
Don't be stupid.

500
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:40,707
Live your life to the fullest
until the very end.

501
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,338
Okay.

502
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,008
I will.

503
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,138
It would be bad if zombies
were to appear in Shibuya, huh?

504
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,099
If they're all bitten here,
they will all turn into zombies!

505
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,810
Stop it with the zombie talk,
and think about which shop to go to.

506
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,772
But if zombies were to appear,
I guess only Karube would survive.

507
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,607
You'd knock those zombies out
with one punch.

508
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,943
No, it wouldn't be me.

509
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,861
You'd be the one to survive, Arisu.

510
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,446
Me? Why?

511
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,949
I'm sure you're the one who will survive.

512
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:00,453
All right.

513
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:01,955
Here we go.

514
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,374
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

515
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,376
This is your Independence Day!

516
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:07,627
Passing through!

517
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,046
Move aside!

518
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,632
-Move aside!
-Hey, this is dangerous!

519
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,256
-Hey!
-Oh, shit!

520
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,761
-Hurry up!
-Look, fireworks!

521
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,394
It's the police! This is bad!

522
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:07,312
Let's run for it!

523
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,692
Over there!

524
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:55,837
Can you hear me?

525
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,172
-Can you hear me?
-Can you hear me?

526
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,674
-Check this one.
-Got it.

527
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,510
Checking for carotid pulse.

528
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,637
He's breathing!

529
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,682
He's conscious! Stretcher!

530
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,767
-His heart's started!
-Right!

531
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,311
Stretcher, over here! Hurry!

532
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,475
A meteorite has exploded over Tokyo,

533
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,895
causing severe devastation
in and around Shibuya City.

534
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:56,230
Firefighting has been proceeding slowly.

535
01:02:56,314 --> 01:03:02,153
The identified victims are:
Kodai Tatta, Saori Shibuki,

536
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:06,240
Takeru Danma, Sho Okada,

537
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:10,953
Daikichi Karube, Urumi Akamaki,

538
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:15,166
Momoka Inoue, Asahi Kujyo,

539
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,335
Chota Segawa…

540
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,048
Both Karube and Chota died.

541
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:25,468
How come only I survived?

542
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,930
Don't think about it.

543
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,933
It'll only make you feel worse.

544
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:39,607
That kind of thing
is called "survivor's guilt."

545
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,277
"How come only I survived?"

546
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:47,657
"How come they couldn't be saved?"

547
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:52,495
People who survive disasters and accidents

548
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,456
often blame themselves like that.

549
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,712
But when the first responders found you,

550
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,966
your heart apparently had stopped.

551
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,429
And for a whole minute.

552
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:16,269
For a whole minute,

553
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,521
you were at the border
between life and death.

554
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,024
One minute?

555
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,110
Yeah.

556
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,785
One minute, huh?

557
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,583
It seemed

558
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,044
more like

559
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,548
I was

560
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,636
in a faraway place for a very long time.

561
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,352
Dad…

562
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:00,730
He cried.

563
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,775
The last time he cried

564
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,570
was when Mom died.

565
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:44,649
Can I help you?

566
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:50,279
Apparently, your heart stopped as well.

567
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,617
How do you know that?

568
01:05:58,245 --> 01:05:59,330
It happened to me too.

569
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,417
What a coincidence.

570
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,339
Since you almost died,

571
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:11,801
did anything change with you?

572
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:15,596
I'm not so sure.

573
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,308
Well, I guess I look flashier than before.

574
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,852
What about you?

575
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,776
Since I've wasted my life until now,

576
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:34,824
I think I'll be able to live
a more useful life from now on.

577
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,161
That's about all.

578
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:45,793
So, you were
a good-for-nothing jerk too, huh?

579
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:48,587
Yeah.

580
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,682
-Doctor, please check this exam data.
-Okay.

581
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:09,900
He's come pretty far
for having survived a cardiac arrest.

582
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,069
-Bring me some gauze.
-Okay.

583
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,162
Are you a friend?

584
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,372
Well… No.

585
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:32,381
He's doing his best to survive too, huh?

586
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,384
Yes, he is.

587
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,782
Starting CPR.

588
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,909
-Prep defib, now!
-Right!

589
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:02,078
Ann! Ann Rizuna, can you hear me?

590
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,079
Ann!

591
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:03,996
Clear!

592
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:07,833
-No heartbeat!
-One more time! Charge it up!

593
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,836
-Right! Charge complete!
-Clear!

594
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,508
Her heartbeat's back!

595
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,344
Sinus rhythm.
BP is steady between 80 and 90.

596
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,513
She's back. Restarting surgery.

597
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:21,931
Pean clamp.

598
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,443
Are you all right?

599
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:35,778
Yes.

600
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,155
There's no need to rush things.

601
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:39,990
Okay.

602
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,456
Welcome back.

603
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,229
Hikari.

604
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:19,089
…and has approved two trillion yen
of national treasury disbursement.

605
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:26,388
It's been a week since a meteorite
exploded over Tokyo, and as of today,

606
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:30,142
many sections of the railway service
are still suspended,

607
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,812
and major highways are still closed.

608
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,060
Excuse me…

609
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:15,562
Can I use it now?

610
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:18,190
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

611
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:46,719
Wait.

612
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:48,971
Your change.

613
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:54,643
Thank you.

614
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:11,243
Sorry… Have we met somewhere?

615
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:14,747
I don't think so.

616
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:20,336
Wait.

617
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,176
Are you sure we've never met before?

618
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:29,470
What?

619
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,060
Are you

620
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,479
hitting on me?

621
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:42,316
No. I'm not doing that.

622
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,862
Well… Then…

623
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:52,201
would it be all right
if I was hitting on you?

624
01:13:01,835 --> 01:13:02,753
Sorry.

625
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,214
That was a weird thing to say.

626
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:13,138
I think we may have met before.

627
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,018
Last year?

628
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,312
Two years ago?

629
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:22,356
When was it?

630
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:25,859
I forgot,

631
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,570
but I think we did somewhere.

632
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,749
Say, the weather's nice.

633
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:46,088
How about taking a walk out in the garden?

634
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,508
Sure.

635
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:02,372
Wait up!

636
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:35,711
