1
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,041
That person…

2
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,752
I killed her.

3
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,509
Everyone was made
to participate in the game.

4
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,220
It's no one's fault.

5
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,517
Just what in the world is this?

6
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,106
Who knows? I don't know either.

7
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,483
But…

8
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,196
It amazes me
that I'm willing to do anything

9
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,615
just so that I can survive.

10
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,996
If we weren't willing,
we might as well die.

11
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,265
My visa ends today.

12
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,861
Do you even know how hard I worked
to get into this company?

13
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,366
I even had to have sex
with someone like that.

14
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,912
I finally got promoted too.

15
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:09,999
Saori,

16
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,834
I talked to the HR department already.

17
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,419
Cypher Bank Holdings…

18
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,671
PERSONNEL CHANGE NOTIFICATION

19
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,258
…strongly recommends Saori Shibuki

20
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,426
as the leader
of the next generation AI development.

21
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,472
SPECIAL PROMOTION FOR ASSISTANT
IN THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM

22
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,934
I will survive

23
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,520
and return to my original life.

24
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,275
Arisu! Karube!

25
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,901
I'm so glad!

26
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,990
I was so worried because you guys
didn't come back this morning..

27
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,533
I'm so glad!

28
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,826
Hey.

29
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,036
-Chota!
-That hurts!

30
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,205
You're hurt?

31
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:50,999
I'm fine.

32
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,670
Someone radioed in?

33
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,171
Yes.

34
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,802
Thanks.

35
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,724
If we go to that place called the Beach,

36
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,226
we might be able to discover something.

37
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,229
Like where all the people
who disappeared went?

38
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,523
Could there be an evacuation shelter?

39
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,234
Maybe everyone else is there.

40
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,905
Are the closest beaches to us
in Shonan, Izu, and Ito?

41
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,450
They're so far.

42
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,786
We can get there.
It's just a matter of time.

43
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,206
What should we do?

44
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,958
Shall we try going there?

45
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,169
In any case,

46
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,714
we have no choice
but to trust that voice for now.

47
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,051
Chota won't be able to make it
with his leg injury.

48
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,763
You're right.

49
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,141
Both of us…

50
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,603
Our visas will expire today.

51
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:02,278
We'll clear today's game
and increase your visa days.

52
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,529
And then,

53
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,699
let's search for the Beach tomorrow.

54
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,385
I will go to the Beach.

55
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,429
No matter what.

56
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,308
I will do anything it takes.

57
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,314
We still have hope.

58
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,417
It amazes me
that I'm willing to do anything

59
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,545
just so that I can survive.

60
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,968
If we weren't willing,
we might as well die.

61
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:23,860
Arisu?

62
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,617
What's the matter?

63
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:38,916
It's nothing.

64
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,055
Say something.

65
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,976
Like what?

66
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,271
Let's see, like gossip?

67
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,695
I saw someone die in front of me.

68
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,116
But I survived.

69
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,245
How should I say this?

70
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,123
You were glad.

71
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,086
Were you relieved?

72
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,842
I didn't think about that, but…

73
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,765
Even so…

74
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,436
I guess I do want to survive.

75
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,195
I told you that last time, right?

76
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,699
During my first game,

77
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,077
everyone except for me died.

78
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,291
I don't want to die like that.

79
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,212
I knew…

80
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,715
I wanted to survive.

81
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,949
Found it!

82
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,719
Please stay safe.

83
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,032
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

84
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,540
He's late.

85
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,168
Hey, should we just go?

86
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,879
No, we'll wait for Karube.

87
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,715
If we don't join the game,
both of us will die.

88
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,262
Let's go, Chota.

89
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,391
Both of you still have days left
on your visas.

90
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,987
Karube!

91
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,074
Sorry.

92
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,576
-I went to pick up something.
-What do you mean, "sorry"?

93
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,041
Shibuki and I…

94
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,168
This is the end for us.

95
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,047
What's going on?

96
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,800
Don't be so angry.

97
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,140
There's no time. Let's go.

98
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,021
Thank you.

99
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,502
Shall we?

100
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:52,062
SHINJUKU NATURAL BOTANICAL GARDEN

101
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,724
FEEL FREE TO USE ANY OF THESE

102
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,935
Are we going to dismantle something?

103
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,527
I'll have this.

104
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,030
That looks really impressive.

105
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,092
FACIAL RECOGNITION IN PROGRESS
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

106
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,932
Entry registered.

107
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,812
WELCOME! SPONSORED
BY SHINJUKU NATURAL BOTANICAL GARDEN

108
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,816
Please wear the goggles
and proceed into the botanical garden.

109
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,576
THIS WAY

110
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,395
REGISTRATION IN PROGRESS
CURRENT PARTICIPANTS

111
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,776
What is this?

112
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,240
It recognized Chota.

113
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,117
The target cursor turned red
when our eyes met.

114
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,327
It's eye-tracking.

115
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,914
What are they making us do this time?

116
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,666
Registration has closed.

117
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,752
The game will now commence.

118
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,170
THERE ARE CURRENTLY 4 PARTICIPANTS

119
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,047
Difficulty, Seven of Hearts.

120
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,965
Hearts.

121
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,842
Hearts? Isn't it…

122
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,097
The suit on a playing card
usually signifies the game genre.

123
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,100
Club refers to a team battle,
and Diamond refers to a battle of wits.

124
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,769
As for Heart…

125
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,688
It's a game of betrayal
where you play with people's hearts.

126
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,275
Seven. Isn't this quite difficult then?

127
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,152
This is terrible.

128
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,820
What should we do?

129
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,699
Game, "Hide-and-seek."

130
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,163
Rule. One person will be the wolf,
and the other three will be the lambs.

131
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,541
The one found by the wolf
will become the next wolf.

132
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,046
Hide well
so that the wolf does not discover you.

133
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,718
Clear condition. Whoever is
the wolf at the end of the game wins.

134
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,721
Time limit, 15 minutes.

135
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,390
After 15 minutes,

136
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,810
the collars
around all the lambs will explode.

137
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,019
What?

138
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,688
What is going on?

139
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,107
What does this mean?

140
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,652
How is this possible?

141
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,529
What?

142
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,991
This means only one person will survive.

143
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,368
What?

144
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,996
We'll play hide-and-seek,

145
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,958
and the person who is the wolf
at the end of the game wins.

146
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,377
The other three will die.

147
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,130
It's a simple game, huh?

148
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,635
The first wolf is

149
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:56,473
ID number 1000247.

150
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,059
Chota Segawa.

151
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,234
Me?

152
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,902
Game start.

153
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,574
Fifteen minutes remaining.

154
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,171
Stop it, Chota! If you try to
force it open, the collar might explode!

155
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,632
-Stop it!
-Then what should I do?

156
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,348
Arisu?

157
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,902
When two people lock eyes,
the wolf's role is passed on.

158
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,613
There's a flaw with the game.

159
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,574
If the wolf survives,

160
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,951
there's no point to the lambs hiding!

161
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,370
What should we do, Arisu?

162
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,500
Everyone!

163
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,800
Shibuki?

164
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,385
The one that needs to hide is the wolf!

165
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,305
-Are we going to die?
-We will if this continues.

166
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,556
But it'll be fine.

167
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,183
Shibuki!

168
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,101
-Karube!
-Karube!

169
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,977
Hey!

170
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:31,860
Wait up!

171
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,115
Hey!

172
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,078
Shibuki!

173
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,968
TROPICAL RAINFOREST

174
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,580
Come out!

175
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,333
Shibuki!

176
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,573
You can hear me, right, Shibuki?

177
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,950
Shibuki!

178
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,785
Don't run away.

179
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,622
Let's think of a way together.

180
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,415
I'm sorry.

181
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,250
I'm sorry.

182
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,800
What's the point in apologizing now? Hey!

183
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,929
-Look at me!
-Get off!

184
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,723
Stop it, Karube!

185
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,516
Hey!

186
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,145
Look over here!

187
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,486
Damn it…

188
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,140
Look over here, damn it!

189
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,183
Hey!

190
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,728
You fucking bitch!

191
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,110
Karube!

192
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,992
Arisu!

193
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,619
Both of you, stop that already!

194
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,164
Please! If we work together as usual,
we might be able to figure things out!

195
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,959
You're too naive.
This is a game of Hearts.

196
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,263
What is happening to all of you?

197
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,227
-You guys are acting weird!
-Damn you, Arisu!

198
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,314
Aren't we on the same side?

199
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,320
Time remaining, ten minutes.

200
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,197
Hey!

201
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,949
Arisu!

202
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,784
O Holy Mother…

203
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,330
-Please save us from our tainted souls.
-Where are you?

204
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,247
Arisu!

205
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,876
Our smiles are the light of hope.

206
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,921
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

207
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,799
O Holy Mother…

208
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,554
-Please save us from our tainted souls.
-Hey!

209
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,472
Hey!

210
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,600
Our smiles are the light of hope.

211
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,937
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

212
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,606
Damn it!

213
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,150
O Holy Mother,

214
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,488
please save us from our tainted souls.

215
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,492
Our smiles are the light of hope.

216
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,120
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

217
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,421
So that's how bad you want to survive.

218
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,840
Just give me a bit of time!

219
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,259
I will think of a solution to this game!

220
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,720
You'll think of a solution?

221
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,975
You just want
to be the only survivor, right?

222
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,230
It doesn't matter if you're dead!

223
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,358
Let me be the wolf.

224
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,027
You've been living
a half-assed life anyway!

225
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,739
There's no point if someone

226
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,991
who has the will to live on dies!

227
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,078
Arisu.

228
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,416
There is no hope left after all!

229
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,678
Chota!

230
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,431
-Let me go!
-Go! Quick!

231
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,684
Let me go!

232
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,353
Wait!

233
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,065
Don't go, Karube!

234
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,318
Let me go!

235
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,113
I let you fuck me!

236
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,324
Do you know who's on your side?

237
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,702
Let me go!

238
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,496
Let go!

239
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,748
-O Holy Mother…
-Let me go!

240
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,005
Eight minutes remaining.

241
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,098
-Let go!
-I can't!

242
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,686
Arisu!

243
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,401
Where are you, Arisu? Come out!

244
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,946
Damn it.

245
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,782
Are you planning
to just hide the entire time?

246
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,534
Damn it!

247
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,328
You lied to us.

248
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,545
And you said
it'll work out if we cooperate?

249
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,176
You just wanted to be the only survivor
in the first place!

250
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,140
Damn it!

251
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,101
Damn it!

252
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,770
I don't know what to do anymore.

253
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,648
Let go of me!

254
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,649
I'm sorry.

255
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,985
I'm sorry!

256
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,698
What's the point in apologizing now?

257
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,116
Arisu!

258
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,870
In the end,

259
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,414
that's all you can say?

260
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,713
Ever since you dropped out of university…

261
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,214
Hey.

262
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,302
All you've ever done is say sorry!

263
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,887
-Hey!
-I'm sorry.

264
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,598
I'm sorry!

265
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,725
I'm sorry.

266
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,360
Congratulations
on your acceptance, Hajime.

267
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,487
You really did your best.

268
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,531
Your mother would be so happy.

269
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,659
But this is just the beginning.

270
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,288
Even if I go to university,
I might end up like Ryohei.

271
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,084
Your brother doesn't devote himself
to anything. But you do.

272
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,753
You have something to work hard on.

273
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,131
You are different from Ryohei.

274
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,511
Ryohei, why don't you come over
and have some, too?

275
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,027
If you're just going to be
a loser forever,

276
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,239
then let me be the wolf!

277
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,621
Arisu!

278
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,882
Five minutes remaining.

279
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,011
Enough already.

280
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:06,434
I don't care who survives in the end.

281
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,482
But…

282
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,612
I don't want it to end this way!

283
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,512
Is this about Arisu and Chota again?

284
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,021
You're really kind.

285
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,487
I don't really expect anything from you.

286
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,199
Hajime…

287
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,082
This is awesome.

288
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,292
It's really good!

289
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,120
Arisu.

290
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,584
I have a dream.

291
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,881
I want to buy a huge farm in Australia.

292
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,844
I'll invite you guys over,
and we'll drink beer all day!

293
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,305
That sounds nice!

294
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,934
Then I'll deliver the highest-quality
beef steak to you through drone delivery!

295
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,897
The drone will be fully automated.
I'll make an app for it!

296
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,898
All right then.

297
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,983
-Cheers to our future!
-Cheers!

298
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,445
You better keep your promise,
you hear that?

299
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,084
Time remaining, three minutes.

300
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,015
I'll drop out.

301
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,689
I'll drop out of this game.

302
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,819
You guys…

303
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,239
are all I have.

304
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,452
If someone has to survive this game,

305
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,706
it's not me.

306
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,169
I'll leave the game.

307
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:32,010
Karube, Chota. Where are you guys?

308
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,056
Karube, Chota.

309
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,898
Karube!

310
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,775
Chota!

311
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:49,902
Hey!

312
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,617
Chota!

313
00:33:59,162 --> 00:33:59,996
Chota?

314
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,415
Where are you?

315
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,167
Chota!

316
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,051
Chota!

317
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,847
Chota?

318
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,850
Where are you?

319
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,351
Chota!

320
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,522
YOU BECOME THE WOLF IF YOU ARE FOUND
HIDE WELL SO THE WOLF WON'T FIND YOU

321
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,191
Karube!

322
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,568
Chota!

323
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,528
Where are you guys?

324
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,822
Please come out!

325
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,283
Hey!

326
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,079
HIDE SO THAT THE WOLF WON'T FIND YOU

327
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,420
Karube! Where are you?

328
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,466
Why are you guys keeping silent now?

329
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,720
Karube!

330
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:06,104
HIDE WELL, SHEEP

331
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,064
Where are you guys?

332
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,025
Karube!

333
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,071
Chota!

334
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,158
Chota!

335
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,578
Karube!

336
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,039
Come out, please!

337
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,875
Shut up!

338
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,129
Karube!

339
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,973
Making a ruckus like idiots

340
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,976
and drinking the whole night away.

341
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,313
When I'm with you guys,

342
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,066
I forget about all the troubles I have.

343
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:59,073
You remember, right? That hot summer day
we made noodles with shaved ice.

344
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,368
Karube, where are you?

345
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,663
Karube!

346
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,295
We laughed a lot then, didn't we?

347
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,507
Chota?

348
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,136
Chota laughed so hard
that noodles came out from his nose.

349
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,473
You don't have to mention that.

350
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,394
Where are you guys? Chota, Karube!

351
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,272
Arisu.

352
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,525
Live on for us.

353
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,996
Karube!

354
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,623
Chota!

355
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,751
Thirty seconds remaining.

356
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:03,846
It's not me.

357
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,432
I shouldn't be the one to stay alive!

358
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,060
Twenty seconds.

359
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,144
I'm behind you.

360
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,025
I'm sorry.

361
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,278
I'm sorry, Shibuki.

362
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,614
-Ten seconds.
-Arisu.

363
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,368
Thank you.

364
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:29,038
-Five. Four. Three. Two.
-Karube!

365
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,957
-One.
-Karube!

366
