00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,419
FRACTAL GEOMETRY

2
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,671
EVERYTHING ABOUT SACRED GEOMETRY

3
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,673
AUDI AND BMW
3D GEOMETRY

4
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,640
What a shitty brother.

5
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,559
Crap!

6
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,605
Shit.

7
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,483
Skipped your interview again?

8
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,573
After I begged them to consider you,
you're playing games?

9
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,119
Did I ever tell you to do that?

10
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,623
Dad also said
this is the last time he's helping.

11
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,876
He won't help you
look for jobs anymore.

12
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,463
I'm saying
that I never asked for your help.

13
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,923
But you needed it.

14
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,509
You're just a parasite at home.

15
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,556
Okay, I'm leaving then.

16
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,851
If only we could reset reality.

17
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,981
It was way better
when Mom was still alive.

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,250
Ryohei.

19
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,878
Just don't get in your brother's way.

20
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,304
ARISU RESIDENCE

21
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,323
CHOTA SEGAWA, DAIKICHI KARUBE

22
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,326
ARISU: CAN I GO TO THE BAR?

23
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,332
ARISU: I'M OFFICIALLY HOMELESS

24
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,525
Oh, boss.

25
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,277
-Good day.
-You're early, Karube.

26
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,864
I just happened to come in early.

27
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,699
Why are you here at this time of the day?

28
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,534
I have some business to attend to.

29
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,001
ARISU: KARUBE, YOU THERE?

30
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,464
KARUBE

31
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,674
How dare you put your hands on my woman!

32
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,800
-Fuck you!
-Stop it!

33
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,094
Shove it, woman!

34
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,768
I feel better now.

35
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:05,787
ARISU:
CHOTA, YOU WORKING? LET ME STAY OVER

36
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,459
CHOTA

37
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,136
Here, Mom.

38
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,599
I'm sorry that you have to do this
when you're so busy, Chota.

39
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,560
This will keep me going.

40
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,562
Let's make this the last time, okay?

41
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,358
How can this be the last time?

42
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,738
ARISU: HEY, ARE YOU IGNORING ME?

43
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,116
Even the air in Tokyo…

44
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,994
It has been contaminated
by the evilness of mankind.

45
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,997
We need to purify it!

46
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,000
Here, here, and here.
Everything has to be purified!

47
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,710
I got it already!

48
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,337
See you.

49
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,839
Thank you!

50
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,887
ARISU: FINE

51
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,657
KARUBE: I WAS FIRED FROM MY JOB

52
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,580
Karube has such bad timing!

53
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,458
ARISU: SERIOUSLY? WHEN?

54
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,712
KARUBE:
RIGHT NOW. I'M JOBLESS NOW!

55
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,631
ARISU: SERIOUSLY? WHEN?
KARUBE: RIGHT NOW. I'M JOBLESS NOW!

56
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:46,763
CHOTA: GOOD JOB GETTING FIRED
I'M SKIPPING WORK RIGHT NOW

57
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:52,018
KARUBE:
YOU SHOULD WORK, CHOTA. YOU ARE POOR

58
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,481
ARISU: I LEFT HOME

59
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,359
CHOTA: GOOD WORK

60
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,361
ARISU: I NEED A DRINK

61
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,987
CHOTA: ME TOO!

62
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,947
KARUBE: LET'S GO THEN!

63
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,950
ARISU: GO FIND A JOB, KARUBE.

64
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,619
CHOTA: YOU TOO, ARISU.

65
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,707
KARUBE: OKAY,
LET'S MEET IN FRONT OF SHIBUYA STATION

66
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,626
ARISU: OKAY!

67
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,543
ARISU: OKAY!

68
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,549
ARISU: I STEPPED ON SOMEONE'S VOMIT

69
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,094
CHOTA: GOOD JOB STEPPING ON VOMIT

70
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,612
ARISU: I'M HAVING THE WORST DAY

71
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,864
CHOTA: ME TOO

72
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,574
KARUBE: SAME

73
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:54,664
ARISU: I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
I'M DOING MY BEST SINCE THIS MORNING

74
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,544
KARUBE: ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOUR GAME?

75
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,217
ARISU: FOUND YOU, KARUBE!

76
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,346
KARUBE: HEY!

77
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,140
CHOTA: HEY!

78
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,725
ARISU: HEY!

79
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,478
Just talk.

80
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,356
So where to?

81
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,109
There are only a few pubs open, right?

82
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,444
Man.

83
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,156
We're all chased out with nowhere to go.

84
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,120
Oh, well.

85
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,706
Wish I could go to some unknown place.

86
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,713
It would be bad if zombies
were to appear in Shibuya, huh?

87
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,215
If they're all bitten here,
they will all turn into zombies!

88
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,885
Stop it with the zombie talk
and think about which shop to go to.

89
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,096
But if zombies were to appear,
I guess only Karube would survive.

90
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,515
You'd knock those zombies out
with one punch.

91
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,058
No, it wouldn't be me.

92
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,852
You'd be the one to survive, Arisu.

93
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,437
Me? Why?

94
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,065
I'm sure you're the one who will survive.

95
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,655
Arisu, you know…

96
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,577
Stop hanging out with us
and go live a normal life.

97
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,622
You can do it.

98
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,374
What?

99
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,335
What's with that?

100
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,014
All right.

101
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,391
Here we go.

102
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,893
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

103
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,937
This is your Independence Day!

104
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,063
Let's take a photo!

105
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,189
Okay!

106
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,692
Passing through!

107
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,943
Move aside!

108
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,779
-Move aside!
-Hey, this is dangerous!

109
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,615
-Hey!
-Come on, let's take a photo!

110
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,200
We're here!

111
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,827
Hey, what are you doing?

112
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,828
Take a photo!

113
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,788
Hey, don't take my picture!

114
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,165
Here, Arisu! Look over here!

115
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,042
Come on, Arisu!

116
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,752
-Here!
-Smile!

117
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,171
Stop it already!

118
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,841
That's a good expression!

119
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,692
This is nice!

120
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,862
Great!

121
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,203
Shibuya!

122
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,748
You're the best!

123
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,132
-Hey!
-Oh, shit!

124
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,678
-Yikes!
-That was close!

125
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,097
-Hurry up!
-Look, fireworks!

126
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,224
Run for your lives!

127
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,193
It's the police! This is bad!

128
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,319
Let's run for it!

129
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:55,988
Where to now?

130
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,456
Over there!

131
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,751
Police!

132
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,628
Head for the restroom!

133
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,546
Sorry!

134
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,429
Hurry!

135
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,932
-Just hurry up already!
-Hurry up!

136
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,741
CHOTA: WHO FARTED?

137
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,458
CHOTA: WHO WAS IT? OWN UP
AND SNIFF UP YOUR OWN FART!

138
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,422
It was you, right?

139
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,860
Power outage.

140
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,627
I'll go out and check.

141
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,464
Be careful.

142
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,763
What?

143
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,662
Emi.

144
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,586
Emi!

145
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,687
WHERE'S THAT FILE?!
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER! - TAKAGI

146
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,613
Are you serious…

147
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,144
Hey!

148
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,690
Hello?

149
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,572
Anyone here?

150
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,539
Hello?

151
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,440
Did you find anyone?

152
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,483
No.

153
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,110
How was it?

154
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,196
There's no one around at all.

155
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,746
Even our cellphones aren't working.

156
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,595
Could it be an evacuation drill?

157
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,015
What's that?

158
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,354
An event? A flash mob, maybe?

159
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,023
The scale is too huge for that.

160
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,738
If only the three of us remain here…

161
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,590
This doesn't seem so bad to me.

162
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,093
What?

163
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,179
Don't you find this exciting?

164
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,599
Are you insane?

165
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,313
You're right. I think this is quite nice.

166
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,272
Hey.

167
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,858
I don't have to go to work.

168
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,069
Have you guys gone crazy?

169
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,071
No one would be angry at us.

170
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,407
And we can eat and drink
all we want, right?

171
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,286
You'll be a virgin your entire life.

172
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,414
I don't want that.

173
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,848
All right!

174
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,766
All right.

175
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,024
-Isn't this nice?
-Perfect!

176
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,068
-Hey.
-Arisu!

177
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,861
Stop joking around, you guys!

178
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,154
Karube!

179
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,741
-It hurts!
-Come on, say that it's nice!

180
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,413
Look.

181
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,800
WELCOME, PLAYERS
THE GAME WILL COMMENCE IN A MOMENT

182
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,555
WELCOME, PLAYERS.
THE GAME WILL COMMENCE IN A MOMENT

183
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,598
Game?

184
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,358
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

185
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,570
Over there.

186
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,324
There are lights.

187
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,076
Is someone there?

188
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,830
Let's go.

189
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,789
Okay.

190
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,605
GM BUILDING

191
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:37,350
THE GAME ARENA IS UP AHEAD

192
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,704
ONE PER PERSON

193
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,037
FACE RECOGNITION IN PROGRESS
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

194
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,164
It has facial recognition.

195
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,125
Can we use these phones?

196
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,878
There's no signal.

197
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,922
We can't make calls with this.

198
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,176
Please wait for the game to commence.

199
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,389
Two minutes until registration closes.

200
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,559
There are currently three participants.

201
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,561
What's this?

202
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,188
A game.

203
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,026
There's a human.

204
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,569
Hey.

205
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,112
Do you know where everyone went?

206
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,881
What was that just now?

207
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,507
A laser?

208
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,634
CONNECT LIGHT
CHOTA SEGAWA

209
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,095
Once you cross the borderline,
you can never return.

210
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,806
You have no choice
but to participate in the game.

211
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,368
It might be best not to go any further.

212
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,251
I'm so relieved!

213
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,004
Geez, I thought
I wouldn't find anyone here!

214
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,593
My condolences.

215
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,937
Registration has closed.

216
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,064
The game will now commence.

217
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,274
Game?

218
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,611
Game, "Dead or Alive."

219
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,779
DEAD OR ALIVE

220
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,365
Difficulty, Three of Clubs

221
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,200
Three of Clubs?

222
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,868
What does that mean?

223
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,204
Rule.

224
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:30,125
Select the correct door
within the stipulated time.

225
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,751
What?

226
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,253
Clear condition.

227
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,256
Leave the building within the time limit.

228
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,430
START

229
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,810
You'll die if you keep spacing out.

230
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,320
There's no time.

231
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,179
The time limit for this room
is two minutes.

232
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,406
What's this?

233
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,289
LIVE

234
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,624
To live…

235
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,541
DIE

236
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,626
…or to die.

237
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,047
Is this really a game?

238
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,219
This is kind of starting
to get a little exciting.

239
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,100
I'm sure this must be some kind of event.

240
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,939
I want to go home.

241
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,317
It'll be fine. You're with us!

242
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,569
Let's win the game,
get the prize, and go home.

243
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,655
The prize?

244
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,074
I was hoping that we'd get one.

245
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,617
One minute remaining.

246
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,618
Arisu.

247
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,954
Which do you think it is?

248
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:31,955
Well…

249
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,875
If it's a choice between life and death,

250
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,961
I wouldn't choose the skeleton.

251
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,589
What if we choose the wrong door?

252
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,925
The answer is "Live."

253
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,135
Open the door that says "Live."

254
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,221
How do you know that?

255
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,266
Because obviously, it's the "Live" door!

256
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,770
Do you guys smell something?

257
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,523
Hey, look down!

258
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,484
Fire?

259
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,112
Thirty seconds remaining.

260
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,530
The answer is "Live"!

261
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,532
-Hurry up and open the door!
-Open it yourself!

262
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,284
What will happen if the time is up?

263
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,994
We have no time. Hurry up!

264
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,789
-Why do you think that's the answer?
-Clearly, we can't choose to die, can we?

265
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,165
Twenty seconds remaining.

266
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,584
I can't stand it anymore!

267
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,472
Did she die?

268
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,767
Ten seconds remaining.

269
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,188
DIE

270
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,692
Five. Four. Three.

271
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,277
-Chota!
-Two. One.

272
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,279
Quick!

273
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,116
The time limit for this room

274
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,993
is one minute and fifty seconds.

275
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,958
She really died.

276
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,335
What the hell is this?

277
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,047
You were the one who killed that girl.

278
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,965
But we survived because of me, right?

279
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,467
What?

280
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,384
Go on. Hit me.

281
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,137
If you guys keep spacing out,
you'll die too.

282
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,015
Damn it!

283
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,976
Do we choose "Die" here, too?

284
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,605
Since the last one was "Die,"
the next one should be "Live."

285
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,358
Yes. It can't be "Die" twice in a row.

286
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,027
-But it's hard to choose "Die."
-I see.

287
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,488
I'm sure that this is a game for us
to choose a sacrifice

288
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,697
within the time limit.

289
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,657
Sacrifice?

290
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,742
There's probably no meaning to the doors.

291
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,494
What's important is
who's going to open it.

292
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,955
They're telling us to choose one person
within the time limit.

293
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,374
You sacrificed that girl just now.

294
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,626
Why don't you open the door next?

295
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,504
I believe if I were to survive,
it'll be for the good of all mankind.

296
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,381
Don't you feel bad talking about that?

297
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,550
One minute remaining.

298
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,056
No one's going to open the doors
at this rate.

299
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,350
Everyone's going to die
from the fire when the time is up!

300
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,893
Then why don't you open it?

301
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,813
Why ask someone to open it?
Do it yourself!

302
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,439
You also want to let someone else do it!

303
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,407
I'll open it.

304
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,078
Arisu!

305
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:18,830
LIVE

306
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,249
DIE

307
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,503
Stop, Arisu. Don't be provoked by her!

308
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,007
I'll open the door, damn it!

309
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,102
Thirty seconds remaining.

310
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,485
Arisu!

311
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,290
See?

312
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:06,294
You can't open it.
Even you would have sacrificed that girl!

313
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,628
Shut the hell up!

314
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,505
Twenty seconds remaining.

315
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,300
I'll do it.

316
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,885
He's got bad luck anyway.

317
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,137
-Karube!
-But we'll take turns!

318
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,433
You'll be next after me.

319
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,685
Ten seconds remaining.

320
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,145
Karube.

321
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,567
Karube!

322
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,947
-Five, Four. Three.
-Karube!

323
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,657
-Two. One.
-Hurry up!

324
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,663
The time limit for this room

325
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,832
is one minute and forty seconds.

326
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,545
-The time limit is shortening each time.
-I can't do this anymore.

327
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,922
We're taking turns.

328
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,965
You open the door next.

329
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,887
-I'll choose the door to open.
-Wait.

330
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,388
"Live."

331
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,182
Open it!

332
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,476
No.

333
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,275
Do you have any ideas, Arisu?

334
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:12,902
Ideas?

335
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,072
You always say that there's a solution
in every game, right?

336
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,574
-This isn't a game.
-You must know what to do!

337
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,828
You've always solved
puzzle games that I could never do.

338
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,789
-So do it!
-This is not a game, Karube.

339
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,290
It's all about luck here.

340
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,501
-Think, Arisu!
-One minute remaining.

341
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,420
There might have been a hint somewhere.

342
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,882
First, we went into this building.

343
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,175
Stop it already!

344
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,427
-Then, the elevator took us--
-I can't do this!

345
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,930
Don't give up, Arisu! We can't reset!

346
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,348
It's impossible, I'm telling you!

347
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,559
-I can't do this anymore.
-I'm telling you to think!

348
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,728
I've been working my ass off,
while you were just playing games!

349
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,313
What does that have to do with this?

350
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,816
You only know how to beat people up.
What makes you so big?

351
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,026
Well, I'm sorry about that!

352
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,403
Just stop that!

353
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,656
GM BUILDING

354
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,036
Wait a minute.

355
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,955
What's the matter, Arisu?

356
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,712
Thirty seconds remaining.

357
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,261
BMW 523d.

358
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,264
It was a BMW 523d.

359
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,057
So?

360
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,021
The answer is "Die."

361
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,732
-How do you know that?
-Ten seconds remaining.

362
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,774
There's no time!

363
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,610
I'll open the door.

364
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,487
Arisu! Are you sure the answer is "Die"?

365
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,406
-Please…
-Five…

366
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,827
-Three. Two. One.
-This means it's correct, right?

367
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,750
The time limit for this room
is one minute and thirty seconds.

368
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,585
What's going on?

369
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,961
Do you know which it is now?

370
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,174
The length of a BMW 523d
is 4 meters and 94 centimeters.

371
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,800
There was one parked outside here.

372
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,723
The length of the building
is equivalent to four of those cars.

373
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,476
This means that this building
is approximately 20 meters in length.

374
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,855
My feet are 28 centimeters long.

375
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,358
One, two, three…

376
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,153
It should be around six meters.

377
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,781
According to the evacuation map,

378
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,824
the elevator is at the corner
of the building.

379
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,622
The shape of the building is square.

380
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,208
These rooms are all square-shaped too.

381
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,919
Assuming that one side
of the building is 20 meters,

382
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,214
and the rooms are 6 square meter in size,
there can only be three rooms on one side.

383
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,008
-One minute remaining.
-Is there something I can write on?

384
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,426
Here you go.

385
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,973
Inside a square building,

386
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,308
assuming that each room is square,

387
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,018
this floor should have nine rooms.

388
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,063
-It's just like a puzzle game.
-It's Arisu's forte!

389
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,606
We started in this room.

390
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,443
The high-school girl died in this room.
This is the next room.

391
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,321
Thanks to Karube, we moved forward.

392
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,116
This means that the door to the right
cannot be accessed.

393
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,910
Then I opened the door to this room.

394
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:08,995
Twenty seconds remaining.

395
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,747
Through the process of elimination,
these two rooms are a no-go.

396
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,332
I'm sure of it.

397
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,667
Ten seconds remaining.

398
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,044
The answer is "Die"!
The "Live" door is a trap!

399
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,257
Four. Three. Two. One.

400
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:28,180
The time limit for this room
is one minute and twenty seconds.

401
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,182
If your reasoning works,
we'll be able to survive!

402
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,809
You're awesome, Arisu!

403
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,104
This game is not based on luck.
We can clear it together!

404
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,232
According to my drawing,
the next is "Die" too.

405
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,192
All right!

406
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,529
Ready?

407
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,781
Come on!

408
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,659
All right!

409
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,203
The time limit for this room…

410
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,163
What's next?

411
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,081
…is one minute and ten seconds.

412
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,044
It's "Live."

413
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,465
All right.

414
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:04,842
Hey!

415
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,803
Hey, it hurts!

416
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,390
The time limit for this room
is one minute.

417
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,060
There's no door in the front.

418
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,270
All right!

419
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,189
-That hurts!
-Take this!

420
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,483
What's next?

421
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,117
Since the right door
is out of the question,

422
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,702
should we choose one on the outer wall?

423
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,247
Wait!

424
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,958
I might have missed something.

425
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,293
Fifty seconds remaining.

426
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,631
The room that we are currently in

427
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,133
is in the back-left corner
of the building.

428
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,512
The clear condition
is to leave this building.

429
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,723
We're compelled to choose
the "Die" door, which leads us out.

430
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,060
But if I recall, there is no gap
between this and the neighboring building.

431
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:59,271
The "Live" door leads us
to where the high-school girl died.

432
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,191
Why isn't there a door
to the rear of the building?

433
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,945
I must have overlooked something.
What could that be?

434
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:10,157
There's no space for any tricks
in the rooms we've come through.

435
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,200
If that's the case…

436
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,290
There's no time to waste! We'll die!

437
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,460
-You didn't even open the door!
-You were the one who pushed it onto me!

438
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,545
Give me a break!

439
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:23,921
A video.

440
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:24,964
Wait.

441
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,174
Chota!
You took a video in the first room, right?

442
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,926
We have no time for that!

443
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,719
Thirty seconds remaining.

444
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,096
I might have missed something.

445
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,431
…some kind of event.

446
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:35,766
Which do you think it is?

447
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,312
Hey, look down!

448
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,523
…will happen if the time is up?

449
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,858
I can't stand it anymore!

450
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,115
There's no door!

451
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,367
There's no door in the room
the girl entered!

452
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,035
-So what?
-There's a door here!

453
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,454
-Ten seconds.
-This means…

454
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,831
The room where the girl died isn't square!

455
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,917
-Then this door…
-There's another room behind that door! 

456
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,919
Four. Three.

457
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,213
Two. One.

458
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,470
The time limit for this room
is ten seconds.

459
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,138
Ten seconds?

460
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,431
Are you kidding me?

461
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,308
It's not "Live." It's "Die"!

462
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,101
Don't be tricked by the question!

463
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,645
Five. Four.

464
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,772
-Hurry up!
-Three. Two. One.

465
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,866
Head downstairs!

466
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,163
Hang in there!

467
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,222
GAME CLEAR

468
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,515
Congratulations.

469
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,354
It's all thanks to you guys.

470
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,565
Thank you.

471
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,697
This must be retribution.

472
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:04,039
To the survivors of the game,
we will now supply you with a visa.

473
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:07,251
WE WILL SUPPLY ALL GAME SURVIVORS
WITH A THREE-DAY VISA

474
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,420
Visa?

475
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,854
I'm going to... drop out of the game!

476
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,566
You guys.

477
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,402
There's no end to this game,
no matter how much you clear.

478
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,449
My visa ends today.

479
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,286
Finally…

480
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,956
This is the end.

481
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,009
GM BUILDING

482
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,745
When it's a new day,

483
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,539
you'll die if your visa expires by then.

484
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,252
Our visas will end too.

485
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,338
Three more days.

486
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,548
If you don't want to die,

487
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,593
you'll have to keep playing the games.

488
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:36,019
