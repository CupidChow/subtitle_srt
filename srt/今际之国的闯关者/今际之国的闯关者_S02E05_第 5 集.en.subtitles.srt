1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,007
Arisu!

2
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,391
Arisu!

3
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,319
Arisu!

4
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,346
Aguni…

5
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,476
Yo, newbie.

6
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,146
So, you survived.

7
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,399
As luck would have it.

8
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,028
I ran into Niragi too.

9
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,741
Guess he cheated death too.

10
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,623
What about your other pals?

11
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,419
We got separated from Ann and Chishiya.

12
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,215
Kuina went to look for them.

13
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,302
Tatta died in a game.

14
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,433
I'm going to look for Usagi now.

15
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,645
I see.

16
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,275
Where are you going?

17
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,403
To kill the King of Spades.

18
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,779
Give us a hand.

19
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,865
How are you going to kill him?

20
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,325
He's still just a human.

21
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,786
He'll have weaknesses.

22
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,497
You'll never kill that guy.

23
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,711
Yeah, so he's the perfect opponent for me.

24
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,798
It's the perfect game
for someone looking for a place to die.

25
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,884
"A place to die"?

26
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,177
I cheated death at the Beach.

27
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:03,391
I don't have anywhere to go back to
or look forward to.

28
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,480
Don't get me involved in this.

29
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,990
I've always wanted to ask you this.

30
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,993
What are you living for?

31
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,622
What is your purpose for living?

32
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,875
To get back to your life before?

33
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,544
Or to get a taste
of that chick you're after?

34
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,213
Aguni…

35
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,385
I don't need a reason to live.

36
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,517
As long as I'm still alive here,

37
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,063
I want to keep living.

38
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,318
Even if I've lost my purpose.

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,698
Such a weak spirit.

40
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,577
But that's what we humans are.

41
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,122
Yeah.

42
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,959
I'm jealous.

43
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,156
Whoa! No way! Your nails are so cute!

44
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,492
-Yeah! Aren't they?
-Where'd you get them done?

45
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:48,288
Let me see… A place near the station.
I forgot the name.

46
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,831
-Behind us.
-Hey, you guys!

47
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,294
-Want to go barbecue with us next Sunday?
-Barbecue!

48
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,378
A barbecue?

49
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,422
-Yeah.
-We'll cook out together.

50
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,300
To remember
our last summer in high school,

51
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,719
-let's go camping by the river!
-Sorry.

52
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,138
That day's the anniversary
of my mom's death.

53
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,098
Oh… Sorry.

54
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,726
We didn't know that. Sorry.

55
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,771
Of course, you didn't. I never told you.

56
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,231
What would I say?

57
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,151
"That dumb bitch died on a trip
when she was having an affair"?

58
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,029
Besides, it's so fucking hot,

59
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,698
so why would we want
to go barbecue outside with you guys?

60
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,660
-Heiya, that's going a bit far.
-They clearly have ulterior motives.

61
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,997
Did you think you had a chance with us?
Stupid fucks!

62
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,666
-For sure.
-Now, now. You'll hurt their feelings.

63
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,917
You think?

64
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,711
Later!

65
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,507
Wait. Don't you have
archery practice today?

66
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,885
I've lost interest lately.

67
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,180
You know, I heard Megu
and her boyfriend are gonna break up.

68
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,098
Seriously? With Odaken?

69
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,434
-They used to be so close.
-Yeah.

70
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,853
Actually, they weren't.

71
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,357
-What? What do you mean?
-How would you know?

72
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,527
He said he was sick of her.

73
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,863
He said he prefers me over Megu.

74
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:04,822
What?

75
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,283
Wait! You mean you hooked up with Odaken?

76
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,994
He's the one who asked me.

77
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,996
-No way!
-Only because you enticed him.

78
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:16,834
You really will do whatever it takes
to get the man you want.

79
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,047
-There's that look!
-Oh, cut that…

80
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,544
PLAYERS, PLEASE GATHER
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD

81
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:04,507
1 PER PERSON

82
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,624
PLEASE WAIT UNTIL THE GAME BEGINS.
THERE ARE CURRENTLY 17 PARTICIPANTS.

83
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,709
"Game"?

84
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,711
What's this all about?

85
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,798
What the heck is this?

86
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,051
Where'd everyone go?

87
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,264
If you want to survive,

88
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,059
you've got to clear the game.

89
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,734
Difficulty, Seven of Spades.

90
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,403
Game, "Boiling Death."

91
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,534
Rules: If you escape the arena
before it collapses,

92
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,785
you clear the game.

93
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,460
What the hell is this?

94
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,806
Oh, shit. What is this?

95
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,149
No way! I'm out of here!

96
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,984
Forget this!

97
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,409
It's hot! Oh god, it's hot!

98
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,963
I've got to pull it out.

99
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,380
Okay.

100
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,528
I'll admit, I was a pretty shitty person!

101
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,700
So I understand that
getting sent here was meant to punish me!

102
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,538
But why do I have to go through this shit?

103
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,084
It's all that bitch's fault!

104
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,322
This is so unlike you.

105
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,040
Takeru.

106
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,599
Why…

107
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,728
are you with those guys?

108
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,068
You even rescued Arisu.

109
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,155
Are you trying to atone

110
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:48,702
for killing all those people
in your attempt to die with the Beach?

111
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:55,501
Going down in a blaze of glory
fighting the King of Spades…

112
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,588
is more than one
who cheated death deserves.

113
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,306
If you want to die so badly,

114
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,019
why don't you just kill yourself?

115
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,540
Aguni.

116
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,126
Let's just stop this.

117
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,504
Don't let the deaths of the innocent…

118
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,299
go to waste.

119
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,845
I understand that.

120
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,681
Go away.

121
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,516
You awake?

122
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,943
What? Are you a virgin?

123
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,027
No!

124
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,250
Okay…

125
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,295
So, which way to the city?

126
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,215
What? You're going already?

127
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,175
I'm looking for someone.

128
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,137
You mean that "Usagi" person?

129
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,764
Is she a woman?

130
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,849
Don't eavesdrop.

131
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,694
Who's prettier, me or her?

132
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,195
What?

133
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,033
Must be me, right?

134
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:34,660
No…

135
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,203
What are you blushing for?

136
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,371
I'm not blushing.

137
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,632
I guess you're acceptable.

138
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,259
What?

139
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,096
-You're good enough. Let's do it.
-What? Hey!

140
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,767
We live in a stressful world
and could die any second,

141
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,352
so a woman has to cut loose.

142
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,187
-Cut it out!
-You know you want it.

143
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,781
This isn't what you think!
Don't get the wrong idea!

144
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,452
I mean, you never pay me
any attention, Aguni.

145
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,370
We're moving out. Get up.

146
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,789
I'm not going with you.

147
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,499
I'm going to look for Usagi.

148
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,669
You need to worry more
about yourself instead of others.

149
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,673
He only attacks
when he's got a pretty clear target.

150
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,551
He might know where we are.

151
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,094
I don't know how.

152
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,764
But it's too dangerous
to stay in one place.

153
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,600
We'll lure him into
a suitable spot in the hills

154
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,226
and kill him.

155
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,814
We need as many people as possible now.
Take this.

156
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,735
Wait!

157
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,239
Oh, god. He's such a stud.

158
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:03,290
The King of Spades targets areas
with lots of people.

159
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,878
But he seems to come after us a lot too.

160
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,713
He probably targets
troublesome people too.

161
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,591
I'll find a place we can lure him into.

162
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,058
The King of Spades never stops killing.

163
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,770
He's greatly reduced
the number of surviving players.

164
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,108
We escaped to the forest outside
the city thinking it would be safe,

165
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,068
but he still came after us.

166
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,534
According to my compass,
we should be near Kichijoji Station.

167
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,744
Then what's this place?

168
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,027
He must've killed himself
before his visa ran out.

169
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,991
What an idiotic way to die,
without even trying to fight.

170
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,536
In this world,
I can understand why he did it.

171
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,332
I'll never take my own life,
no matter what.

172
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,795
Have you lost anyone
precious to you in these games?

173
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,799
No.

174
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,678
But I did lose…

175
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,099
a part of my own precious self.

176
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,446
Akane.

177
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,495
Mom?

178
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,542
What are you doing here?

179
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,930
Akane!

180
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,527
Come here.

181
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,289
I can trust you, right?

182
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,947
It's not hot here!

183
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,083
I was the only one
who survived my first game.

184
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,380
Who would've ever thought
the ghost of that stupid, cheating bitch

185
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,299
would have saved me?

186
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,617
It's turning a funny color.

187
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,496
I'll die.

188
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,331
I'll die at this rate!

189
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,461
That's a pretty bad case
of gangrene there.

190
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:12,224
Unless that foot is cut off, you'll die.

191
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,726
Are you a doctor?

192
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,938
Then help me!

193
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,398
For free?

194
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,110
You want money? How can I possibly pay?

195
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,238
What? Money?

196
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,866
That shit's useless in this world.

197
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,868
You know what I want.

198
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,802
Fine…

199
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,433
Now hurry up
and do something with this foot!

200
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,166
My future self owes me one.

201
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:25,255
The only reason I'm here now
is that I worked so hard to survive then!

202
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,426
So I swore that I'm never going to die.

203
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,846
I'll survive no matter what.

204
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,151
I looked too, but there's nothing.

205
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,165
You can have these if you like.

206
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,592
Thank you.

207
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,847
Is he your son?

208
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,520
I saw him all alone at a Game Arena.

209
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:48,773
Where are your parents?

210
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,200
I think they may be dead.

211
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,454
He doesn't have much time left
on his visa either.

212
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,914
I couldn't leave him on his own.

213
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,292
Then…

214
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,295
even if he makes it back,

215
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,340
it'll be harsh for him.

216
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,345
Yes, it probably will be.

217
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,390
But…

218
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:28,938
I'm sure his parents want him
to survive and return to the real world.

219
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,027
They'll want him to find happiness there.

220
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,738
I'm sure of it.

221
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,471
Yuzuha.

222
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,348
Yeah?

223
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,975
If I die in a climbing accident,

224
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,062
don't you cry for me.

225
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,398
What's that all about?

226
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:16,403
For me, dying in the mountains
is what I want.

227
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,154
Cut that out.

228
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:25,537
Becoming an old man
and dying in a hospital isn't for me.

229
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,293
If I do die in the mountains,

230
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,380
it's proof that
I've lived life to the fullest.

231
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,800
So even if that does happen,

232
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:43,388
I want you to live your own life
to the fullest too, okay?

233
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,160
I should be in Yokohama by now.

234
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,765
How far does this forest continue?

235
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,571
We'll lure him here.

236
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,739
Here?

237
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,700
It's a cliff!

238
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,077
Nobody asked for your opinion.

239
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,296
Flares?

240
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,840
We'll set up a trap
so we know we're being attacked.

241
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,384
And we can see the enemy even in the dark.

242
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,637
It'd be better if we had grenades,

243
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,140
but we can at least set up tripwires.

244
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,517
Just tripwires?

245
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,812
There's no need
for the whole trap to be real.

246
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,107
What's important is to put stress
and pressure on the enemy.

247
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,651
You sure know a lot.

248
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,236
Yeah, I do.

249
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,321
I taught her.

250
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,198
You stand guard by the tent.

251
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,271
I was the bait?

252
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,023
You're a natural at being a decoy.

253
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,903
Is that guy immortal?

254
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,529
It's a bulletproof vest.

255
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,031
He must be a mercenary.

256
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,409
Let's cover each other
and force him over that cliff.

257
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,787
Go!

258
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,834
Arisu! Run!

259
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,384
Arisu!

260
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,218
Aguni?

261
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,526
Usagi!

262
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,208
Sorry.

263
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,235
Yes!

264
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,570
We won!

265
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,785
Yeah!

266
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,751
-We won!
-Yes! We did it!

267
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:22,878
Usagi!

268
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,342
Usagi!

269
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,781
I've cheated death again.

270
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,838
Go away.

271
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,095
Go away!

272
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,642
Aguni?

273
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,981
You're awake?

274
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,030
Thank god!

275
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,411
Thank god!

276
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,907
Difficulty level, Jack of Spades.

277
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,826
These face card games are rough.

278
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,162
Going at it alone is brutal.

279
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,207
I'm covered in wounds.

280
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,488
But I refuse to give up.

281
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,718
What is this world?

282
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,003
I won't go.

283
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,341
Do you want to die?

284
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,432
Then let's win and survive.

285
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,436
What'll happen if we win?

286
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,234
I'm sure…

287
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,571
we'll return to the real world.

288
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,118
My mom and dad…

289
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,914
They're not there anymore.

290
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,003
But…

291
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,883
what do you think
your mom and dad would want you to do?

292
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,597
They'd want me to go back.

293
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,059
Then let's go.

294
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:41,942
Hey, sweetie.

295
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,860
How old are you?

296
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:45,904
I'm ten.

297
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,116
Good kid.

298
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,790
This is a spade game.
You'll never win with a kid.

299
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,419
I'll get rid of anyone
who holds us back, even a child.

300
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,213
Don't hold it against me.

301
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,387
But you'll win, Usagi.

302
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,353
Arisu…

303
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,023
Usagi.

304
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,032
I knew you were still alive.

305
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,576
Me too.

306
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,954
How did you know I was here?

307
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,374
You're good at physical games.

308
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,837
Besides the King of Spades,
the only spade left is the Queen.

309
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,788
This boy…

310
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,707
His visa expires today.

311
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,334
Is that right?

312
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:27,089
I thought I could help him
if we played a spade game.

313
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,516
Game, "Checkmate."

314
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,101
"Checkmate"?

315
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:46,775
The Queen Team will compete
against you, the Challenger Team.

316
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,069
Welcome!

317
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:53,031
This is the Game Arena of
beautiful physiques and vigorous activity.

318
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,493
I am the Queen of Spades.

319
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:01,248
There are four members
of the Queen Team, including me.

320
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,167
There are 16 members of your team,
the Challenger Team.

321
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,837
Are they citizens too?

322
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,674
One person on each team
will be designated the King.

323
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,218
The King of the Queen Team…

324
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,345
is me.

325
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,599
As for the Challenger Team…

326
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,270
Who shall I pick?

327
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,398
I know.

328
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,526
I'll choose that boy.

329
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,630
The rules will now be explained.

330
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:56,303
Each team will alternate taking turns
for a total of 16 rounds.

331
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,722
When it is the Queen Team's turn,

332
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:03,393
the members of the Queen Team will chase
the members of the Challenger Team.

333
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:08,064
When the button on your back is pressed,
the button's light changes

334
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,776
from blue to red, the Queen Team's color.

335
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,986
THE BUTTON COLOR CHANGES TO RED,
THE QUEEN TEAM'S COLOR.

336
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:16,656
Also, during the rest of that round,
you can no longer move.

337
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,992
From the next round,

338
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:23,079
you must act
as a member of the Queen Team.

339
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,293
However, the King cannot change teams.

340
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,757
During the Challenger Team's turn,
the roles are reversed.

341
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,010
Each round lasts for five minutes.

342
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,222
The teams switch roles after each round.

343
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:44,851
Then after 16 rounds, the team
with the most members is the victor.

344
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:49,606
Everyone on the losing team,
including the King, dies.

345
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,275
What does all that mean?

346
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,653
I think

347
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,364
it's like chess or shogi.

348
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,075
If the other team
presses the button on our back,

349
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,701
we go to the other team.

350
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:05,789
Then, like in shogi, from the next turn,

351
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,749
we fight like a member of the other team.

352
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,295
Please equip yourselves with a button.

353
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,306
We have to put this on?

354
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,650
It turned on.

355
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:38,113
Round 1, the Queen Team's turn,
will now commence.

356
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,991
The round lasts for five minutes.

357
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,951
The game will now start.

358
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,211
Shit, they're coming!

359
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,840
They're headed this way!

360
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,385
If we stick together, they'll get us
all at once! Let's split up!

361
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,137
-Right! Everyone, run!
-Okay!

362
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,305
-Go!
-Right!

363
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,606
Wait here.

364
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,816
I swear we'll protect you.

365
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,277
Okay.

366
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,194
Let's go, Usagi.

367
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,918
Go! Hurry up!

368
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,091
Come on! Quickly, this way!

369
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,386
-Run!
-Don't leave me!

370
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,669
Once your button is pressed,
you can't move for the rest of the round.

371
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,964
You'll fight for my team next round.

372
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,805
Up there! They're above us!

373
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:29,933
Where?

374
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,644
They're heading your way!

375
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,096
Round 1 will be ending soon.

376
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:12,976
Ten, nine, eight, seven…

377
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,645
-Damn. There are more red lights.
-six, five, four…

378
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,106
-The Queen's turn will end soon.
-three, two,

379
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,190
one.

380
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,445
The Challenger Team's turn
will now commence.

381
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,032
The round lasts for five minutes.

382
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,742
Start.

383
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,327
Let's get back the people they caught.

384
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,414
There's no way
they'll actively work for the Queen.

385
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,207
They'll try to get back
to our team for sure.

386
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,251
You're right. Okay, let's go!

387
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,632
Hey! Over here!

388
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,925
Over here!

389
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,762
Up here! I'm here!

390
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,096
Come and help me!

391
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,723
-I'm on my way!
-Okay.

392
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,058
Don't move.

393
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,559
Hurry!

394
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:02,692
Hey!

395
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,652
There he is!

396
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,030
Here! Please!

397
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,795
The Queen's attacking?

398
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,171
She's using force.

399
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:27,175
The rules didn't say anything
against using force.

400
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,555
Round 3, the Queen Team's turn,
will now commence.

401
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,642
The round lasts for five minutes.

402
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,227
Start.

403
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,731
Anyway, we'll have to split up
and get them back one by one.

404
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,400
If we split up,
we won't know where each other is.

405
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,568
We may never meet again!

406
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,619
When a new round starts,
there's a siren and an announcement.

407
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,502
Let's look out from the ocean side
and see where each other is at that point.

408
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:03,962
Okay.

409
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:30,905
No!

410
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,241
Stay back! Back!

411
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,960
Do you want to survive?

412
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:46,754
Of course.

413
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,507
Then join my team.

414
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,845
One minute remaining in Round 5.

415
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:12,530
Hold up! Dammit!

416
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,458
Shit!

417
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,147
Found you!

418
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,613
Yes!

419
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,240
Damn…

420
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:02,539
Round 10, the Challenger Team's turn,
will now commence.

421
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,791
The round lasts for five minutes.

422
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,376
Start.

423
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:08,795
I'll get you now!

424
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,593
What? Hey, hold on!

425
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:35,196
Round 11, the Queen Team's turn,
will now commence.

426
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,532
The round lasts for five minutes.

427
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:38,950
Start.

428
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,619
-You okay?
-Yeah.

429
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,584
-Hurry up!
-Go!

430
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,211
-Wait!
-Why?

431
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,717
-Hey wait!
-No!

432
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,153
You stay on the Queen Team too.

433
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,155
What?

434
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,869
If we stay here, we don't have to
participate in other games.

435
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:26,247
We won't be chased down
and shot by the King of Spades either.

436
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,583
Nice, isn't it?

437
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,129
Are you players too? Like us?

438
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,130
That's right.

439
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,634
We played this game last time
and joined the Queen Team.

440
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,137
The Queen is tough. She'll always win.

441
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,765
When we win, we can stay in this arena.

442
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:48,019
As long as the Queen lives,
this game keeps on being played.

443
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,520
In other words,

444
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,691
as long as we're on the Queen Team,
we can survive.

445
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,027
How about it?

446
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:57,945
Awesome, isn't it?

447
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,386
-Found him?
-No. I'll look up higher.

448
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,388
-Okay!
-Damn!

449
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,524
Instead of dying in some other game,
it's way better to stay here and survive.

450
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:41,072
This game is easy
when we're all on the same team.

451
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,950
Let's all work with the Queen!

452
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,042
That boy…

453
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,336
I feel sorry for him.

454
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,380
Yeah.

455
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,841
But it can't be helped.

456
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,011
There are only three of them left.

457
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,265
Victory is within our grasp.

458
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,935
You people will survive.

459
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,230
Oh, yeah.

460
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,398
But…

461
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,276
there's one more that I want.

462
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,111
One more?

463
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,197
The guy who was with
the woman who brought the kid.

464
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,701
Oh, him. She called him "Arisu."

465
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,787
That guy…

466
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,294
He's my type.

467
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,383
Two people remaining until checkmate.

468
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:46,512
Round 13, the Queen Team's turn,
will now commence.

469
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,848
The round lasts for five minutes.

470
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,391
Start.

471
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,688
Found him!

472
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:17,710
Go!

473
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,003
She's after you, Arisu!

474
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:20,797
What?

475
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:11,384
