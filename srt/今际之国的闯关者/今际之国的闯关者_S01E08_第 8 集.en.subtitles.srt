1
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,356
-Oh, it worked.
-What?

2
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,859
Is that your phone, Asahi?

3
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,445
No, it's the one I picked up.

4
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,157
Is it recording?

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,074
Yes.

6
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,786
I think the camera is working.

7
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,309
Let's see.

8
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,395
There's no one in this town.

9
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,317
Everyone in Tokyo disappeared.

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,284
We're in Harajuku, yet there's no one.

11
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,994
Yes.

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,172
What's going on?

13
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,348
It's been five days

14
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,517
since everyone disappeared.

15
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,521
You're taking a video again?
What are you going to do with it?

16
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,106
To leave a record.

17
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,358
And why would you want to do that?

18
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,944
Someone might see it.

19
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,490
After that,

20
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,076
we met a certain person.

21
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,582
Then we were brought to that place,

22
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,504
and we work there now

23
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,762
Here?

24
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,608
Are you really going in?

25
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,000
It's pitch black!

26
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,254
Momoka?

27
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,381
Momoka?

28
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,717
Momoka!

29
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,729
Time remaining, 15 minutes.

30
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,203
Kill them all.

31
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,168
Jun…

32
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,380
I can't do this anymore.

33
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,299
We've gone too far to stop.

34
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,013
There's no way we can return
to our original lives

35
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,222
after killing so many people.

36
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,018
You heard me, right?

37
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,272
Anyone who goes against me is a witch.

38
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,528
Please shoot me!

39
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,531
Stop it already!

40
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,581
Let's end this game.

41
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,880
I…

42
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,466
I was confined by you guys

43
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,969
the entire time,
even when the murder occurred.

44
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,847
I'm sure you know

45
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,433
I couldn't have been the witch.

46
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,815
If you aren't the witch,
then there's no need to kill me.

47
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,111
Please cooperate with me
and search for the witch!

48
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,457
Arisu!

49
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,170
Stop it!

50
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,421
Hey!

51
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,841
Now I know.

52
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,844
The reason why you attacked Arisu,

53
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,596
even though
he's the only one with an alibi.

54
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,766
That's because you're the witch!

55
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,020
Arisu!

56
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,695
You…

57
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,364
Are you the witch?

58
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,417
Yes. I'm the witch.

59
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,856
Shoot me.

60
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,734
Do it!

61
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:33,244
-Shoot him!
-Aguni is not the witch!

62
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,081
This is a Ten of Hearts game!

63
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,959
A game that toys with people's feelings!

64
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,464
It's not a game
where you win by killing Aguni!

65
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,431
You're not the witch.

66
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,600
So why?

67
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,936
That's because you have another motive.

68
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,064
Another motive?

69
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,651
The one you killed

70
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,695
was not Momoka.

71
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,406
It was Hatter.

72
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,117
What?

73
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,417
I found out after I saw your eyes.

74
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,962
It was as if you had given up all hope.

75
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,592
Those eyes.
It was the same as mine that day.

76
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,970
Those eyes after I killed my friends.

77
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,852
You're not dumb.

78
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,189
Yet you wanted to kill everyone
right from the start.

79
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,483
That's not like you!

80
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,947
You must have had another motive in mind.

81
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,120
Ever since I came to the Beach,
I thought it was strange.

82
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,832
If you had these many firearms,

83
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,336
the militants would have gained control
over the Beach a long time ago.

84
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,130
Yet that didn't happen until now.

85
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,841
In reality,

86
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,303
you were not in conflict
with Hatter at all.

87
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,890
Didn't you both actually help each other?

88
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,478
You wanted to make sure

89
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,064
that dangerous people like Niragi
don't go on a rampage.

90
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,234
You tried to hold them back.

91
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,661
You…

92
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:44,667
Weren't you and Hatter
best friends in reality?

93
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,589
Then, why did you kill him?

94
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,219
For some reason,

95
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,890
you couldn't forgive Hatter
for what he did.

96
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,938
You wanted
to stop Hatter and his crazy ways.

97
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,738
You wanted your best friend
to regain his senses.

98
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,475
Will it continue?

99
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,645
Those games.

100
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,859
I…

101
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,071
will create a utopia here.

102
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,909
For those who have fallen into despair,

103
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,873
if we don't have hope,

104
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,416
we just need to make one!

105
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,297
This will be the land of hope.

106
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,260
That's impossible.

107
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,554
No.

108
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,976
We can do it.

109
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,444
Everyone here

110
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,988
is now one!

111
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,034
We shall unite and gather all cards,

112
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,037
and return to the original world together!

113
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,676
These guys.

114
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,471
They dared
to hide their playing cards from me.

115
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,953
Aguni.

116
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,501
As of today,

117
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,007
I will create a third rule.

118
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,185
"Death to the traitors."

119
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,860
What would you know?

120
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,369
Stop it!

121
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,762
What would you…

122
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,933
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

123
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,735
This way.

124
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,207
Congratulations.

125
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,890
How nostalgic.

126
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,436
This place looks exactly
the same as before.

127
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,734
I'm…

128
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,154
at my limit.

129
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,910
It's getting harder
to control Niragi and the militants.

130
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,457
Let's end the Beach.

131
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,297
End it?

132
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,509
All the members of the Beach

133
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,055
are immersed in the happiness
they found there, aren't they?

134
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,058
Returning to the original world
after we gathered all the cards

135
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,768
was just a big lie you came up with!

136
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,566
Let's end this.

137
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,071
Are you going to betray me?

138
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,497
"Death to the traitors."

139
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,878
The rules of the Beach are absolute.

140
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,421
There's no meaning to the Beach!

141
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,632
Let's stop this already.

142
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,888
We need to aim towards hope!

143
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,389
Stop talking like that!

144
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,310
Just where is the hope within the Beach?

145
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,190
A world like this,

146
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,818
where is the hope?

147
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,246
In the past,

148
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,210
I had trusted friends alongside me.

149
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,881
My hope in them…

150
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,427
was enough for me.

151
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,362
For a king…

152
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,536
There are times where
we have to make difficult decisions.

153
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:45,170
What a pity, Mori.

154
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,613
I was also someone who killed my friends.

155
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,951
I understand the pain in your eyes.

156
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,997
You killed your friend.

157
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,251
And so you wanted
to kill everyone at the Beach,

158
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,212
because they were the ones
who made your friend go crazy.

159
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,887
Your broken feelings.
The game master made use of them!

160
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:40,434
-That's why this is a Hearts game!
-Shut up!

161
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,811
Arisu!

162
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:49,651
If that's true, then Aguni just wanted
to kill everyone regardless of the game?

163
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,113
You're joking.

164
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,617
And we went along with that?

165
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,040
Just who is the witch?

166
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,626
I know who it is.

167
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,338
The identity of the real witch.

168
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:19,306
You can always see the game master's
characteristics in a game.

169
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,393
In a Hearts game,

170
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,314
it always makes a fool out of everyone.

171
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,732
NATURAL BOTANICAL GARDEN

172
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,568
Difficulty, Seven of Hearts.

173
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,363
A game of betrayal
where you play with people's hearts.

174
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,364
Everyone!

175
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,203
The one that needs to hide is the wolf!

176
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,497
Maybe…

177
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,001
there really was a way to end the game

178
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,713
without killing everyone.

179
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,300
A solution

180
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,722
where no one has to die.

181
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,060
But that's impossible.

182
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,397
We have to hunt down the witch

183
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,732
and burn them
in the Fire of Judgment, right?

184
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:12,943
No.

185
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,829
There's a witch candidate

186
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,790
that makes it possible.

187
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,212
It is possible…

188
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,717
if the witch is Momoka herself.

189
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,443
Momoka struck the knife into herself?

190
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,737
Yes.

191
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,073
If I were the game master,

192
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,577
I would come up with this idea.

193
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,335
What a joke.

194
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,171
I'm the witch!

195
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,300
You guys want to kill me, right?

196
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,855
Aguni is trying
to take everyone down with him!

197
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,036
Hey, Takeru.

198
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,458
Takeru.

199
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,795
Takeru.

200
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,424
Takeru!

201
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,518
The Beach made him crazy.

202
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,688
You guys made him crazy!

203
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,276
I'm the witch!

204
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,160
I know how to stop Aguni!

205
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,872
I'll get Aguni's attention.

206
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,999
Use the chance
to burn Momoka in the Fire of Judgment!

207
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,835
Arisu.

208
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,048
End this meaningless massacre.

209
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,512
Asahi!

210
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,683
Listen up, everyone!

211
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:38,482
I'm the dealer of this game.

212
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,223
It was a reverse grip.

213
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,774
Fingerprints with a reverse grip
were found on the knife.

214
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,201
This means

215
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,121
Momoka grabbed the knife herself

216
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,290
and stabbed it through her own chest.

217
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,175
She's the witch.

218
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,598
Why would she…

219
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,560
kill herself for a game?

220
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,730
Was Momoka really the game master?

221
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,276
That girl also said she's the dealer.

222
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,948
So were we just being toyed with by them?

223
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,537
But she's human, just like the rest of us.

224
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,456
Ordinary humans…

225
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,794
The two of them…

226
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,923
They might have been
controlled by someone else too.

227
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,806
Aguni.

228
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,728
Let's just stop this.

229
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:46,109
Don't let the deaths
of the innocents go to waste.

230
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:54,409
I understand
how it feels to kill your friends.

231
00:24:55,744 --> 00:25:00,582
But we shouldn't take out our frustration
on those who are still alive!

232
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,836
We are still alive!

233
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,215
We're all facing despair head-on

234
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,052
and fighting until the very end!

235
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,850
Don't look down on those
who are still alive!

236
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,300
The fire is spreading!

237
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,262
Run!

238
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,976
-Move the body to the Fire of Judgment!
-Hurry up!

239
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,154
That hurt.

240
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,163
In the first place,

241
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,336
I should have just burned down the Beach
with the Fire of Judgment.

242
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,130
Niragi…

243
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,298
Niragi?

244
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,969
With this, I'll clear the game!

245
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,401
You guys…

246
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,071
I'll kill all of you!

247
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,260
Aguni.

248
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,523
Three minutes remaining.

249
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,441
There's no time!

250
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,613
You grab her legs.

251
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,998
-Get out!
-Hurry up!

252
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,971
Congratulations.

253
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,973
GAME CLEARED
CONGRATULATIONS

254
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:38,735
There is no place
where we'll always be safe in this world.

255
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,325
The North Pole, which the explorer saw,

256
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,036
was the true form of the world

257
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,247
without the illusions of civilization.

258
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:58,213
When all is done,
you simply return to the soil.

259
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,842
This land

260
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,470
is the true form of the world.

261
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm thankful to this place.

262
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,436
Now…

263
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,316
I'm freer than I ever was.

264
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,553
I guess this is the end of our paradise.

265
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,354
Everyone died.

266
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,376
Those guys.

267
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,545
I can't forgive them.

268
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,048
Let go!

269
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,466
You can't.

270
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,973
They killed all our comrades!

271
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,058
I won't forgive them!

272
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,542
Let's stop this.

273
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,796
We're still alive.

274
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,134
That's all that matters now.

275
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,096
That's all.

276
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,140
Arisu?

277
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,100
Arisu!

278
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,078
I got it.

279
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,627
I got it.

280
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,545
Arisu…

281
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,011
You're quite persistent too.

282
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,935
I started to think that it's pointless
to collect all the playing cards.

283
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,729
Say what?

284
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,690
But with this,

285
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,736
we've got everything
except for the face cards.

286
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:56,868
But I wonder what the management team
of the game wants us to see?

287
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,505
-Is it recording?
-Yes.

288
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,718
I think the camera is working.

289
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,265
What's this?

290
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,018
It's a video that Asahi left behind.

291
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,105
Let's see…

292
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,358
There's no one in this town.

293
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,988
Everyone in Tokyo disappeared.

294
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,992
After that,

295
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,912
we met a certain person.

296
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,793
Then we were brought to that place,

297
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,798
and we work there now.

298
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,348
We help with setting up the games.

299
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,269
Are you really going in?

300
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:20,159
People known as dealers help
to facilitate the games.

301
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:28,835
Sometimes we join games to act as taggers,

302
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,756
or we act as players
to confuse other players

303
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,175
or to help prepare the game.

304
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,181
But during the games,
we're also being monitored,

305
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,853
and we'll be killed
if we reveal that we're dealers.

306
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,817
Are you recording again?
What are you going to do if they find out?

307
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:17,091
RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK

308
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,601
Is this the dealers' base?

309
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,653
Stop!

310
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,529
Place your bets!

311
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,490
I got a ten-day visa!

312
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,091
Just hurry up already!

313
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,265
DEALER WINS

314
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,438
This is…

315
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,402
So they are the game masters.

316
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,706
Many people have died.

317
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,585
There was a girl
who was around the same age as us.

318
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:24,218
We prepared the game
according to how our superiors wanted,

319
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,553
then we joined the games

320
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,473
and made it so that the players die.

321
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,059
Because of us,

322
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,855
many people die every day.

323
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,819
I can't take this anymore.

324
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:49,869
We kill people,
win games, and earn visa days.

325
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,043
We get to live for another two weeks,

326
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,920
but I don't even know
how many people we had to kill for that.

327
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,674
I can't take it anymore.

328
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,719
Momoka.

329
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,474
This is all a dream.

330
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,353
It's all right.

331
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,148
We will wake up from this dream soon.

332
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,580
I want to end everything…

333
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,070
This is the place.

334
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,817
There it is.

335
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:56,871
RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK

336
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,204
Are you serious?

337
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,049
You actually found this place.

338
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,309
As expected
from someone I have high hopes for.

339
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,022
We meet again.

340
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,067
You guys.

341
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,115
Thanks to you guys, I have
all the numbered playing cards with me.

342
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,200
Thank you.

343
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,038
How did you discover this place?

344
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,668
It took me some time to realize
that this is actually

345
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,046
the route map of a subway station.

346
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,731
What happens
when we collect all the playing cards?

347
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:15,069
I thought I would know the answer
after I came here.

348
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,198
But there's only one thing I discovered.

349
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,826
They are not game masters.

350
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,120
Right.

351
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:30,834
Judging from the fact that
they were all killed after our victory.

352
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,421
They're humans like us,
and on top of that,

353
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,591
there's someone above them.

354
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,893
Just who could they be?

355
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,354
Who knows?

356
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,940
They might be aliens.

357
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,694
Or even God himself.

358
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,122
SPECIAL URGENT BROADCAST

359
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,421
Congratulations to all players.

360
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,259
What?

361
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,803
Interesting.

362
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:27,850
Mira.

363
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,187
With the exception of the face card games,

364
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,441
all of you have cleared
all the numbered games thus far

365
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,776
and emerged the victors.

366
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,613
A sweet victory you've grasped

367
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,116
by sacrificing numerous lives.

368
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:54,376
I wonder how many
of your comrades have died?

369
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,008
Try remembering…

370
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,512
those that were shot dead with a gun.

371
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,726
That girl you burned alive.

372
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:20,319
Those struck with the lasers
and those that drowned.

373
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,950
Those whose heads were blown off.

374
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,203
Those comrades of yours.

375
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,291
The despair you've felt so far

376
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,213
and those dying moments
that you can never forget.

377
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:46,053
I'm extremely touched!

378
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,102
All of you players,

379
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:59,608
we would like to give you a present.

380
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,361
Are you returning us
to the original world?

381
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,366
There will be new games!

382
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,745
Let's play games together.

383
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,997
You'll fight for face cards!

384
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,458
New games?

385
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,628
I don't dislike the idea.

386
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:26,009
We've still got many more
wonderful games prepared for all of you,

387
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,220
so look forward to it!

388
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,974
This woman.

389
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,309
Is she the game master?

390
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,272
I'd rather see an alien
appear on the screen.

391
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:44,903
The next stage will commence
tomorrow at noon.

392
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:50,492
Let's have some fun together!

393
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,954
So we have to fight again.

394
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,373
Yes.

395
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,835
But one thing is different.

396
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,716
We're finally seeing our target.

397
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,430
We'll definitely find our answers there.

398
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,949
