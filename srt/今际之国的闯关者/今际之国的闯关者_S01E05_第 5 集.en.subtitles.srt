1
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,225
Please wait for the game to commence.

2
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,437
Five minutes until registration closes.

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,482
It's a Ferris wheel this time?

4
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,528
What game could it be?

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,033
Our visas are expiring tonight.

6
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,245
We have no choice but to join.

7
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,874
Do you guys have a minute?

8
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:47,172
Have you ever heard of "the Beach"?

9
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,590
What?

10
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,925
-Ignore him. Let's go!
-Wait!

11
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,777
Just where is the Beach?

12
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,529
Registration has closed.

13
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,815
We can't seem to find the Beach anywhere.

14
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,485
We are back here again.

15
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,829
If we don't participate in a game soon,
our visas will expire.

16
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,258
My visa will only last
for another three days.

17
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,391
I have three days

18
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,853
to find out where the Beach is

19
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,273
and put an end to this ridiculous game.

20
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,701
Are you really going to hunt with me
in the morning?

21
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,828
Is that all right?

22
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,831
I'll try my best not to stand in your way.

23
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,920
What you've learned
while living in nature,

24
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,215
I want to pick up those skills too
while there's still time.

25
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,844
There's a limit to our lives.

26
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,140
I've lived my life so far
without thinking about that.

27
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,436
Those guys.

28
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,105
They died believing in me.

29
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,902
I may also die in the near future.

30
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,821
For now,

31
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,867
I don't want to waste
even a single minute or second!

32
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,332
Good night.

33
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,905
When there are no lights in the city,

34
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,950
the stars look really beautiful.

35
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,299
That hurts!

36
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,343
Itchy.

37
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,554
It's so itchy.

38
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,935
That's why I told you
it's impossible to sleep outside.

39
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,397
Just come inside the tent already.

40
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:15,940
What?

41
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,692
But…

42
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,822
It's important to have sufficient sleep.

43
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:27,160
If you can't even take care of yourself,
you might die anytime here.

44
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,902
This is a mud puddle.

45
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,364
Boars clean themselves here.

46
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,907
What's more,

47
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,827
you can see the ground they dug
to eat leaf buds

48
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,955
as well as the marks they left
while sharpening their fangs.

49
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,291
There are boars in Odaiba?

50
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,921
There's no one left in the cities,
so the animals came in.

51
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,802
Looking at footprints
is a basic hunting technique.

52
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,224
The habitat of beasts
expands out like mesh.

53
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,479
What you need in hunting
is the ability to connect these mesh lines

54
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,732
and understand
the movements of these animals.

55
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:45,780
So we shouldn't just focus on one thing.
We need to consider the big picture.

56
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:50,535
-You learn fast.
-I fought the same way in Battleland.

57
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,286
Battleland?

58
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,288
Oh, it's an online game.

59
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,165
Online game?

60
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,084
Games you play online.

61
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,311
How is it?

62
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,023
There are
around ten participants, I think.

63
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,193
There are some who have formed teams, too.

64
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,862
What about your side?

65
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,198
There are four people here.
I'll talk to them and pretend I'm joining.

66
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,451
Wait, Usagi!

67
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,288
-What's the matter?
-Look at the participants' wrists.

68
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,207
-Wrists?
-Is there anyone wearing a locker key?

69
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,918
The ones that you usually see in gyms.

70
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,047
If I remember, during our tag game…

71
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,841
I got it.

72
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,347
Those with the keys are a team.

73
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,475
From where I'm standing,

74
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,436
there are two of them!

75
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,146
Take note of those two.

76
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:01,898
Understood.

77
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,327
Those who cleared the game
left the building.

78
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,496
I knew it!
They're all wearing locker keys.

79
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,540
There are three people left in my area.
They are leaving.

80
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,792
The two with the locker keys
seem to be a pair.

81
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,045
They're going back to the same area.
I'll follow them!

82
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,257
All right, we did it!

83
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,302
Let's head back!

84
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,186
Usagi.

85
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,188
Do you see it too, Arisu?

86
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,148
I'm sure of it. It's those guys!

87
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,780
There's a car.

88
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,951
They may be collecting these cars
systematically.

89
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,329
They're on the move!

90
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,830
Same over here!

91
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,088
The car is moving towards Maihama!

92
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,506
This side, too!

93
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,002
Is that the place?

94
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,509
BEACH

95
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,594
"The Beach."

96
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,054
That's the place!

97
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,515
How do they have electricity?

98
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,853
Will we find the answers
to our questions there?

99
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,369
Good morning.

100
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,706
I'm sorry that we were so rough.

101
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,668
We heard that there were some people
sneaking around the place.

102
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,296
What are your motives?

103
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,220
We heard that we'll know the answer…
if we come here.

104
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,557
What this game is about

105
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,769
and where all the people
who disappeared went.

106
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,150
Exactly.

107
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,696
We know the answers
to the questions you both have.

108
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,496
Welcome

109
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,750
to the Beach, the utopia.

110
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,425
This…

111
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,802
is the answer.

112
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,045
I'll tell you the truth.

113
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,844
There's only one way
to end this hellish nightmare.

114
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:05,349
We clear the games
and collect all the playing cards.

115
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,186
All the playing cards?

116
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,481
So if we gather all of them,

117
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,526
will the original world return?

118
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,490
The original world will not return.

119
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,535
Only one person

120
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,413
can return to the original world.

121
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,709
Only one person?

122
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,047
It's impossible for a single person

123
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,884
to clear all the games
and gather all 52 playing cards.

124
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,636
You can't leave this country
by working alone.

125
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,808
That's why everyone unites as one

126
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,686
in order to let that one person
leave the country.

127
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,106
This is the Beach's objective.

128
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,404
I've heard that the two of you
possess good cards.

129
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:07,620
I'll have both of you play your part
and help us gather the remaining cards.

130
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,290
And if we refuse?

131
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,168
You can't reject me.

132
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,840
Your visa is expiring today.

133
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,595
You have no choice
but to participate in a game, don't you?

134
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,266
We can return if we gather all the cards.

135
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,186
Is that really true?

136
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,855
I can't reveal everything yet,

137
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,317
but I have a credible source
for that information.

138
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:44,698
Before both of you entered this world,
we already thoroughly investigated

139
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,201
everything about this country.

140
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,497
You've been referring to this place
as a "country."

141
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:56,168
The fact that we've been issued visas

142
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,504
means that this is a country.

143
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,552
The people in Tokyo didn't just disappear.

144
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:10,474
It's hypothesized that we've entered
another country accidentally.

145
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:15,437
If that's true,
then there must be a way to return.

146
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:21,735
And we created an organization here.

147
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:27,908
Fuels are used to generate electricity,
and rainwater is used as a water supply.

148
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,328
We have even secured firearms
around the country.

149
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:36,667
However, only a selected few
are allowed to use them.

150
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,047
Our objective is to unite
and collect all the playing cards.

151
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,550
And…

152
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:49,638
there are only three rules
in this utopian Beach.

153
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:55,060
Rule number one. You must
always wear swimsuits at the Beach.

154
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,229
What?

155
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,860
You can't hide firearms in a swimsuit.
Safe, isn't it?

156
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:10,701
You're free to drink,
take drugs, or even have sex!

157
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,205
Feel free
to enjoy your life to the fullest.

158
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,169
We damaged all the door locks
with super glue.

159
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,837
No one is allowed to hide anything!

160
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,381
Rule number two.

161
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,260
All playing cards belong to the Beach.

162
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:34,934
We will take away all the cards
the two of you possess.

163
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,649
Those that have contributed more cards
will be promoted to a higher number.

164
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:47,279
After everyone works together
to get the first person out the country,

165
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,824
if we gather enough duplicated cards,

166
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,202
we will soon be able to have the second

167
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,371
or even the third person
to leave this country.

168
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:02,378
The day will come when everyone
at the Beach will be able to leave!

169
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,841
And when will that be?

170
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,805
What if…

171
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,474
I reject your offer?

172
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,487
Rule number three of the Beach.

173
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,449
This is the last rule.

174
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,414
Death to the traitors.

175
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,425
Everyone at the Beach vowed

176
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,386
to produce the first departure
from this country

177
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,221
at the cost of our lives.

178
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,224
It's our mission, our duty!

179
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,230
Those who show contempt for that…

180
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,650
will never be forgiven by the Beach.

181
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,465
Usagi.

182
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,633
I'm sorry.

183
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,095
I dragged you into this.

184
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,224
Don't apologize.

185
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,394
I wasn't dragged into this.

186
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,607
This is a path that I chose.

187
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,553
It's the Seven of Hearts!

188
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,598
Luck is on our side.

189
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,353
Now we're another step closer
to departure!

190
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,604
Thank you!

191
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,318
We will consider promoting both of you
to a higher rank number.

192
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:37,449
Well then,
please enjoy your stay at the Beach!

193
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,691
What the hell is this?

194
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,514
Somehow,

195
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,017
it feels like we're being watched.

196
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,562
Newcomers are always
a spectacle to others.

197
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:07,456
This is the Beach's Special Time!

198
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,919
This is completely

199
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,837
an escape from reality.

200
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,592
It's time for the games!

201
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,893
A new game arena
has been located in the Shinagawa ward!

202
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:32,481
-The cars are in the second parking lot!
-Adachi and Koto wards, form two groups!

203
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:38,362
-Hatter!
-Hatter!

204
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,582
My comrades!

205
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,252
The time has come again tonight.

206
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,755
Do not falter!

207
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:01,093
This is a war against fear!

208
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,472
Everyone here has the courage
to overcome their obstacles.

209
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,100
Everyone here

210
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,769
is now one!

211
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,315
We shall unite and gather all cards

212
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,110
and return to the original world together!

213
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,112
And…

214
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,322
that day is upon us!

215
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,993
Let's go!

216
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,915
Get in the car marked with your number!

217
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,920
So we're just an army
to collect the cards, huh?

218
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,798
We've been divided into separate games.

219
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,384
You must survive.

220
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,099
What's the matter?

221
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,644
I was in the same game as them.

222
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,689
The two of them?

223
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,732
Yes.

224
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,109
They might be useful.

225
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,111
To our plan, that is.

226
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,537
Teams 1 to 9 will head
to the Shinagawa ward,

227
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,415
while Teams 10 to 17
will head to the Koto ward.

228
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,292
Teams 18 to 24 will…

229
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,627
Game, "Beast Hunter."

230
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,631
Using this scoreboard as a reference,

231
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,926
please cooperate and defeat
the beasts in the area together.

232
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,899
Game, "Hunting Competition."

233
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,157
Game, "Human Elevator."

234
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,915
Game, "Bingo in Match Factory."

235
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,086
You only have nine matches.

236
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:03,840
Answer all the numbers
you find across the 24 rooms

237
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,759
and clear the game by achieving bingo.

238
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,180
It's the militants!

239
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,350
50 POINTS RECEIVED

240
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,643
30 POINTS RECEIVED

241
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,691
Just where the hell is it?

242
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,598
Where is it hiding?

243
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,948
ONE POINT RECEIVED

244
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,741
Piece of cake!

245
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,537
Here it is!

246
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,539
Room 4D is nine!

247
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,541
PLAYERS

248
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,846
ONE PER PERSON

249
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:23,939
This is a trial to see if you're fit to be
an executive member of Beach.

250
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,149
Well, do your best.

251
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,157
A waterproof case?

252
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,287
I'm Kuina. Nice to meet you.

253
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,249
Nice to meet you.

254
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,292
Ann!

255
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,212
Water is starting to spurt out,
and it's filling up the area!

256
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,590
Hey, you're…

257
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,512
You're the one from the tag game.
So you're alive.

258
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,181
Yes, I help with maintenance
at the Beach and--

259
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,183
Leave the formalities for after the game.

260
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,000
What's with this room?

261
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,589
Registration has closed.

262
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,341
There are currently seven participants.

263
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,552
The game will now commence.

264
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,348
Difficulty, Four of Diamonds.

265
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,435
The last Diamond card we need.

266
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,772
Game, "Light Bulb."

267
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,733
"Light bulb"?

268
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,402
OPEN AND CLOSE FREELY

269
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,449
Question.

270
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,660
Which switch turns on the light bulb?

271
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,582
WHICH SWITCH TURNS ON THE LIGHT BULB?

272
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,000
Rule number one.

273
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:14,549
Only one switch among A, B, and C
will turn on the light bulb.

274
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,010
Rule number two.

275
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,222
You only have one chance

276
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,267
to flip a switch while the door is open.

277
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,729
OPEN AND CLOSE FREELY

278
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,983
If the door is closed, you can flip
the switches as much as you like.

279
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,112
Rule number three.

280
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:43,203
If someone is in the room,
or if a switch has been turned on,

281
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,956
the door will be locked in place
and cannot be moved.

282
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,545
You only have one chance
to answer as a group.

283
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,883
If you answer correctly
which switch turns on the light bulb,

284
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,051
you clear the game.

285
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:03,515
If the water level rises and touches
the electrical wires, it's game over.

286
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,267
Electrical wires?

287
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,234
You'll get electrocuted!

288
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,986
Is that what they meant?

289
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,490
The water level is slowly rising!

290
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,034
If it rises too high, everyone dies.

291
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,955
Anyway, we just need to figure out
the switch for the light bulb, right?

292
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,582
I'll head into that room first,
so let's take turns!

293
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,376
If you enter, the door won't close!

294
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,670
Let's see…

295
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,173
So we only have one chance
to turn on the switch with the door open.

296
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,385
But there's no point in flipping
the switches when the door is closed!

297
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:45,056
For example, if you turn on Switch A
with the door open

298
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,685
and it doesn't light up,
then the answer is not A.

299
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,020
And why is that wrong?

300
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,317
Anyway, let's just flip Switch A
with the door open--

301
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,069
What if your answer is wrong?

302
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,197
If it turns on, it's A.
If it doesn't, it's either B or C.

303
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:05,243
-At least we have a 50 percent chance!
-It's 66 percent.

304
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,246
Shouldn't it be 50 percent?

305
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,040
I don't understand it at all.

306
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,501
What will you do, Arisu?

307
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,589
But there's no other choice.

308
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,759
For now, let's turn on a switch
with the door open!

309
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,179
If the bulb doesn't turn on,
we'll decide on one out of the two!

310
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,722
Are you just going to guess?

311
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,392
-We have no choice but to bet on it.
-Using all seven lives here?

312
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,647
Or six, I guess.

313
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,443
Yes. If you know the answer,
then do it already!

314
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,944
Didn't I tell you?

315
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,780
I'm testing you.

316
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,992
Don't drag us into the newcomer's trial!

317
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,202
Giving up already?

318
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,288
I give up! Please tell us the answer!

319
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,250
This is really bad!

320
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,461
Ann!

321
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,131
Arisu, just do it.
It's going to be too late!

322
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,258
I'm doing it then!

323
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,346
Are you really all right with that?

324
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,310
Just do it already!

325
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,645
What are you waiting for?

326
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,239
You only have one chance

327
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,324
to flip a switch while the door is open.

328
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,118
For example, if you turn on Switch A
with the door open

329
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,704
and it doesn't light up,
then the answer is not A.

330
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,374
If it turns on, it's A.
If it doesn't, it's either B or C.

331
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:38,336
If the door is closed, you can flip
the switches as much as you like.

332
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,005
Let's close the door.

333
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,131
What?

334
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,635
Close the door! Hurry up!

335
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,680
If you don't do as Arisu says,
everyone will die!

336
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:01,943
Stay like this!

337
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,114
-What are you up to?
-I hope you know what you're doing!

338
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,171
Hurry up!

339
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,300
Open the door!

340
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,186
Hurry up.

341
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,527
It didn't turn on!

342
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,821
Kuina, touch the bulb!

343
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,533
-What?
-Just go! We're running out of time.

344
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,830
Please!

345
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,042
That's hot!

346
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,002
-The answer is A--
-Switch A!

347
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,484
Game cleared. Congratulations.

348
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,702
Electricity generates heat.

349
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,205
If the bulb had been on,
it would feel hot.

350
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,915
If not, it would have felt cold.

351
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,918
And we only had one chance
to check with our own eyes.

352
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:46,255
With this, the chance of survival was
increased from 66 to 100 percent.

353
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,179
It's 50 percent, right?

354
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,473
I don't care anymore.

355
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,172
You survived.

356
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:29,966
Yes.

357
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,224
She knew the answer.

358
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,813
Ann was trying to test me.

359
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,483
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

360
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,906
Your girlfriend?

361
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,866
What?

362
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,826
You're wrong!

363
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,704
You guys get along,
so why not date each other?

364
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,874
You never know when you're going to die.

365
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,333
What are you saying?

366
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,669
There are things you should do
while you're still alive!

367
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,717
My mom is sick in the hospital.

368
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,137
She can't even relieve herself
without my help,

369
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,139
and yet I had to be separated from her.

370
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,059
So I want to return alive.

371
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,854
That's why I quit smoking.

372
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,608
I haven't been able to quit before this.

373
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,778
I'll need some stamina
in order to survive, right?

374
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,324
I'll definitely survive
and return to the original world.

375
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,620
Hey, stop playing that tacky music!

376
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,759
It's the militants at the Beach.

377
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,887
If you want
to live peacefully at the Beach,

378
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,889
avoid getting involved with them.

379
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,978
The leader, Aguni, is an ex-SDF officer,

380
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,065
and he is in charge of
all the weapons at the Beach.

381
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,944
The ones currently in power at the Beach

382
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,364
are the Number One, Hatter,
and his devotees

383
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,450
as well as the militants led by Aguni.

384
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,038
We've only barely managed
to maintain peace and order here,

385
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,834
but a conflict between the two parties
could happen anytime.

386
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,428
What happened to your pal?

387
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,146
I see. He died.

388
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,481
What a shame.

389
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,359
So only the small fish survived.

390
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,820
Do you know each other?

391
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,577
You,

392
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,620
bring that woman over.

393
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,080
Yes.

394
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,001
-Hey!
-Stop. Don't get yourself involved!

395
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,546
Our boss says
he wants to have a taste of you.

396
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,799
Come.

397
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,593
Stop it.

398
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,972
What should we do about this kid?

399
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,267
Break his legs
so that he'll die in the next game.

400
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,519
Yes. You guys!

401
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,271
Bring the woman to him.

402
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,690
You come with me.

403
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,359
Stand up.

404
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,662
Is this a fight?

405
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,379
Back off, Hatter.
This doesn't concern you.

406
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,091
I can't do that.

407
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:03,763
As the Number One, I'm obliged
to maintain order at the Beach.

408
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:13,314
Could you let off the newcomers
on my account, Aguni?

409
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,448
Niragi.

410
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,912
I only take orders from the boss.

411
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,548
Then let me ask your boss.

412
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,013
Who is your boss,

413
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,765
Aguni?

414
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,199
It's you, right?

415
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,209
Go take a shower.

416
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,796
All executive members are to gather
in the meeting room!

417
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,847
Arisu, you're coming too.

418
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,268
I've heard about your potential from Ann.

419
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,645
Follow me.

420
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:43,779
I'll be back.

421
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,505
So what do you think about him?

422
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,967
I like him.

423
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,347
-We still have four missing.
-We're starting the meeting!

424
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,515
Those who have nothing to do here, leave.

425
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,288
It's you.

426
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,041
Two of Spades.

427
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,212
Six of Spades. Four of Diamonds.

428
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,798
Two of Clubs.
We've collected all four of them.

429
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,345
Until now, we still haven't found
any face cards.

430
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,891
If face cards do not exist,
then we're only left with Ten of Hearts.

431
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,769
Ten of Hearts.

432
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,147
It has never appeared in a game before.

433
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,488
If it doesn't appear, we can't clear it.

434
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,449
Maybe there needs
to be a condition for it to appear.

435
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,993
Maybe it is not in Tokyo.

436
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,539
A game arena has never been found
outside of Tokyo.

437
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:20,584
-But we haven't investigated that far yet.
-The strategy won't change.

438
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,423
We will continue investigating
the game arenas in town.

439
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,885
Make sure you have days left on your visas
and keep a lookout for the Ten of Hearts.

440
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,306
I need to replenish my visa soon.

441
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:46,360
There's a way to earn visa days for sure.

442
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,237
Is that so?

443
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:55,703
Heart games let you toy
with the hearts and feelings of others.

444
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,623
If you bring along those
that don't mind dying,

445
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,585
you'll survive for sure.

446
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,257
Even in the Seven of Hearts game
that Arisu cleared.

447
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,718
The same thing happened, didn't it?

448
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,763
It's a game that doesn't
even require you to use your brain!

449
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,934
As someone who cleared a Hearts game,

450
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,312
do you have any advice for us, Arisu?

451
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,695
But would a Hearts game
appear so conveniently?

452
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:35,117
On top of that, we won't know what type
of game it is until registration closes.

453
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,704
But we should be able to deduce it
based on the probability theory.

454
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,375
I don't need
such a pretentious investigation method.

455
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,879
I'll join the next game.

456
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,590
Be it Hearts or Spades.

457
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,801
Someone like me with a 100 percent
winning rate will clear it easily!

458
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,222
I'll join the games
until the Ten of Hearts card appears!

459
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:00,518
The day where we gather all cards
and depart from this country is near!

460
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:06,649
Executive members, I'm counting on
you guys to oversee things here.

461
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,111
The meeting is adjourned!

462
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,202
You should drink too, Arisu.

463
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:09,628
I also like to enjoy myself before a game.

464
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,973
There's no poison in it!

465
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:34,445
It seems like you don't trust me.

466
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,745
I like your prudence.

467
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,415
What did you do in the original world?

468
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,127
Nothing.

469
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,588
So you're a NEET?

470
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,720
I ran a host club in Kabukicho.

471
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,014
It's called Beach.

472
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:03,932
Have you heard of it?

473
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,563
It was quite famous, you know?

474
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:14,860
Beach, Beach, there's no sand
But it's the utopia Beach

475
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,367
It was advertised all over Tokyo
on cars with loudspeakers, you know?

476
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,036
All I did was play games at home.

477
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,547
Did you know?

478
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,095
I wanted to be the best in Kabukicho…

479
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,349
desperately.

480
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,819
My subordinates all looked up to me,

481
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,281
and I told them I'll do
whatever it takes to rule over this place!

482
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,748
As a host,

483
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,503
it's all over if you're looked down on
by your customers.

484
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,632
No matter how much you're made to drink…

485
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:25,389
you must never lose your human pride.

486
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,644
I instilled that mindset
into my subordinates.

487
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,358
However…

488
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,615
that pushed him over the edge.

489
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,413
In the dormitory,

490
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,960
he hanged himself.

491
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:00,966
Everyone.

492
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,597
They all left me.

493
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,936
I…

494
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,401
I wanted to rule the place with them.

495
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,619
Now that I think about it,

496
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:34,082
his death was a necessary evil.

497
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,630
In order for me to mature.

498
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,383
Mature?

499
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,598
In this new Beach,

500
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:55,938
all the players will devote
their bodies and lives to me!

501
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,318
And I will be a hero.

502
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,658
The one and only hero

503
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,993
to succeed in leaving this country!

504
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,166
And that is me, Hatter.

505
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,434
For a hero,

506
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,688
tragedies are needed.

507
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,532
To the second Beach.

508
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,627
