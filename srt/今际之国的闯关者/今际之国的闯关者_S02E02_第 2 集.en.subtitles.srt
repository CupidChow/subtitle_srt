1
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,099
You guys alive?

2
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,686
I can't hear you!

3
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,742
How would you rate today's gig?

4
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,036
Five hundred.

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,497
-Five hundred? That's high!
-Maki rates a three.

6
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,290
That's brutal!

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,961
-That's hilarious.
-That's so brutal.

8
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,464
It was great. Totally great.

9
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,049
The audience was on fire.

10
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,222
Okay, now let's decide who'll drive today.

11
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,643
-On the count of three, point.
-Point?

12
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,395
-Point on three.
-Okay.

13
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,272
-The worst member?
-That's right.

14
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,189
Thought so.

15
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,316
-That'll be easy.
-Oh, shut up.

16
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,985
-That'll be easy.
-Here goes.

17
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,946
-Okay.
-Let's go.

18
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,781
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

19
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,422
We're the citizens of this country.

20
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,384
The "citizens"?

21
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,177
That's right. The citizens.

22
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,681
That's insane. We're all humans.

23
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,516
I wouldn't be so sure.

24
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm the leader of this team.

25
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,523
We made this game.

26
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,235
Incidentally,
it was developed by him, Shitara.

27
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,947
But this will be
the first time it'll be played.

28
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,450
We haven't even played it ourselves yet.

29
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,287
In other words,

30
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,582
we'll be playing against you,
the citizens, in this game?

31
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,499
That's right.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,588
All the face card games are deathmatches
against the citizens of this land.

33
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,507
The team that loses dies.

34
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,051
In other words,

35
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,514
these games are serious affairs
even for us citizens.

36
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,685
Shall we begin?

37
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,648
This is the game we are about to play.

38
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,027
Difficulty, King of Clubs.

39
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,570
Game…

40
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,948
"Osmosis."

41
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,743
"Osmosis."

42
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,281
The rules are very simple.

43
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,993
There's a two-hour time limit.

44
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,620
We battle each other for points,

45
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,790
and the team with the most points
at the end clears the game.

46
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,919
Both teams start with 10,000 points each.

47
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,257
You'll divide the points
between members before the game starts.

48
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:47,305
They can be divided as you please,
but the least you can start with is 100.

49
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,141
Talk it over carefully before you decide.

50
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,271
The amount you start with
is extremely important in this game.

51
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,736
Here's how you get points.

52
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,782
There are three ways to get points.

53
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,408
Battles.

54
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:08,993
Items.

55
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,703
Base.

56
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,080
Wait.

57
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,873
Sure. What's your question?

58
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,459
This doesn't make any sense at all.

59
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,252
Okay.

60
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,421
Without an example,
it's probably hard to get.

61
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,258
For now, I've given you
random amounts of points.

62
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,763
The number on your wrist is
how many points you have.

63
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,599
Let's start with battles.

64
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,227
ARISU 2,000

65
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,646
Battles are decided
by how many points you have.

66
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,110
To battle someone,
you just need to touch your opponent.

67
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,027
Hey!

68
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,737
BATTLE

69
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,575
NIRAGI: 2,000 LOSE

70
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,576
KYUMA: 3,500 WIN

71
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,245
The person who has more points wins.

72
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,706
The winner gets 500 points from the loser.

73
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,707
NIRAGI: 2,000 -500 LOSE

74
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,834
NIRAGI: 1,500

75
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,461
KYUMA: 3,500 +500 WIN

76
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,255
KYUMA: 4,000

77
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,508
There has been a change
in points for both teams.

78
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,015
The King of Clubs Team
leads by 1,000 points.

79
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,276
ARISU: 2,000

80
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,320
So you don't know
your opponent's points until you battle.

81
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,363
Right.

82
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,992
This means battles are fought
without knowing each other's points,

83
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,411
so it's a seriously risky fight.

84
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,290
Also, multiple people can fight a battle.

85
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,958
For example…

86
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,587
You two, hold hands.

87
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,093
What's this?

88
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,012
Don't tell me you're blushing.

89
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,359
You two make a nice couple.

90
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,948
Anyway, when two teammates
are touching one another,

91
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,284
they battle with the sum of their points,

92
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,287
so they can defeat an opponent
that they can't defeat alone.

93
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,628
Then when you win,
you each split the 500 points.

94
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,883
Next…

95
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,260
The items!

96
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,721
ITEM

97
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:38,893
Hidden somewhere
inside all these containers are six items.

98
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,772
This place is huge!

99
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,525
There are only six in this massive arena?

100
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,903
You get extra points
when you touch the item.

101
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,614
Now let me explain this.

102
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,199
The key to making a comeback…

103
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,493
is your base.

104
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,666
This is your team's base.

105
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,210
Ours is on the other side of the arena.

106
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,549
If you touch the opposing team's base,

107
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,260
you'll get 10,000 points.

108
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,970
Ten thousand points?

109
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,264
That's freaking insane!

110
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,976
That's why you need to leave a keeper
to protect your base.

111
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:25,189
When a player is touching their own base,
they have infinite points.

112
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:26,983
Infinite?

113
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,945
What if you battle someone
with infinite points?

114
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,700
Come here a sec.

115
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,427
ARISU: 2,250 LOSE
KYUMA: INFINITE WIN

116
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,429
The loser loses 10,000 points.

117
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,264
ARISU: -7,750 -10,000

118
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,432
KYUMA: 3,500

119
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,100
The winner gains 10,000 points.

120
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,311
KYUMA: 3,500 +10,000

121
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,354
KYUMA: 13,500

122
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,023
Hold on here!

123
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,986
What if you lose 10,000 points
and go below zero?

124
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,781
You die.

125
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,828
If you try to touch the other team's base,

126
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,914
but their keeper blocks you
and touches you,

127
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,374
you'll lose 10,000 points…

128
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,918
and die.

129
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,464
While the other team gets 10,000 points.

130
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,008
That's way too risky!

131
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,761
But if you succeed,
you'll come from behind and win.

132
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,307
Incidentally,

133
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,436
when players exchange points
from a battle or at the base,

134
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,190
they become inactive
and cannot gain or lose points.

135
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,527
If an inactive player touches
an opposing team member…

136
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,655
INACTIVE

137
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,074
…the bracelets give them
a tremendous shock.

138
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,243
It could even knock you out,
so be careful.

139
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,831
Once you touch your own base,
you become active again.

140
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,462
Those are the rules.

141
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,007
After you decide how to divide the points,
the game will start.

142
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,306
Wait!

143
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,895
I'm Arisu.

144
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,023
Kyuma.

145
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,486
I want to know something before we begin.

146
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,574
If we clear all the games,

147
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,620
can we return to the real world?

148
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,377
First of all, what is the "real world"?

149
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,673
This "real world" you want to return to…

150
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,636
it seems that you believe
it is the true world.

151
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,722
What do you mean by that?

152
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,767
When you were there,

153
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,020
how many people could you talk to honestly

154
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,815
and deal with truthfully?

155
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,444
Vanity and deception.

156
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,156
Shit like that falls away quickly here.

157
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,742
When faced with death,

158
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,788
that's when you see
the true nature of people.

159
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,588
This world is the real world.

160
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,549
Games are true conversations.

161
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,389
Let's converse with our naked souls
and with all our strength, Arisu!

162
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,934
If you want to know the truth,

163
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,146
then battle me with all your might.

164
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,451
All right.

165
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,580
I'll show you.

166
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,384
You know,
that Kyuma dude seems like a nice guy.

167
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,386
He seemed like a normal person.

168
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,139
How can a buck-naked nutjob be normal?

169
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,142
This is just another fight to the death
like all the others.

170
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,062
Okay.

171
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,439
Let's divide up the points.

172
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,817
How will we divide up the 10,000 points?

173
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,321
How about in five equal parts?

174
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,074
It's way too basic.
We'll never win that way.

175
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,078
Like Kyuma said,

176
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,913
in this game, Osmosis,

177
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:55,084
the way we divide the points has
a huge impact on who wins.

178
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,336
You got a plan?

179
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,970
DIFFICULTY LEVEL

180
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,930
Game start.

181
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,922
Here's the plan.

182
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,009
The fast runners get
a low number of points

183
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,720
while the slow runners get a lot.

184
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,225
Whoever guards the base gets
the least possible number of points.

185
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:59,231
We'll split into pairs with one high-point
and one low-point member.

186
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,109
Why did you pair up with me?

187
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,944
I didn't know you liked me so much.

188
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,822
If I have to see you die,
it won't bother me.

189
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,994
The benefit of pairing up is
when you touch an opponent for a battle,

190
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,663
they can only see
your total number of points.

191
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,083
In other words, our opponents won't know
how much each of us has.

192
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,594
NIRAGI: 4,700

193
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,596
USAGI: 300

194
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,641
Combined, we've got 5,000 points.

195
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:37,895
When splitting 10,000 points among five,
they wouldn't give 5,000 to one person.

196
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,605
Let's fight this guy.

197
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,649
I like that attitude.

198
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,908
I see.

199
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,333
He must not have had much.

200
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,680
Nothing.

201
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,726
No, nothing.

202
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,903
Why the heck
did you pair up Usagi and Niragi?

203
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,571
It's part of the plan.

204
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,116
Did something happen between you?

205
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,659
No. It was nothing.

206
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,036
Arisu.

207
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,165
If it's something
that'll hinder our teamwork,

208
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,750
then shouldn't you talk about it?

209
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,170
That's not it. I did it for a reason.

210
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,631
Fine. Whatever.

211
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,014
That must be it!

212
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,454
KUINA: 300 +2,000
ITEM

213
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,039
KUINA: 2,300

214
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,458
I got 2,000 points!

215
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,209
All right!

216
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,421
Yes!

217
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,591
The Player Team obtained an item.

218
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,386
The Player Team leads by 2,000 points.

219
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,805
-That's 12,000 points!
-We lead by 2,000!

220
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,268
That's a promising start.

221
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,900
Being cautious is boring.

222
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,735
Let's try a battle.

223
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,822
ARISU: 4,600

224
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,824
KUINA: 2,300

225
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,507
Let's stay together.

226
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,718
It's two-on-one,
so there's no need to panic.

227
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,136
Right.

228
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,185
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,
but I couldn't help hearing you.

229
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,271
Did you have a fight
with another team member?

230
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,987
Arisu.

231
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,825
There's a lot of determination
in your eyes.

232
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:43,664
They tell me you've faced death many times
and are prepared to sacrifice everything.

233
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:49,628
So it's strange to me
that you'd let something trouble you now.

234
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,510
Our team was originally a band.

235
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:02,391
Sometimes we'd fight and argue,
but they still stuck with me.

236
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,520
However, there's something
I learned as a leader.

237
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,607
You can't just
randomly lead people around.

238
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,487
You need to listen to their feelings
and wait for them to come around.

239
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,868
When you do that, you'll eventually
come to understand one another.

240
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,000
Okay.

241
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,085
Let's do this.

242
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,386
You could die today, you know?

243
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:44,016
It's the same for me and my teammates.
Of course, you guys too, Arisu.

244
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,019
So let's not have any regrets.

245
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,729
If we're going to die,

246
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,732
then I want us to fight bravely
before we die.

247
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:06,997
Arisu…

248
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,626
Kyuma.

249
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,212
Like you said before,

250
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:18,258
if I want to know the truth,
then I should fight with all my might.

251
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,219
Right.

252
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,431
I want to start
by getting to know you better.

253
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,392
So battle me.

254
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,858
But Arisu…

255
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,489
With pleasure.

256
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,673
ARISU: 4,600 WIN
KYUMA: 2,000 LOSE

257
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,882
Damn!

258
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,259
There has been a change in points

259
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,551
-I lost!
-for both teams.

260
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,053
Two thousand points?

261
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,471
ARISU: 4,600 +500
KYUMA: 2,000 -500

262
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,391
The Player Team leads by 3,000 points.

263
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:14,273
You mean you divided
your 10,000 points evenly?

264
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,857
That's right.

265
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,693
Each person got 2,000 points.

266
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,320
But this is a deathmatch, right?

267
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:29,788
To me, my teammates and I are equals
who either live or die together.

268
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,629
Have you come
to know me a little bit better now?

269
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,497
Shit!

270
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,253
Fucking shit! They got me!

271
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,338
Yes!

272
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,341
There has been a change
in points for both teams.

273
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,179
The Player Team leads by 4,000 points.

274
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,681
All right!

275
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,328
There has been a change
in points for both teams.

276
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,412
Yes!

277
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,915
-The Player Team leads by 5,000 points.
-Sorry, man.

278
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,171
You guys are awesome!

279
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,423
It's starting out almost too well.

280
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,426
This guy's a King? What a joke.

281
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,427
High five!

282
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,471
Yes!

283
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,722
I hate to admit it,

284
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,809
but I've almost forgotten
that you're one of the bad guys.

285
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,118
ARISU: INACTIVE

286
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,121
What did you find out?

287
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,832
They split their points evenly.

288
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,125
Evenly?

289
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,960
Two thousand points each.

290
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,380
Let's keep battling them like this
and keep looking for items.

291
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,634
Tatta, I'm counting on you
to protect this.

292
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,052
Sure thing.

293
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,027
They've got a 5,000-point lead on us.

294
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,904
Well, this situation sure sucks.

295
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,907
What are we going to do now, "leader"?

296
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,077
Those guys are pretty damn good.

297
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,787
How can you compliment them?

298
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:20,041
It's your fault for dividing
the points evenly without any plan at all.

299
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,835
Don't be like that.

300
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,088
There's no majority rule on our team.

301
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,133
Until now,

302
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:31,761
we've only ever made important decisions
when we all agree what to do.

303
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,722
That's for sure.

304
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,890
Then what will we do?

305
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,725
Come on, Maki!

306
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,394
Why don't you chill out?

307
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,937
And why don't you get serious?

308
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,984
I've got a good idea.

309
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,110
I do too.

310
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,779
It's a freaking crazy idea.

311
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,784
You want to bet we've got the same idea?

312
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,038
Then how about
we say it together on three?

313
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,206
Sure.

314
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,292
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

315
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,633
The Player Team obtained an item.

316
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,554
The Player Team leads by 6,000 points.

317
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,848
All right!

318
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,698
Yo.

319
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,771
What did you come here for?

320
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,648
To win, of course.

321
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,627
TATTA: INFINITE

322
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,548
I…

323
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,218
I've got infinite points now.

324
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,683
If I touch you,

325
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:44,894
you'll die!

326
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,900
That's right.

327
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,195
This is a deathmatch after all.

328
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,282
You choose who dies.

329
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,162
What? That doesn't make any sense!

330
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:04,998
You'll die!

331
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,751
Stay away!

332
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,005
Stay away!

333
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,518
There has been a change
in points for both teams.

334
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,193
The King of Clubs Team
leads by 4,000 points.

335
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,444
They came from behind.

336
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,364
How did that happen?

337
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:43,787
In addition, one participant
has less than zero points.

338
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,881
Me, huh?

339
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,144
You guys had better win.

340
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,606
If you waste my death,

341
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,068
I'll beat the shit out of you in heaven.

342
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,905
The game is over for that participant.

343
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,246
Shitara…

344
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:31,334
I won't ever forget you,
not for a single second.

345
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,216
Later, guys.

346
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,831
Shitara…

347
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:46,993
Shitara…

348
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,558
By sacrificing one of their teammates,

349
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,646
they now have three members
with over 10,000 points.

350
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,358
You can't even guard the base properly.

351
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,609
Fricking moron.

352
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,403
Losers will always be losers
no matter what.

353
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,822
You useless piece of shit.

354
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,533
Tatta did the best he could
in that situation.

355
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,450
"Did the best he could"?

356
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,578
Anyone else would have tagged Kyuma then!

357
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,914
We underestimated them.

358
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:37,669
His casual attitude fooled us
and made us forget

359
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,671
that he's a King.

360
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,465
And that this is a deathmatch.

361
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,554
Those guys are more prepared
to sacrifice their lives than we are.

362
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,932
If nothing changes, we'll lose for sure.

363
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,566
We've got just one hour left.

364
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,071
We might still win
if we attack their base.

365
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,490
Impossible, as long as
they defend their base.

366
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,867
Like Niragi says, it's useless.

367
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,743
So what are we supposed to do?

368
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,748
Let's split up,
avoid battles, and get items.

369
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,835
That's the only way for us to survive.

370
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,295
Let's get going.

371
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,186
Not here.

372
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,489
The King of Clubs Team obtained an item.

373
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,202
The King of Clubs team
leads by 4,500 points.

374
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,330
They're not easing up.

375
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,182
Sorry.

376
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,771
There has been a change
in points for both teams.

377
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:25,360
The King of Clubs Team
leads by 5,500 points.

378
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:33,076
The King of Clubs Team obtained an item.

379
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,956
The King of Clubs Team
leads by 7,000 points.

380
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,999
We're screwed.

381
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,678
Alone, huh?

382
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,102
Finally, a one-on-one fight.

383
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,856
Sorry, but you won't win
without paying a price.

384
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,948
I'll give you a taste of my fists.

385
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,369
You'll spend the rest of the game
flat on your ass.

386
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,054
KUINA: 3,050
MAKI: 11,500

387
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,139
KUINA: INACTIVE

388
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,977
You should've told me
you knew how to fight.

389
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,815
There has been a change
in points for both teams.

390
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,900
I told them to avoid battles.
What's their problem?

391
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,486
The King of Clubs team leads
by 8,000 points.

392
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,218
Finders keepers.

393
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,601
Yes, 3,000 points!

394
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,686
That's the biggest item.

395
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,440
What's going on?

396
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,400
If you're both here…

397
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,611
You mean

398
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,447
there's nobody at your base?

399
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:35,865
Yes.

400
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,867
The way you guys are now,

401
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,412
we figured you wouldn't think of
or have the guts to attack our base.

402
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,582
You've got to be kidding…

403
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,130
You said you wanted some answers, right?

404
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,719
Everything about these games
is harsh and ludicrous.

405
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,890
We thought our lives were precious,
but they're snuffed out so easily.

406
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,936
In fact, just now, I lost a close friend.

407
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,275
Shitara was a member of our band.

408
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,695
We lived together in a filthy apartment.

409
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,699
Back then,
we risked our lives to play live.

410
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,955
They were tiny venues,
but they were tons of fun.

411
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,547
When playing these games,

412
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,260
we can see each player's true character.

413
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,304
We're utterly naked.

414
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,558
Just like live shows.

415
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,186
I think…

416
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,858
I wanted to see
the real attitude of people towards life.

417
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,532
Shitara lived admirably until the end.

418
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,048
ARISU: 5,350 LOSE
KYUMA: 13,500 WIN

419
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,050
ARISU: 4,850
KYUMA: 14,000

420
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,051
ARISU: INACTIVE

421
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,470
Arisu.

422
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,225
Don't you dare forget

423
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,729
that this is a deathmatch.

424
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,940
The losers die.

425
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,571
Show me how you want to live life.

426
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,878
Time remaining, 30 minutes.

427
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:57,840
The King of Clubs Team
leads by 12,000 points.

428
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,510
USAGI: INACTIVE

429
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,352
Only 30 minutes left.

430
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,646
They've got a 12,000-point lead.

431
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,981
It's too soon to give up.

432
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,900
Let's find all the items we can.

433
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,904
There are only 2,500 points in items left.

434
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,405
There must be some other way!

435
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,200
If we don't do anything,
we really will die!

436
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,786
We've still got Tatta with over 10,000.

437
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,956
-We could pair with him and battle.
-The hell I will!

438
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,209
We all know whose fault it is
that this happened.

439
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,129
There isn't any damn job
we can let this loser do.

440
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,883
We're also behind by 12,000 points.

441
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:45,638
We'll never catch up just by battling
and gaining a measly 500 points each time.

442
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,726
If I were Kyuma…

443
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,396
I'd…

444
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:04,991
ARISU: INACTIVE

445
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,618
If you want to know the truth,

446
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,371
then battle me with all your might.

447
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,831
When playing these games,

448
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,419
we can see each player's true character.

449
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,922
This is a deathmatch.

450
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,800
Show me how you want to live life.

451
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,386
ARISU: INACTIVE

452
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,850
We'll attack their base.

453
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,982
If two of us can touch their base,
we'll get 20,000 points.

454
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,109
We can win then.

455
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,402
But that's impossible!

456
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,696
I saw it happen myself.

457
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,408
There's no way in hell we could do that!

458
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,868
Then…

459
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,664
let's give the finger to that fear
that's holding us back.

460
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,042
Have you lost your mind?

461
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:01,339
The difference between us and them
is that we're letting fear hold us back.

462
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:05,259
So let's tell our fear to fuck off.

463
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,221
That plan's insane.

464
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,641
I can't waste our lives like that.

465
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,896
But if we don't do anything,
we'll all die for sure.

466
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,732
I think it's worth it to risk our lives.

467
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,485
We're a team.

468
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,236
We're teammates.

469
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,822
So I don't want any of us to die.

470
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,575
But I would risk my life

471
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,453
if it would save all of you.

472
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,916
I like your plan. Count me in.

473
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,589
I couldn't give a shit about you people.

474
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:48,928
But I told my fear to fuck off ages ago.

475
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,227
Me too.

476
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,065
I also want to win this game.

477
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,070
Aw, hell.

478
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,491
I can't let you look like
the only cool one.

479
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,412
I don't think…

480
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,625
Tatta.

481
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,211
You take care of things here.

482
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,382
Okay.

483
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,775
As long as we guard this, we win.

484
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,994
Try and catch me!

485
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:01,000
Doesn't that chick only have 50 points?

486
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,462
You'll die instantly, you know?

487
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,009
Goken, don't do it!

488
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,844
Don't let her provoke you!

489
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,264
We'll still win.

490
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,614
I haven't been so invigorated in a while!

491
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,577
Time for some fun!

492
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,719
Here's another one.

493
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,502
You guys!

494
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,382
You must be so bored with life
that you're starving for excitement!

495
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,763
You sure do know us well!

496
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,148
KYUMA: INFINITE

497
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,483
MAKI: INFINITE

498
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,318
UTA: INFINITE

499
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,696
You guys will die!

500
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,813
Here I come!

501
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,316
Okay.

502
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,082
ARISU: INACTIVE

503
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,087
You're inactive?

504
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,688
The Player Team has gained points.

505
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,649
Yes!

506
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:36,567
Just 10,000 more!

507
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,985
NIRAGI: INACTIVE

508
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,278
Niragi!

509
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,326
Kuina!

510
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:48,996
Go!

511
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,802
There has been a change
in points for both teams.

512
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,183
The King of Clubs Team
leads by 3,000 points.

513
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,988
Congrats on getting 10,000 points!

514
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,824
You're really something, Arisu.

515
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,534
That was a good plan.

516
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,953
But it's over for you guys.

517
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:35,334
Even if you find the last item,
you won't have enough.

518
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,048
You won't ever get that chance again.

519
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,384
Until time runs out,
we'll stay by this base

520
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,179
and never do battle.

521
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,057
Time remaining, 20 minutes.

522
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:54,520
The King of Clubs Team
leads by 3,000 points.

523
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,249
I'm sorry.

524
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,919
It's all my fault.

525
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:23,757
No, it's not.

526
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,219
We all did our very best.

527
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,348
My idea wasn't good enough.

528
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,433
I'm sorry.

529
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,646
Everyone takes the blame, huh?

530
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,820
It's your fucking fault we'll all die!

531
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,375
I'll look for the item.

532
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,752
It's too late now.

533
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,547
Maybe this is just to please myself,

534
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,675
but…

535
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,722
I want to do everything I can

536
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,891
to the very end.

537
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,738
She sure is tough.

538
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,575
I could never do that.

539
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,197
All that crap about cooperating
was such bullshit.

540
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,911
Fucking self-righteous bastards.

541
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,498
Fuck it all!

542
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,678
I was such a fool.

543
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:48,193
I don't have much time anyway.

544
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,664
There must be…

545
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,666
There must be a way.

546
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:00,849
I found it!

547
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,988
The Player Team obtained an item.

548
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:20,452
The King of Clubs Team
leads by 500 points.

549
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,830
Usagi got the item.

550
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,126
Only 500 more points.

551
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,295
I've got to do something.

552
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,380
I've got to do something!

553
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,677
I'll go to Kyuma's base.

554
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,595
Why?

555
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:42,098
We just need 500 points.
Some kind of miracle could happen!

556
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,142
That's ridiculous.

557
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,562
If I'm going to die anyway,
I want to do everything I can before I do!

558
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,481
Arisu…

559
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:57,280
Come to think of it, I never did tell you.

560
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,576
Tatta…

561
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:07,541
You've always been so optimistic.
You've really cheered me up.

562
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,463
Thank you.

563
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,145
Time remaining, ten minutes.

564
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,315
The King of Clubs Team
leads by 500 points.

565
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,316
We can still win.

566
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,201
Niragi?

567
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,047
Pretty pitiful, huh?

568
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,800
I found the item!

569
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,218
We just need 500 more points!

570
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,511
Don't be stupid.

571
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,264
I'm not giving up.

572
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,439
We're going to die.

573
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,150
Both you and I are going to die.

574
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,571
I've got no hope left.

575
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,078
You people…

576
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,832
you've always got
a righteous look on your faces.

577
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,505
Do I really disgust you that much?

578
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,424
Do I?

579
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,762
Everyone looks at me that way.

580
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,942
I don't know if everyone hated me
because I was twisted,

581
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:02,530
or if I became twisted
because everyone hated me.

582
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,702
Remember what Kyuma said?

583
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,874
We can see a person's true character
in the face of death.

584
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,836
I finally understand

585
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,880
after facing death.

586
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,468
I'm not like you people
who take the blame for others.

587
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:28,181
I'm not the kind of person
who clings to hopes and dreams.

588
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,726
I'm scum.

589
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:59,421
I can finally pick up where we left off.

590
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:02,882
Let's have a good fuck

591
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,969
and face the end of our lives
with a smile on our faces!

592
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,104
Usagi!

593
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,067
Arisu!

594
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,069
Shut up!

595
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,586
Time remaining, nine minutes.

596
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:43,173
The King of Clubs Team
leads by 500 points.

597
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:58,284
