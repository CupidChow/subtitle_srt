1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,981
Hey. You didn't tighten this one.

2
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,899
Okay. Sorry.

3
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,193
Jeez! And the jack stand's
in the wrong place.

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,988
It could fall over.

5
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,699
I also told you two days ago.

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,702
You're completely hopeless.

7
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,120
Sorry.

8
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:38,997
SUMIRE
SERVING POPULAR DISHES AND FUGU

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,876
Darn that Kato.
He never stops treating me like a newbie.

10
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:49,549
But I won't be like my dad who worked
seven days a week, then got sick and died.

11
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,386
I may be working this lame job now,

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,765
but when I save up some money,
I'll go and learn English.

13
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,851
-Then I'll pursue bigger dreams.
-Didn't know it was so lame.

14
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,523
I'm going to work there for a long time.

15
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,817
I'm sorry that you don't like it.

16
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,070
Oh, sorry.

17
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,073
That attitude of yours
is why Kato always gets mad at you.

18
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,077
How can you talk like that
if you can't even tighten a screw?

19
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,788
This may be boring work,

20
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:24,125
but I work hard at it every day, get paid,

21
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,544
and my family appreciates me for it.

22
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,465
Has anyone ever appreciated
what you've done?

23
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,766
Hurry it up!

24
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,809
Get out of the way!

25
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,018
Yes, sir.

26
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,395
I'm going to remove the skid plate,
so take out the jack.

27
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,190
Okay. Excuse me.

28
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,919
-Hey!
-You okay?

29
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,129
Out of the way!

30
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,463
-Oh, shit!
-Lift the car!

31
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,427
It's off him!

32
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,138
Come on! You okay?

33
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,014
Hang in there! Take him out slowly!

34
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,645
You okay?

35
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,273
Call an ambulance! Now!

36
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,066
Got it! Will do!

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,568
Mr. Kato!

38
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,819
Mr. Kato! Hang in there!

39
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,195
The jack stand slipped!

40
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,490
Kato!

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,451
Kato is quitting.

42
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:42,871
What?

43
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,082
He can't use his hand anymore.

44
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:49,752
That's all.

45
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,091
I said that's all! Get out.

46
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,724
-Okay. I'll do it.
-Thank you.

47
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,435
-What about that oil change?
-Done already.

48
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,939
That guy…

49
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,822
Come on, focus.

50
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,160
We don't need any more accidents.

51
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,331
Can you hand me a wrench?

52
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,540
-Sure.
-Thank you.

53
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,751
Okay then, I'll check this myself.

54
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,897
Time remaining, nine minutes.

55
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,525
The King of Clubs Team
leads by 500 points.

56
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,972
You asshole!

57
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,724
What the fuck are you doing?

58
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,394
I'm trying to enjoy the last minutes
of this fucked-up game!

59
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,188
You son of a bitch!

60
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,275
You act so goddamn righteous.

61
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,444
You and I are the same!

62
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,073
But I fucking hate
how you're so full of stupid hope!

63
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,701
If I can watch you die
while tasting utter despair,

64
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,370
then I'll be glad to die here with you.

65
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,639
Just eight more minutes.

66
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,392
No sign of the enemy, huh?

67
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,354
I guess it's over.

68
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,358
What a letdown.

69
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:44,237
It only makes sense.
Whatever they try, they're out of time.

70
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,741
Maybe I'll go take a walk.

71
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,723
I never knew it could take so long…

72
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,852
to wait for death.

73
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,121
Arisu…

74
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,956
I'm sorry…

75
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,666
I couldn't fight…

76
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,878
alongside you till the end.

77
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,296
Usagi,

78
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,840
I should be the one apologizing.

79
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,884
I'm sorry.

80
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,946
Even now…

81
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,325
I'd hate that world if I went back.

82
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,703
But if you stay here, you'll never…

83
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,166
You can't just
randomly lead people around.

84
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,129
You need to listen to their feelings
and wait for them to come around.

85
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,426
Time remaining, seven minutes.

86
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,494
I knew you'd come.

87
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:03,501
I figured I might meet you if I came here.

88
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,715
I was thinking the same thing.

89
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,261
If I were you, Kyuma,

90
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,014
I'd probably come here to wait for me.

91
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,603
The ocean sure is large.

92
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,856
At the end of life,

93
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,651
we humans want to see something big.

94
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,831
You've defeated us.

95
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,879
You sure you have no regrets?

96
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,800
You know…

97
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,887
I'm a little bit disappointed.

98
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,017
Time remaining, five minutes.

99
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,521
Say, Kyuma.

100
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,861
Before I die, tell me…

101
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:14,989
the answer.

102
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,700
I can't do that.

103
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,037
I mean, you've given up.

104
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,083
I guess you're right.

105
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,300
Then…

106
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,762
at least,

107
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,681
before I die,

108
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,768
as the last thing I do,

109
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,063
can we shake hands?

110
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,231
Shake hands?

111
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,859
The game hasn't ended yet, you know.

112
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,028
If you touch me now,

113
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,530
we'll battle and I'll win.

114
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,955
From what you told me earlier…

115
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,502
I finally understand.

116
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,506
I should have listened…

117
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,010
to my teammates' feelings more

118
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,764
and waited for them to come around.

119
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,268
Then maybe,

120
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,313
we would have understood
each other better.

121
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,822
Though we're enemies…

122
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,952
Though we're adversaries…

123
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,166
I know it's crazy for me to feel this way,

124
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,215
but I appreciate what you've done.

125
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,429
You helped me realize
something very important.

126
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:12,148
There's no more time for me
to do anything about it though.

127
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,861
So at least,

128
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,197
before I die…

129
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,077
Since you made me realize it…

130
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,081
I'd like to shake hands with you.

131
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,347
Okay.

132
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,642
Since it's my rival's final request,

133
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,604
I will gladly do it.

134
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,443
Thank you, Kyuma.

135
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,404
Arisu.

136
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,951
I enjoyed competing against you.

137
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,009
There has been a change
in points for both teams.

138
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,604
Seriously?

139
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,150
The Player Team leads by 500 points.

140
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,445
KYUMA: 14,000 LOSE
ARISU & TATTA: 14,950 WIN

141
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,989
KYUMA: 13,500
ARISU & TATTA: 15,450

142
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,909
How did that happen?

143
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,454
You have 14,950 points?

144
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,541
What kind of trick is this?

145
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,460
It's no trick.

146
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,679
Time remaining, seven minutes.

147
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,803
What are you doing? Stop it!

148
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,555
I'm going to take off this bracelet!

149
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,723
Stop it!

150
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,562
Dammit.

151
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,898
I can't get it off.

152
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,276
I can't do it.

153
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,571
Arisu…

154
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,240
Do it for me.

155
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,493
Are you insane?

156
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,039
I came up with a good idea.

157
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,541
There are 10,100 points on this.

158
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,338
If you secretly carry this,
you'll have the power of two.

159
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,424
This way, we can pull ahead of them.

160
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,302
I can't do that.

161
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,722
There's no rule
against removing the bracelets.

162
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,311
Please!

163
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,190
I could never do that!

164
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,651
There's no time!

165
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,486
Please!

166
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,957
This will bring us victory.

167
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,753
Our lives are on the line, you know?

168
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,254
Our lives depend on this!

169
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,341
Time remaining, six minutes.

170
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,385
We'll all die!

171
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,263
Arisu…

172
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,349
Do it!

173
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,770
There's no other way!

174
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,771
Hurry!

175
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,606
I can't…

176
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,484
Do you want to kill us all?

177
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,485
Do it!

178
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,321
Do it now!

179
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,532
Do it!

180
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,160
Arisu!

181
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,706
Do it!

182
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,989
Tatta!

183
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:12,906
I'm sorry!

184
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,366
I'm sorry!

185
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,078
I'm sorry…

186
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,080
I made you do this.

187
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,630
Take this.

188
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,883
-I've got to stop the bleeding!
-Forget it! Go!

189
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,645
Arisu…

190
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,649
Remember how you said
"Thank you" to me earlier?

191
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,236
That made me really happy.

192
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,326
Let me be the guy
who does something cool for once.

193
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,455
I'll be fine.

194
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,957
I won't die from just this.

195
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,212
Hurry or we'll all die!

196
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,129
Go!

197
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,717
Go!

198
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,427
Go!

199
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,661
Holy shit…

200
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,666
You're way more fucked up than I am.

201
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,254
This was thanks to my teammate.

202
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:58,137
Looks like we're the losers.

203
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,184
But even you

204
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,563
must be afraid of dying.

205
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,357
No.

206
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,444
But I made a promise
to Shitara who died earlier.

207
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,868
He said he'd beat the shit
out of me if we lost.

208
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,414
I don't like the idea
of getting beat up in heaven.

209
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,127
And everyone
who trusted me will be angry too.

210
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,300
I'm sorry.

211
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,598
It was just like you said.

212
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:49,396
In this game,
both our teams battled each other

213
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,317
with all our might and all our souls.

214
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,779
And I learned something.

215
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,325
Kyuma…

216
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,787
You guys were once players too,
weren't you?

217
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,961
Damn that Kyuma.

218
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,007
He let his guard down at the end.

219
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,012
You're the one to talk.

220
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,182
You're right.

221
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:31,647
We only survived this long
thanks to Kyuma.

222
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,567
So I won't criticize him for failing.

223
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,028
For sure.

224
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,698
Thank you, Kyuma.

225
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,534
It was fun!

226
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,373
Let's do crazy shit on the other side too!

227
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,635
Kyuma…

228
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,181
Your feelings for your teammates
are the same as ours.

229
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,270
They came from surviving deathmatches
over and over again…

230
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,897
together.

231
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,025
Just like us,

232
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,282
you guys were players
who won game after game.

233
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,828
Isn't that right?

234
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,585
But even after clearing all the games,

235
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,174
you couldn't return and could only
become citizens of this land, right?

236
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,762
Please…

237
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,766
Tell me!

238
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,650
If that's how it seems to you,

239
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,987
then that must be the truth.

240
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,162
You call that an answer?

241
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,001
If that's the truth…

242
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,136
then…

243
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,140
there's no point in continuing to play.

244
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,935
So, you'll quit playing the games?

245
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,358
Why are we doing this?

246
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,325
I can't do it.

247
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,122
I can't become tough like you.

248
00:22:56,083 --> 00:23:00,128
You'll never be like me,
and there's no need to be like me.

249
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,715
The choice

250
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,593
is always yours alone.

251
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,058
Time has run out.

252
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,228
Since the King of Clubs Team
has fewer points,

253
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,397
the game is over
for all their team members.

254
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,816
Arisu…

255
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,236
Well done.

256
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,496
I don't want you to die!

257
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:42,254
Once we meet here, one of us has to die.
Those are the rules.

258
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,966
If we hadn't met in this game, we could…

259
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,260
It's exactly because we met in this game,

260
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,304
that we came to understand one another.

261
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,143
If we'd met somewhere else,

262
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,273
we could have become friends.

263
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,279
Aren't we already friends?

264
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,783
Arisu.

265
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,036
I hope you find it soon.

266
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,251
I hope you find
your own true reason for living…

267
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,462
not just someone else's.

268
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,601
I pray for that from my heart.

269
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,284
So, this is death.

270
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,163
It's actually not so bad.

271
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,753
I don't have a single regret.

272
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,843
It's been the ideal life.

273
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,097
Kyuma…

274
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,851
The Player Team has cleared the game.

275
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,653
Usagi?

276
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,412
Kuina…

277
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,205
We won.

278
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,249
What?

279
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,043
Really?

280
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,089
PLAYER TEAM
CONGRATULATIONS

281
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,300
Arisu must have pulled something off.

282
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,180
We won?

283
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,316
Tatta, are you okay?

284
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,817
Tatta!

285
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,444
Wake up!

286
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,159
Hang in there!

287
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,038
Tatta!

288
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,460
Tatta…

289
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,172
Tatta.

290
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,216
We won.

291
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,843
We won the game!

292
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,929
It's thanks to you!

293
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,973
All right.

294
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,479
Come on, stay with us!

295
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,314
Hang in there!

296
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,066
Tatta!

297
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,528
What do you think?

298
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,906
Even I…

299
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,119
can do a good job when I try.

300
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,831
Yeah! You did well!

301
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,333
It's all thanks to you, Tatta!

302
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,337
Thank you.

303
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,347
Hey, Tatta.

304
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,517
Tatta! Don't go!

305
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,936
Don't!

306
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,438
Tatta!

307
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,523
Tatta!

308
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,192
You've got to be kidding.
Stay with us, Tatta!

309
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,944
Tatta!

310
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,488
Don't go!

311
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,282
Tatta!

312
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,534
Tatta!

313
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,538
Tatta…

314
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,957
Don't go…

315
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,621
It's a beautiful view.

316
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,750
It's not so bad right here.

317
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,668
Yeah.

318
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,182
I can't.

319
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,311
I can't let this go to waste.

320
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,653
We need to keep on going for Tatta's sake.

321
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,005
When I think about
how it was you who saved me,

322
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,508
it makes me sick.

323
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,345
But you know…

324
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,641
since I'm still alive, I can't complain.

325
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,649
Thanks, man.

326
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:35,059
TEIO PRISON

327
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,727
PUT ON A COLLAR AND GO UPSTAIRS
TO THE CENTRAL GUARDROOM.

328
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,795
Difficulty, Jack of Hearts.

329
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,924
Game, Prison Cell.

330
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:36,347
Rules. Guess the suit that appears
on the back of your collar.

331
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:40,268
However, you cannot see your own suit.

332
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,813
I can't see it.

333
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,734
The time limit per round is one hour.

334
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,944
Five minutes before the time is up,

335
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,948
enter one of the prison cells
and guess what your own suit is.

336
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,595
If you do not guess your suit correctly,
the game is over for you.

337
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:21,142
When time runs out,
your collar will explode and you will die.

338
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,438
In addition,
your suit will change at every round.

339
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,611
But we just need to have
someone tell us what it is, right?

340
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,237
That'll be easy.

341
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,864
I wouldn't be so sure.

342
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,742
They haven't told us
how to clear the game.

343
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:43,498
Prison Cell is a test of
how much you can trust others.

344
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,543
In addition, the Jack of Hearts
has secretly joined the game

345
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,338
as one of the participants.

346
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,757
See? There it is.

347
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:59,305
One of us is the Jack of Hearts.

348
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,475
Clear condition.

349
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,311
Every hour, this will be repeated.

350
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,063
The game is cleared

351
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:11,359
when the Jack of Hearts,
who is hiding among you, is killed.

352
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,196
Prohibited activities.

353
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,991
Using reflective objects to see your suit.

354
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:24,372
You also may not use violence
or weapons to kill others.

355
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,707
In other words,

356
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,128
until the Jack fails
to answer correctly and dies,

357
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,963
this game won't end.

358
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,340
Which means,

359
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,761
unless we lie to the Jack,
we can't clear this game.

360
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,764
There is no time limit.

361
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,307
No time limit?

362
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,602
There is plenty of food.

363
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,230
What?

364
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,241
While participating in this game,

365
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,910
the days remaining
on your visas will not be reduced.

366
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,165
Unless we lie like crazy

367
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,876
and eliminate anyone
suspected of being the Jack,

368
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,879
we'll be in this prison forever.

369
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,592
A life sentence, huh?

370
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,678
The game will now start.

371
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,221
ROUND 1

372
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:26,100
You may pass the time anywhere you like
until it is time to enter a prison cell.

373
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:35,943
Seriously?

374
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,325
Well…

375
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,995
Will you please tell me?

376
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,914
I'll tell you yours.

377
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,250
In this game,

378
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:57,089
the 20 of us need to kill each other off
until we get the Jack of Hearts, right?

379
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,719
Are you sure
you want to trust each other so easily?

380
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,350
Let's go downstairs.

381
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:26,911
I have an idea.

382
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,206
Why don't we form a team
and tell one another?

383
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,875
If we do that, then we can't lie.

384
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,168
I agree.

385
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,004
Can I be on the team?

386
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,005
Me too.

387
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,633
Me too, please.

388
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,761
The more, the merrier.

389
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,845
Can I join too?

390
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,848
-Tell me. What suit am I?
-Okay…

391
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,850
Well…

392
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,270
Speak up, man!

393
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,189
-What am I? Come on.
-But…

394
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,067
Can't you say it? I'll tell you yours too.

395
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,027
Okay.

396
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,828
Hey, let's tell each other.

397
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,248
If you want to survive,

398
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,334
you need to observe
everyone here very closely.

399
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,422
You need to remember everyone
who doesn't lie.

400
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,135
Besides, I could be
the Jack of Hearts myself.

401
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,596
Look.

402
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,141
They've already broken up into groups.

403
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,353
They're all sizing up one another
to see if they can trust anyone.

404
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,442
See those two?

405
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,325
Do you know what they were doing
before the game began?

406
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:58,711
Really?

407
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,839
That guy's got massive confidence.

408
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,883
He's got her under his thumb

409
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,220
and won't let her get involved
with any other participants.

410
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:13,559
In this game, if you build
ultimate confidence with one person,

411
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,436
you'll survive and win.

412
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:16,771
Hey.

413
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,485
It looks like
you still don't have a partner.

414
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,197
Tell me my suit, and I'll tell you yours.

415
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,120
That's a pretty damn
authoritative way of speaking.

416
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:34,789
What?

417
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,793
I can tell a lot
from your childish attitude.

418
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,256
You're ashamed of your own dark side
and are jealous of everyone.

419
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,385
Behind those bangs
is where you keep your real self.

420
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,639
You hide your face to keep people
from seeing your disgusting true nature.

421
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,850
You're the type

422
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,645
who makes yourself feel better
by looking down on others.

423
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,820
But that's what I like about you.

424
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,371
Let's be friends.

425
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,845
Say, would you like to join our team?

426
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,764
It's okay if you don't want to.

427
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,975
No, I don't mind…

428
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,770
Okay. Let's work together.

429
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,607
-Do you want to join us?
-Yeah.

430
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,068
I'll be in your care.

431
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,530
First, we'll start with me.

432
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,658
Tell me what suit I am, everybody.

433
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,871
Urumi, your suit is heart.

434
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,039
-Yes, heart.
-It's heart.

435
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,295
Okay, now for me, please.

436
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,504
You're a heart too.

437
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,089
-It's heart.
-Heart.

438
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,217
I'll go next.

439
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,847
-It's spade.
-Yes, it's spade.

440
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,098
-It's spade.
-Spade.

441
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,142
-Can I go next?
-Okay.

442
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,312
-Diamond.
-It's diamond.

443
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,605
My turn next.

444
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,899
-It's diamond.
-Thank you.

445
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,318
-It's diamond.
-Okay. Mine, please.

446
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,612
-It's spade.
-It's club.

447
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,363
Thank you.

448
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,407
Oh, and me, please?

449
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,452
It is time to make your guess.

450
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:41,415
Everyone, please enter a prison cell.
One person per cell, please.

451
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,518
Please make your guess.

452
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,020
Diamond.

453
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:33,092
Well, well. That was easy.

454
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,392
Thank goodness.

455
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,893
Let's work together again.

456
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,438
Thanks goodness. I'm so happy.

457
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,527
Round 2 will now start.

458
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,995
-Thank you very much, everyone.
-Not at all. Thank you as well.

459
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,998
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

460
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,293
-Let's do it again.
-Yes, let's.

461
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,795
-Please.
-Likewise.

462
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,424
You know,
I wonder how long this will last.

463
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,303
Either the Jack will start killing people,

464
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,681
or someone who's afraid they'll be killed
will start killing others.

465
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:26,145
Until one of those things happens,
this will never end.

466
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,855
That's exactly right.

467
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,068
As long as we're all telling each other,
we'll be fine.

468
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,696
I wouldn't be so sure.

469
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,531
What's your goddamn problem?

470
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,244
Hurry up and tell me, fucker!

471
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,501
You okay?

472
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,173
Tell him "club."

473
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,976
You want another knuckle sandwich?

474
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,237
Now tell me!

475
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:18,989
Club…

476
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,032
What?

477
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,659
Club!

478
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,252
Tell me faster next time.

479
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,688
Now the game is starting for real.

480
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,248
Are you all right?

481
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:11,792
Yeah.

482
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,379
Why don't you join our group too?

483
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,341
Thank you.

484
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,312
ROUND 2

485
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,022
It is time to make your guess.

486
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:38,986
Everyone, please enter a prison cell.
One person per cell, please.

487
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,301
Please make your guess.

488
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,387
Club.

489
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,234
GENKI KIRIU

490
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,078
Hey, what do we do now?

491
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,915
He's dead.

492
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:34,875
That guy, huh?

493
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,544
He really died…

494
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,590
That person, right? That was him, no?

495
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,059
Say…

496
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,230
He's probably the Jack.

497
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,777
He lied and killed that guy.

498
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:08,825
Let's kill him on this round.

499
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:10,994
What?

500
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,206
You mean

501
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:18,252
you want us to lie to him?

502
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,299
I mean, he's clearly the Jack.

503
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,510
Even if he's not, he's dangerous.

504
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,097
Let's kill him now while we can.

505
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,414
So, next…

506
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:56,873
Your turn.

507
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:01,837
Heart.

508
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,255
-It is.
-It's heart.

509
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,756
-That's right.
-Thank you.

510
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,175
-Could you do mine next?
-Sure.

511
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,470
Your suit is diamond.

512
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,389
It's diamond.

513
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,057
-It's diamond.
-Diamond.

514
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,518
Do mine, please.

515
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,690
Your suit is spade.

516
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,527
-Spade…
-It's spade…

517
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,779
-It's spade.
-It's spade.

518
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,031
Thank you.

519
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,397
Please make your guess.

520
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:05,734
Spade.

521
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,739
AKIFUMI SETO

522
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,870
Round 4 will now start.

523
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,831
What? How come?

524
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,001
You mean he wasn't the Jack of Hearts?

525
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,383
You see? Just like I told you.

526
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:34,137
People are already starting
to lose their sanity.

527
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,975
Even though there is no time limit,

528
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,062
this won't take long to end.

529
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,806
That woman…

530
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:21,768
When we were planning
to lie to that guy, she was against it.

531
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,521
Why don't we get rid of her?

532
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,577
Mine, please.

533
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,288
Diamond.

534
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,832
-Yes, it's diamond.
-It's diamond.

535
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,629
Okay, mine too, please.

536
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,845
Your suit is club.

537
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,597
Club…

538
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,766
-Club.
-It's club.

539
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,894
-Club. It's club.
-Club.

540
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:06,938
Thank you.

541
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,324
Please make your guess.

542
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,370
Spade.

543
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,421
MEISA TOKUI

544
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,594
-It's spade.
-Yes, it's spade.

545
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,179
-Spade.
-Thank you.

546
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:41,973
Mine, please.

547
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,642
It's club.

548
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,144
-Club.
-Yes, it's club.

549
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,609
Your suit is heart.

550
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,319
It's heart.

551
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,154
-Heart.
-Heart.

552
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,240
Now mine, please.

553
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,621
Yours is spade.

554
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,290
-Spade.
-It's spade.

555
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,084
Thank you.

556
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,006
Excuse me.

557
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,259
Sorry.

558
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,302
Sorry.

559
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,767
If it's possible,
could you tell me my suit?

560
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,313
I can't trust my group anymore.

561
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,235
Sure.

562
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,071
Thank you.

563
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,407
I appreciate this.

564
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,163
It's club.

565
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,416
Club…

566
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,294
Club…

567
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,380
Club.

568
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:57,841
Thank you.

569
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,759
Thank you.

570
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,136
Club.

571
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,143
Just in case.

572
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,783
Please make your guess.

573
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,122
Club.

574
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,133
SHINOBU FURUTA

575
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,720
Round 6 will now start.

576
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,102
Why are they lying to each other?

577
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,980
Well, it only figures.

578
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,025
Nobody wants to die.

579
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,885
MASASHI OTA, KAKERU KISHOIN

580
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,139
Round 9 will now start.

581
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,519
I can't take this anymore.

582
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,562
I'm going to puke.

583
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,983
Pull yourself together.

584
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,902
Yours is club.

585
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,946
Okay, now tell me mine.

586
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,574
D…

587
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,412
D…

588
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,164
Heart.

589
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:55,834
Heart.

590
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,210
-It's heart.
-Heart.

591
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,354
Let's get rid of him.

592
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,356
-What?
-What?

593
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,817
For a second there, he tried to lie to me.

594
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,404
I don't think he likes
the way I'm doing things.

595
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,321
But…

596
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:29,325
Unless we get rid of him soon,
you'll be in danger too.

597
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,041
Round 10 will now start.

598
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:40,336
Let's get rid of her.

599
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,550
That woman is dangerous.

600
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,763
We can't let that woman

601
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:52,599
keep doing just as she pleases.

602
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,033
Here you are.

603
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:13,036
First, here's a drink.

604
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,538
And some crackers.

605
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,625
Your selection sucks.

606
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,505
I don't like them.

607
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,257
-Let's kill…
-I don't like them.

608
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,343
those two.

609
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:30,678
What?

610
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,456
Spade…

611
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,084
Diamond…

612
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:03,962
Diamond.

613
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,839
Spade.

614
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:07,799
Diamond.

615
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,176
Thank you.

616
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,595
You're the only ones I can trust.

617
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,314
Please make your guess.

618
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,320
Diamond.

619
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,363
Spade!

620
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,666
URUMI AKAMAKI

621
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:42,584
MOTOHIKO KANEKO

622
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,178
Spade.

623
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,181
Club.

624
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,272
SATOMI AOKI

625
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,860
It's going exactly the way
the Jack of Hearts wants it to.

626
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,656
Once the taboo of killing
your own teammates is broken,

627
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,992
the whole group breaks down.

628
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,872
But that won't happen to us.

629
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,290
That's right.

630
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,543
You don't need to worry.

631
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,087
I'll protect you.

632
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,467
Oh, Mr. Yaba…

633
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,316
This game is insane!

634
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,153
Diamond.

635
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,912
How long will this continue?

636
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,337
I can't take it anymore.

637
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,802
I thought…

638
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,472
people were better than this.

639
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,185
You've lived a blessed life.

640
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,314
But you know,

641
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:33,903
the reality we're faced with
is happening right here and now.

642
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:40,451
Right now, all you and I can do
is tell each other what our suit is.

643
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,580
That's the only way we'll survive.

644
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,714
Anyway, let's hang in there.

645
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,012
Okay.

646
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,639
Mine, please.

647
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,734
Heart.

648
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,587
I can't do this.

649
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:38,843
I…

650
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:41,679
can't take this.

651
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,642
Please make your guess.

652
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,490
I want out!

653
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:06,829
IPPEI OKI

654
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,510
You were far too kind-hearted,

655
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,095
Ippei.

656
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,351
Well…

657
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,521
I've lost my partner.

658
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,124
I think I'm in a bind.

659
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:32,076
