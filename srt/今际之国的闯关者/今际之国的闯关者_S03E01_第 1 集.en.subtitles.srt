1
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:23,523
Now, all the surviving players
will be given a choice.

2
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,986
Please select whether you will accept
permanent residence in this land

3
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,280
or if you will not accept it.

4
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,829
I…

5
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,168
don't want permanent residence.

6
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,129
I also…

7
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,176
don't want it.

8
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:57,599
PERMANENT RESIDENCE IN THIS LAND
ACCEPT / DO NOT ACCEPT

9
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,689
Of course, I'll take it.

10
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,734
I will gladly take it as well.

11
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:15,158
This place offers endless possibilities.

12
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,095
I saw a red light.

13
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,140
But…

14
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:45,480
I thought it was fireworks,
so I didn't pay much attention to it.

15
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:51,152
I hid in a toilet stall with my friends.

16
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,241
I won't go into how we got there.

17
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:02,831
But then everything went quiet.

18
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,796
I don't remember anything after that.

19
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:17,178
The meteorite strike caused you
to go into cardiac arrest, correct?

20
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,639
That's right.

21
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,394
Do you remember anything else?

22
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,486
There's nothing else.

23
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:41,161
Do you remember dreaming
while you were unconscious?

24
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,746
Did I dream?

25
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,875
About games.

26
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,086
"Games"?

27
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,880
Did you?

28
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,342
A dream about games
where your life was on the line.

29
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,479
No.

30
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,150
You didn't?

31
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,528
But…

32
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,031
But what?

33
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,037
I feel like I dreamed about a journey.

34
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:26,915
"A journey"?

35
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:33,796
Like I went to… a far-off land.

36
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,770
Don't push yourself too hard.
Thank you for your time today.

37
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,275
Please, Matsuyama. No leading questions.

38
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:58,238
They might distort his memories.

39
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,282
Multiple survivors mentioned games.

40
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,201
You may have planted the idea.

41
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:07,664
Fireworks came up again.
Multiple survivors mentioned that.

42
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,666
It was probably just the meteor.

43
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,712
They all clearly experienced
the same thing.

44
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,769
A former genius researching the afterlife…
He's lost it.

45
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,939
He wasn't always like this.

46
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,109
-The Shibuya meteorite changed everyone.
-No, before that.

47
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,196
That accident five years ago,
where the student died.

48
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,864
Oh, right.

49
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,866
That.

50
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,291
There was nothing I could do.

51
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,003
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,632
Forgive me.

53
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,875
The main hall is that way. Thank you.

54
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,251
You're welcome.

55
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,377
Thank you.

56
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:43,384
I found your dream
about a journey very interesting.

57
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,387
I'd love to hear more sometime.

58
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,016
Please contact me directly
if you remember anything.

59
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,267
Okay, I will.

60
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,396
Even if it seems absurd.

61
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,648
"Absurd"?

62
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,194
Something no one else would believe.

63
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,654
All right?

64
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,578
This way.

65
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,545
Arisu.

66
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,590
Hey. Sorry it took so long.

67
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,095
-You must be tired.
-Sorry. Were you waiting long?

68
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,021
This is my wife.

69
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,235
-Mr. Matsuyama is an assistant professor.
-Hello.

70
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,530
My wife was also interviewed here today.

71
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,074
You were in Shibuya too?

72
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,368
-That's right.
-I see.

73
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,664
Would you tell me your story next time?

74
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,419
-Okay.
-I'm Ryuji Matsuyama.

75
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,550
ASST. PROFESSOR, DEPT. OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
SHUSHIKAN UNIVERSITY

76
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,427
I'll be in touch.

77
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,513
Sure.

78
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,689
What did they ask you?

79
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,234
A bunch of stuff
about dreams and other things.

80
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,779
Like we could ever remember.

81
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,412
I wish my university was this big.

82
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,332
Have you gotten used to
your counseling internship?

83
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,209
Yeah, pretty much.

84
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,380
I bet I'll get hired full-time
after I graduate next year.

85
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,593
Wow! I finally get a proper husband.

86
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:49,927
Excuse me?

87
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,812
Takuma Hagio.

88
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,815
Sumiko Murakoshi.

89
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,358
NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES

90
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,568
Saaya Ishii.

91
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,862
ANSWERS FROM THE AFTERLIFE

92
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,946
Shuto Aida.

93
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,203
In my study,
the aforementioned ten subjects…

94
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,040
spoke of near-death experiences.

95
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,251
They all had…

96
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,295
COHORT STUDY ON TOKYO METEORITE SURVIVORS

97
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,297
…the exact same dream.

98
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,258
A journey.

99
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,719
A deserted city.

100
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,096
Games.

101
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,724
Fireworks.

102
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,315
MESSAGE

103
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:51,239

FROM: NEAR-DEATH SUPPORT GROUP INFO

TELL ME MORE. I'LL PAY 100 COINS

00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,663
DEAL. ASK "HIM" FOR DETAILS

MR. LORD

109

100 COINS
COINS SENT

110
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:08,214
MR. R, I FOUND A LEAD
THAT MAY INTEREST YOU

111
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,617
Whoa!

112
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,787
I can't believe this is Shibuya.

113
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,871
Seriously?

114
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,456
Whoa!

115
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,861
Are you Mr. R?

116
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,158
Yes, I'm R.

117
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:17,885
So… are you interested
in that seminar too?

118
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,013
Yes.

119
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,224
Could you invite me?

120
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,143
I heard there's a strict referral…

121
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,814
Let me know when you're ready.

122
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,942
-Tea, please.
-I'll have the same.

123
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,860
Okay.

124
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,158
I wouldn't recommend it.

125
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:43,911
But

126
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,164
if you do go, you'll understand

127
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,417
it's the real deal.

128
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,755
What sort of experience did you have?

129
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,261
We do strange things.

130
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,474
"Strange things"? Like what?

131
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,771
Games.

132
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:15,985
"Games"?

133
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,738
Yes.

134
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,490
They're exhilarating.

135
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,494
Like a sacred ritual.

136
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,344
You'll receive an email invitation
in a week.

137
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,724
Go to the specified location.

138
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,022
INBOX: (NO SUBJECT)

139
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,423
MR. R, THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST

140
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,968
AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW,
WE HEREBY INVITE YOU TO THE "SEMINAR"

141
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,227
TUE, OCT 14, 2024, 23:00
KOTO SIDE OFFICE

142
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,647
WE LOOK FORWARD
TO YOUR ATTENDANCE, MR. R

143
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,016
Thank you for coming.

144
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,186
Please be seated over here.

145
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,292
Please take a seat.

146
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,087
On that chair.

147
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,341
You shouldn't move once you've sat down.

148
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,995
Now then, let's begin the game.

149
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,539
What game?

150
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,043
I came here for a near-death experience.

151
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:47,381
You can only take part in the journey
if you win this game.

152
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,967
"Journey"?

153
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,431
Let's begin.

154
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,726
The game is Old Maid.

155
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,485
Please take your cards.

156
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:21,665
Any pairs in your hand must be discarded.

157
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,292
I have a pair!

158
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,630
Whoever has the Joker,
aka Old Maid, at the end wins.

159
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,801
Okay, let's start with you.

160
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:39,641
Note that whoever has the Joker
drawn from their hand is eliminated.

161
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,144
What?

162
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,737
You all heard me, right?

163
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,365
You shouldn't move once you've sat down.

164
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,120
If you do, you're eliminated.

165
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,457
She's dead.

166
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,337
No way. It's just an act, right?

167
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,005
Now it's getting interesting.

168
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,707
Crap.

169
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,977
The odds are fifty-fifty.

170
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,687
One of us will die.

171
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,304
Welcome to Borderland.

172
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,582
Dad?

173
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,458
Are you okay?

174
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:21,918
Yeah.

175
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,717
Had a bad dream?

176
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,262
Are you all right?

177
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,266
Yeah, I'm fine.

178
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,812
I just need some water.

179
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:54,409
YUZUHA ARISU

180
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,994
RESIDENTIAL LEASE

181
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,873
We should consider buying someday
instead of renting, right?

182
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,834
But first, we need to save some money.

183
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,961
Right.

184
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,256
We splurged on our wedding rings.

185
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,634
True.

186
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,222
What an unusual color.

187
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,807
That? I bought it by accident.

188
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,810
I really like this color.

189
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,229
You can have it.

190
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,396
Really? Yay.

191
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,816
Want some help moving?

192
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,237
No, I'll hire someone. I've got work too.

193
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,781
I'll let you handle this.

194
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,782
Sure.

195
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,284
Gotta go. Bye.

196
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,745
-Take care.
-See you.

197
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,709
You're still brushing your teeth?

198
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,962
You'll be late. Bye.

199
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,129
Okay, see you.

200
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,432
On the 19th of this month,
seven seminar attendees

201
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,186
were found dead in a unit
of a mixed-use building

202
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,771
in Koto City, Tokyo.

203
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:10,443
Police are investigating the incident
as a possible group suicide.

204
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:17,534
The Tokyo Bay Area
is popular with foreign tourists,

205
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,996
and we expect
that they'll also visit our store.

206
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,582
Then we should offer
a wide range of sizes.

207
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,419
Like in Shibuya and Shinjuku,
where large sizes sell well.

208
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,546
Right. I see your point.

209
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,552
Here's the referral.

210
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,306
This client was a victim
of the disaster at Shibuya Station.

211
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:45,353
They have chronic PTSD
and are still suffering from flashbacks.

212
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,106
Trauma from the meteorite incident.

213
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,860
-Show them to the room.
-Will do.

214
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,699
Excuse me. Would you please
fill out this medical questionnaire?

215
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,619
Please include your name and address.

216
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,540
Good morning.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

217
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,794
Please follow me.

218
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,853
Can I get you something?

219
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,981
We have coffee, tea… Whatever you like.

220
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,484
Cold drinks too.

221
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,985
Arisu.

222
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:43,161
We've… met before.

223
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,665
What?

224
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,468
Our paths crossed

225
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,722
in a far-off place.

226
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,475
"A far-off place"?

227
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,438
Some who had that near-death experience

228
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,400
said they entered another world.

229
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,446
Did they find hope there?

230
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,074
Or did they find despair?

231
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:10,498
You must have had
a near-death experience too.

232
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,003
You should have memories of that world.

233
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,050
Arisu…

234
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,680
It's all real. You just don't remember it.

235
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:03,468
You probably think I'm crazy.

236
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,639
But that world is real.

237
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,309
Both you and I

238
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,479
fought there and survived.

239
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,274
That's how we…

240
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,986
returned to this world alive.

241
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:31,264
I want to know what happened to us.

242
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,267
So I did everything I could

243
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,478
to find a way to return to that world.

244
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,982
And I found one.

245
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,861
A way to enter that world…

246
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,742
by using a certain drug.

247
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,913
Sorry for the wait.

248
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,499
Please have a seat.

249
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,886
INCOMING CALL
YUZUHA USAGI

250
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,181
Quitting time?

251
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,183
Arisu…

252
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,143
Wanna come over?

253
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,191
What's wrong?

254
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,318
Where are you?

255
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,530
Arisu…

256
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,241
Yeah?

257
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,660
I'll come get you.

258
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,919
Usagi?

259
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,631
I'm sorry.

260
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,134
Usagi?

261
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,940
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

262
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,803
Usagi?

263
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,393
You there?

264
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:29,400
The Public Safety Division
is also investigating this.

265
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,905
At this point,
nothing suspicious has been found.

266
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,742
But she still hasn't even
contacted her workplace.

267
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:41,621
There is something
we'd like you to look at.

268
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,622
Show him.

269
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:49,212
This is security footage from the hotel
where your wife was last seen.

270
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,425
It's a resort hotel in the Tokyo Bay Area.

271
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,932
Do you recognize this man?

272
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:04,936
Yes.

273
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,355
I met him once before.

274
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,608
He teaches at Shushikan University.

275
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,152
Was he acquainted with your wife?

276
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,865
We met him at his school
about two weeks ago.

277
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,205
Did he abduct her?

278
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,751
No, there's a more plausible explanation.

279
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,879
I hate to say this,

280
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,343
but could she have been
secretly meeting with him?

281
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,638
It is a hotel, after all.

282
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,932
And since you say they're acquainted,

283
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:48,396
you might want to look into this
before filing a missing person report.

284
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,033
I can't find my wife.

285
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,744
She met with the professor
before I lost contact.

286
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,916
Professor Matsuyama hasn't been
answering his phone either.

287
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,001
What?

288
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,970
He was obsessed
with strange subjects like the afterlife.

289
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,473
But it's not like him
to be absent without notice,

290
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,767
so we wondered if something happened.

291
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,905
He was also investigating occult meetings.

292
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,573
It was scary.

293
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,116
MASS SUICIDES AND CULTS

294
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,326
NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES

295
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,578
Was your wife involved too?

296
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,343
DID SHIGENORI USAGI KILL HIMSELF
AFTER STAGED-CLIMB ACCUSATIONS?

297
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,140
YUZUHA ARISU

298
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:16,108
YUZUHA ARISU: INTERVIEW

299
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,819
Do you dream often?

300
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,783
I think so.

301
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,453
What sort of dreams?

302
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,956
Could you be more specific?

303
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,548
I see the same scene over and over.

304
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,760
Is it

305
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,054
a nightmare?

306
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,142
My father…

307
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,315
He kills himself.

308
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,319
I see.

309
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,699
Any issues with him?

310
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,034
None at all.

311
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,330
My dad was a wonderful person.

312
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,001
Could it be that

313
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,796
you didn't get to say goodbye?

314
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,049
Or that you have regrets?

315
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,266
Don't push yourself.

316
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,146
No, please listen.

317
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,066
I can't tell anyone else.

318
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,153
Even your husband?

319
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,534
I don't… want to tell him.

320
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,915
I met my husband, and we got married.

321
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,753
I should be getting on with my life.

322
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,632
But I'm still hung up on my dad.

323
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,561
When I dream,

324
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:20,858
I can feel my dad's presence.

325
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,028
It's like he's right there.

326
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,532
Even if I cry…

327
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,660
Even if it hurts…

328
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,957
Even if I see him kill himself…

329
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,960
If my dad is there…

330
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,226
Even if it's a nightmare…

331
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,355
I want to be there.

332
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,921
The player who played a part
in winning every single game…

333
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,800
I became a citizen thanks to you.

334
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,435
I've wanted to meet you.

335
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:42,815
Won't you return to that beautiful world?

336
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,659
It will all come back to you.

337
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,079
Then you, too, will return to that world.

338
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,959
Let the games begin.

339
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,759
Your beloved will also be participating…

340
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,013
in the games.

341
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,685
Let's have fun.

342
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,561
-How is she?
-She's in a coma.

343
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,689
But she could go
into cardiac arrest at any moment.

344
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:09,401
There were no signs of resistance
or a violent struggle.

345
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,028
According to the doctor,

346
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:15,574
the man she was with may have forced her
to take some kind of drug.

347
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,784
A drug?

348
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,452
It might be a murder-suicide.

349
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,830
Doctor, he's here.

350
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,709
-You're the husband?
-Yes.

351
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:30,714
I know this is a bad time,
but according to a blood test,

352
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,093
your wife is pregnant.

353
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:35,803
What?

354
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,473
It's still early,
so we can't detect a heartbeat.

355
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,393
Your wife might not have known.

356
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,562
You can go in.

357
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,298
Usagi.

358
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,678
This is the man
who was found collapsed with her.

359
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,222
Please have a look.

360
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,861
So you recognize him?

361
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,406
Can we ask you some questions?

362
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:52,838
Have you heard about
the mass suicides in Tokyo?

363
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,341
What?

364
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:59,386
Are you saying that guy abducted my wife

365
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,514
and got her mixed up
in those mass suicides?

366
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:06,602
It seems he'd been attending
those seminars.

367
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,313
We traced their movements after the hotel.

368
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:14,652
First, she was taken
to the university where he worked.

369
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:19,531
After that, they went to the building
where they were found unconscious.

370
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:25,496
Your wife may have gotten
mixed up in this case.

371
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,668
I tried to tell you.

372
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,963
But you wouldn't listen!

373
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:42,721
We can't act without concrete evidence.

374
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,146
May we ask you…

375
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,443
to check your wife's belongings?

376
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:06,995
If something seems out of place,
please let us know.

377
00:45:59,131 --> 00:45:59,965
Well?

378
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,260
Notice anything?

379
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,681
Your beloved will also be participating.

380
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,270
No, nothing.

381
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,899
That Joker card…

382
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,819
Matsuyama had one too.

383
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,579
Even if it seems absurd.

384
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,081
"Absurd"?

385
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,918
Something no one else would believe.

386
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,003
"A far-off place"?

387
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,088
That world is real.

388
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,809
TAKINOGAWA SANATORIUM

389
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,818
This way.

390
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,737
The train will be stopping…

391
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,999
My wife is in a coma.

392
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,627
And she's pregnant.

393
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,589
But her heart may soon stop.

394
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,008
It's only a matter of time.

395
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:31,306
A guy gave me this yesterday.

396
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,395
You told me about that world.

397
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:41,316
You said we fought there, survived,
and returned to this world.

398
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,404
That guy said something similar.

399
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:52,619
They might take my wife and child away
to that world.

400
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,291
I know it sounds crazy.

401
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:04,256
But I'd do anything
if there was a way to bring my wife back.

402
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,258
Tell me.

403
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:15,809
Two minutes.

404
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:17,811
What?

405
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,858
Once someone goes into cardiac arrest,

406
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:28,280
they'll die if their heart doesn't
resume beating within two minutes.

407
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:33,160
In the two minutes between cardiac arrest
and irreversible death,

408
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,956
I believe people enter
a shared consciousness.

409
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:42,085
That's the world we experienced.

410
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:46,757
If you go there
and bring her back within two minutes…

411
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,552
she might survive.

412
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,473
"Within two minutes"?

413
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,352
When we were there,

414
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,812
it felt like a long time.

415
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:08,153
But our hearts only stopped
for one minute.

416
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,198
Time flows differently

417
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:16,078
between the real world
and the shared consciousness.

418
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,455
Two minutes.

419
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:23,669
That moment in time
may feel like an eternity.

420
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,508
Is that really possible?

421
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,719
Isn't that why you're here?

422
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,892
But I haven't tried it yet.

423
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:43,397
There's no guarantee
you'll make it back alive.

424
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,190
And if I don't make it back?

425
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,027
You'll die, of course.

426
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:54,491
And I'll be charged with
assisted suicide or murder.

427
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,046
Yes?

428
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,591
I see.

429
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,433
Her heart stopped?

430
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,483
I don't care if I die.

431
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,779
If there's a chance I can save Usagi,

432
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:34,906
I'll take it.

433
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,759
INSULINACT

434
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,220
That drug…

435
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,473
It will stop your heart

436
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,308
on purpose.

437
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,517
Stop my heart?

438
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,478
No time to think.

439
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,479
Well?

440
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,113
Two minutes.

441
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,074
Right.

442
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,924
Feel anything?

443
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,258
Nothing.

444
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,347
We're running out of time!

445
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,855
The clock…

446
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,536
Ann?

447
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,542
Ann?

448
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,947
PROCEED 15 KM SOUTH-SOUTHEAST
THE "GAME" STARTS AT SUNDOWN

449
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,007
Usagi?

450
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:30,225
THE "GAME" ARENA IS 6 KM AHEAD

451
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,581
"GAME" ARENA AHEAD

452
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,557
FRIED NOODLES

453
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,101
COTTON CANDY

454
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:51,741
Player quota reached.
Registration is now closed.

455
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,955
A new team has been formed
at Hikawa Shrine.

456
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,426
The game will now commence.

457
