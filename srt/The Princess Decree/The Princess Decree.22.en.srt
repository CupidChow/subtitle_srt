Your Majesty.

59
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,160
You once said

60
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,959
you would not be Emperor Wu,

61
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,680
but one like Emperor Wen and Jing.

62

63

is worth less than peace for the people.

Do you remember?

65
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,079
Remember.

66
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,399

69
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,360
Rest now.

71
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,439
things may be better.

Pingning,

73
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,959
you will come tomorrow, will you not?

74
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,079
I will.

00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,079

Xing.

77
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,600
Are the preparations ready?

78
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,680
Your Highness,

79
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,639
please think again.

80
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,240
Once the rites are complete,

81
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,000
Gan Sheng will become
imperial son-in-law.

82
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,360
With the title Prince Wu'an,

83
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,560
his power will be unshakable.

84
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,439
War spreads,

85
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,759
the court is unstable.

86
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,319
His Majesty is still young.

87
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,519
To remove him then

88
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,240
will be nearly impossible.

89
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,000
But...

90
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,639
There is still Official Lin.

91
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,439
And Official Zhang.

92
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:16,759
Your Highness.

93
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
If we could rethink our plan...

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,090
The Grand Secretary is gone.

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,720
Your Highness.

96
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,120
Your Highness.

97
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,839
Xing!

98
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,279
At this moment,

99
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,959
there is only one path left.

100
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,439
If we fall, we fall together.

101
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,399
Your Highness.

102
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,720
We must remove General Gan
before the wedding

103
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,319
or we lose our last chance.

104
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,639
Xing.

105
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
My mind is settled.

106
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,360
Do not try to stop me.

107
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,480
Your Highness, wait.

108
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,680
Must I seek your approval

109
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,960
to see my future husband?

110
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,159
Move aside.

111
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,360
General Fuyao.

112
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,130
A pleasure to meet you.

113
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,279
Why is it you?

114
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,279
You truly care for your daughter.

115
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,440
The moment you heard

116
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,840
there was a cure for her legs,

117
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,879
even an anonymous letter

118
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,039
was enough to draw you here.

119
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,759
Scholars are sly indeed.

120
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,039
How dare you deceive me!

121
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,000
General, I deceived no one.

122
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,559
Your daughter was poisoned,

123
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,879
which is why her legs were crippled

124
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,900
and she can no longer walk properly.

125
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,440
What nonsense.

126
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,320
Her injury was an accident.

127
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,120
An accident?

128
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,240
Or could it be that someone
planned all of this,

129
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,360
hoping to bind your loyalty

130
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,639
with a debt of gratitude?

131
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,639
Your loyalty is sincere, General Fuyao.

132
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,360
But you treated your enemy as a savior

133
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,000
and ruined your daughter's life.

134
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,320
How dare you slander the Prince of Wu'an.

135
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,200
You must be courting death.

136
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,519
Kill me if you wish

137
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,679
and throw away her last chance.

138
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,720
The evidence is here.

139
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,039
Right and wrong

140
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,480
will speak for themselves.

141
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,399
Fortunately,

142
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,480
a poison always has its cure.

143
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,000
This prescription

144
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,039
will help her recover.
