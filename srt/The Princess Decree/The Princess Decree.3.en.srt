24
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,560
General Gan,

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,560
I have something you want.

26
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,280
Beijiang's defense map.

27
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,280
In exchange, take me back to the capital.

28
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,479
I wonder

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,759
what you plan to do

30
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,680
once you return?

31
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,280
Liu Zhen framed me.

32
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,319
The royal family abandoned me.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,599
I will throw them into chaos

34
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,000
and make them repay

35
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,960
whatever they owe me.

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,759
Good.

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,759
Very good.

38
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,800
I'll take you back to the capital.

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,680
The hundred thousand cavalry behind me
will be your backing.

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,560
But I have one more condition.

41
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,800
I want you

42
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,360
to marry me.

43
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,039
I need your status as the Princess Royal

44
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,960
to weaken the ministers' power,

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,479
so I can rightfully claim Jing as mine.

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,599
Of course I remember.

47
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,000
But don't forget what we agreed on.

48
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,240
Only after you wipe out
Liu Zhen and his faction

49
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,759
and bring all the armies
under our control

50
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,199
will we marry.

51
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,350
Your Highness,

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,400
you asked me to find Mr. Qingya.

53
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,960
There's no news yet.

54
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,720
It's all thanks to him

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,360
that I could come back alive.

56
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,519
You must find him.

57
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,430
Yes, Your Highness.

How was it?

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,839
Your Highness, I didn't mean
to defy your order.

62
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,959
But I truly

63
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,759
can't write a word.

64
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,319
Why?

65
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,800
You could write five years ago,
and you can't now?

66
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,020
Official Li, have you forgotten

67
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,079
how you held my hand

68
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,519
and taught me to write

69
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,199
five years ago?

70
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,240
'Nian'.

71
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,720
It means faith.

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,360
"Present"

73
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,759
and "heart"

74
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,850
formed the character for "faith".

you could write so well without me.

89
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,590
"Present" and "heart"
together form the character "faith"?

90

But the heart I have now
is no longer the one I had before.

All of this

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,519
is thanks to you, Official Li.

93
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,519
You taught me a hard lesson.

94
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,759
Heaven and earth can be measured,

95
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,890
but you can't get the measure
of the human heart.

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,519
With these very hands,

101
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,560
you wrote the memorial that sent me away
for the marriage alliance.

102
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,480
Li Yuanze,

103
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,959
tell me.

104
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,439
On the day I was sent off,

105
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,319
why didn't you come?

106
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,120
Stop right there.

107
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,480
Yuanze,

108
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
where are you going?

109
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,279
I'm going to see His Majesty.

110
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,199
I'll tell him the memorial
wasn't written by me.

111
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,040
It shouldn't count.

112
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,360
You can't go.

113
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,759
Why not?

114
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,879
Sir,

115
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,600
you submitted that memorial

116
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,079
in my name,

117
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,839
and drugged my food

118
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,240
so I slept through the day,

119
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,639
causing me to miss my last chance.

120
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,519
Because of all this,

121
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,840
a marriage alliance
can bring a truce to Beijiang.

122
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,000
This is the Emperor's choice.

123
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,360
He needs a proper reason.

124
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,990
In the entire imperial court,

125
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,759
you're the only one
who knows her,

126
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,080
and you have a clean reputation.

127
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,360
What you think doesn't matter.

128
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,120
What matters is that His Majesty
needs that memorial.

129
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,399
And more importantly,

130
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,320
Jing needs time to catch its breath.

131
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,039
Then let my life be the exchange!

132
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,240
I'd rather be executed

133
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,440
than let her make the sacrifice alone.

134
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,080
It's too late.

135
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,639
You, me, and the Princess Royal

136
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,519
are nothing but His Majesty's pawns.

137
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
Since we are pawns,

138
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,279
how could we ever decide our own fate?

139
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,720
I...

140
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,759
Since you refuse to tell,

141
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,399
