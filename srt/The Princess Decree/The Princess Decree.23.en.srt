Your Highness,
what brings you to the palace?

22
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,599
Take me to His Majesty.

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,680
At a time like this,

24
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,359
you still wish
to seek His Majesty's help

25
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,159
to escape this marriage?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,159
Unless you marry me tomorrow obediently,

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,640
otherwise,

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,400
you will never see
His Majesty again in this lifetime.

29
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,959
You...

30
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,599
Zhou Cheng.

31
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,780
Escort Her Highness
back to her chambers.

32
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,519
Your Highness, please.

33
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,660
=The Princess Decree=

34
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,660
=Episode 23=

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,120
What is it?

36
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,700
Am I not welcome here, Your Highness?

37
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,360
It is not yet the auspicious hour.

38
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,120
Why rush to meet?

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,039
I care little for those rules.

40
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,120
Your Highness.

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
I know you value affection.

42
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,560
But...

43
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,120
Even if you grieve

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,960
for Li Yuanze who is gone,

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,039
it should end here.

46
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,919
After all,

47
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,759
you are now a married woman.

48
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,120
And in your heart,

49
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,319
there should be room
for only your husband.

50
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,240
Do you not agree?

51
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,080
I understand.

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
I told you once.

53
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,000
As long as you behave as you should,

54
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,599
everything

55
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,319
will be yours to have.

56
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,340
(Li Residence)

57
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,240
Yuanze.

58
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,599
It is time.

59
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,400
Song.

60
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,599
You remain outside the palace.

61
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,479
If anything happens to me...

62
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,159
Yuanze.

63
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,560
I must go with you.

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
This path is perilous.

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,039
Besides,

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,159
Her Highness and His Majesty
are both trapped inside.

67
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,800
Even if it means walking through fire,

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,840
I have to break through myself.

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Gan Sheng.

70
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,279
Your time has come.

71
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,000
(Taiji Hall)

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Gan Sheng.

73
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,160
You crippled my daughter's legs

74
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,879
and still pretended to be righteous,

75
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,079
tricking me into serving you.

76
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,120
You are shameless beyond measure.

77
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,319
Today

78
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,560
will be the day you die.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Qian Yong.

80
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,319
You think taking down the palace guards

81
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,920
means victory is already yours?

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,399
Generals, to arms.

83
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,839
Qian Yong.

84
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,319
Surrender while you still can.

85
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,040
The one who should surrender

86
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,399
is clearly you.

87
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,000
Very well.

88
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,480
Grand Secretary.

89
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,160
Why are you all standing there?

90
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,040
Take him down as well.

91
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,240
Grand Secretary.

92
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
His Majesty has been rescued.

93
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,439
You call yourselves generals,

94
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,879
yet now you serve
a civil official like dogs.

95
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,000
I trusted you deeply.

96
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,839
Is this how you repay me?

97
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,319
They followed you into battle,

98
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,319
risking their lives.

99
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,480
But you?

100
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,639
You stole military funds
and sold grain illegally.

101
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,000
You conspired with foreign forces.

102
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,439
Did you think of them then?

103
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,720
So many

104
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,199
good soldiers of Jing

105
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,040
did not fall on the battlefield

106
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,839
but at the hands of their own comrades.

107
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,519
Such unforgivable sins,

108
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,920
can you bear them?

109
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,800
They did not betray you.

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,360
It was you who betrayed them.

111
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:59,639
- Kill.
- Kill.

112
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,720
Gan Sheng.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You have lost.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,680
Your Highness.

115
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,639
Your Highness.

116
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,759
There is chaos in the palace.

117
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
Grand Secretary.

118
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,000
How is the Grand Secretary?

119
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,680
He is unharmed.

120
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,720
He told me to take
Your Highness away at once.

121
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,199
Very well.

122
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,519
Gan Sheng.

123
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,079
Your end has come.

124
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,839
Withdraw now

125
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,600
and I may grant you a whole body.

126
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,000
Grand Secretary.

127
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,639
Do not speak too soon.

128
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,240
Look.

129
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,560
Do you recognize her?

130
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,680
Your Highness.

131
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,680
Prince Wu'an.

132
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,759
All you commanded

133
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,079
has been done.

134
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,040
Your Highness.

135
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,399
Forgive me.

136
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,079
I had no other choice.

137
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,040
Please tell me,

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,519
where is my foster son?

139
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,480
Do not worry.

140
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,439
I shall reunite you
father and son right now.

141
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,920
Li Yuanze.

142
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,100
Stand your troops down.

143
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,120
Or I kill her.

144
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,800
You dare?

145
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,160
Try me if you wish.

146
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:31,879
Li Yuanze.

147
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,720
Archers.

148
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,279
Do not mind me.

149
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,080
Grand Secretary.

150
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,919
Will you abandon her again

151
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,320
for the sake of power?

152
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Five years ago,

153
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,600
you already failed her once.

154
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
And now you will watch her die

155
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,559
by my sword?

156
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,039
Truly, Princess Royal

157
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,960
deserves better.

158
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,840
Li Yuanze.

159
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,159
You think your plans flawless,

160
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,200
victory assured,

161
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,399
yet in the end

162
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,440
you still fall into my hands.

163
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,799
Li Yuanze.

164
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,840
I always liked the ending
of Qingya and White Deer.

165
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,639
If not for you back then,

166
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,240
I would have died far from home.

167
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,480
Your Highness.

168
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,919
This time,

169
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,639
let me return the favor.

170
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,240
