=Episode 20=

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,560
Your Highness.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,990
What if the Grand Secretary
misunderstands you?

25
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,519
No.

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,680
He would never doubt me.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,090
How could she act like this?

28
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,319
I am furious.

29
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,599
The Princess Royal is far too bold.

30
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,890
It goes against all moral codes.

31
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,680
The late emperor is barely in his grave,

32
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,319
yet she keeps company
with that disgrace.

33
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,080
Etiquette is no longer the main concern.

34
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,599
Gan Sheng's ambition is clear.

35
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,719
He accepts
the title of Prince Wu'an today,

36
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,560
and tomorrow he may covet the throne.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,240
Indeed.

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,970
In my opinion,
marriage is only his excuse.

39
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,159
Rebellion is what he truly seeks.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,599
If he joins hands
with the Princess Royal,

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,879
the empire of Jing

42
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,000
may fall in a single night.

43
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,400
I will seek an audience immediately.

44
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,319
Even if it costs me my life,

45
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,560
I must stop this from happening.

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,319
Official Lin, I will go as well.
And so will I.

47
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:37,879
Everyone.

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,639
Her Highness must have

49
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,719
had no other choice.

50
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,840
If we rush in now,
we will only drive Gan Sheng into fury,

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,479
and the consequences
will be beyond control.

52
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,439
Yuanze,

53
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,520
you are far too trusting.

54
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,960
Xiao Pingning is cruel at heart.
She would stop at nothing.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,879
You and I have seen it clearly.

56
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,479
How could we trust her so easily?

57
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,840
I know well.

58
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,400
You and the Princess Royal share a past.

59
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,280
Back then,

60
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,120
you even blamed your master for it.

61
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,439
But matters of state

62
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,879
concern the fate of the realm.

63
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,759
Personal feelings
must never cloud judgment.

64
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,759
Everyone condemns
Her Highness as vicious.

65
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,800
But think carefully.

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,000
Since she returned
to assist in governance,

67
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,879
have any loyal officials

68
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,919
been wrongly punished under her rule?

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,120
Think again.

70
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,500
These past few days,

71
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,599
she has moved freely within the palace,

72
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,680
even pressured His Majesty.

73
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,680
Yet has His Majesty's learning

74
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,479
not grown rather than diminished?

75
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,159
But she does
bear a grudge against us scholars.

76
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,000
She may...

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,520
She may resent officials,
but she has never harmed the people.

78
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,680
If she wished to spill innocent blood,

79
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
five years ago,

80
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,000
she could have driven Beijiang

81
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,120
to massacre the borders.

82
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,560
Yet she did not.

83
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,639
That may be true,

84
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,360
but who can guarantee it now?

85
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,840
I can.

86
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,719
I will bear witness.

87
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,000
This is…

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,639
In this time of peril, I pledge
in the name of the Grand Secretary

89
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,199
that all of you may trust me

90
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,639
will safeguard

91
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,879
peace in Jing.

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,279
I will follow
the Grand Secretary's lead.

93
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,879
- We will follow the Grand Secretary's lead.
- We will follow the Grand Secretary's lead.

94
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
Yuanze.

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,160
How is it?

96
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,199
Gan Sheng has stationed heavy guards
around the Princess' Residence.

97
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,319
No message can get through.

98
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,439
Song.

99
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,600
(Empress Dowager)
Give this letter to the Empress Dowager.

100
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,590
Ask Her Majesty to take Her Highness out
under the pretext of worshiping Buddha.

101
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,639
Meet at Lotus Pavilion.

102
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,260
(Lotus Pavilion)

103
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,040
Are you hurt, Your Highness?

104
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,040
I thought

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,600
you were here to question me

106
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,439
for breaking my word.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,279
I understand your hardships.

108
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,639
How could I blame you?

109
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,600
Besides,

110
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,439
have you forgotten?

111
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,800
We are allies now.

112
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,480
This token was given to me
by Your Highness' own hand.

113
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,399
There is no taking it back.

114
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,600
You...

115
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,399
You went through great trouble

116
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,439
to see me.

117
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,160
Surely not for small talk.

118
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,959
How could your safety
ever be small talk?

119
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,879
But I do

120
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,199
have news to report.

121
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,400
I must ask Your Highness

122
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,279
to cancel the marriage with Gan Sheng.

123
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,639
Why?

124
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,400
My teacher's manuscript
has been mostly deciphered.

125
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,480
In a few more days,

126
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,720
everything will be clear.

127
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,879
It records

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,759
every crime Gan Sheng has committed.

129
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,300
He has embezzled funds,

130
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,520
colluded with foreign forces,
and stole military merit.

131
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Once it is revealed,

132
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,480
his influence in the army will crumble.

133
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,240
And then, we will finally
be able to remove him.

134
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,920
It is a sound plan.

135
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,680
But it will take time.

136
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,759
If that is the case,

137
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,439
I should marry Gan Sheng instead

138
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,040
and buy us some time.

139
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,360
Your Highness...

140
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
You know it too.

141
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,959
It is indeed the best option.

142
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,040
Right?

143
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,519
I cannot bear

144
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,519
to watch you risk yourself again.

145
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,000
You make it sound

146
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,519
as if I am marching to my death.

147
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,160
Your Highness...

148
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,279
Do not worry.

149
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,759
I am not as noble as you imagine.

150
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,639
Besides,

151
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,160
I still have you.

152
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,360
I trust myself,

153
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,559
and I trust you.

154
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,919
I

155
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,279
will not fail you, Your Highness.

156
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,600
Grand Secretary,

157
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,759
what is our next move?

158
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,799
The board is set.

159
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,759
But one final piece

160
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,039
has yet to fall in place.

161
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:14,960
Hyah.

162
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,200
Hyah.

163
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,700
(Prince Wu'an's Residence)

164
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,711
(Qian Yong, Deputy General under Gan Sheng)
I, General Fuyao, Qian Yong,

165
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:26,679
(Qian Yong, Deputy General under Gan Sheng)
request an audience with Prince Wu'an.

166
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,100
(Record of General Fuyao)

167
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,240
Yuanze.

168
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,039
Who exactly is this Qian Yong?

169
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,320
Why does he concern you so?

170
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,799
Gan Sheng has many capable officers.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,080
But only this one

172
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,679
is truly trusted by him.

173
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,720
Look here.

174
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,200
The victory at Moquan Pass,
the Battle of Blackwater River,

175
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,840
the ambush at Broken Blade Ravine, these

176
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,039
are all his achievements.

177
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,399
He is a fierce warrior indeed.

178
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,879
Qian Yong was born to a humble family.

179
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,159
He cares for the army.

180
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,840
He is honest and never seeks credit.

181
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,200
So he holds great respect in the army.

182
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:08,159
Then why has his name

183
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,720
never reached the court?

184
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,120
Gan Sheng keeps him suppressed,

185
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,799
not allowing him to stand out.

186
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,320
He fears being overshadowed.

187
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,399
And Qian Yong endures it?

188
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,639
His loyalty to Gan Sheng is unwavering.

189
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,440
Do you know why?

190
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,240
He has a daughter.

191
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,480
Her name is Qian Yu.

192
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:38,799
I, Qian Yong,

193
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:39,879
greet Prince Wu'an.

194
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,720
Prince Wu'an?

195
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,559
Empty titles mean nothing.

196
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,480
Call me General.

197
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,200
General.

198
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:50,679
General.

199
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,960
Yu brewed this herself.

200
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,039
Before I left,

201
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,360
she reminded me again and again

202
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,879
to give it to you in person.

203
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,300
All this time in the capital,

204
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,639
I thought only of this drink.

205
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Please thank her for me.

206
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:06,840
I cannot.

207
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,639
You saved my whole family.

208
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,720
Without you,

209
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,919
Yu's life would have been ruined.

210
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,879
I...

211
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,559
I can never repay you.

212
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,080
Enough.

213
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,840
We are brothers.

214
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,320
No need for formalities.

215
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,120
With you here,

216
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,679
the war in Nanjiang

217
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,879
troubles me far less.

218
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,360
General.

219
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,600
I am here.

220
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,000
No enemy shall cross

221
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,960
into Jing.

222
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,000
General.

223
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:43,960
Let's drink.
