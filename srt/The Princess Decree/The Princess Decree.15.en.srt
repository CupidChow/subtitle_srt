This matter is not yet settled.

55
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,680
I naturally had to return.

56
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:24,560
I have come today to ask for
Your Highness's forgiveness.

57
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,920
You…

58
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,160
Yuanze.

59
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,920
Song.

60
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,079
The matter I entrusted you with earlier,
is it done?

61
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,879
Rest assured.

62
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,920
After Gan Sheng left,

63
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,399
the spy from the Princess Residence

64
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,759
was thrown into the mass grave.

65
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,420
I have already collected
the body properly, just as you instructed.

66
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,920
Did Gan Sheng's men see it?

67
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,079
At this moment, they must believe the spy
was one of ours.

68
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,399
Good.

69
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,040
Yuanze,

70
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,720
why do this?

71
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,839
We could have used this chance

72
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,790
to sow discord between
Gan Sheng and Xiao Pingning

73
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,560
and let them fight each other.

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,079
Song,

75
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,480
be patient.

76
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,560
I will

77
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,319
tell you everything later.

78
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:13,959
Yuanze.

79
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,839
No matter what happens, I trust you.

80
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,759
Rest early.

81
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,959
There is still one urgent matter.

82
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:33,879
Yesterday,

83
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,519
I was blinded by villains
and believed their slander.

84
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,680
I misunderstood Your Highness.

85
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,240
The spy in my residence

86
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,040
was planted by Li Yuanze
to drive a wedge between us.

87
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,480
General, such courtesy

88
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,360
is more than I can accept.

89
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,439
Your Highness.

90
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,319
I was indeed too extreme in my actions.

91
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,600
If Your Highness still holds anger,

92
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,160
then perhaps

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,970
you may strike me back.

94
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,240
I do not wish to dirty my hands.

95
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,439
Step aside.

96
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,759
Pingning.

97
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,839
I was only afraid of losing you.

98
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,399
I wanted to prove

99
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,800
that I could protect you.

100
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
Yesterday,

101
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,680
my behavior was truly offensive.

102
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,360
But the wish to marry you sooner

103
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,120
was not a moment of impulse.

104
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,720
From this day on,

105
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,120
your honor will be mine as well,

106
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,920
and your loss will be mine.

107
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,399
General,

108
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,920
since you know you misunderstood me,

109
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,319
why be so anxious?

110
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,759
Have you forgotten

111
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,680
our agreement?

112
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,000
Only when we
become husband and wife soon,

113
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,040
and no longer doubt each other,

114
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,160
can I fulfill Your Highness's wish
as early as possible.

115
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,519
Is that not so?

116
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,079
This matter is of great importance.

117
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,639
It cannot be decided in haste.

118
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,319
Could it be

119
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,000
Your Highness is unwilling?

120
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,639
I…

121
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,519
This may not be appropriate.

122
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,900
The late Emperor's mourning
is not yet over.

123
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,879
Your Highness,

124
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,199
are you truly so eager to be wed?

125
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,879
Insolence.

126
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,879
My affairs

127
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,519
are not for you to meddle in.

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,680
Li Yuanze.

129
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,800
Remember your place.

130
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,580
If Your Highness refuses to see me,

131
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,440
I feel the same.

132
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,879
If not for the command
of the Empress Dowager,

133
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,360
in this lifetime,

134
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,360
I would never set foot here again.

135
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,799
The Empress Dowager issues a decree.

136
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,590
The Princess Royal
is summoned to the palace

137
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,240
to organize the memorial ceremony
for the Imperial Consort.

138
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,519
Your Highness,

139
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,799
receive the decree.

140
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,240
Official Li,

141
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,559
thank you.

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,879
You visit
the Princess Residence often enough.

143
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,639
I will not see you out.

144
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,279
Digging up graves at the mass pit

145
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,759
must have been unpleasant.

146
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,320
You...

147
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,440
Li Yuanze,

148
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,279
there will be plenty more

149
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,320
days like this for you.

150
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,600
General.

151
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,600
Something is wrong.

152
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,970
There is trouble at the encampment.

153
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,759
What happened?

154
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,960
General,

155
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,759
after you used Mr. Qingya's method

156
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,039
to win over the great clans,

157
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,200
the reform

158
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,360
indeed went smoothly,

159
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,039
and our military funding increased,

160
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,320
but...

161
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,200
Get to the point.

162
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,279
But because the military funds
increased so much,

163
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,320
the divisions began fighting over it.

164
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,600
Everyone thought
their share was too small,

165
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,600
and conflicts broke out.

166
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,039
Nonsense.

167
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,850
How could these funds
be distributed straight to the...

168
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,919
It was the Ministry of Revenue.

169
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,159
Yes.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,679
The civil officials
pretended not to know,

171
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
claiming it was an honest mistake.

172
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,559
But they clearly did it on purpose.

173
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,240
They want to use this money

174
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,679
to stir up discord among the generals.

175
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,679
General,

176
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,639
what should we do now?

177
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,399
These wretched old schemers.

178
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,480
I will not let them have their way.

179
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,650
Prepare to leave the city.

180
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,990
I will handle the matter
at the encampment myself.

181
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,919
Yes.

182
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,940
(Lotus Pavilion)

183
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,600
The Imperial Consort was known
for her kindness and virtue,

184
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,039
her grace long remembered.

185
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,860
(Memorial Tablet
of Imperial Consort Gao)

186
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,879
Pay respects.

187
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,279
As we stand
before her today in remembrance,

188
