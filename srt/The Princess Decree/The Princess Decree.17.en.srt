Careful.

The weather is pleasant today,

yet it feels

27
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,080
Someday let us choose
a snowy night beneath the moon,

28
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,520
and watch the sky full of stars.

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,800

Thank you, sir.

37
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,639
Now I finally understand

38
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,240
what the scholar was thinking.

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,879
Yet,

40
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,280
the story of the scholar
and the Princess

41
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,439
seems unable to continue.

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,560
The scholar and the Princess

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,000
can only part ways here.

44
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,719
Why?

45
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,879
Love was real.

46
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,439
Resentment was real.

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,639
The hurt was real.

48
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,039
So was the regret.

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,970
After so many years of entanglement,

50
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,480
causes and consequences

51
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,360
are no longer clear.

52
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,160
Since that is so,

53
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,720
letting go might be better.

54
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
As you once said, sir,

55
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,959
not every story

56
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,720
needs an ending.

a sky full of stars

62
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,319
is not as beautiful as I once thought.

63
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,600
Someday let us choose
a snowy night beneath the moon,

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,120

00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,879
Let us treat each other as strangers.

74
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,920
And walk our separate ways.

75
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,800

Get up quickly.

138
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,399
You still make things hard for yourself.

139
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,720

140
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,000

149
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,159
