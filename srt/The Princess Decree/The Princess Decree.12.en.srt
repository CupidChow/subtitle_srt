23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,780
(The Palace
Imperial Study)

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,079
I, Gan Sheng, request an audience
with Your Majesty.

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,090
There is an urgent matter
that requires discussion.

26
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,040
His Majesty is unwell
and has already retired.

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,000
General Gan, please return another day.

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,799
If His Majesty is ill,

29
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,959
then I should all the more pay a visit.

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,160
His Majesty has barely fallen sick,

31
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,800
yet you rush into the palace so hastily

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,800
that I cannot even keep up appearances.

33
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,159
If I allow you inside,

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,080
the civil officials
will use it against us.

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,319
Whatever the matter is,
can you not discuss it with me first?

36
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,080
I came today to ask something.

37
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,039
The tribute from Nanjiang
has already arrived.

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,000
How does His Majesty find it?

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,400
What does the general think?

40
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,360
In my opinion,

41
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,199
the tribute is fine enough,

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,199
but

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,319
the treasures of Nanjiang

44
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,560
are far more than these items.

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,439
Exotic beasts
and rare curios are only trifles.

46
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,479
Nanjiang's greatest treasure

47
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,919
is its vast fertile land.

48
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,080
Your Highness,

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,039
what is your view?

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,639
That depends on your abilities, General.

51
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,800
If you can present such land to me,

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,900
then it would naturally be most welcome.

53
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,439
Your Highness,

54
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,000
I understand that you harbor resentment.

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,560
But what General Gan said earlier

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,100
was clearly a call to attack Nanjiang.

57
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,639
Once war begins,

58
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,199
there is no turning back.

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,919
For Your Highness,

60
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,479
what benefit does that bring?

61
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,719
Understand?

62
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,890
Li Yuanze, you think
you deserve to say that?

63
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,319
I want everyone to taste

64
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,159
the suffering I endured five years ago.

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,639
Besides,

66
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,120
if I can make Official Li uncomfortable,

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,520
why would I not do it?

68
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,599
(This scent...)

69
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,439
Official Li,

70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
what is wrong?

71
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,800
Your Highness,

72
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,839
I am fine.

73
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,839
Since His Majesty has already retired,

74
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,199
I will take my leave for now.

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,439
Pingning,

76
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,439
why did you speak to him
like that just now?

77
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,360
You clearly did not mean it,

78
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,290
yet you insisted on
hurting him with your words.

79
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,439
Matters of adults

80
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,040
are not for children to meddle in.

81
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,439
Pingning,

82
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,240
I am not a child anymore.

83
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,319
If that is the case,

84
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
let me ask you.

85
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,160
Did you hear the deeper meaning
behind Gan Sheng's words?

86
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,319
That is simple.

87
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,279
Gan Sheng is ambitious and ruthless.

88
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,079
He wants to invade Nanjiang
and expand our borders.

89
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,480
Once the two nations go to war,

90
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,879
military spending will rise.

91
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
His prestige

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,480
will naturally rise with it.

93
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,319
By that time,

94
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,279
he will reap all the benefits.

95
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,199
Gan Sheng is selfish and greedy.

96
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,920
But there is one thing
he was not wrong about.

97
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,759
What is it?

98
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,790
A thousand miles of fertile land
and endless rivers and mountains.

99
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,199
Treasures like these

100
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,480
would Your Majesty truly feel nothing?

101
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,519
How can a ruler be without ambition?

102
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,240
But I have no wish
to be another Emperor Wu of Han.

103
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,190
I only wish to follow the ways
of Emperors Wen and Jing.

104
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,360
Why?

105
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,000
If war breaks out,

106
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,560
(Jing)
may indeed expand its borders.

107
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,000
A great legacy may be achieved.

108
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,000
But

109
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,680
the people will suffer for it.

110
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,879
It brings them no benefit.

111
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,759
A ruler's legacy

112
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,639
lies not only in distant glories
but also in what is near.

113
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,399
A brilliant line in the history books

114
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,480
cannot compare
to households filled with light.

115
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,860
(Princess Royal Yong'an's Residence)

116
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,920
If I can make Official Li uncomfortable,

117
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,160
why would I not do so?

118
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,370
This is a secret coagulation balm
from the Princess Royal's Residence.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
It uses sappanwood as medicine
and carries a unique scent.

120
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,759
Within the capital,

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,560
no one else knows the formula.

122
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,800
I used it only once,
on Mr. Qingya that day.

123
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,000
Why would he have any on him?

124
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,060
(Qingya and White Deer)

125
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,439
(If you truly are him...)

126
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,480
General, a young servant in the residence
has been acting suspiciously.

127
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,600
He left without permission.

128
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,090
Should we bring him
back for questioning?

129
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,800
No need.

130
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,399
Let him go.

131
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,879
Let us see

132
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,120
which household this burrowing rat

133
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,560
belongs to.

134
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:28,879
Yes.

135
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,039
(Could it be)

136
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,360
(that she was testing my wound?)

137
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,879
Sir, you seem rather unsettled today.

138
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,279
You see clearly, Master.

139
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,000
The Princess may already be suspicious.

140
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,840
If one day

141
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,240
she discovers
the identity of Mr. Qingya,

142
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,759
I hope you will lend your aid.

143
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,360
I have long said

144
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,200
that I am willing
to be of service to you.

145
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,480
Sir,

146
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,320
do you recognize this?

147
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,679
This is...

148
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
Open it and see.

149
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,519
Windvine?

150
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,240
It grows in the Eastern Sea.

151
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,879
When my mentor was still alive,

152
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,320
every so often

153
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,330
he would ask traveling merchants
to search for it.

154
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,840
Zhao had asthma since childhood

155
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,519
and needed Windvine for her medicine,

156
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,960
keeping it with her at all times.

157
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,639
But now

158
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,639
she has no use for it anymore.

159
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,559
Some days ago,

160
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,519
Lotus Pavilion

161
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,960
received a large donation.

162
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,080
The only condition was that I

163
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,559
find this

164
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,679
Windvine.

165
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,440
Who was it?

166
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,639
The Princess Royal,

167
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
Xiao Pingning.

168
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,000
