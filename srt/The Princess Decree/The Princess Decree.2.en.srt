did he not plead to His Majesty,

49
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,590
but he even wrote a recommendation
for a marriage alliance instead.

104
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,639
your handwriting is unacceptable.

105
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,600

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,199
Why does this name

115
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,680
sound so familiar?

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,000
Your Highness,

117
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,090
he is this year's imperial scholar.

118
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,920
His Majesty appointed him
to be your teacher yesterday.

119
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,439
He will teach you how to write.

120
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,959

121
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,240
Come.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,039

124
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,480

Yuanze,

126
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,120
you stopped me

127
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,320
at the imperial hall.

128
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,220
Was it for some kind of purpose?

129
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,080
Song,

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,320
a person's grudge alone
is not enough to achieve something.

131
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,120
I wanted to incite
every literary official's rage

132
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,120
but something unexpected happened.

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,990
However, I've still
gained something out of this.

134
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,090
I need to stay in
the Princess Royal Residence for now

135
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,480
because...

136
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,519
All of them are your weaknesses.

137
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,519

139

00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,679
We'll plan for it

143
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,320
when I get the booklet

144
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,830
by staying
at Princess Royal's Residence.

145
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,600
General Gan,
you've been watching the show

146
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
behind the curtain for a whole day.

147
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,080
Are you satisfied?

148
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,020
(Gan Sheng, General of Jing
Leader of Generals)

149
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,679
Your Highness first killed Liu Zhen

150
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,720
before doing that in public

151
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,639
to humiliate all the literary officials.

152
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,600
It is really interesting.

153
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,279
However,

154
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,360
I still have something
that I don't understand.

155
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,279
If Your Highness

156
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,559
hates Li Yuanze so much,

157
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,159
why not kill him

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,759
to get rid of your hatred?

159
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,840
Brutes like you

160
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,360
are really boring.

161
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,840
Your Highness,

162
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
why do you say that?

163
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,840
A game

164
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,440
is only interesting
when it takes time to play.

165
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,440
Letting him die so easily

166
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,559
would be letting him off easily.

167
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,159
Is Your Highness not afraid

168
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,600
of future troubles?

169
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,320
With General Gan here,

170
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,000
I have nothing to be afraid of.

171
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,080
I was foolish.

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,720
I can

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,200
only apologize by offering you
this litchi from Lingnan.

What?

175
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,279
Are you going to make me peel it myself?

176
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,600
This is what I should do
