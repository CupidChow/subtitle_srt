(Old Bookshop)

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,120
We shouldn't stay here long.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,239
Let's talk somewhere else.

26
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:38,879
Go.

27
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,680
Your Highness.

28
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
I heard news
inside Gan Sheng's residence.

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,439
They're setting a trap
to capture Mr. Qingya alive.

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,359
I see.

31
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,040
Thank you.

32
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,120
It's dangerous for you there.

33
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,560
Be careful.

34
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,840
You have shown me great kindness.

35
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,040
If I can serve you,

36
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,519
I'm willing to give my life.

37
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,560
Mr. Qingya.

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,290
The one who sent the letter
wasn't the bookseller, but Gan Sheng.

39
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,159
He set this trap

40
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,719
to ensnare you
and force you into his service.

41
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,719
That's why

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,800
I had to

43
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,680
intercept you on the route
he knew you'd take.

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Everyone knows

45
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,680
your relationship with General Gan

46
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,719
is far from ordinary.

47
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,960
If that's the case,

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,360
why ruin his plan

49
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,120
and help me?

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,520
If I hadn't used the bookseller as bait,

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,199
you wouldn't have
exposed your whereabouts

52
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,159
and gotten in danger.

53
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,759
It started because of me.

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,000
I should take responsibility.

55
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,520
If General Gan finds out about this,

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,240
will it implicate you?

57
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,240
You seem concerned
about my relationship with him.

58
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,000
What if

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,759
I do get implicated,

60
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,400
will you help me?

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
If you have a conflict with General Gan,

62
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,680
I'll help you.

63
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,240
Consider it repaying today's favor.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,639
But

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,919
I'd rather you stay alive

66
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,039
and live freely.

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,000
Why?

68
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,919
Because

69
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,080
you saved my life.

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,879
Five years in Beijiang,

71
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,879
surrounded by ice and frost.

72
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,599
It helped me survive.

73
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,719
Just because
my play script encouraged you.

74
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,400
How does that count as saving your life?

76
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,800
This is

77
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,000
Jing's Princess Royal.

78
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
Look at her.

79
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,479
That face

80
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,520
and that waist.

81
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you like her?

82
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,599
Come on, drink up.

83
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,000
Drink. Here.

84
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,400
Someone who doesn't care about living

85
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,080
won't fear you.

86
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,719
Even if I die,

87
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,879
I'll drag you down with me.

88
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Princess or not,

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,480
you're still our spoils of war.

100

Back then,

102
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,560
I had already accepted death.

103
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,480
I was only

104
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,079

the person standing before you now

107
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,759
would be a wandering soul.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,720
You killed my mentor

109
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,399
for revenge.

110
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,160
Did he not deserve to die?

111
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,800
I suffered so much in Beijiang
these past five years.

112
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,319
If not for hatred,
I wouldn't have survived until now.

113
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,480
Liu Zhen was tied to it all.

(Which one is the real you?)

116
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,560
So

117
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,759
how is that not saving my life?

118
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,160
Whatever it is...

119
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,439
Thank you

120
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,480
for helping me today.

121
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,399
I won't forget

122
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,800
this kindness.

123
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
You just said

124
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,120
you owe me a favor.

125
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,879
Don't forget it.

126
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,920
Thank you for the trouble.

(To General Gan)

128
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,000
Mr. Qingya.

129
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,120
Tonight's plan
was ruined by Princess Royal.

130
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,639
Looks like

131
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,560
you'll have to meet
General Gan tomorrow instead.

132
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,260
Since you've
already prepared a fallback,

133
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,000
why are you

134
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,439
still uneasy?

135
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,480
Planning is easy.

136
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,600
People's hearts are not.

137
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,519
When you were teaching
me to play chess today,

138
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,399
you said those in the game are blind,

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,639
only by stepping outside it

140
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,240
can one see the whole board.

141
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,040
Maybe the same applies

142
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,959
when judging a person.

143
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,720
Seeing Mr. Qingya

144
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,799
is truly difficult.

145
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,799
You suffered last night.

146
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,679
Please.

147
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,480
What's the meaning of this?

148
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,720
The place was surrounded
by elite soldiers last night.

149
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,320
An inescapable trap.

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,279
Tell me.

151
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,919
Did you take me for a guest

152
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,840
or a fugitive?

153
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,600
In other words,

154
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,000
you went there after all.

155
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,279
But seeing how you treated me,

156
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,159
I changed my mind.

157
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,639
My men acted on their own.

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,639
I only wanted to keep you safe.

159
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,679
I didn't expect

160
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,200
to make you misunderstand instead.

161
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,559
Are the men
you replaced in this courtyard

162
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
also here to "protect" me?

163
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,720
Indeed.

164
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,120
I value you the most.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,039
Your safety

166
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,679
naturally comes first.

167
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,360
I imagine you act the same way in court.

168
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,360
Even though this capital

169
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,039
is already in your control,

170
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,440
you're still troubled.

171
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,679
These civil officials

172
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,679
would rather die than yield.

173
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,759
You truly are a hidden talent.

174
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,990
Living in a humble room,
yet seeing the whole world.

175
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,840
Admirable.

176
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,960
Seeing you like this,

177
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,399
I already understand

178
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,159
why the army fund reform

179
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,200
still hasn't been implemented.

180
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,360
Please

181
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,320
enlighten me.

182
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,240
World affairs should be handled
with openness, not with obstruction.

183
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,799
The civil officials

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,720
are just a bunch of lousy scholars.

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,440
Even if they shout the loudest,

186
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,759
so what?

187
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,639
What truly matters

188
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,960
is prying at the noble clans.

189
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,519
If you want profit,

190
