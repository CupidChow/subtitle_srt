23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,439
General.

24
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,239
Our spy has news.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,000
Yesterday, the Princess Royal
visited the Lotus Pavilion

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,560
in the name of worship,

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,439
but met Li Yuanze there.

28
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,840
Her wedding is almost here,

29
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,200
yet she still cannot let him go.

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,560
Xiao Pingning.

31
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,959
Li Yuanze.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,480
You will both pay for this.

33
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,060
(Princess Royal Yong'an's Residence)

34
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,719
Your Highness.

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,479
A message from Prince Wu'an.

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
The wedding robe is prepared.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,479
He requests that you
enter the palace to try it on.

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,479
I am tired.

39
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,080
Have the robe delivered
to my residence instead.

40
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,360
Your Highness, please

41
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,520
do consider

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
coming to the palace.

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,479
And if I refuse?

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,919
Stand aside!

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,120
The Princess Royal truly has a temper.

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,319
You

47
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,599
will enter the palace today,

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,120
whether you want to or not.

49
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,120
Otherwise,

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,120
I will slaughter everyone
in your residence.

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,800
You...

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,199
Your Highness.

53
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,719
Please.

54
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,879
Where is the wedding robe?

55
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,360
Why rush?

56
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,759
Perhaps

57
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,120
it will be here soon enough.

58
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,199
I heard

59
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,279
you went to Lotus Pavilion yesterday.

60
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,360
I only accompanied my grandmother
to recite scriptures.

61
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,240
It seems

62
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,680
your brother's life

63
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,920
is not so important to you.

64
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,000
Let...

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Let go of me.

66
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,079
After all I have done for you,

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,439
you still deceive me time and again.

68
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,759
Answer me.

69
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,040
Do you still care for Li Yuanze?

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,959
I...

71
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,759
There is nothing

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,439
between him and me.

73
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,079
Good.

74
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,040
Then let us see

75
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,720
whether he comes for you tonight.

76
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,240
General.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,170
If you wish to put someone to the test,

78
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,839
you should plan more carefully.

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,959
With a trap this obvious,

80
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,360
who would walk into it?

81
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Perhaps

82
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,199
someone would walk
into Your Highness's trap

83
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
of his own accord.

84
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,079
But

85
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,480
my patience is limited.

86
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,680
If he still does not appear...

87
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,360
Release her!

88
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,839
Li Yuanze.

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,800
I should have killed you
when you urged me

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
to attack Beijiang.

91
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,120
The Princess doesn't even know.

92
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,199
Your beloved

93
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,279
went through quite some trouble

94
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,879
to rescue you from Beijiang.

95
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,720
First you used the name Mr. Qingya

96
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,120
to persuade me to wage war.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,160
Later, when the Second Prince
of Beijiang marched to war,

98
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,319
you sent secret letters

99
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,959
to turn the two brothers
against each other.

100
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,399
The Beijiang defense map.

101
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,680
So carefully planned.

102
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,279
Truly worthy of the Grand Secretary.

103
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,920
You staged every scene flawlessly,

104
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,680
playing me for a fool.

105
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:37,879
Gan Sheng!

106
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,240
Li Yuanze.

107
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,560
You are the clean stream among scholars.

108
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,279
I cannot kill you.

109
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,759
But Xiao Pingning is ruthless.

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,240
If I kill her,

111
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,360
I would rid the world of a scourge.

112
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,000
Perhaps

113
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:59,920
history may even praise the deed.

114
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,560
What do you really want?

115
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,000
Since you two love acting so much,

116
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,680
why not join me

117
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,920
for one final performance?

118
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,199
Kill him.

119
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,240
Kill him and I will let the past go.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,800
What is it?

121
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,399
Can't bear to do it?

122
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,600
Do it!

123
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,920
Today one of you dies,

124
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,839
