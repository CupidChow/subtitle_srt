Who was it?

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,959
The Princess Royal,

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,319
Xiao Pingning.

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
Xiao Pingning?

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,439
Why would she do that?

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,200
Is this answer

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,280
what you were hoping for in your heart?

30
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,760
It is what I wished for.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,079
Yet I fear deceiving myself,

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,280
only to end up with empty joy.

33
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,959
Master, please help me invite
the Princess Royal for a meeting.

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,280
Has your injury improved, sir?

35
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,770
Thank you for your concern,
Your Highness.

36
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,280
I am fine.

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,960
It is rare for you to request
a meeting on your own accord.

38
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:46,919
May I ask

39
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,840
what this is about?

40
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,400
There is someone very important to me.

41
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,800
She was born with asthma

42
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,319
and has suffered greatly.

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,080
So I hoped to ask Your Highness

44
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,400
for a medicinal herb
that could save her life.

45
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,159
What is it?

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,680
Windvine.

47
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,960
And why are you so certain

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,199
that I can help you?

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,680
I searched far and wide

50
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,400
and finally found Master Jueyuan.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,879
He did indeed have one Windvine plant.

52
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,719
But unfortunately,

53
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,479
he told me that this Windvine

54
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,680
has already been reserved
by Your Highness.

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,120
That is correct.

56
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,120
Your Highness went to great lengths

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,080
and donated a large sum to the temple

58
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,390
for the sake
of that single Windvine plant.

59
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,400
If I may be so bold to ask,

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,280
why?

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,400
For the same reason as you.

62
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,599
There is someone I wish to save.

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,919
Who is it?

64
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,120
An old acquaintance.

65
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,079
Would Your Highness be willing

66
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,279
to part with the Windvine

67
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,720
and let me have it?

68
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,160
Very well.

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,720
Only, if I give it to you,

70
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,519
my acquaintance

71
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,959
will have to suffer for it.

72
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,360
That little girl

73
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,839
has had asthma since childhood.

74
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Whenever it flares up,

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,879
it is truly life threatening.

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,839
I heard that

77
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
when her grandfather was alive,
he exhausted every effort

78
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,100
searching across the land
for medicine for her.

79
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,560
But later on

80
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,040
her grandfather

81
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,160
passed away.

82
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,279
So then,

83
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,720
do you still want it?

84
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:18,879
Your Highness.

85
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,620
General Gan has gone
to the Princess Royal's Residence.

86
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,720
He said he will not leave
unless he sees you.

87
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,959
Have you decided?

88
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,360
Mr. Qingya.

89
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,550
It seems Your Highness's acquaintance
is more important.

90
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,519
I will find another way.

91
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,780
(Princess Royal Yong'an's Residence)

92
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,399
Your Highness seems rather busy lately.

93
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,639
Could it be

94
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,800
you are hiding something from me?

95
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,560
Who allowed you to barge into my room?

96
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,470
I have even barged into the palace.

97
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,879
Let alone

98
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,920
your little Princess Royal's Residence.

99
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,800
What exactly do you want?

100
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,199
You seem very nervous.

101
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,519
Do not worry.

102
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,120
I simply came across
a rare treasure by chance

103
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,639
and could not wait
to bring it to Your Highness

104
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,959
for your appreciation.

105
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,000
What is it that makes you so eager?

106
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,319
Open it and see.

107
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,319
Well?

108
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,160
This gift,

109
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,680
Your Highness recognizes it, do you?

110
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,519
You truly are mad.

111
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,240
You bring me a corpse as a gift?

112
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,759
Take a good look.

113
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,199
This is the spy
you sent into my residence.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,120
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,160
I...

116
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,199
I do not understand.

117
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,839
Your Highness is so delicate and frail.

118
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,319
Perhaps

119
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,560
I should help
strengthen your body a little.

120
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,319
Your Highness,

121
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,639
as long as you obey me,

122
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,639
all these elite soldiers outside

123
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,120
would have been here to protect you.

124
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
But you refused.

125
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,360
Do you know why?

126
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,800
You have been married before.

127
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,800
Would I still be willing to marry you?

128
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,639
I heard the Eldest Prince was impotent.

129
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,200
So you remain untouched even now.

130
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,840
In that case,

131
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,770
why not consummate
our marriage here today,

132
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,679
ahead of time?

133
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,240
Are you planning to break our agreement?

134
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,559
How ridiculous.

135
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,759
You bargain with me on one hand

136
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,600
while sending people
to spy on me on the other.

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,639
Do you truly take me for a fool?

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,919
Look here.

139
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,679
Does this not resemble Beijiang?

140
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,240
I heard

141
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,759
that back then,
the Eldest Prince tied you up

142
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,279
right in a place like this.

143
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,279
No.

144
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,080
No.

145
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,639
No.

146
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,980
(Lotus Pavilion)

147
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,080
Sir.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,799
How?

149
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,120
What have you found?

150
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,160
After obtaining the Windvine,
the Princess Royal

151
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,990
secretly sent someone to deliver it to
a remote secondary residence outside the city.

152
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,159
The place is heavily guarded.

153
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,679
My men did not dare get too close
for fear of alerting them.

154
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,240
Therefore we were unable
to see who she was.

155
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,840
Even so, we confirmed

156
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,039
that an old woman
and a young girl live inside.

157
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,519
Mrs. Liu and Zhao.

158
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,600
Could it be...

159
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,799
Could she truly...

160
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,500
Senior, you told me to keep an eye

161
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,600
on Xiao Pingning
after she returned to her residence.

162
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,480
I saw General Gan take her away.

163
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,620
The two of them rode toward
the direction of the military camp.

164
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,440
The military camp?

165
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,200
Yes.

166
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,720
Could they possibly

167
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,279
be planning a revolt?

168
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,240
Impossible.

169
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,279
True.

170
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,790
The two of them did not look
as if they were acting together.

171
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,600
Xiao Pingning seemed reluctant.

172
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,790
It looked more like
Gan Sheng forced her along.
