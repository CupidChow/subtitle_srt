Since you refuse to speak,

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,840
I'll give you a piece of calligraphy.

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,680
Your Highness, General Gan is here.

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,020

(Clear Waters Stained With Ink)

29
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,599
Actually,

30
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,840
I stopped caring
about that answer long ago.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,599
I just wanted you to know

32
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,199
I'm the biggest stain on your life.

33
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,680
A

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,960
false

35
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,400
gentleman.

36
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,199
General.

37
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,960
Her Highness said

38
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,879
ordinary punishment is useless

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
to someone like Li Yuanze.

40
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,280
Only in this way

41
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,479
can we grind down his arrogance.

42
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,400
Nonsense.

43
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,199
General, you can't go in.

44
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,199
Gan Sheng.

45
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,479
How dare you?

46
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,120
How dare you draw your sword at me?

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,240
You know very well

48
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,360
who I'm drawing this blade at.

49
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,280
Last time I tried to kill Li Yuanze,

50
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,000
you stopped me.

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,479
Now, you're stopping me again.

52
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
You keep stopping me.

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,080
Could it be

54
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,080
that you have ulterior motives?

55
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,639
Or

56
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,040
do you still have feelings for him?

57
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,319
Don't forget

58
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,920
how you got here.

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,839
You've always

60
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,199
belonged to me.

61
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,639
Insolence.

62
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,639
Since you allied with me,

63
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,720
you should remember your promise.

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,720
Now, you nitpick me at every turn

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,700
and have no trust in me.

66
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,920
If that's the case,

67
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,360
the schemes I've been helping you with

68
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,839
end now.

69
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
What schemes?

70
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,120
Lin Jue of Ministry of Revenue

71
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,920
will summon the civil officials
under the pretext of his birthday.

72
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,759
I already planned

73
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,279
to bring Li Yuanze there

74
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,560
and humiliate him publicly.

75
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,160
Let them all see

76
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,079
that their only hope

77
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,519
has long fallen under my skirts.

78
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,240
Only then

79
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,839
can we shake the civil court's morale

80
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,560
and find our opportunity.

81
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,319
Besides,

82
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,680
don't you also need

83
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,560
a puppet like me to take the blame?

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,040
Right?

85
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,480
I acted rashly

86
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,480
and let your kindness go to waste.

87
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,680
My grip was a bit too strong.

88
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,879
You should rest.

89
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,000
Your Highness.

90
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,759
Don't let anger harm your health.

91
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,079
Fool.

92
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,800
Princess Royal is too much.

93
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,380
How could she treat you like that?

94
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,959
We still

95
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,319
need her cooperation.

96
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,759
If she's just a cat showing its claws,

97
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,720
playing along won't hurt.

98
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,959
But if she has bigger ambitions...

99
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,240
Keep an eye on her.

100
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,680
Don't spare

101
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,560
anyone who shouldn't be spared.

102
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,120
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

103
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,100
How have you been lately?

104
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,519
Thank you all

105
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,759
for coming to celebrate my birthday.

106
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,920
(Lin Jue, Vice Minister of Revenue)
A toast to everyone.

107
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,199
- Congratulations, Official Lin.
- Cheers.

108
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,639
This liquor tastes excellent.

109
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,560
On Official Lin's birthday,

110
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,920
I've brought my new pet to celebrate.

111
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,720
Why don't you all guess

112
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,560
who this is?

113
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,439
Who?

114
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,879
Isn't this Official Li?

115
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,319
It's indeed Official Li.

116
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
Yuanze!

117
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,720
This is outrageous.

118
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,800
You've gone too far!

119
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,839
Insolence!

120
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,720
How dare you disrespect Princess Royal?

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,480
Someone, seize him.

122
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,290
Your Highness, calm your anger.

123
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,080
Absolutely disgraceful.

124
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,720
Truly intolerable.

125
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,879
What?

126
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,240
You want to speak up for him?

127
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,039
But I

128
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,759
can't bear to punish you.

129
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,039
She's utterly lawless.

130
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,519
We're in broad daylight.

131
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,540
(Zhang Bowen, Left Censor-in-Chief)

132
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:16,960
Your Highness.

133
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,639
Stop.

134
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,039
Beg me.

135
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,320
I beg you.

136
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I didn't hear you.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,159
Say it again.

138
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,960
I

139
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,240
beg you.

140
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,559
How shameful.

141
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,639
This is utterly improper.

142
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,200
Let's leave!

143
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,180
Official Zhang is right.

144
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Official Zhang.

145
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,600
Let's leave.

146
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,260
I can't watch this either.

147
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,320
Outrageous.

148
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,879
How unlucky.

149
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,600
Such a joyous occasion ruined.

150
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,879
Princess Royal.

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Official Zhang
had a bit too much to drink earlier

152
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,919
and is feeling unwell.

153
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Please forgive him.

154
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,540
(Wang Huan, Vice Minister of Personnel)

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,080
The way Official Li looks

156
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,480
is truly remarkable.

157
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,519
On such a lovely night,

158
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,799
why not improvise a poem?

159
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,679
Take your affection

160
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,639
for Your Highness as inspiration.

161
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:50,679
Make it bold.

162
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,879
Make it sensual.

163
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,720
Only then is it worthy

164
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,159
of Her Highness's divine beauty.

165
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,399
Insolence.

166
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,080
Who are you

167
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,679
to order my man around?

168
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,240
Someone.

169
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,399
Take him away.

170
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,080
Make him kneel for six hours.

171
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,800
Your Highness, have mercy.

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,039
Your Highness, have mercy!

173
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,039
Your Highness, have mercy.
Your Highness.

174
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,759
I was wrong.

175
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,210
I shouldn't have spoken out of turn!

176
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,639
I know my mistake.

177
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,879
Your Highness!

178
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,639
Your Highness, have mercy!

179
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:30,320
Your Highness.

180
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,279
Your Highness.

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,320
Staying with you stuffy scholars

182
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,840
is such a bore.

183
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,799
Xing.

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,519
You stay here

185
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,120
and catch up with your friends.

186
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:55,720
You'll come back obediently tonight.

187
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,279
Won't you?

188
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,000
Your Highness.

189
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,080
Keep your eyes
on whoever approached him first

190
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,480
and what they said.

191
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,360
Yes.

192
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,639
Just finding a bookseller

193
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,639
is really enough to lure Mr. Qingya out?

194
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,639
All of Mr. Qingya's play scripts

195
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,420
were sent to Beijiang through him.

196
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,780
Hopefully.

197
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,820
As per your instructions,

198
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,180
I recorded

199
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,060
all the guests' behavior just now.

200
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,260
Those who flattered or wavered

201
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
are all recorded here.

202
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,900
A fence-sitter like Vice Minister Wang

203
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,980
is a sore sight.

204
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,600
Deal with him when the chance arises.

205
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,900
Official Zhang

206
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,660
is a man of action.

207
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,100
(Zhang Bowen)
These people

208
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,340
must be retained.

209
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,380
Yes.

210
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,700
It's a pity they don't understand.

211
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,580
They might mistake your protection

212
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,700
for oppression.

213
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,820
Doing the right thing

214
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,460
needs no one's understanding.

215
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,660
We sent several visiting cards

216
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,900
as per procedure,

217
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,780
but Mr. Qingya didn't respond.

218
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,060
This was our last resort.

219
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,500
Forgive me.

220
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,020
Do you always summon people this way?

221
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,820
Apologies.

222
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,300
I was impolite.

223
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,420
I couldn't see you
with ordinary methods.

224
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,020
Xing.

225
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,860
Apologies.

226
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,980
May I

227
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,740
have eight minutes?

228
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,660
I came to see you

229
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
to thank you in person.

230
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,740
I have never met you.

231
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,220
Why thank me?

232
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,420
Though we have not met,

233
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,260
I've long since

234
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,780
memorized your Qingya and White Deer

235
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,820
by heart.

236
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,860
Five years in Beijiang,

237
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,340
surrounded by ice and frost.

238
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,820
It helped me survive.

239
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,380
It showed me

240
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,900
that there are people

241
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,220
who never yield to hardship

242
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,820
and can rise again
in desperate circumstances.

243
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,500
Out of gratitude,

244
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,260
whatever you ask of me,

245
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,860
be it rare books

246
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,060
or your career,

247
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,980
I will do my utmost

248
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,340
to repay you.

249
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,180
You overstated.

250
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,660
When I wrote it,

251
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,940
I never sought anything in return.

252
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,380
A story meeting a kindred soul

253
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,980
is already a blessing.

254
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,180
Yet I always feel

255
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,540
the Princess Zhaoyang in the play script

256
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
resembles me in some ways.

257
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,700
All beings in this world

258
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,860
are protagonists of their own lives.

259
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,740
Partings and reunions,
fortunes and fates.

260
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,780
They're mostly
just similar coincidences.

261
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,140
Does the story have a continuation?

262
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,780
Your Highness.

263
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,340
Not all stories

264
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,380
have continuations.

265
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,540
Regardless,

266
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,420
I'm grateful you wrote this story.

267
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,740
Should the day come

268
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,620
that you need me,

269
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,220
I will always be at your service.
