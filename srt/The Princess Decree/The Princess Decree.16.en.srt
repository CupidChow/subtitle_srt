00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,420
(Princess Royal Yong'an's Residence)

24
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,360
Mother.

25
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,719
There are so many things
I wish I could tell you.

26
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,039
Yet,

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,479
you can no longer hear me.

28
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,639
Your Highness.

29
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,120
Mr. Qingya sent a gift.

30
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,750
An offering for the Imperial Consort.

31
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,360
This is a painting
done by Mother herself.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
But...

33
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,759
How could he have it?

34
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,039
Your Highness,

35
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,319
after today's ceremony, I overheard people
in the palace talking.

36
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,850
They said that when the Imperial Consort
was gravely ill, she was not unattended.

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,080
What?

38
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,240
They said

39
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,800
someone visited her many times.

40
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,080
But that person wore a mask,

41
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,280
so no one saw the face clearly.

42
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,280
If you ask me,

43
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,080
it must have been Mr. Qingya.

44
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,280
Your Highness,

45
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,960
perhaps you could

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,439
ask him yourself.

47
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,990
Maybe things are not
as bleak as they seem.

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,919
The Imperial Consort
had old acquaintances in the capital,

49
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,599
who arranged
for her belongings long ago.

50
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,159
It is comforting to hear,
and I thank you.

51
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,500
(Qingya and White Deer)

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,959
Xing.

53
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,000
Go to the Lotus Pavilion.

54
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,639
Tell them,

55
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,319
Xiao Pingning awaits at the residence

56
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,480
and invites Mr. Qingya for a meeting.

57
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:29,560
Understood.

58
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,680
You came.

59
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,439
Thank you.

60
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,439
Thank me for what?

61
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Thank you, Mr. Qingya,

62
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,079
for helping me once again.

63
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,680
Good liquor.

64
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Naturally.

65
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,879
This is Daughter's Red
brewed by my mother herself,

66
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,199
(Year after year, we shared the spring breeze)
prepared especially

67
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,399
for my wedding day.

68
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,560
But…

69
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,360
When she brewed it, she told me

70
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,720
the sealing labels
of this wine were meaningful.

71
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,959
She said I must ask them
from someone I cherish.

72
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,079
She insisted I
seek out a certain person.

73
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,040
Looking back now,

74
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,639
all those thoughts in my heart…

75
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,439
Mother was the first person
who truly saw through me.

76
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:34,580
(Year after year,
we share the spring breeze.)

77
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,560
Why does Your Highness need so many

78
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,279
wine labels?

79
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,759
I…

80
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,079
It was what my mother wanted.

81
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,720
Do not ask too much for now.

82
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,319
I'm leaving.

83
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,240
Your Highness.

84
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,680
Do you like Official Li?

85
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,279
You…

86
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,480
How dare you speak nonsense.

87
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
I can already tell.

88
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,079
Come back here.

89
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,439
I spent a long time finding this place
to sail and rest.

90
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,590
Consider it thanks for writing
the wine labels for me.

91
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,720
Are you pleased with it?

92
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,279
I feel it seems to lack something.

93
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,120
Since Your Highness
used the labels I wrote,

94
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,879
should you not invite me
to drink with you?

95
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,480
Well…

96
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,839
Well…

97
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,460
Let us speak of it
when there is another chance.

98
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,519
Very well.

99
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,480
I shall wait.

100
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,959
You excel in opera and stories.

101
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,759
I have a story as well.

102
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,879
I wonder if you would like to hear it.

103
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,720
I would like that.

104
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,519
Once,

105
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,319
there was a Princess
and a scholar-official.

106
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,279
They spoke of no grand vows,

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,199
yet they shared

108
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,839
trust and companionship,

109
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,690
and hearts that understood each other.

110
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,080
Later the Princess fell into danger,

111
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,840
and the scholar promised to save her.

112
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,039
Yet at the final moment,

113
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,320
he betrayed her.

114
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,159
Strangely,

115
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,159
many years later,

116
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,919
the two met again.

117
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,879
The Princess tormented him in every way,

118
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,519
thinking

119
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,360
he must hate her deeply.

120
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,919
But as time passed,

121
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,799
she found

122
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,399
he had been trying to make amends.

123
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,600
I never understood

124
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,720
why this scholar in the story

125
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,559
would do such a thing.

126
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,399
If we cannot understand it,

127
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,720
the story cannot move forward.

128
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,000
If we look from the scholar's view,

129
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,120
perhaps

130
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,399
he never betrayed her at all.

131
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,759
That day,

132
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,759
the scholar's mentor drugged him,

133
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,440
and he slept for a full day and night.

134
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,000
When he finally awoke,

135
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,240
the Princess was already gone.

136
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,279
In truth, the Emperor had already suspected

137
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,340
that the scholar
and the Princess formed a faction.

138
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,200
Yet out of selfishness,

139
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,080
the mentor protected the scholar alone.

140
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,679
So that is the truth.

141
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,000
So it was.

142
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,960
Why has Your Highness never asked

143
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,200
why the scholar did not explain himself?

144
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,840
Perhaps because his mentor had passed,

145
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,679
and he did not wish to stain his name,

146
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,440
nor add to his guilt.

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,679
The scholar was upright and loyal,

148
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,120
never one to shift blame.

149
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,480
He must have believed

150
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,440
that no matter how he explained,

151
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,240
wrong was still wrong,

152
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,159
and if he could not ease her pain,

153
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,960
there was no point speaking of it.

154
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,799
Sir,

155
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,960
am I right?

156
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,799
Exactly.

157
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,960
But I have one more question.

158
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,799
Later the Princess learned by chance

159
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,279
that the scholar
once cared for her mother.

160
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,600
Tell me,

161
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,039
what do you think
they said to each other?

162
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,320
If one day,

163
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,000
you truly feel remorse,

164
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,639
I ask only one last promise.

165
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,159
Just one.

166
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,039
Please speak.

167
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,240
If one day,

168
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,960
Pingning returns home safely,

169
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,840
I beg you,

170
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,200
spare her.

171
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,000
Do not hurt her again.

172
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,000
I promise you.

173
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,840
And yet, the scholar failed her,

174
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,000
for even that final promise

175
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,399
was left unfulfilled.

176
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
It is snowing.

177
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,780
