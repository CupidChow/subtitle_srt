10
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,520
request Your Majesty

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,520
to retry Liu Zhen's case

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,240
according to the law

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,799
and return justice
to the Grand Secretary.

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,500
He spent his whole life
contributing to the kingdom.

15
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,380
There must be
more to this than meets the eye.

16
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm making a daring request

17
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,580
to Your Majesty
to investigate this person thoroughly.

18
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,640
The Princess Royal,

19
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,079

20
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,350
Where is His Majesty?

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,319
Where is His Majesty?

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,200
Thank you for thinking about me.

for a marriage alliance)

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,719
(and I was tortured.)

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,879
(Now,)

28

(and humiliation than I suffered.)

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,639
His Majesty is ill.

34
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,280
I will be the one making decisions
in the imperial court today.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,919
Official Li,

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
are you going

37
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,960
to make this imperial accusation?

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,159
Princess Royal,

39
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,039
please fulfill my wish.

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,639
Sure.

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,280
If Official Li wants to do things
according to the law,

42
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,960
we'll do things according to the law.

if the one sounding the drum

46
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,760
is accusing someone of a higher rank
and members of the royalty are involved,

47
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,960
he must step over the fire,

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,759
submit a petition, and be imprisoned

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,759
to show his determination.

00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,759

Official Li.

75
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,879
You didn't expect me to return, right?

76

77
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,279

in that formal request

80
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,690
to send me to Beijiang
for a marriage alliance.

81
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,120
Sir,

82
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,480
you used my name

83
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,959

are you awake?

101
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,960
Where is this?

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,159
Does it surprise you?

103
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,190
This is the Princess Royal's Residence.

104
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,440
It's all thanks to General Gan,
whom all literary officials despise,

105
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,240
for defeating Beijiang

106
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,399
so I could be

107
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,799
brought back alive.

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,200
Now that my father has passed away

109
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,559
and the new emperor is still young,

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,919
he completely obeys my orders.

111
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,360
Even the whole imperial court of Jing

112
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,080
is under my control,

113
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,360
let alone Liu Zhen.

114
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,120
Official Li,

115
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,279
isn't it a joke for you

116
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,520
to make a royal accusation
at the imperial hall?

117
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,200
You killed my teacher

118
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,559
to get revenge?

119
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,600
Didn't he deserve to die?

120
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,639
I was tortured for five years

121
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,600
and only stayed alive
because of my grudge!

122
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,600
All of this happened
because of Liu Zhen!

123
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,320
Princess Royal,

124
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,399
why do you

125
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,120
bring me here?

126
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:01,320
Naturally, I'm trying
to gather talented individuals.

127
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,639
There might be a grudge between us,

128
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,039
but I've always
appreciated people with talent.

129
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,679
Official Li, why don't you stay

130
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,279
and become a strategist
of Princess Royal's Residence?

131
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,960
What do you think?

132
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,039
Your Highness is right.

133
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,200
All strategists

134
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,240
are remarkably perceptive.

135
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,679
Unfortunately,

136
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,679
I am foolish.

137
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,120
I only have a magnetic heart.

138
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,840
I only

139
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,519
point in one direction

140
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,580
and I won't give up no matter what.

141
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,039
Li Yuanze,

142
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,679
I'll give you another chance.

143
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,519
No matter how many chances you give me,

144
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,559
it'll still be the same.

145
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,840
Fine.

146
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,879
I will fulfill your wish

147
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,879
and put this in your grave with you.

148
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,440
(Salt Iron Theory: Extracted Critiques)
Liu Zhen did everything to write this.

149
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,600
It is something that is seen
as a treasure by all of you.

150
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,799
No.

151

What?

Sure.

If you want to protect it,

155
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,320
get rid of your noble behavior

156
