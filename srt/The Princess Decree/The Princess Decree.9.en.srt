00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,359
It's a pity

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,200
that things didn't go as you wished.

27
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,200
You have always upheld justice,

28
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,040
yet you would resort
to vigilante measures,

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
taking lives at will.

30
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,120
That's incorrect.

31
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,400
Vice Minister Wang committed suicide.

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,439
What does that have to do with me?

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,280
Tell me

34
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,159
why he committed suicide.

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,519
This sword was bestowed
by the late emperor.

36
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,360
Seeing it
is like seeing the late emperor.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,360
The late emperor's authority
still lingers.

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,159
I guess

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,280
Vice Minister Wang
was too ashamed to live,

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,919
so he sought death to atone his sins

41
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,560
and ask for forgiveness.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,159
Official Li, you

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,159
can truly twist the facts.

44
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,599
You flatters me.

45
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,919
I'm not even half as good as you.

46
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,879
If you have any tricks left,

47
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,159
feel free to use them.

48
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
I'm ready.

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,039
You're really full of surprises.

50
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,599
It truly makes me

51
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,439
regret deeply.

52
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,479
I really regret

53
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,599
not having some fun with you back then.

54
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,199
I missed out on so much amusement.

55
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,560
What?

56
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,599
In just a few days

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,479
after putting on this court robe,

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,800
you already forgot

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,719
your time at Princess Royal's residence?

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,840
Want me to jog your memory?

61
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,919
I didn't expect you to be the one

62
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,039
who cannot forget.

63
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,199
What are you trying to prove
by humiliating me?

64
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,960
Proving you're no longer
the Xiao Pingning of five years ago.

65
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,599
Proving

66
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,080
that all you brought back
from Beijiang was hatred?

67
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
But Your Highness,

68
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,280
hatred clouds the eyes.

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,680
and colluding
with wolves like Gan Sheng,

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,240
aren't you afraid

72
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,000
it will backfire?

73
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
Who are you to say that to me?

74
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,960
You want to kill me, right?

75
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,319
Yes.

76
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,439
Is there anything that you care about?

77
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,560
Let alone human lives.

78
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,639
(It's Gan Sheng's informant.)

79
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,680
Would you care about the life of an ant?

80
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,639

167
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,200

You're compassionate and righteous,

179
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,279

by selfish intent a year ago?

180
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,960
Would you regret helping me?

Perhaps

188
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,600
there is no way to get what one wants.

189
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,120
Master Jueyuan, Yuanze.

190
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,540
(To Yuanze)

191
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Since abducted

192
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,320
(Meet me tomorrow night)
by Xiao Pingning,

193
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,990
didn't Zhou leave the capital in terror?

194
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,240
Why'd he come back so quickly

195
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,360
and even ask to meet you?

196
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,639
This isn't Zhou.

197
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,120
The handwriting may be Zhou's,

198
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,559
but we agreed

199
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,000
we only sign with our aliases.

200
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,840
This letter uses his real name.

201
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,279
It's obviously fake.

202
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,080
Gan Sheng...

203
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,120
Gan Sheng has been

204
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,679
repeatedly asking around about you.

205
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,919
Could this be his trap?

206
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,000
He must be getting desperate.

207
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,399
If he's using such a method,

208
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,679
he has bad intentions.

209
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:52,600
Yuanze.

210
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,990
Think this through.

211
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,360
Since Gan Sheng trusts Mr. Qingya,

212
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,519
why not make use of it

213
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,940
and hold him in check?

214
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,080
But

215
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,399
if he finds out,

216
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,519
your safety...

217
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:05,799
As long as we win,

218
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,519
so what if I step into the game myself?
