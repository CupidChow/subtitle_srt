=Episode 11=

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,439
Something just arrived
from the Princess Royal's Residence.

24
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,860
(A meeting at the Bookshop
during the Hour of Wei)

25
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,180
(Old Bookshop)

26
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,590
I didn't expect
the favor Your Highness mentioned

27
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,360
to mean accompanying you
on a shopping trip.

28
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,759
Why not?

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,599
A favor from Mr. Qingya
isn't something one should turn down.

30
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,400
As it happens,
I want to buy a painting as a gift.

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,039
You're familiar with the arts.

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,479
You can help me choose.

33
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,680
And buying it from Zhou
can count as making it up to him.

34
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,560
A gift?

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,759
May I ask who it's for, Your Highness?

36
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,520
My mother.

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,800
To be more precise,

38
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,439
it's for a memorial offering.

39
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:50,199
My mother loved calligraphy
and paintings above all else.

40
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,730
Whenever she came across a fine piece,

41
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,500
she could stay up
the entire night with it.

42
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,240
She would spare no effort
just to behold one.

43
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,800
That year,

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,000
I promised her

45
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,759
that on her birthday,

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,500
I would give her the finest painting
in the entire capital.

47
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,400
But she was born in spring,

48
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,800
and by the time winter snow fell,
I had already left the capital.

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,080
In the end,
I never made it back in time.

50
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,199
After she passed,

51
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,159
her treasured paintings
disappeared as well.

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,479
If she were watching from the afterlife,

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,039
knowing her beloved collection
was treated so poorly,

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,599
she would be heartbroken.

55
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,199
At that time, I was beyond the border.

56
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,520
I could barely protect myself,

57
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,719
let alone her paintings.

58
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,960
Perhaps it wasn't
as tragic as you think.

59
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,479
Maybe the Consort
had old acquaintances in the capital.

60
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,400
They may have taken care
of her belongings for her.

61
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,039
Is that so?

62
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,039
Even if you only said it
to comfort me, thank you.

63
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,990
I failed my mother in many ways.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,580
So I hope this memorial offering
can make up for it in some small part.

65
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,360
Tell me,

66
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,800
which painting is the best?

67
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,439
That one.

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,600
Though painted with only a few strokes,

69
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,399
the light ink captures
blossoms in full bloom.

70
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,319
A gentle rain, white pear flowers.

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,639
It looks delicate,

72
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,759
yet it is the first to bloom
in the chill of spring.

73
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,319
How fitting.

74
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,800
Pear blossoms
were my mother's favorite.

75
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,120
I believe

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,000
she would truly love this one.

77
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,639
Thank you, sir.

78
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,420
There is no need for thanks,
Your Highness.

79
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,879
Demon girl, prepare to die.

80
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,160
Leave one alive.

81
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,040
Demon girl,

82
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,519
you deserve the worst death.

83
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,900
(Old Bookshop)

84
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,879
You're quite the devoted father.

85
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,920
To save your daughter,

86
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,560
you even take on any job offered.

87
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,120
How did you know?

88
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,319
You thought assassinating me
might solve your urgent troubles.

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,680
But if you die,

90
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,560
who will protect your daughter?

91
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,240
Did you really believe

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,560
I would let her go?

93
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,800
Xiao Pingning,

94
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,560
you monster!

95
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,160
Why do you hate me so much?

96
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,240
Speak.

97
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,680
Ever since you returned,

98
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,639
you've been colluding with Gan Sheng.

99
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,959
You've thrown
the entire court into chaos.

100
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
Everyone fears the two of you.

101
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,959
Xiao Pingning,

102
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,759
you are utterly unworthy
of being the Princess Royal of Jing!

103
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,680
Killing you

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,480
would rid the people of a plague.

105
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,600
I have no regrets!

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,519
You really do hate me to your very core.

107
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,639
It seems

108
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,480
I can only...

109
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,639
Your Highness.

110
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,319
Let you go.

111
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,120
Why?

112
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,920
You despise me,

113
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,279
yet I insist you owe me your life.

114
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,959
Remember this. From this day on,

115
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,600
I am the one who saved you.

116
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,600
Xiao Pingning, you...

117
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,680
Enough. Let him go.

118
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,680
He's an eyesore.

119
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,079
Move.

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,279
Your wound needs tending.

121
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
I have medicine with me.

122
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,560
Forgive the intrusion.

123
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,399
Your Highness let him go.

124
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,040
That was a brilliant move.

125
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,879
You mean

126
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,399
I was only putting on a show for you?

127
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,439
And once you looked away,

128
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,680
I would have him killed?

129
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,439
Would you?

130
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,480
So that's truly how you see me.

131
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,279
After all,

132
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,399
that's what everyone
in this world believes.

133
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,879
It's only natural.

134
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,720
Judging from Your Highness's tone,

135
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,279
does that mean Your Highness's decision

136
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,039
had another reason behind it?

137
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,679
You mean letting that man go?

138
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,500
Every wrong has its perpetrator,
every debt its owner.

139
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,080
He was nothing more
than an insignificant pawn.

140
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,990
I, Xiao Pingning, have no interest
in making things difficult for him.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,799
Besides,

142
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,600
a child is innocent. Why involve him?

143
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,840
(And were Mrs. Liu
and Zhao not innocent too?)

144
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,399
But tell me, sir,

145
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,399
since you truly believe

146
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,759
I am a demon who kills without blinking,

147
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,480
then when I was in danger just now,

148
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,519
why did you step in to save me?

149
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,639
It was an emergency.

150
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,360
Saving someone is instinct.

151
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,559
Even a stray cat or dog,

152
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,279
I would still help.

153
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,919
Let alone a living person.

154
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,559
With a heart like yours,

155
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,840
not becoming a living Bodhisattva
in some temple

156
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,320
is truly a pity.

157
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,559
Still, thank you for today, sir.

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,780
When I make my offering
for my mother's memorial,

159
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,039
I will tell her about you.

160
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,759
Heaven above,

161
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,600
I pray you

162
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,799
grant my mentor's family
peace in the afterlife

163
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,519
and guide them to the Pure Land.

164
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,000
Mr. Liu,

165
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,080
I think I may have made a mistake.

166
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,080
Or perhaps

167
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,200
I made that mistake a year ago.

168
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,320
Because

169
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,759
you were the one who saved my life.

170
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,759
My play saved Xiao Pingning,

171
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,000
yet Xiao Pingning killed you.

172
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,879
I have always understood,

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,320
that in life,

174
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,590
no one can escape the consequences
of their actions.

175
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,320
But I never imagined,

176
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,480
that the retribution
would fall upon you.

177
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,679
If a life must be exchanged for a life,

178
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,399
why couldn't the one to die be me?

179
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,320
Perhaps

180
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,159
this is retribution indeed.

181
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,840
Retribution for the fact that

182
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,360
I still harbored
foolish hopes about her.

183
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,080
Even today, I wavered again.

184
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I nearly believed in her.

185
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,759
