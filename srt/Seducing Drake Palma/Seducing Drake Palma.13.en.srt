00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:35,280
Previously on
Seducing Drake Palma.

2
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:38,217
Hello?

3
00:00:38,242 --> 00:00:39,785
Why are you calling?

4
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,417
He’s asleep!

5
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:44,701
I’m not going to wake
him up for you! Duh!

6
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:47,209
What are you doing
in Drake’s condo?

7
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:49,336
Take a guess.

8
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:51,685
Shai–!

9
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:54,761
- Dad?
- I’ve been looking for you.

10
00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:58,217
Who is this with you?

11
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:00,264
- Oh, I’m Alys-
- My girlfriend.

12
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:02,920
I’ll introduce you
to Tripp’s cousin.

13
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:04,224
Let me just call Drake.

14
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:06,376
Are you accusing me
of cheating on you?

15
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:07,537
Why, aren’t you?

16
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:17,779
What’s going on?

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,135
Family reunion.

18
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:20,826
Tristan! Tristan!

19
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,061
Hey! What’s up?

20
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:24,705
This is Drake’s girlfriend.
She is Alys.

21
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:58,447
I’m going to take this home.

22
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:03,619
Maybe this is the reason
for Tripp and me to talk.

23
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:06,079
Drake and I might end up
fighting if that happens.

24
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,963
I’ll take this since
he won’t eat it, anyway.

25
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:44,648
Oh my gosh!

26
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,281
Unbelievable!

27
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:29,121
I need to avoid Tripp,

28
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:32,116
so Drake and me will get
along peacefully.

29
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:46,499
- Sorry, Ma’am!
- Excuse me!

30
00:03:46,524 --> 00:03:47,739
Sorry!

31
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:49,057
Look at your face!

32
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:45,297
I love you, Drake Palma!

33
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:48,200
I wonder when I’ll get
to talk to that guy again.

34
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,957
Honestly, class is boring
the whole day.

35
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:57,196
In fairness, he’s really fun to talk to.

36
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:02,300
Oh, Alys, what mess did
you get yourself into?

37
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:08,183
What’s that?

38
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,605
What’s that? It’s ruining my
main character moment!

39
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:15,352
I’ve got so much on my mind–

40
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:19,940
Dane, you’re here!

41
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:21,770
You look ugly, Alys!

42
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,944
OMG!

43
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:26,446
- My baby Dane is so big now!
- Stop! I’m not a kid anymore!

44
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,573
But you’re still my baby!

45
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:29,216
Get off!

46
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:32,401
Oh my gosh, Dane,
you’ve grown so much!

47
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,716
You’re too much!

48
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:37,448
Your sister’s just excited
that you’re here, okay?

49
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,106
Why didn’t you text me
that you were here already?

50
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,456
Blame mom.
She wanted to surprise you.

51
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:43,855
But you were surprised, right?

52
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,236
Of course!

53
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,929
- My baby Dane is here–
- Get off!

54
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:48,151
Hey...

55
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:49,323
Why?

56
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,809
Are you scared that your girlfriend
will see that you’re still our baby–

57
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:54,105
Alys, stop it already!

58
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:55,401
Stop!

59
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:56,565
Because you’re big now?

60
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,019
- Are you really that grown-up?
- Stop!

61
00:05:58,044 --> 00:06:00,136
Because you’re
still our baby Dane!

62
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:02,331
- Alys!
- Hi, Alys!

63
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:03,671
Felice!

64
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:07,279
Hi, baby girl!

65
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:10,949
Oh wow, the love birds are here!

66
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:11,967
Let’s have snacks!

67
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:12,574
Nanny–

68
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:13,608
No, we’re going out.

69
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:15,036
Right away?

70
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:17,205
You’re leaving already,
but you just got here.

71
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:19,499
It seems baby Dane
didn’t miss me.

72
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,684
You’re so corny.

73
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:22,038
- We’ll be back right away.
- It’s okay.

74
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:23,628
Felice is just gonna
show me around.

75
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,726
Okay then.

76
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,548
- Just be back by dinner, okay?
- Yes.

77
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:27,466
Bye, Alys!

78
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:29,259
It was so nice to
see you, though.

79
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:30,569
Nice meeting you, baby.

80
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:31,486
Okay.

81
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:32,512
Take care of her.

82
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:37,979
Puppy love.

83
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:40,309
They’re so sweet.

84
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:42,104
I wish everyone had that.

85
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:50,018
You’re really avoiding me, huh?

86
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,889
Goodness, Tripp Marco Palma!

87
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,302
I had two successful days,
but failed on the third day.

88
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,026
Oh my gosh!

89
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,791
What am I supposed
to tell Drake if he asks?

90
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:04,206
I really hate lying.

91
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:06,527
Hey.

92
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,659
What?

93
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:08,792
Are you avoiding me?

94
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,119
No, I’m not.

95
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:11,604
You’re just too sensitive.

96
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:15,151
Sorry, Tripp.

97
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,059
You don’t deserve the
stupidity I’m doing, but...

98
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:21,139
I really love Drake.

99
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:27,612
Okay. I shouldn’t
have entertained Tripp.

100
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,682
But it’s so hard,

101
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:32,127
it’s sad having to go home
every break time

102
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,057
because I have no one
to talk to at Brenford.

103
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:40,492
Should I face him?

104
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:45,129
I really feel guilty
everytime I ignore him.

105
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:49,980
Is he coming closer?

106
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:54,019
Lord, please, give me strength.

107
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:58,323
I’m close to giving in
and talking to Tripp.

108
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:18,049
Well, happy birthday.

109
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:21,079
After all, you don’t want
to talk to me, anyway.

110
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,737
Tripp...

111
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,044
I missed you.

112
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:46,338
Tripp…

113
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:58,807
Where are we going, Ma’am?

114
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:08,248
Sir, do you know how it
feels to be guilty?

115
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:10,440
What?

116
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,757
It’s because I’m
avoiding my friend.

117
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,260
I feel so guilty.

118
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:19,512
That’s why I’d rather go home,
because I don’t want to see him.

119
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:22,349
I feel like I’m
such a bad person.

120
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:24,129
Oh…

121
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:32,636
All he ever did was make
me laugh, make me feel better.

122
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,810
And then what,
this is how I’ll treat him?

123
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,034
I don’t know what kind of
friend I am.

124
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:45,205
Ma’am, that looks more like
a lover, not just a friend.

125
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:49,601
Alright, Sir, let’s go.

126
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:50,825
Where to?

127
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:52,513
Southville, Gate 3.

128
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:03,615
Alys!

129
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,392
- You’re here!
- Mom.

130
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:07,302
I thought your class was later?

131
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:10,154
We got dismissed early.

132
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:12,646
Are you alright?

133
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:15,356
- Alys?
- Huh?

134
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,715
I said are you alright?

135
00:10:18,295 --> 00:10:20,091
Yes, mom. I’m okay.

136
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:21,740
I’m just really tired.

137
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:24,926
Well, I know something that
will make you very excited.

138
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:26,733
Your gowns are here!

139
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:29,599
Oh right!

140
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:31,299
My debut is tomorrow!

141
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:33,787
Well, aren’t you
excited to try them on?

142
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:36,064
Of course, Mom, I’m very excited!

143
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:38,400
Well, they’re upstairs,
go try them on!

144
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:39,668
- Okay?
- Okay.

145
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:41,278
Alright, see you later.

146
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:42,366
Okay.

147
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:03,224
Sigh.

148
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:05,784
I thought my debut would be fun,

149
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,615
since Drake agreed
to be my escort.

150
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:13,690
But why don’t I feel happy?

151
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:18,669
Is it because Tripp
is ignoring me already?

152
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:23,448
Gosh, life is such a mess.

153
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:35,095
Baby Dane, you’re here!

154
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,396
Hi!

155
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,919
What are you doing here?

156
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,685
Don’t you have
plans with Felice?

157
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,786
She went out with her friends.

158
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:45,443
Mmm.

159
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:53,433
What happened to you?

160
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,428
You are ugly,
but you’re getting even uglier.

161
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:57,607
Are you really my sister?

162
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:02,650
Good thing I still have
my super cute brother!

163
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:03,873
Stop!

164
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:05,467
You know what?

165
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,535
You’re the only one who
makes me happy these days.

166
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:09,724
Making you happy?
But you’re hurting me.

167
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:13,701
Come on, I was just being sweet.

168
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,115
You’re acting like I’m not
your big sister.

169
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,404
It doesn’t really seem like it.

170
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:22,216
You’re crazy.
What makes you say that?

171
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:24,624
Because I’m cool,
and you’re not.

172
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,147
Fine, you win.

173
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:28,860
You’re the handsome one,

174
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:30,720
the honor student,

175
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,528
and everyone’s favorite,
including me.

176
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,299
I’m not sure about
being the favorite.

177
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:41,273
Life’s so unfair!

178
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:43,873
But you know what,

179
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,393
I’m super happy that you’re
here for my birthday.

180
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:48,873
I love you.

181
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,496
Baby!

182
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:51,568
Stop!

183
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,373
Dane!

184
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:00,798
Stay right there, okay?

185
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,458
I need your honest opinion.

186
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:03,560
Whatever.

187
00:13:06,248 --> 00:13:08,873
I look so pretty, my gosh!

188
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,420
Who is this?
I look so cute, wow!

189
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,507
That’s right.
Just love yourself.

190
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:21,904
Admit it. It suits me,
and I look gorgeous.

191
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:26,265
Wow, he’s speechless!

192
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,943
Was the impact that strong?

193
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:31,771
Oh my gosh,
my little brother!

194
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:36,984
Admit it. The gown looks
great on your beautiful sister!

195
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,135
Whatever.

196
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,112
Is that so?

197
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:42,990
- Mom!
- Fine!

198
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:44,802
- He said the gown is – !
- Fine!

199
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:49,180
So, what? Is it beautiful?

200
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:50,326
Does it look good on me?

201
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,458
Your boyfriend will like it.

202
00:13:57,964 --> 00:13:59,310
Wait, there’s one more.

203
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:06,935
In fairness...

204
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,044
Even though you’ve been in California
for two years, we’re still close, right?

205
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:13,966
Because there’s just the two of us –
what choice do I have?

206
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,940
Wow! Are you forced?

207
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:17,193
Hey, let’s eat.

208
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,025
- Come on, let’s eat!
- Have a seat.

209
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,210
I missed this food!

210
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:20,820
Wow, this is a lot!

211
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,248
Come on, eat!

212
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:23,948
What took you so long?

213
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:25,091
You’ve been gone long.

214
00:14:25,303 --> 00:14:28,264
Because Alys couldn’t
stop admiring her gown.

215
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:29,787
I’m sorry, okay?

216
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,685
I told you she’d love your work.

217
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,435
Of course, Mom made that.
It’s going to be beautiful.

218
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:39,922
Well, is Drake really sure about
being your escort for your debut?

219
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:43,357
He said yes.

220
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,319
He better.

221
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,804
Oh, scary!

222
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,802
This tastes so good!

223
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:54,687
Glad you like it!

224
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:55,668
Come on!

225
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,478
Why are you so grumpy?

226
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,526
Mmm, Alys, by the way,

227
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:02,013
here’s the program flow.

228
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,678
Check them out and let me
know if you’re okay with it.

229
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,742
Wow, Mom, there are so
many 18 things here.

230
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,371
But I love it.
Thank you, Mom.

231
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:14,707
That’s good. Come on, eat.

232
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:16,505
You know, Mom...

233
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,146
Mmm?

234
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,129
Nana keeps on scolding me

235
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,256
just because I talk to a lot of
girls at school.

236
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,817
It’s not my fault if
they think I’m being flirty,

237
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:25,968
I’m just being friendly.

238
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,762
Well, because you’re my baby,

239
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,639
you’re a cute
baby of Mommy!

240
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,265
Stop, that’s not true!

241
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:33,351
Oh, what?
You look like Mommy!

242
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,740
I don’t look like you.

243
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,522
I’m so blessed with my family.

244
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,026
Thank You, Lord,
for giving me the best.

245
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:44,701
- Who did I take after?
- You look like your dad.

246
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:45,630
Your Mommy.

247
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:46,822
- You were found in a garbage can.
- Mommy?

248
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:47,951
Wow!

249
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,841
And my big sister speaks!

250
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,027
Hey!

251
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,136
Why are you reading that?

252
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,721
That’s a magazine for adults.

253
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:12,365
So?

254
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:14,617
“So?”

255
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,018
Kids these days!

256
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,521
Alys…

257
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:22,615
Mmm?

258
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:25,083
Do you believe

259
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,405
the number of
girls I played with

260
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,490
would be the amount
of times you would cry

261
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:30,591
because of someone?

262
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:36,458
Why would I cry?

263
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,685
Have you made many
people cry?

264
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:41,802
I don’t know,

265
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,338
but if that theory is true,

266
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:46,452
I think you need to
brace yourself.

267
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:53,060
I’ll sleep in your room.

268
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,434
Why in my room?
Go sleep in yours!

269
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,269
I don’t like it there.

270
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:00,955
Well, that’s fair.

271
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,419
You’re not here that often, anyway.

272
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:04,404
Better for you to sleep there.

273
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:07,919
Theory?

274
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:10,752
What if that’s true?

275
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,607
Hey, Dane!

276
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:15,755
Who are the girls
you’ve made cry, huh?

277
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:20,207
What’s taking her so long?

278
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:23,005
Here she comes!

279
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:24,729
- She’s here. Hurry, go!
- She’s coming. Wait.

280
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:25,544
She’s coming!

281
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,373
- Wait.
- Hurry!

282
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:31,277
Who’s going to count? Go.

283
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:32,428
Sshh!

284
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,056
- Alys!
- Alys!

285
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:38,976
- Happy birthday, bestie!
- Happy birthday!

286
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:41,579
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

287
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:43,330
Hello! Thank you!

288
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,521
Wow, why are you
throwing me a surprise!

289
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,962
I didn’t expect this, since I’m
always the one who goes to SCA.

290
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:50,755
Oh, right.

291
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,532
Sorry, bestie, it’s our
first time dropping by.

292
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:57,203
But of course, we won’t let this
day pass without surprising you.

293
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,121
Thank you, bestie.

294
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,791
We brought something
for you. It’s here, a cake!

295
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:03,701
Thank you so much, bestie!

296
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:08,464
Of course, bestie, it’s just
school separating us, right?

297
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,095
But we’re still friends.

298
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,346
Happy birthday, bestie!

299
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:19,208
Happy birthday to you…

300
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:20,443
Wait!

301
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:24,138
Happy birthday to you…

302
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:25,122
Come on, sing!

303
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:25,981
To me!

304
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:29,168
Happy birthday, happy birthday…

305
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:32,201
- Happy birthday to you!
- To me!

306
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:33,464
- Okay, that’s enough!
- Blow the candle, Alys.

307
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:34,490
- Blow the candle.
- Stop, wait!

308
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:35,591
Wait!

309
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:36,909
Make a wish, bestie!

310
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:37,701
- Oh, okay.
- Yes, that’s right!

311
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:38,577
- I got excited.
- That’s right, make a wish.

312
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:39,609
Okay.

313
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:43,332
I wish Drake would
be my husband.

314
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:45,559
Just kidding!

315
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:46,584
Okay.

316
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,133
- Yay!
- Thank you!

317
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,576
You’re welcome, bestie.

318
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,804
Anyway, I still have class.

319
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:58,359
- My gift –
- She has really changed.

320
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,474
My gift – I’ll give it
at the party later.

321
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:01,350
Alright.

322
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,060
- Thanks so much. You take care.
- Happy birthday!

323
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:04,529
Thank you!

324
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:06,564
- Happy birthday, Alys!
- Bye, Kent!

325
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:07,731
Thank you for coming!

326
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:10,583
Would you like me to...

327
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:12,224
...bring this for you?

328
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:14,591
I thought you were
going with them?

329
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,824
My class isn’t until
an hour from now.

330
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:18,425
Let me carry this for you.

331
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,802
Okay, thanks.

332
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,193
Do you want to eat
at the caf?

333
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:22,857
Your treat?

334
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:25,124
Seriously, it’s my birthday
and it’s still on me?

335
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:25,833
Fine, let’s go!

336
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,685
- Even on your birthday, it’s your treat.
- Okay, fine!

337
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,779
- Okay, go!
- Well, I don’t come here often.

338
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,281
Here.

339
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:41,891
Wow!

340
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,450
This is your treat?

341
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,544
Yes!

342
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:46,396
I might have to pay for this.

343
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,396
Fine, later.

344
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,357
Happy birthday again, Alys!

345
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,026
Thank you, Sheen.

346
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,111
It’s still early but
I’m already so happy.

347
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:57,656
Are you ready for
your party later?

348
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:00,701
Uhm...yes.

349
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:03,569
I’m a bit nervous,
since Mom invited so many people.

350
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:05,429
Seems like our entire clan.

351
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:07,731
Of course, my friends
are coming, too.

352
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:11,521
Even the kids of Mom and Dad’s
friends are invited, too.

353
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:13,375
The venue will be packed.

354
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,509
You know what, I missed
your craziness a lot.

355
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,428
I missed you too, Sheen.

356
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:24,182
I used to get so giddy
when Sheen smiled at me.

357
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:29,396
But now, I’m just genuinely
happy when he does.

358
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,833
How are you doing
here in Brenford?

359
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:34,777
You must be happy, right?

360
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,295
Have you adjusted?

361
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,990
Honestly, I’m still so sad,

362
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:45,190
because it’s almost half the
semester and I still don’t have friends.

363
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,095
Do they really hate me just
because I’m Drake’s girlfriend?

364
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:52,795
Hey, Alys!

365
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,170
Huh?

366
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,802
I said, how are you in Brenford?

367
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,537
Are you happy?

368
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,054
Oh, I’m fine.

369
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,333
I’m happy.

370
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:06,767
You know, too bad
you’re not in SCA.

371
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,294
We’re always having fun
there with Aya and Kent.

372
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,648
But it’s good to know
that you’re happy here.

373
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,299
How about you, Sheen?
How’s your love life?

374
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:18,185
Love life?

375
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,146
What is love life?

376
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:20,589
I don’t even know what that is.

377
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,449
Hey, it’s been a long
time since Kei left.

378
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:25,091
Time to move on already, okay.

379
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,712
I’ve already moved on.

380
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:29,657
Why do you know whether
I’ve moved on or not?

381
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,960
I’m just a third wheel with
Aya and Kent, but it’s fun.

382
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:35,087
You know those
two, they’re so playful.

383
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:39,138
What does “third wheel” mean?

384
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:41,318
Hmm...

385
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,888
I’ll just ask my playboy brother
the meaning of third wheel?

386
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:49,091
Oh, Alys, wait.

387
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:50,622
I need to go.

388
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,912
Mmm...

389
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,927
Why, are you finished already?

390
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,666
You ate so fast.

391
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,126
- I’m sorry.
- Are there worms in your stomach?

392
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:59,445
Time went by so fast.
I’ll just see you later, okay?

393
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,655
Happy birthday again,
see you later.

394
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:02,823
- Thank you!
- Bye!

395
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,138
- Happy birthday!
- See you later!

396
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:10,755
Even if you say you’re
doing okay,

397
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:12,833
I know you better, Sheen.

398
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:15,451
But don’t worry, best friend.

399
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:17,748
Time heals everything.

400
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:35,474
Oh no, what should I do?

401
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:39,505
Should I greet him, or just walk
straight like I didn’t see him?

402
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,820
What to do?

403
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:50,662
What just happened?

404
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:53,832
He didn’t say hi or smile?
There’s nothing.

405
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:02,263
Is he really that mad
because I ignored him?

406
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:08,013
This is hard.
I miss Tripp already.

407
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,244
Before refrigeration existed…

408
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,193
Did that idiot
really forget I exist?

409
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:35,912
Early Filipinos used salt
and vinegar to preserve food.

410
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,021
- This is my first time losing a friend.
- And that’s how adobo started.

411
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:42,553
- It actually hurts.
- Even before the Spaniards came,

412
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,919
our ancestors already
knew how to preserve food.

413
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,127
Adobo was not just

414
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:53,822
- created for its flavor.
- [In French] Only you.

415
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:56,558
- It was first created for survival.
- [In French] Happy birthday, Alys.

416
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:58,021
What’s with him?

417
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,942
Sometimes it’s like playing
“decode the message” with Drake.

418
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,670
Miss Perez, anything
you want to add?

419
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:06,076
[In French] Only you.

420
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,896
What? Are you cursing me?

421
00:24:09,688 --> 00:24:10,688
Uh…

422
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:13,966
No, Ma’am.

423
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:15,247
I’m sorry.

424
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:16,787
You better not.

425
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,207
Sit down.

426
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,356
Alys, you’re 18 years old already.

427
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,233
Behave yourself, please.

428
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:49,447
Yes?

429
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,844
Why are you still not dressed?

430
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,474
Mom said come down already.

431
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,154
Why are you speaking all posh?

432
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:58,640
Hurry up.

433
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,584
Or you’re gonna hear
more nagging on your birthday.

434
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:04,240
That kid is so grumpy!

435
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,400
You go, girl.

436
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,510
You can do this.

437
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:10,919
Aja!

438
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,748
My daughter looks beautiful.

439
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,586
You’ve become a woman, my baby.

440
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,714
Aww, Mommy!

441
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:29,849
Dad!

442
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:35,846
Dane, stop laughing!

443
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:37,706
They’re having a nice moment.

444
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,602
Mom, don’t cry.

445
00:26:41,627 --> 00:26:44,088
It’s a special day.
We should just be happy.

446
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:47,770
You’re so beautiful, baby.

447
00:26:50,848 --> 00:26:52,060
Where are you?

448
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:55,653
Alys...

449
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:57,467
- Are you okay?
- Mom...

450
00:26:57,585 --> 00:26:58,857
Is there any problem?

451
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,245
Uh, nothing.

452
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:02,802
Well, you seem uneasy.

453
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,224
Are you nervous?

454
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,560
A little bit.

455
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:09,004
Well, we when we get
to the hotel later,

456
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,506
just have fun, enjoy,
it’s your day, okay?

457
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:12,883
Okay, Mom, thanks!

458
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:13,610
Alright!

459
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:16,138
Dane, let’s go, it’s late!

460
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:21,725
Oh, where’s Drake?

461
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,271
Oh, uhm...

462
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,364
On the way.

463
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,802
He said he’s on the way.

464
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,107
Great.

465
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:37,942
Are you feeling too giddy?

466
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:40,010
Stop it.

467
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,495
Alys, let’s go!

468
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:42,544
Yes, Mommy!

469
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:48,644
- Daddy!
- Hi!

470
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:49,795
Hi, Aunt!

471
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:52,047
- Hello!
- Happy birthday!

472
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,256
Thank you!

473
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:53,940
You look nice.

474
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:56,301
You look gorgeous, Aunt.
And so do you, Dad.

475
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:57,361
Thank you.

476
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:58,695
Enjoy the party.

477
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,139
I’ll go greet my other guests.

478
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,265
- Alright.
- Okay.

479
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,016
Enjoy!

480
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,351
- Thank you for coming!
- Okay, have fun.

481
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:05,630
Please eat, okay?

482
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:07,177
- Oh, hello!
- Happy birthday!

483
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,314
Thank you!

484
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,399
Hi!

485
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,358
- Thank you!
- Happy birthday!

486
00:28:11,383 --> 00:28:13,594
- Hi, Alys!
- Mom, hi!

487
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,646
- You look so pretty.
- Alys, happy birthday.

488
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,280
Do you remember your aunties?

489
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:19,474
Of course, hello po!

490
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:20,833
Happy birthday, dear.

491
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:22,052
Thank you, Aunt.

492
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,130
- You look stunning.
- Thank you!

493
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:26,449
Wow, time really
flies, doesn’t it?

494
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:28,521
Tell me about it, my friend.

495
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:32,479
Mom, I’ll just
greet my friends.

496
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:33,888
Is that okay, Aunties?

497
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,048
- I hope you don’t mind.
- Sure, dear.

498
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:36,650
- It’s your party, just enjoy.
- Okay.

499
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,385
Okay, thank you!
Excuse me.

500
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:39,761
Okay, see you later!

501
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:43,724
Oh, thank you!

502
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,642
- Bestie!
- Bestie!

503
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:46,810
Happy birthday, Alys!

504
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,562
- You look so gorgeous!
- Hi, Kent!

505
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:50,021
You look beautiful, too.

506
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:50,956
Happy birthday!

507
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:52,357
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

508
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,333
Thank you!

509
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:54,735
Thank you for coming!

510
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,627
- Sure!
- Of course!

511
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,155
Wherever Bee is, I’m there too.

512
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,116
Wow, looks like you didn’t
come here for the birthday girl.

513
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:02,857
Oh, it seems like you’re
not used to him.

514
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:05,919
Oh, by the way,
where’s Sheen?

515
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:09,249
He’s on his way,
but maybe he’ll be here soon.

516
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,851
- Maybe he got stuck in traffic.
- Yes.

517
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,005
Okay.

518
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,778
Where’s your escort?

519
00:29:16,227 --> 00:29:18,104
Exactly, I still haven’t
heard anything.

520
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:21,841
But before I left, he said
he was already on his way.

521
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:24,552
Just let it be,
he’ll be here soon.

522
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:26,349
I hope so.

523
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,435
You’re ready for the
cotillion dance, right?

524
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,811
We already rehearsed.

525
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:30,228
Of course!

526
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:31,685
We already practiced.
Right, Bee?

527
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,332
Hi, Aya!

528
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,192
Aunt!

529
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:36,403
Oh my god!

530
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:38,028
You look so pretty!

531
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,237
Thank you!

532
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:42,341
Oh, Aunt! This is
my boyfriend, Kent.

533
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:44,284
I’m proud to be.
Hello, Aunt.

534
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:44,910
- “Proud to be?”
- "Proud to be?”

535
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,886
Hi, Kent!
Nice to meet you!

536
00:29:46,928 --> 00:29:49,556
Oh, by the way, can I
borrow Alys for a while?

537
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:50,849
- Yes!
- Go ahead, Aunt.

538
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:52,357
You don’t even
have to return her.

539
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,004
Just kidding! Go ahead!
Happy birthday!

540
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:57,214
Go now, baby girl!

541
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,131
Bye!

542
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,051
Alys, where’s Drake?

543
00:30:01,514 --> 00:30:03,216
The program is about to start.

544
00:30:03,241 --> 00:30:04,603
Mom, I don’t know.

545
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:07,881
Actually, I texted him a while ago,
and he said he’s already on the way.

546
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:09,951
Oh gosh, Alys!

547
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,536
Anyways, don’t you worry.

548
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:13,467
Your Dad and I will check if he’s here.

549
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:14,869
For sure, Drake will come.

550
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:18,434
No, Mom. Can I be the one
to check on him at the lobby?

551
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:22,046
I’ll feel better if I get
to see him first.

552
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:25,592
Oh, baby girl, don’t stress out.
Enjoy the party.

553
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,035
It’s your day. Okay?

554
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:30,288
Alright, smile.
So we’re always pretty.

555
00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:32,307
- Okay?
- Thanks, Mom.

556
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,630
- Alright!
- Love you.

557
00:30:33,655 --> 00:30:35,852
Love you.
See you later, okay?

558
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:36,895
- Okay, Mom.
- Alright, bye.

559
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,958
Okay.

560
00:30:39,448 --> 00:30:41,208
How are you doing there?

561
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:42,989
Where could he be?

562
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,269
Happy birthday!

563
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:55,313
Tripp, really?

564
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:59,609
If you only knew how much I
wanted you here at my debut.

565
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:03,208
This is so hard.

566
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:18,669
Drake!

567
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,227
Drake!

568
00:31:36,787 --> 00:31:39,039
Oh no! This can’t be!

569
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,067
It’s my birthday today!

570
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:42,700
Drake!

571
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,405
Wait, maybe...
he just forgot something.

572
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,112
Maybe he left my birthday gift.

573
00:31:47,232 --> 00:31:50,168
Or maybe he’s wearing slippers
and forgot to change into shoes.

574
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:52,037
Oh my god, Drake!

575
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:53,997
Drake, please!

576
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:56,480
Drake, answer me, please!

577
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,793
Drake, pick up
the phone, please!

578
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,570
Alys.

579
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,028
Hello, Drake?

580
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,723
I’m really sorry, Alys.
I really need to go.

581
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,419
I didn’t mean to disappoint you.

582
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:27,377
Wow.

583
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,575
Happy birthday, Alys.

584
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,123
Happy damn birthday.

585
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:49,094
My worry is that there are just
too many guests already.

586
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,875
Mommy can’t see me
like this.

587
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:31,970
I can’t be seen like this.
What do I even say?

588
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:35,724
Drake says sorry, but
he can’t come anymore?

589
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:37,864
That can’t be!

590
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:41,187
Mom will be mad
and disappointed!

591
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,566
Alys, please! Think!

592
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:48,528
Please, use your brain cells,
even just a little, come on!

593
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:54,784
Oh my god!

594
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:55,952
Please, please!

595
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:03,831
Sorry.

596
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:07,205
Sorry, I know this is selfish.
I’m so sorry.

597
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:22,925
You called?

598
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,245
Tripp, please…

599
00:34:27,924 --> 00:34:30,426
Please, come here.

600
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,229
Wait.

601
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,237
Hold on, are you crying?

602
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:44,918
Please, Tripp, come here.
I don’t have a partner.

603
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:48,088
Please!

604
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:52,534
Come on.

605
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:57,555
Don’t leave me.

606
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,475
Do you understand
what you’re saying, Alys?

607
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,189
If I go there,
I’ll make my joke real.

608
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,675
I won’t leave you alone.

609
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:16,746
Maybe this is what happens
when I’ve had enough.

610
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:23,003
Are you sure that’s
what you want?

611
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:27,104
Please, Tripp.

612
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,296
I’ve cried five times already.

613
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:32,423
It’s a lot, actually.

614
00:35:32,928 --> 00:35:34,763
Don’t you feel sorry for me?

615
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:38,263
Come on, please.

616
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:02,287
Even Tripp doesn’t like
me anymore?

617
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,475
- Aya?
- Aunt?

618
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,668
Have you seen Alys?

619
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:20,753
No, Aunt.

620
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:22,682
Is there a problem?

621
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:24,284
No, I’m just looking for her.

622
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:25,315
Sorry, Aunt.

623
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,901
Uh, Sheen, have you
seen Alys outside?

624
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:30,744
Uh, I didn’t notice, Aunt.

625
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:31,941
I just got here, too.

626
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:35,320
Maybe Alys is in the holding area.
I’ll go check for her, okay?

627
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,081
- Okay, Aunt.
- Alright, see you later.

628
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:39,311
- Sheen, what happened to you?
- Where were you?

629
00:36:39,336 --> 00:36:40,737
What took you so long?

630
00:36:41,372 --> 00:36:42,862
I’m having diarrhea.

631
00:36:44,457 --> 00:36:46,250
Keep it down.
It’s embarassing.

632
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:48,768
You stink.

633
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:51,586
Why are you like this, Drake?

634
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:00,011
I let go of Tripp for you,

635
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,641
but you’re the one
who let go of me now.

636
00:37:09,317 --> 00:37:10,652
Where’s Sheen?

637
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:14,484
He’s the only one I have left.

638
00:37:19,629 --> 00:37:21,229
You’re so selfish, Alys!

639
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:24,731
That’s why everyone leaves you.

640
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,441
Miss Alys?

641
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,661
Ma’am...

642
00:37:32,686 --> 00:37:36,397
Excuse me, Ma’am Alys,
shall we introduce you now?

643
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:37,534
Are you ready?

644
00:37:38,497 --> 00:37:40,370
Um, okay.

645
00:37:41,703 --> 00:37:44,289
We’re holding this event
for over an hour,

646
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:46,199
my guests might
be starving already.

647
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,517
Thank you, Ma’am.

648
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:48,601
Wait, I’ll just call you in.

649
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:50,453
Please standby, we’re ready.

650
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:51,495
Thank you.

651
00:37:53,288 --> 00:37:56,495
You can do this, Alys.

652
00:37:58,027 --> 00:37:59,028
You can do this, Alys.

653
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:03,031
Let’s go, Alys.

654
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:05,951
Aja!

655
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:07,534
Tripp…

656
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:08,806
I will stop at nothing.

657
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:10,854
You know that, right?

658
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:15,011
Sorry for making you come here.

659
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:18,907
I didn’t know that Drake
won’t come to my debut.

660
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:22,051
I’m so stupid.

661
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,952
This is the 5th time, Alys.

662
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:31,746
You know what that means.

663
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:35,878
I’ll do everything to
make you leave Drake.

664
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:34,526
What did I do to
deserve this, Drake?

665
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:38,058
Why are you hurting me so badly?

666
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:41,737
Why are you laughing
at my husband?

667
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:45,855
“Husband?”

668
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,841
You made me hold on to a
relationship that’s very uncertain.

669
00:41:51,213 --> 00:41:52,715
Today, we’re okay.

670
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:54,198
Tomorrow, we’re not.

671
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:56,128
The next day, we’re okay again.

672
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:57,721
Why, Drake?

673
00:41:58,638 --> 00:42:00,472
I’m so tired.

674
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:02,687
Drake?

675
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,683
My gosh, I just had
so much fun with you, Drake.

676
00:42:09,977 --> 00:42:11,520
Am I hard to love?

677
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:15,229
Why do you keep
hurting me over and over?

678
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:27,347
This is supposed to be
the happiest night of my life.

679
00:42:27,817 --> 00:42:28,817
My debut.

680
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:31,690
I don’t deserve this, Drake.

681
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,070
Drake!

682
00:42:34,095 --> 00:42:36,639
This can’t be happening,
it’s my birthday today!

683
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:38,997
Drake!

684
00:43:04,075 --> 00:43:05,831
Thank you so much, Tripp.

685
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:09,175
Stop thanking me. You’ve
said it too many times already.

686
00:43:18,543 --> 00:43:20,261
Still, I want to thank you.

687
00:43:21,384 --> 00:43:22,925
That’s your last “thank you”.

688
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,339
I don’t want to hear it again.

689
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,222
What do you want
me to say instead?

690
00:43:28,441 --> 00:43:29,487
“I’m sorry?”

691
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:32,417
No.

692
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:35,683
Next time, I want
to see you smiling.

693
00:43:37,546 --> 00:43:39,548
Smile for me?

694
00:43:55,593 --> 00:43:57,511
Thank you so much for coming!

695
00:43:57,511 --> 00:43:58,387
Please eat!

696
00:43:58,387 --> 00:43:59,430
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

697
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,183
-Thank you for coming, thank you!
-Happy birthday, Alys!

698
00:44:02,725 --> 00:44:03,836
Mom!

699
00:44:03,885 --> 00:44:05,494
Oh, hi!

700
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:06,979
You remember Uncle Allan?

701
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:07,997
Of course!

702
00:44:08,022 --> 00:44:09,273
Hi, Uncle Allan!

703
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:11,025
- Thank you for coming.
- Happy birthday, dear.

704
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:12,585
Enjoy your dinner.

705
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,519
Mom, I’m just gonna go
say hi to my friends again.

706
00:44:14,544 --> 00:44:15,463
- Okay?
- Okay, go ahead.

707
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:16,656
Alright, see you later!

708
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:19,409
Thank you for coming!

709
00:44:21,243 --> 00:44:22,243
Hello?

710
00:44:23,576 --> 00:44:24,576
Okay.

711
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:32,159
Where’s your boyfriend?

712
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:35,800
I don’t know, okay?

713
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:37,818
Let’s just talk
about it next time.

714
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:40,721
You know, if he’s being
such a jerk towards you,

715
00:44:40,807 --> 00:44:41,862
ditch him.

716
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:43,190
You’re my sister.

717
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:45,017
You deserve
nothing but the best.

718
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:48,628
You really are mature
for your age, Dane.

719
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:51,941
I don’t wanna see you crying, Alys.

720
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:55,190
We rarely see each other,
then you’ll cry in front of me.

721
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:56,394
Where would that put me?

722
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:59,156
I’m not crying!

723
00:45:04,328 --> 00:45:06,370
Yeah. And who are
you fooling, anyway?

724
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:09,526
When will you tell me
where’s that noble boyfriend of yours?

725
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:15,026
- Hey, don’t tell Mom—
- You know what –

726
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:16,769
as your only brother,

727
00:45:17,425 --> 00:45:19,318
if he’s hurting you that bad,

728
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:21,429
don’t you think it’s time to
forget him and move on?

729
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:24,139
Hey, Dane.

730
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:27,326
Who’s older between us?
You or me?

731
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:29,562
I’m just reminding you –
you’re only fourteen!

732
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:32,183
Whatever.

733
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:33,315
I’ll look for Felice.

734
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:37,403
Look at him, he left me here.

735
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:56,964
Bestie!

736
00:45:57,381 --> 00:45:58,174
Bestie!

737
00:45:58,199 --> 00:45:59,133
Alys!

738
00:45:59,158 --> 00:46:00,109
Hey!

739
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:02,178
You’re really gorgeous tonight!

740
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:04,013
Am I beautiful just
for tonight?

741
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:04,972
Well, that’s a pity.

742
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:06,115
Yes, only for tonight.

743
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,683
You too, huh?

744
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:10,895
- Wow, I’m a comedian now!
- Happy birthday again, Alys!

745
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:12,855
- Happy birthday, Alys!
- Happy birthday, Alys!

746
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,772
- Thank you!
- Hope you had fun!

747
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:16,998
I had fun.

748
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:18,586
Hey, Sheen,
thank Kei for me—

749
00:46:18,611 --> 00:46:20,362
she even sent a
gift from Russia.

750
00:46:20,387 --> 00:46:21,451
Oh, wow!

751
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:23,924
Who would have thought

752
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,990
that you will be friends
with the other bestie.

753
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:28,428
“Bestie?!”

754
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:29,328
Yes, Bestie!

755
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,826
- Bestie-friends now, see?
- Yeah, yeah.

756
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,264
Alys…

757
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:34,393
Alys…

758
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:35,433
Hey, Tripp.

759
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:38,421
Can we talk?

760
00:46:39,882 --> 00:46:41,675
Aren’t we already talking?

761
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:43,889
No, I mean...

762
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:45,767
...outside.

763
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:49,141
Okay.

764
00:46:49,183 --> 00:46:51,232
Can we grab something
to eat first, is that okay?

765
00:46:51,663 --> 00:46:52,770
- Okay.
- Okay.

766
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:56,576
We’ll just eat.

767
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:58,350
Alright!

768
00:47:01,612 --> 00:47:03,906
Tripp, where are you taking me?

769
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:13,873
Tripp.

770
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:15,792
Just follow the light.

771
00:47:20,928 --> 00:47:22,800
He prepared that for you, Zyril.

772
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:26,720
I’ll head back upstairs.

773
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:31,976
When he explained himself
and you really don’t want anymore,

774
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:35,568
you know where to find me.

775
00:48:46,892 --> 00:48:47,976
Happy birthday.

776
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:51,565
Hopefully, I’m still not late.

777
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,475
Thank you for coming!

778
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:26,547
Hello?

779
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:28,950
Okay.

780
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,826
What do you want from me, Drake?

781
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:50,239
Thanks for coming.

782
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:53,367
For old times’ sake,

783
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:55,869
help me out, Tripp.

784
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:58,947
I really messed up with Alys.

785
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:02,917
At least you know.

786
00:50:03,961 --> 00:50:05,045
So please,

787
00:50:06,857 --> 00:50:08,217
I’m asking you as family –

788
00:50:08,856 --> 00:50:10,149
bring Alys here.

789
00:50:10,718 --> 00:50:12,594
She won’t answer my calls.

790
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:20,243
I love her, Tripp.

791
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:26,275
I really, really love Alys.

792
00:50:35,325 --> 00:50:36,452
I’ll try.

793
00:50:38,454 --> 00:50:39,455
Thank you.

794
00:51:03,888 --> 00:51:04,888
I’m really sorry, Alys.

795
00:51:06,774 --> 00:51:07,774
I’m making up to you.

796
00:51:31,215 --> 00:51:33,092
I hope she can forgive me.

797
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:35,843
I really messed up this time.

798
00:51:36,251 --> 00:51:37,717
I cannot lose you, Alys.

799
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:46,740
On the next episode of
Seducing Drake Palma.

800
00:51:47,898 --> 00:51:48,990
So, how’s the single life?

801
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:51,139
It’s been a week, huh?

802
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:53,490
How is it going?

803
00:51:53,975 --> 00:51:55,639
- Like this.
- Ouch.

804
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,928
Good morning, Alys.

805
00:51:59,628 --> 00:52:01,087
No more Drake talks, okay?

806
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:02,975
I’m moving on!

807
00:52:03,122 --> 00:52:04,122
Tripp!

808
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:06,652
- Tripp, hello!
- Here comes this squid again!

809
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:09,521
Oh, Alys.
You’re here, too.

810
00:52:09,795 --> 00:52:11,289
I didn’t notice you.

811
00:52:11,314 --> 00:52:13,942
Uh, Zy, have you eaten?

812
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:18,320
What’s your passcode?

813
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:19,780
Come on, let’s eat.

814
00:52:19,805 --> 00:52:20,857
I’ll whisper it to you.

815
00:52:21,682 --> 00:52:22,725
What?

816
00:52:22,933 --> 00:52:23,982
1-1-3-1?

817
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:26,100
Why’d you shout it out?
