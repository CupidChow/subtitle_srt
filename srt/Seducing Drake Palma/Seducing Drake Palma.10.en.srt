Previously on
Seducing Drake Palma.

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,630
Lord, please let me
meet some friends.

3
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,215
Even just one!

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,011
Do you have a partner yet?

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,262
- How about us instead?
- Huh?

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,414
I have a boyfriend!

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,929
Wait, Drake!

8
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:18,968
Ahhh!

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,564
No, I meant for the
Freshman Walk.

10
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,015
Do you have a partner yet?

11
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,257
Do you want to pair up?

12
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,403
Ouch, Drake!

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,031
Who’s that?

14
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:33,907
That’s Shaira.

15
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,411
So, how’s my husband?

16
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,997
You know, you look different.

17
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,124
More matured, more...

18
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:43,793
mysterious?

19
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,937
Tss.

20
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,098
Don’t worry.

21
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,922
I got you.

22
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,012
Tripp?

23
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,179
This is safe.

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,639
You’re really sure?

25
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,699
What the heck?!

26
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,879
Are you ready?

27
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,075
Let’s go!

28
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,146
Don’t speed up!

29
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,190
Tripp, that’s enough!

30
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,699
Right?

31
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,873
Alys!

32
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,231
You’re too cute!

33
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:24,267
Stop it!

34
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,044
- Wait, you’re really cute!
- Alys!

35
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,172
Why are you laughing
at my husband?

36
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,617
“Husband?”

37
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,797
Yeah.

38
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,353
My husband.

39
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,063
Why are you with him?

40
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,187
You’re married?

41
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,152
Well, actually –

42
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,177
Shut up.

43
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,865
Wait, who are you?

44
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,283
I’m Shaira.

45
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,785
Drake’s wife.

46
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,220
Drake!

47
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:04,245
What?

48
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,666
What?

49
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,088
She’s the wife?
Then I’m just a girlfriend?

50
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,152
Something doesn’t add up here!

51
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:15,488
Why am I even explaining myself?

52
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:18,716
Go home and rest.

53
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,725
But I can’t sleep!

54
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,706
Why would it be Drake’s
problem, who is my boyfriend,

55
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,233
if she can’t sleep?

56
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,641
What is with this girl?

57
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,529
Come on, Drake.

58
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,713
Drake –

59
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,753
Ahh!

60
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:39,270
Oh my ankle,

61
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,703
it hurts so bad, Drake!

62
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,038
And here’s my boyfriend,

63
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,416
helping the “wife”.

64
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,543
What is happening?

65
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,629
We just ended up in different
schools, and this is what happens?

66
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,090
Drake, can you accompany me?

67
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,676
My ankle is killing me!

68
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,027
What is happening?

69
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:16,529
There’s definitely a
conspiracy going on!

70
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,488
Ugh! Annoying!

71
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,534
Is he cheating on me?

72
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,574
And in the unit next door, seriously?

73
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,964
I know that Drake can be
dense and blunt, but...

74
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:37,782
I never thought
he’d be a two-timer.

75
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:51,652
Great, Alys.

76
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,276
I know your brain is weak,

77
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,886
but in a situation like this,

78
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:59,470
at least think about your pride.

79
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,620
You can save some of it sometimes.

80
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,845
Drake said he’d take me home

81
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,431
because my place is
far from his condo.

82
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,284
Well, it didn’t happen.

83
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,227
He seems busy with his “wife”.

84
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:16,998
What will happen to me
as his girlfriend?

85
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,377
Why did the picky girl
end up here?

86
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,705
Here he goes again.

87
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,363
You want some? Mmm.

88
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,614
Yuck, gross!

89
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,134
You just sipped from that and
now you’re handing it to me?

90
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,681
I was right to call
you “the picky girl”.

91
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,299
Why are you even here?

92
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,651
Because...

93
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,830
Because?

94
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,236
Because I had a
fight with my boyfriend.

95
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,371
He keeps prioritizing
that girl over me—

96
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,619
his actual girlfriend!

97
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,959
That’s what’s difficult
with you women.

98
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,978
You jump to conclusions.

99
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,880
You don’t want to
look for reasons.

100
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,267
Alys, don’t let your eyes wander.

101
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:35,587
Concentrate on the face.

102
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,353
So, why did he leave you?

103
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:42,075
Because the girl
twisted her ankle.

104
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,712
That’s what I’m saying.

105
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,111
Okay, let’s say it’s me,

106
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,990
and your boyfriend is here,

107
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,427
and I’m dying, and
he’s not even scratched—

108
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,473
who are you going to?

109
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:54,082
That’s a wild example!

110
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,415
Of course I’d pick you!

111
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,126
See? That’s all it is!

112
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,461
Even so, I’m
still his girlfriend.

113
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,861
You’re impossible to talk to.

114
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,300
You only think like that because
you don’t have a girlfriend.

115
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:08,085
Oh, wow.

116
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,470
I don’t have one now,

117
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:13,366
but who knows?
I might have soon.

118
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,393
Why? Are you courting someone?

119
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,146
Courting? That’s so outdated!

120
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,272
Playboy!

121
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,245
Playboy? I don’t
even have a girlfriend.

122
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,045
I’ve never even had a girlfriend.

123
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,323
That’s a wild accusation.

124
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,383
Tss.

125
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:33,152
Why am I even bothering
to talk to this Tripp guy?

126
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,830
I might get influenced
by his bullying.

127
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,850
Alys, where are you going?

128
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,432
I’m going home.

129
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,190
What? It’s already 10 PM.

130
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,034
That’s dangerous!

131
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,604
It’s fine, I’ll just hail a cab.

132
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:52,511
Alys, I’m not letting you go
home alone this late, okay?

133
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,916
- Can you slow down a bit?
- What?!

134
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,612
I said slow down!

135
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,463
What?

136
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,448
I said slow down!

137
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,451
That one again?

138
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,345
Chill, I’ll slow down.

139
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,393
I’ll just change.

140
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,101
Oh my God.

141
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,463
Tripp Marco!

142
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,923
Hang on, Miss Perez!

143
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,633
Let me off here,
right now!

144
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,276
Let me off right here!

145
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,054
Okay, sure, if you say so.

146
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,805
I’m easy to talk to.

147
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,505
Ouch!

148
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,643
Ouch!

149
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,815
It’s like I’m always about
to die when I’m with you!

150
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,182
Do you think you’re in a race
when you’re driving?

151
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,765
And you’re hitting me
like you’re my girlfriend—

152
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,089
If I were your girlfriend,
you’d be in bigger trouble!

153
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,393
I seriously thought I
was going to die earlier!

154
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:06,495
Ouch.

155
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,129
Bye!

156
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,627
Drake?

157
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,551
What are you doing here?

158
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:54,839
Did I tell you to leave?

159
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:55,987
Hmm?

160
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,690
If I didn’t tell you to
leave, then don’t leave!

161
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,909
Because you’re with your “wife!”

162
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,815
Are you jealous?

163
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,042
Why would I be jealous?

164
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,057
I’m way too cute to get jealous
over that squid-looking girl.

165
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,112
Why are you laughing?

166
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,071
What’s funny?

167
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:15,823
You. You’re funny.

168
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:22,323
What’s going on?

169
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,041
And in the unit next door, seriously?

170
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,209
Is he cheating on me?

171
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:30,229
Go home. I’m not feeling well.

172
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,380
We’ll just end up fighting.

173
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,983
Seriously, let me go!

174
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,551
If you don’t have
anything sensible to say,

175
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:37,233
just go home and let go of me!

176
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,641
I hate explaining things.

177
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,811
How am I supposed to
understand if you don’t explain?

178
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,612
She’s nothing to me, okay?

179
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,486
You’re my girlfriend.

180
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,047
Why do I feel like this?

181
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,824
I don’t feel like I’m
his girlfriend, not once.

182
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,951
We don’t even hold hands.

183
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:04,664
It’s like Alys and
Drake—just two people.

184
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,223
There’s no “us”.

185
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,393
Are you still mad?

186
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,190
Go home.

187
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,347
You’re mad.

188
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,440
Well, you know that I’m mad!

189
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,159
Why are you even asking?!

190
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,569
I’m asking because I’m
trying to understand you.

191
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,887
Can’t you give me some credits for trying?

192
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,222
Drake, we’ve been dating for months now!

193
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,824
What?

194
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,036
You know what’s funny?
It feels like we’re nothing.

195
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,284
This is like a joke.

196
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:29,362
Do you get it?

197
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,759
Why are you mad?

198
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:32,233
Okay, let’s go through it one by one.

199
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,636
Wait, no—it’s really
just one reason.

200
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,737
Because I feel you don’t
take me seriously.

201
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,172
What made you think
that I’m not serious?

202
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,526
Hello? Why am I only finding
out now that you have a wife?

203
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,828
Do you honestly
think that I’ll date you

204
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,339
if I’m already married?

205
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,207
Are you that dumb?

206
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:47,581
Fine, I’m dumb!

207
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,862
Is it my fault I’m dumb
when it comes to you?!

208
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,300
Sorry, I just like
you this much!

209
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,448
You’re such a noob, noob.

210
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,628
Then explain to this noob—
who was that girl earlier?

211
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,620
Her name is Shaira
and don’t mind her.

212
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,620
Then why did you help her?
Why are you like that?

213
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,401
I was trying to be a gentleman.

214
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,690
You’re not even a gentleman.

215
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,136
Precisely why I was trying.

216
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,667
Before, I thought
all girls were dumb.

217
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,776
But then I met you.

218
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,386
And I realized
that I was wrong.

219
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,659
I’ll only say this once.

220
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,188
I’m falling.

221
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,317
I’m almost there.

222
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,677
Look who’s here?

223
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,488
Ugh!

224
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,808
I forgot that this squid-like girl lives in
the same condo as Drake!

225
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:30,527
What now?

226
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,064
What are you? Drake’s groupie?

227
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,285
No, I am not Drake’s groupie.

228
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,277
I’m his girlfriend.

229
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,160
Is there something
funny about what I said?

230
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,969
Is it funny that I’m
Drake’s girlfriend?

231
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,856
What’s wrong with this squid?

232
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,751
Oh my gosh, she’s
delusional—“girlfriend,” seriously?!

233
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:56,965
I’m going to cry.

234
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,684
Pardon my reaction—it’s
just that you’re actually really funny.

235
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,160
Who are you again?

236
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,010
Alys Perez.

237
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,740
It was nice meeting you, Alys,

238
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,936
but I don’t really shake
random stranger’s hands.

239
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,855
Don’t take it personal, though.

240
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:22,443
It’s not even been a
week since I met this girl,

241
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,990
and she’s already jumped
to the top of my hate list.

242
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,426
What are you doing here, anyway?

243
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,090
Oh, Drake and I have a date.

244
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,379
“Date”?

245
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,749
Stop daydreaming... again.

246
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,252
Dates aren’t Drake’s thing.

247
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,338
Well now, it’s his thing.

248
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,527
Hi, Drake, good morning!

249
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,678
Hi, Drakey baby!

250
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,637
Why are you here?

251
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,465
We have a date, remember?

252
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,142
I messaged you on soc-med.

253
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,309
Ah.

254
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,437
Let’s go?

255
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,107
Give me a minute.

256
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,035
I told you so.

257
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,510
Dates are our thing.

258
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,723
Ha-ha-ha.

259
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,715
Whatever!

260
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,931
Gosh, Drake’s books are
making me dizzy.

261
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,143
but they’re kind of
the same as Tripp’s.

262
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,317
Why am I even thinking
about Tripp Marco?

263
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:42,124
He’s so annoying,

264
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,109
always asking me to
treat him at the café.

265
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,824
Do I look like his wallet?

266
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,887
Should I answer this?

267
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,465
What is it?

268
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,418
Good morning to you too, Alys!

269
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,527
What do you want now?

270
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,676
I need a date tomorrow.

271
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,590
I’m busy. Bye!

272
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,762
Wow, after I dropped you
off last night, this is what I get?

273
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,154
You’re unfair,
that’s blackmail.

274
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,348
Come on, go with me tomorrow,
I just need someone with me!

275
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,972
Where is that anyway?

276
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,074
There’s an art exhibit
in QC tomorrow.

277
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,520
Come with me.

278
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,794
Don’t you have other friends?

279
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:47,297
None. Just you.

280
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,094
Why was I born
with a kind heart?

281
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,848
Fine!

282
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,067
You’ll go with me?

283
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,475
Pick me up tomorrow.
All expenses paid, okay?

284
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,863
Bye!

285
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:07,426
I’m turning off my phone
so Drake and I won’t be disturbed.

286
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,856
It’s our day.

287
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,379
Just Drake and Alys and love!

288
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,787
My boyfriend’s so handsome.

289
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,124
Good thing I’m cute!

290
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,817
Tss.

291
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,434
What did I do this time?

292
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,137
You’re staring.
It’s creeping me out.

293
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,848
It’s because you’re handsome.

294
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,668
You’re only dating me because
of my face. Wicked Alys.

295
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,449
Well, that’s just a bonus.

296
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,543
I like you because...

297
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:46,856
I like you.

298
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,027
Need I say more?

299
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,879
Let’s go.

300
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,918
Okay.

301
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,824
Wait.

302
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,328
I thought we’re leaving.

303
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,640
What’s that?

304
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,598
Hold my hand.

305
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:06,099
Huh?

306
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,747
You said I lack affection, right?

307
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:10,773
Hold my hand.

308
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,798
Let’s go.

309
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:17,471
Lord, what did I do to
feel this much giddiness?

310
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:20,908
Way to go, Alys!

311
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,936
Next time,
intertwined fingers is my goal.

312
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,503
Oh my gosh, he chose me over
that squid-like girl.

313
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,863
This is remarkable!

314
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,491
I feel giddy.

315
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,646
Hi, Drake!

316
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,887
Mind if I join you?

317
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,691
You won’t mind, right?

318
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,468
I’m just so, so, so, bored!

319
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:58,208
Silence means yes, right?

320
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,426
I’m so excited! Let’s go!

321
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,854
So, where are we going?

322
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,440
To hell, you want to join?

323
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:15,426
Excuse me, did you say
anything of importance?

324
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,169
Didn’t think so.

325
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:28,598
I’m so excited for today, we’re
gonna have so, so much fun!

326
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:33,090
Oh my.

327
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:34,606
What are you looking at?
Hey!

328
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,090
Wait!

329
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,681
Of course, I won’t let my
dignity be stepped on.

330
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,975
So, I got in the shotgun
seat right away.

331
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,161
This is the girlfriend’s seat.

332
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,239
She can’t take it from me.

333
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,423
Shaira.

334
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,465
Yes, hubby?

335
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,301
Can you please
check if the tire is flat?

336
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,952
Of course, anything for you.

337
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,623
Why did Drake ask her to check?

338
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,666
Couldn’t it have been me?

339
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,045
I know how to check a
flat tire too, you know.

340
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:17,919
Wait!

341
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,593
What about Shaira?

342
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,236
Drake!

343
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,661
Wait!

344
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:24,231
What the heck?!

345
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:30,309
Ugh!

346
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,035
Why did you leave Shaira?

347
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,567
She’s annoying.

348
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,544
What if she gets mad?

349
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:51,458
I don’t care. I can
handle her being mad at me.

350
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,379
I can’t handle you
not talking to me.

351
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,649
You’re ugly!

352
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,708
Weirdo!

353
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,177
You’re annoying, you’re ugly.

354
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,278
You’re making me feel giddy.

355
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,895
It's my job after all.

356
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,154
Drake, are we eating here?

357
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,035
Hey, where are we going?

358
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,589
Where are we eating?

359
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,583
I’m so hungry.

360
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,172
Where are we eating?

361
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,997
I’m tired.

362
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,075
Don’t use that face on me.

363
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,184
I won’t give you a
ride inside this mall.

364
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,402
What face?

365
00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:01,427
That face –

366
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,573
puppy eyes, pouty lips –

367
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,551
it’s adorable, but stop it.

368
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,387
I won’t give you a piggy back ride.

369
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,678
Tss.

370
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,703
Fine!

371
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,417
[in Japanese] Welcome!

372
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,073
There you go, a great
place for us to eat.

373
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,607
After all that walking,

374
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,067
only ramen will satisfy you.

375
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,237
It’s delicious.

376
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,393
You really love ramen, don’t you?

377
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,994
Oh right, I was gonna
ask for his number.

378
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:53,432
How do I even do this?

379
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,290
It’s embarrassing,

380
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,710
I’m the girl, and I’m the
one asking for his number.

381
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,173
Um, Drake...

382
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,632
Mmm?

383
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:08,320
Can I ask for...?

384
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,987
Your Pork Tonkatsu Ramen.

385
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,892
Prawn Tempura Rice Bowl.

386
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:19,905
Enjoy your food!

387
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,737
Ramen is really Drake’s favorite.

388
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,699
Ramen is all it takes for him
to give in.

389
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,979
I’ll ask Aunt Liana to teach me
when she gets back from abroad.

390
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,223
For all I know,

391
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:40,210
his “almost there” could
suddenly become “already there”.

392
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,284
Come on, let’s go this way!

393
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,065
Let’s go here instead!

394
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,971
Imagine you’re punching
that squid-like girl.

395
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:12,174
Who?

396
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:13,993
Secret.

397
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,003
You’re really a noob.

398
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,930
Why can’t I shoot?

399
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,826
You’re cheating!

400
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,060
It’s too far!

401
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,581
Stop!

402
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,074
3...2...1!

403
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,704
Come on, jump!

404
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,915
Jump!

405
00:25:45,705 --> 00:25:47,499
Wait, let’s jump together!

406
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,696
What the hell?

407
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,385
He kissed me?

408
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,224
Oh my gosh!

409
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,748
Miss?

410
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,399
Yes?

411
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,917
Did you take a video?

412
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:55,488
Uhm, which one – when
you fell, or when you kissed?

413
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:56,930
All of it.

414
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,592
Yes.

415
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,968
Can you AirShare it?

416
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,164
Sure!

417
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,360
Thank you!

418
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,907
Miss, can you delete it?

419
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,423
Miss, can you delete it?

420
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,118
Okay.

421
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,766
Let me see.

422
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,454
Very good, thank you!

423
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,774
- Wow.
- Tea.

424
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,829
Thank you!

425
00:27:57,401 --> 00:27:59,487
You’ve been all smiles
for a while now.

426
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:06,199
I’m on the way, where are you?

427
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:13,908
I won’t ride your motorcycle, FYI.

428
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,488
Wow, bestie,
you’re improving.

429
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,180
Your fingers are practically
worn out from texting.

430
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,326
Are you texting Drake?

431
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,211
I wish I was just
talking to Drake instead.

432
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,249
Okay, that’s your story to tell.

433
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,753
I can go until 3:00 PM.

434
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:38,590
I have practical test tomorrow,
I need to practice.

435
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:41,271
By the way, how’s SCA?

436
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:45,813
Hey.

437
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:48,308
I asked how’s SCA?

438
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,561
It’s okay.

439
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,380
“Okay”?

440
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,778
Bestie, I don’t want
to be there anymore.

441
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,901
Everyone’s so
smart, I can’t keep up!

442
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:08,114
Why, is it that hard?

443
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:12,677
I thought that clothing technology
would be easy, but…

444
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:15,145
Bestie,

445
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,964
it's just our first week and we’re
already submitting portfolios –

446
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,677
due next week!

447
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,402
You can do it, bestie!

448
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:26,136
Bestie, I really can’t – I
can’t do this anymore!

449
00:29:26,638 --> 00:29:29,743
Didn’t you say you wanted to be
a fashion designer like my mom?

450
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:31,098
You got this, come on!

451
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:37,068
Who would’ve thought being
a designer was this hard?

452
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:41,029
I thought it was just drawing
here, there, everywhere –

453
00:29:41,054 --> 00:29:42,107
that easy.

454
00:29:48,197 --> 00:29:49,532
Oh, Kent texted –

455
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:52,873
he and Sheen are waiting for me.

456
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,225
I’m going now.

457
00:29:54,382 --> 00:29:56,310
Wait, let me just fix my things.

458
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,947
In all fairness, huh?

459
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:10,856
It’s only been a week since we started
college, and you’re becoming more girly.

460
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:11,942
It’s weird.

461
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:15,246
Is it because you’re in love?

462
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,349
Alys, you’re so annoying!

463
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:19,392
I’m going!

464
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,177
Wait.

465
00:30:24,837 --> 00:30:26,422
I want to go with you.

466
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,839
Next time, okay?
Don’t you have plans?

467
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:30,787
Well, maybe I can say

468
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,818
I suddenly have to go
somewhere.

469
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,390
Up to you!

470
00:30:34,524 --> 00:30:35,755
Are you coming or not?

471
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:41,965
You’re taking so long to decide.

472
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,927
Okay then, I’ll leave you here.

473
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:47,403
Bye, bestie. Love you!

474
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,722
Bye. Love you.

475
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,739
Hey, Princess!

476
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,685
Daddy!

477
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:03,653
Daddy!

478
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,838
How are you?

479
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,990
- Is that for me?
- Yeah, for you, of course!

480
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,049
Thank you, Dad!

481
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,591
What brings you here?

482
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:12,262
Oh, you and Aunt
Liana fought again, huh?

483
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,664
No, we didn’t fight.

484
00:31:14,856 --> 00:31:20,061
Actually, I went home to ask you
how was your first week in school.

485
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:21,732
So, was it okay?

486
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:27,669
School was fine.

487
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,572
“Fine”?

488
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,911
I mean, nothing superb?

489
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,253
I don’t know, Daddy.

490
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:36,738
My friends aren’t there.

491
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:40,888
School feels kinds of lonely
without my friends around.

492
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:46,854
Make friends.

493
00:31:48,495 --> 00:31:50,664
Believe me, you’ll be fine.

494
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:53,827
Okay?

495
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:56,154
Anyways,

496
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,142
another reason why
I’m home is because

497
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,224
I wanna ask about your debut.

498
00:32:03,183 --> 00:32:04,183
What do you want?

499
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,183
OMG!

500
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:09,796
Alys?

501
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,846
Huh?

502
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:17,583
I said, what do you
want for your birthday?

503
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:20,038
Your Aunt Liana wants to know.

504
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,233
Daddy really loves Aunt Liana

505
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,110
even though they
don’t have kids.

506
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,046
I wish they did.

507
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,949
Talking to baby Dane
gets tiring sometimes.

508
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,554
Um, I don’t really know yet.

509
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,413
You don’t know?

510
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,973
Okay.

511
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,542
When you figure it out,
tell me, okay?

512
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,796
I’m sure your mom’s going to
plan something for your birthday.

513
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:50,593
And what I want to give you is something
you wouldn’t expect to receive.

514
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,820
Okay, Daddy.

515
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,629
Okay?

516
00:32:53,654 --> 00:32:54,739
- Okay.
- Deal, huh?

517
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,804
Mhm.

518
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:58,332
Ma’am Alys, Tripp
is here to see you.

519
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,426
Who’s Tripp?

520
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:04,843
A friend of mine, Daddy.

521
00:33:05,802 --> 00:33:07,095
A friend, you say.

522
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:09,537
Well,

523
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,788
I want to meet this “friend.”

524
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,483
Uncle Cyriel?

525
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,419
Oh, Tripp!

526
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,437
- Uncle.
- So it’s you!

527
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,422
- Hello.
- How are you?

528
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,589
I’m good. How are you?

529
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,608
Wait, do you know Alys?

530
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,819
Yes. How about you?

531
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,843
She’s my daughter.

532
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:36,905
Oh!

533
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,249
Small world, Uncle!

534
00:33:39,462 --> 00:33:40,515
Small world!

535
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,620
So, why are you here?

536
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,897
Uhm...

537
00:33:44,495 --> 00:33:47,921
Alys and I are going to
check out the art exhibit in QC.

538
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,670
Oh, okay.

539
00:33:50,804 --> 00:33:52,851
So, you pursued Fine Arts?

540
00:33:52,876 --> 00:33:54,382
Uh, no, Uncle.

541
00:33:54,477 --> 00:33:55,383
No, Uncle.

542
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,897
I took Business Ad –
as my dad specifically ordered.

543
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,397
We’re going just to unwind.

544
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,616
Wow!

545
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,663
So he’s close with Dad?

546
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,840
Tripp is close to my Daddy Cyriel.

547
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,259
Drake is close to my Dad Andy.

548
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,597
Wow, what’s next –
Sheen is close with Mommy?

549
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,036
Alright then.

550
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:21,104
Sweetheart, sorry, I’ve got
another appointment, okay?

551
00:34:21,242 --> 00:34:22,118
Okay, Daddy.

552
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,019
- Sorry.
- Thank you for coming.

553
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,772
Tell Dana and Andy
I’ll be back tomorrow.

554
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,748
Okay.

555
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,815
- Okay?
- Okay.

556
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,375
- Tripp...
- Uncle.

557
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,894
You take good care
of my daughter, alright?

558
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,624
- Of course, Uncle.
- Alright, bye.

559
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:34,129
Bye, sweetheart.

560
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:36,350
- Thank you, Daddy, bye. Love you.
- Bye.

561
00:34:51,513 --> 00:34:52,398
Ouch!

562
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,483
That hurts!

563
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,675
You’re such an Amazon!

564
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,735
What Amazon are you
talking about?

565
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,111
You’re the one acting all close!

566
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,530
Why are you close with my Daddy?

567
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,843
Well, our dads are
business partners, okay?

568
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,757
Stop hitting!

569
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,343
You’re really like an Amazon!

570
00:35:06,913 --> 00:35:08,081
Why did you just get here now?

571
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,671
I’ve been waiting for you.

572
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,116
You said you didn’t
like my motorbike,

573
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,100
so I went home first,
that’s why it took longer.

574
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,694
Did you wait?

575
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,014
And holy cayote!

576
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,582
Did he just try to charm me?

577
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,561
No, it’s fine.

578
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,562
Let’s go!

579
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,587
Let’s go.

580
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:52,883
Shall we?

581
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,609
After you.

582
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:13,215
Show off.

583
00:36:13,678 --> 00:36:16,306
Drake’s car is still
my forever favorite.

584
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,102
Ready?

585
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,272
How was your first week?

586
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,069
Your cousin Tripp,
I thought...

587
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,954
you’d go to same school
and he’d be your classmate.

588
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,208
But he went to Brenford.

589
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,405
Are you two talking?

590
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:54,937
Why would I?

591
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:56,022
Are we close?

592
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,608
Come on, Drake,
Tripp is your cousin.

593
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,405
Why are you two
fighting? Fix that.

594
00:37:15,097 --> 00:37:17,585
I’m not angry,
I just don’t care.

595
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,820
But, Drake, you’re cousins
– make peace already.

596
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,827
If you’re upset, fix it!

597
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:25,036
I’m not upset, what else
can’t you understand?

598
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:28,365
If you two don’t talk,
and we’re at a reunion,

599
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,207
and your mom finds out,
what will she think?

600
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,405
She’ll be sad.

601
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,792
I don’t care.

602
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,294
Oh, I know.

603
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,588
It’s about Shaira.

604
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,197
She wasn’t even your girlfriend.

605
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,177
She never said yes.

606
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,012
And you guys
were in sixth grade.

607
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,197
And now you have a girlfriend.

608
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,486
That was ages ago!

609
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:52,455
Tss.

610
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,203
Drake!

611
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,206
You left me yesterday!

612
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,417
Drake, why did you leave me?

613
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,156
I was with my girlfriend.

614
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,828
You got to be kidding me.

615
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,259
Drake, you know I’ve been waiting
for you for since like forever.

616
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,320
I didn’t even date anyone
because I only liked you.

617
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,867
And then now you’re going
to tell that you already have Alys?

618
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,984
Drake, that is so unfair!
What the heck?

619
00:38:34,743 --> 00:38:36,218
Are you serious with her?

620
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:41,249
See?

621
00:38:41,274 --> 00:38:42,773
You’re not even sure.

622
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,163
That means I still have a chance!

623
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:01,472
Now what?

624
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,507
You didn’t want to stay earlier.
Now, you don’t want to leave.

625
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,801
Shhh! Keep quiet!

626
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,699
It’s beautiful.

627
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,452
Isn’t it great?

628
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,412
Shhh!

629
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,081
It’s happening again.

630
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:25,607
But you know what,
you’re really good.

631
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,676
It’s my first time seeing a
gallery with that kind of concept.

632
00:40:28,701 --> 00:40:30,386
- It’s beautiful, right?
- Your photos are amazing!

633
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,012
- Told you so!
- Legit. You weren’t lying.

634
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,058
No, not really.
It’s no big deal.

635
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,472
You’re being humble!

636
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,878
- Seriously.
- You know what?

637
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,020
Drake?

638
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,485
Oh my gosh, I just have so
much fun with you, Drake!

639
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,370
Here’s our ride.

640
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,597
Such a gentleman.

641
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,894
Oopsies!

642
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,745
Come on, jump!

643
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:38,855
Jump!

644
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:43,808
Wait, let’s jump together!

645
00:41:46,595 --> 00:41:47,628
Wait.

646
00:42:00,173 --> 00:42:02,300
I’ve never seen her this happy.

647
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:06,327
And this makes me happy, too.

648
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:15,407
I’m almost there, Alys.
Almost there.

649
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,847
On the next episode of
Seducing Drake Palma.

650
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:41,442
I shouldn’t even ask him, right?

651
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:44,691
Drama doesn’t suit you.

652
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,011
You’re an Amazon, remember?

653
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,401
One question, one answer.

654
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,920
What’s going on
with you and Tripp?

655
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,628
Go on in with your boyfriend.

656
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,340
He’s not my boyfriend.

657
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,019
You said I didn’t know
anything about love problems,

658
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:03,831
so I’m trying to make you laugh.

659
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,550
You’re cousins?!

660
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,376
Our fathers are brothers.

661
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,238
We’re both Palmas –

662
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,097
and both handsome.

663
00:43:12,398 --> 00:43:13,399
You jerk!

664
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,968
After everything I cried to
him about, he’s your cousin?!

665
00:43:16,144 --> 00:43:17,636
Just tell me already!

666
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,726
I knew it, nothing good
ever comes from that Shaira!

667
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:25,269
What makes you say that?

668
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,636
Don’t you know, she and
Drake are always together!
