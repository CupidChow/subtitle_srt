1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,637
13 years ago, it was 2012.

2
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:09,434
I was in college back then…

3
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:11,468
My friend actually challenged me-

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,902
If there’s nothing for you to read,

5
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:14,900
why not write your own story?

6
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:16,626
I was just out on the street back then

7
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,274
my playmates and I were always playing.

8
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:21,515
We were always playing outside –

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,674
playing tag and other chasing games.

10
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,485
I loved anime.

11
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,825
I also really liked K-POP.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,320
Actually, I also used to read Wattpad.

13
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:32,965
We played outside..

14
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:36,302
games like “patintero”, “chinese garter,”

15
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:37,508
and “langit-lupa”.

16
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:39,510
I know I used to play soccer…

17
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:42,382
And I even joined local
singing competition in Canada.

18
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:43,769
I was in school…

19
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,565
I love skateboarding.

20
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:48,148
I’m really into video games,
especially horror ones.

21
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:49,090
I don’t know why.

22
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,605
More on studying, playing, and sleeping.

23
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,405
Because my parents said that-

24
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,982
I need to sleep in the afternoon.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,085
I was just an ordinary student.

26
00:00:57,085 --> 00:00:59,090
I was really focused on my studies.

27
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,065
I thought, why not write some teen fiction?

28
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,212
That’s how I came up with
“Seducing Drake Palma”,

29
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:06,563
which is just sweet and cheesy.

30
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:08,314
That's how I get into "SDP".

31
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:11,365
As an escape from the
really heavy stuff I was writing.

32
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:22,890
Drake Palma?

33
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:24,822
Drake Palma?

34
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:26,537
Drake Palma?

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,582
In 3,2,1.. action!

36
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:55,717
My career started as a writer when
I was in high school.

37
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:58,880
Actually, there’s this really famous story,

38
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:00,657
as in very famous in our school.

39
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:02,038
So I started reading along as well and-

40
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:06,214
I realized why everyone at school
was so hyped about it-

41
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,753
because the story was really interesting.

42
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:09,707
My initial meeting with the director-

43
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:11,905
It was my first time seeing him and,

44
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,946
that’s when I realized that-

45
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:15,697
"Seducing Drake Palma" is in good hands.

46
00:02:15,722 --> 00:02:17,851
Because he asked me so many questions,

47
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,992
about this, about that, about everything.

48
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:21,725
It’s like, you know, as a writer,

49
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:23,665
you want your story to
end up with a director-

50
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,360
who truly cares and really
wants to give their best.

51
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:28,617
After the Metro Manila Film Fest,

52
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,845
I was told that the series would
be “Seducing Drake Palma.”

53
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:35,594
Then I learned, that
this was one of the OG’s.

54
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:36,765
Well, I was honored-

55
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:42,828
because they gave me the material that
I knew had a lot of followers.

56
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:45,475
So there was definitely some pressure,

57
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,165
since it was coming after the
success of “Mutya ng Section E.”

58
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:51,897
It needs to be good.

59
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,062
So that’s why I’m very thankful to Viva,

60
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,994
for offering me this project.

61
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,388
When Ariesa and I met, actually-

62
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,805
she was just smiling.

63
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:01,542
Her personality was so pleasant.

64
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,625
Just from that,

65
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,240
I already felt that she was approachable.

66
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:06,099
It’s the dream and prayer of every writer-

67
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:09,365
to have a director who
will really give their best,

68
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:14,800
so that the story you only once saw
on paper or on Wattpad, on computer,

69
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:17,645
can finally be brought to
life through an adaptation.

70
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:20,080
So it became easy for me to ask questions-

71
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:21,725
like what her non-negotiables were,

72
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:25,000
and which parts really had to
stay to the Wattpad and the book.

73
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,491
I can see that she was very
collaborative and very approachable.

74
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:37,314
Before, there was an interest to
adapt “Seducing Drake Palma”,

75
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:39,310
unfortunately, it didn’t pan out.

76
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:42,320
So when Viva reached out to me about this,

77
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:44,757
I felt a bit nervous.

78
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:46,788
Because for me, casting is important.

79
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:50,971
When I received Rabin and Angela’s photo,

80
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:54,981
I said ‘Ah, this is why “Seducing
Drake Palma” is only happening now–

81
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:57,065
because they we really
waiting for the right cast.

82
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,263
Of course I was surprised,

83
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:01,685
because this is a big break for me.

84
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:04,377
The bosses trusted me with this,

85
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:08,834
so I really have to work
even harder and give my best.

86
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:12,360
Rabin Angeles, regarding him as an actor-

87
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:14,217
I didn’t have a hard time with Rabin,

88
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:15,700
because he really understood the character.

89
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:17,908
Even during the preparation for the series,

90
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,972
already went smoothly.

91
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,569
So when we started filming,

92
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,323
things were a lot easier because
they had already gone through workshops.

93
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:26,135
When I first learned I was going
to play the role of Alys Perez,

94
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:28,605
I couldn’t believe it at first.

95
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:30,948
I don’t know  what to say,

96
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:32,445
"Is this for real, boss?"

97
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,085
That's the first thing I said,

98
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,480
"Is this for real, boss Vic?"

99
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:38,085
During site meeting,

100
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,337
It's like, finally... at last, right?

101
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:45,542
And this is the first time I've
ever been given this major role.

102
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,651
Angela at first, I felt...

103
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,685
like she was a bit
nervous with her character.

104
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,508
But when I brought her in...

105
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:58,788
she immediately got the
Alys that I was imagining.

106
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,851
With just a very light personality.

107
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:04,617
I was really excited, because
his character was good.

108
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:06,897
I think it fits me well,

109
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,182
because his role is very
chill, with a swagger, very cool.

110
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:14,645
I'm very excited to this series
"Seducing Drake Palma."

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,211
I'm so excited because there's so
many ideas that running through my head.

112
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:20,765
Especially when I learned
I will play the role of Aya.

113
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:23,331
While I was reading the book,

114
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:27,194
what I look like here in
"Seducing Drake Palma,"

115
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,977
this is the look I imagine for Aya.

116
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:33,005
Aya's kind of the ice breaker.

117
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,274
She’s the reason why people laugh.

118
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:38,291
They really nailed the
dynamics of best friends.

119
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:39,345
Of course, I'm very happy-

120
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,577
'cause I'm doing
another Wattpad series.

121
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:45,845
You're bringing a
character from a book to life,

122
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,320
so, it's really exciting.

123
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:49,525
When I read the script for Sheen,

124
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,685
I always feel sorry for her character,

125
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,991
because he's always crying.

126
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:54,674
When we did that scene,

127
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:57,040
he and Kei were fighting on the rooftop.

128
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,714
I was so surprised because
her tears actually fell.

129
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:04,257
He gave justice to the character of Sheen.

130
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:05,662
I was excited,

131
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:07,817
overwhelmed in a very good way.

132
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:10,611
I'm happy that this will challenge me.

133
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:12,302
This is a different character.

134
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:14,480
Very fun, it was very fun to play.

135
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,707
It's me, it's me now, this
is Kent Justine Valdez.

136
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:20,165
Let's do this, let's work, let's go.

137
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:24,937
Frost, because Kent is
Aya's love team partner.

138
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:29,345
Imagine a tough girl suddenly
meet a handsome guy,

139
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:33,691
who’s courted her almost
every day, that's laughable.

140
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,897
Kent's character is very funny.

141
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:37,000
I am happy,

142
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:39,951
She’s more on the girly,
"kikay" side and a cheerleader.

143
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:41,805
Another adjustment again.

144
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,622
Rafa as Kei,

145
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:48,137
a rich student who's very posh.

146
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,907
The character fits her perfectly.

147
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:51,820
Many people idolize her,

148
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,337
she’s a figurehead at school.

149
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:55,571
Rafa is also good.

150
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:57,851
I was very nervous,

151
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:00,977
I was really nervous,
because people know me as the mean girl,

152
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,114
who is super over the
top and very dramatic.

153
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:06,988
And now it’s kind of the same
vibe, but with a different kind of fun.

154
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:11,220
Of course, the nervous
excitement is still there.

155
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:15,695
I actually read this book before
when I was still in high school,

156
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,344
that’s why I'm really excited.

157
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,322
Boss Vic is really good at casting.

158
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:22,091
Everyone he cast was perfect for the role.

159
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,188
Mark Anthony Fernandez,

160
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,611
Christopher Roxas,

161
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,754
Lander Vera Perez.

162
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,251
We have Nikka Ruiz, the role of Katrina.

163
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:32,585
Denise Esteban.

164
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,617
It’s no longer hard for
me to motivate them.

165
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:36,127
That's them as a character,

166
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:37,555
and they’re already seasoned actors.

167
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,965
They already know what needs to be done,

168
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,274
very professional.

169
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:43,697
Oh my God, I met Ms. Ariesa,

170
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:46,028
I’m so happy I wanted to jump for joy,

171
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,697
and tha's exactly what I did.

172
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:51,177
It was perfect, I brought the
book and had it signed by her.

173
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:53,480
I asked for an autograph. I was so excited!

174
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:56,508
She was so warm, and so welcoming, and-

175
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,280
I'm very thankful that she
consider me as Tripp Palma.

176
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,085
And I hope she keeps
on writing many stories,

177
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:07,017
because the Wattpad stories
she writes are really good.

178
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:09,800
I worked with Director Cris before,

179
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:13,342
in "Instant Daddy", he
is an amazing director.

180
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,457
I really followed him.

181
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,931
That’s how I am whenever I
have a favorite director or actor.

182
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:25,274
I will keep on following
until he follows me back.

183
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,571
Until now, Director Cris
doesn't follow me back.

184
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:30,331
If Director Cris follows me back,

185
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:32,988
it means I did a good
job playing Drake Palma.

186
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,399
Watch out for me if Director
Cris decides to follow me back.

187
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,702
Honestly, I’m feeling
pressured just this much.

188
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,308
Because he's an award-winning,

189
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,160
his standards for acting are really high.

190
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:46,148
I am nervous at the same time excited,

191
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,062
because, of course, it’s him
that’s just how it is, right?

192
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,297
He's giving me hope because

193
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:55,455
he gives me advice and he gives me tips,

194
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,822
on how to portray my role better.

195
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,000
So, when it comes to our tapings,

196
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,834
just like earlier, we had a taping...

197
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,428
He gives some tips like...

198
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:04,577
this is how your emotion should be,

199
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,357
this is how your nuances
should be, your reaction.

200
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:10,357
So if you can to do
it, let's make it better.

201
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,683
I told him, "Thank you Director."

202
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,702
Wow, I really want to work
with him on another project.

203
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,217
Every scene, whatever
his vision is, he will tell you.

204
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:22,120
If you need to add
something, I'll tell it to him.

205
00:09:22,702 --> 00:09:25,914
And if ever you exceed his vision,

206
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:27,513
He will tell you that,

207
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,085
okay, let's just tone it a bit, like that.

208
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:35,342
I get nervous, but he is really kind.

209
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:37,342
He is an award-winning director.

210
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,285
I've heard about his past project and-

211
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,611
It's so... such a blessing
to be able to work with him.

212
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:44,796
Very clam, very playful.

213
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:47,222
And usefully hands on...

214
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,902
So, I can't wait to have
more days with them, Director.

215
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:51,978
I'm excited

216
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:55,165
and yeah, let's do this, let's have fun.

217
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,057
It’s like when they say OG,

218
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:02,977
there's some feelings like... really?

219
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:04,335
It was really just for fun,

220
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,422
I didn’t expect the "Seducing Drake
Palma" to become popular like that.

221
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:12,982
The feeling is heartwarming, and I'm happy.

222
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:15,194
Almost everyone can relate to this series.

223
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,190
especially the new generation.

224
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:21,525
It's a love story of two different
people with different personality.

225
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,565
How can two totally
different people connect?

226
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:29,554
How can love develop
between the two of them?

227
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:31,251
Love story should have a verse.

228
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,560
Since, "Seducing Drake Palma" is
a love story of Alys and Drake,

229
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:36,674
I think, everybody can relate.

230
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,630
If you don't know him that well...

231
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:40,051
you might misjudge him.

232
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,537
But deep inside, he's
just going through a lot,

233
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:44,483
that's why he's like that.

234
00:10:44,508 --> 00:10:46,617
At first, she was just light hearted.

235
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:49,508
Kind of funny, just funny, just chillin.

236
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:51,160
But towards the end

237
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,411
you're in for a ride,

238
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,331
'cause it's really - "Ah, it's hurtful"

239
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:58,497
It's hurtful to read, it's
hurtful to watch but...

240
00:10:58,634 --> 00:11:01,742
you’ll get hooked and
you’ll really like this.

241
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:05,000
Interesting, very exciting, very fun.

242
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:06,875
Oh my, why am I smiling?

243
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,914
Why am I feeling giddy?

244
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:12,188
So as the story keeps
getting longer and longer…

245
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:14,012
I got curious if...

246
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:18,592
Anyway, you'll see it here
in "Seducing Drake Palma."

247
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:21,325
It is really so heart-fluttering.

248
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,960
Drake Palma’s character is really diverse.

249
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:28,445
He got some secrets.

250
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,243
You also need to watch out for
Kei and Sheen’s love issues,

251
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:34,270
their love quarrel.

252
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,548
His character is... he’s emo here.

253
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,085
But he’s also playful, so
how will he portray that?

254
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,317
You’ve got to see it.

255
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:45,925
Seducing Drake Palma also
tackles some family issues.

256
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:48,422
Alys has family issues,

257
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:52,297
with her mom Dana and step dad Andy.

258
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:55,880
Drake Palma has daddy
issues with Daddy Steve,

259
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,019
and her stepmom Katrina.

260
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:03,175
When a story tackles family,

261
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,331
for sure anyone watching can relate.

262
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:09,425
Because Filipinos are known
for their deep love for family.

263
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:11,392
We’ve all been through that.

264
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,040
There are families with
unconditional setups,

265
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:18,271
like those with stepmoms,
separated parents, or broken families.

266
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,290
there are families that are complete.

267
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:22,737
So I think every audience,

268
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:26,822
left, right, center, all
aspects of family are there,

269
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:30,027
so they’ll definitely
like this series for sure,

270
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:31,745
because it talks about the family issue.

271
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:39,280
Drake is sleepy, rich, and arrogant, but…

272
00:12:39,394 --> 00:12:41,405
deep inside, he has a heart.

273
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:43,262
He has gone through many things.

274
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,235
Alys Perez loves deeply.

275
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,308
She will do everything
for the person she loves.

276
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:52,391
Even if it’s really hard and
even if she’s already hurting.

277
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:54,822
She’s persistent and a
very lovable character.

278
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,491
I can relate to her, aside
from her aesthetic is that...

279
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:02,312
Her personality—how
deeply she loves as a person

280
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:04,310
because I was once like that before.

281
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:06,168
I also love deeply,

282
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,767
I'll do anything for you
'cause I love you very much.

283
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:13,594
But right now, I can say that
I'm a hundred percent Alys Perez.

284
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:18,120
Tripp Palma is the cousin of Drake Palma.

285
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:23,588
And my father Tristan
always compares me to him.

286
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,291
A student who loves photography,

287
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:28,925
biking, and who also
loves any kind of arts.

288
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,280
He likes painting, drawing, like that.

289
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:32,851
He never had a girlfriend before,

290
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,908
but in this story,

291
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,228
he got interested with one girl named Alys.

292
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:42,360
Aya is like... let's say dark feminine.

293
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:46,652
She's brave, bubbly, and
a very supportive friend.

294
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,737
Aya is the type who will
support you in everything,

295
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:52,522
as long as you're doing the right thing.

296
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:56,011
We'll show you how she loves,

297
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:58,925
in a way that's not showy but-

298
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:01,984
you'll truly feel how
much she cares for you.

299
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:04,575
Sheen is a responsible student.

300
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,126
He is the president of the student council.

301
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:10,118
He's a varsity player,
and he was the captain.

302
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,680
Even if he is that
responsible, he still a cry baby.

303
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:16,529
You can see me very emotional
when it comes to Kei especially.

304
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,685
Kent? So much to say, he's handsome.

305
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,302
I mean he's charming,

306
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,320
He's a lazy genius.

307
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,240
He's kind of a playboy.

308
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:30,217
He's Aya Pineda's number one sweetheart.

309
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:32,851
He's the one, that's him.

310
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:36,440
Kei is a cheerleader.

311
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:40,308
She's competitve, and whatever she like
she needs to have it.

312
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,451
Shaira Silos is kind of manipulative.

313
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:45,944
No, she's very manipulative.

314
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:50,091
She's a sad girl, and Drake
was really her first love.

315
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:55,268
Katrina Palma here is Drake's stepmom,

316
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,270
the fiancée of Tito Steve.

317
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:00,531
Wattpad stories are usually long.

318
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,902
It's not written like
the films I'm used to.

319
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:05,960
There can't be any jumping scenes.

320
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:09,577
You need to explain to the audience
where that jump came from.

321
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:12,508
I think that's the part that's
a bit challenging for us.

322
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:14,822
So we also need to update it,

323
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:16,985
so we also need to update it,

324
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,954
that is relatable with the Gen Z.

325
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,805
And also, there are some part in Wattpad

326
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,042
in "Seducing Drake
Palma" that is a bit sensitive.

327
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,045
So that's what we're adjusting

328
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,657
it needs to be sensitive enough,

329
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:33,660
so no one gets offended,

330
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,668
especially the Gen Z audience as whole.

331
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:39,700
I always have a concept communication
with my writer Spencer Baterna,

332
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:42,217
together with Christine and also Anton.

333
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:45,262
We need to jive together to tell one story.

334
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:47,928
We can't go against each other.

335
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:55,097
Only if we tell the story in one direction
will its message become clear.

336
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,542
Hi guys, it's time for my haircut,

337
00:15:57,577 --> 00:16:00,468
so I can fully achieve Alys Perez's look.

338
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,087
Hope it looks good on me, come with me.

339
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,582
I'm back! Hello, Alys Perez.

340
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:25,160
Is that full bangs?

341
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,274
Earlier, the room was so happy.

342
00:16:34,382 --> 00:16:38,822
Because it was also our first
time to meet the entire cast.

343
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,794
Then we saw our uniforms.

344
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:42,963
How our look appears.

345
00:16:42,988 --> 00:16:45,228
Then we tried different styles of looks.

346
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:51,840
Earlier was also the first time for
Angela and me to act on screen.

347
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,509
We showed it to the director,

348
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:57,892
and tried out the scenes
he wanted us to try.

349
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,643
and we delivered them well.

350
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:01,148
Actually, I was very happy,

351
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,697
'cause it gives me a glimpse of
how our set is going to look like.

352
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:06,279
When there’s a taping,

353
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:10,337
and that was also my first
time shooting with Rabin.

354
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:15,251
I'm happy that the director is
happy because I’m nervous.

355
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:18,451
But I can see that he’s
laughing, he’s feeling giddy.

356
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:21,097
"Ah, okay, what you’re doing is right."

357
00:17:21,137 --> 00:17:25,579
I’m flattered that Rabin
and I have good chemistry.

358
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:28,545
If the director is really
smiling and feeling giddy.

359
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,948
That makes me happy too.

360
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,005
When I saw it, you know
that feeling of thrilled.

361
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,508
I saw Rabin, his face
looked very much like Drake,

362
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,674
and that was what I imagined.

363
00:17:35,699 --> 00:17:39,662
I sent the Viva team photos
of the looks I’m aiming for.

364
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:42,062
And when I saw Rabin's look test,

365
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:43,220
I said, "Oh my God, it's Drake."

366
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:46,370
And especially Angela, I
said she really looked like Alys,

367
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:48,326
especially when they put bangs on her.

368
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:51,337
I feel like I’m throwing back to the ’90s.

369
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,342
Because it’s giving me
Jolina Magdangal vibes.

370
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,406
I like it, actually.

371
00:17:56,491 --> 00:18:01,291
Tripp’s description of the
styling is really arrogant.

372
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,120
Very cool boy.

373
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,874
He wears boots, tight pants,

374
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,548
and then the shirt is unbuttoned.

375
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,560
He’s showing a bit of skin
since he has some muscles,

376
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,811
so it’s kind of sassy.

377
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:16,405
Well, what I did to
prepare for this role is...

378
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:17,851
I worked out.

379
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,394
As for the hair, I had it brushed up.

380
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:24,340
That’s what I imagine would suit him,

381
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:25,148
since he rides a motorcycle.

382
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,760
so naturally, when he
takes off his helmet...

383
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:28,788
his hair’s all brushed up.

384
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:31,662
A bit wavy, and totally cool.

385
00:18:31,788 --> 00:18:35,251
Before we did the look test,
I already had my hair colored red.

386
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:36,842
And, ta-da!

387
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:40,228
I also bought some accessories for Aya.

388
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:43,360
Earrings, necklace, bracelet.

389
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:45,977
Her vibe is kind of
gangster, dark feminine,

390
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:49,051
and you can really see that
she gives off a strong energy.

391
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:53,268
I had my nails done
in a really gothic style —

392
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:54,514
there she is!

393
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:57,417
I really, really love my nails right now

394
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,011
because they’re not girly.

395
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:01,850
It has a very sporty look.

396
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:04,657
Like I'm wearing right now, varsity jacket.

397
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:08,377
That’s because he’s the
captain of the varsity team.

398
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:11,672
He needs a clean look
— flatform rubber shoes,

399
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:13,700
and he’s always wearing denim pants.

400
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,411
And his hair is always styled like that-

401
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:20,794
brushed-up with side-swept bangs.

402
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,302
Kent is clean. He looks very clean.

403
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:26,965
He wears knitted polos,
jewelries, accesories,

404
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:29,994
khaki pants or trousers, leather shoes.

405
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,588
And of course the hair,

406
00:19:31,777 --> 00:19:33,811
the low maintenance one of the dos.

407
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:36,211
all I do is I do that and I'm Kent.

408
00:19:36,236 --> 00:19:38,802
Kei is more of a fashionista.

409
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:42,155
She is more on pink and pastel colors.

410
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,291
She has to stand out —

411
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,290
she should be the most
beautiful of them all.

412
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:50,968
Hello everyone, this is our third day of
workshop with Ms. Ana Feleo

413
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:53,370
Come on, it gets more exciting — join us!

414
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:56,282
I first worked with Rabin on 'Mutya".

415
00:19:56,496 --> 00:20:00,262
He’s unique because
he’s not a pushy person.

416
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,280
There's some kind of mystery,

417
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:05,320
but unique thing about him really is that-

418
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,451
He has this element
like he doesn’t really care.

419
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:11,705
As an actor, it’s also
important to have that-

420
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,868
"I don’t care attitude sometimes,"

421
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,348
so they can express
themselves more freely,

422
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,182
more irreverent, more unpredictable.

423
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:21,497
And they won’t hold back or play small.

424
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,011
Drake is just easy.

425
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,097
It’s like I just need to
tone down the real me,

426
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:29,497
because I’m super outgoing and talkative,

427
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,142
and then Drake is so quiet.

428
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:36,085
Of course, at first, he
was really mad at Alys.

429
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,697
I was looking for a reason
to be annoyed with Angela,

430
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,525
even though I can’t get annoyed at her,

431
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,628
because of her face,

432
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,891
her face is way too cute.

433
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:47,125
It’s like you just can’t
get annoyed at her, right?

434
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:51,080
I also worked with Angela, not as much...

435
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,165
but I worked with her in "Mutya."

436
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:55,170
As a person, she has spunk.

437
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:56,700
Very bright.

438
00:20:56,725 --> 00:21:00,200
It's a nice element to
put into any kind of show.

439
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,360
Because it adds flavor to a very rare.

440
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,640
Ms. Ana really grilled us hard.

441
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:09,531
It's not a typical acting workshop,

442
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,657
it's an internal work.

443
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:14,660
It's like, you have
to fixed your self first,

444
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,710
before you fixed your acting.

445
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:19,251
One thing I really like about Ms. Ana.

446
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,148
Is her emphasis on putting
your mind before you work is.

447
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,560
And then putting your
heart where your craft is.

448
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:29,182
So putting your heart where your craft is,

449
00:21:29,217 --> 00:21:32,434
so that makes a lot of sense and
I'm going to keep it wherever I go.

450
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:35,674
This is different, because
they are the lead actors.

451
00:21:36,017 --> 00:21:37,805
There's pressure on Rabin,

452
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,171
because of the succes of the "Mutya."

453
00:21:40,388 --> 00:21:44,645
With Angela, I feel like
the pressure is heavier,

454
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:47,864
because she’s being rushed to mature.

455
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:51,577
You know, the opportunitty
does not wait for the actor.

456
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:53,531
So, they know the work,

457
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:56,586
they know what kind of work is needed.

458
00:21:56,685 --> 00:21:59,680
So they're really using
their head for their career.

459
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,937
Again, I learned how
to connect with Angela.

460
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:07,068
We had a proper conversation about
how we can work well together.

461
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:09,554
How we can help each other.

462
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,577
Throughout the process of workshop,

463
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:15,018
I started to warm up with him,

464
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,298
and I felt a bit comfortable,

465
00:22:16,323 --> 00:22:19,731
and I really think I need this with Rabin.

466
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,044
I need to do a workshop with Rabin,

467
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:24,570
so we can work things out for this series.

468
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:27,995
But Rabin is really easy to work with,

469
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,337
in terms of chemistry,
he really brings it

470
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:35,354
with the way he uses
his eyes in his acting.

471
00:22:36,068 --> 00:22:38,777
My orientation is different because
I didn’t come from television.

472
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,000
My orientation is that I come from film.

473
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:43,257
I always treat things
like I’m making a film.

474
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:45,731
When you watch the episode,

475
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:47,822
the camera is always moving,

476
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:50,235
there’s always great framing,

477
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,342
like it could be a wallpaper or hallmark.

478
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:57,337
It’s like a poster — it should
be really pleasing to the eye.

479
00:22:57,497 --> 00:22:59,920
Because the story itself
is really heart-fluttering.

480
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:01,805
So as you watch it,

481
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,114
you should just keep
smiling the whole time.

482
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:05,051
That's how I imagined it.

483
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:06,691
Happy first day!

484
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:09,785
I’m still nervous, I don’t know what to do,

485
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,497
but what I’ll do is just run.

486
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:12,916
But I still get nervous.

487
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:15,337
Maybe I'm just too excited.

488
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:17,285
So, see you guys.

489
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,840
On our first day of shooting,

490
00:23:18,908 --> 00:23:20,422
when we got on the line,

491
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,645
running is my first scene.

492
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:24,626
I had to run from point A to point B,

493
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:26,320
then from point B to point C.

494
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,485
I was so happy that I didn’t
even notice how tired I was.

495
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,505
Aah! Finally, first day shooting of
"Seducing Drake Palma."

496
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:35,748
Before we got on set,

497
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,817
what we do is we throw lines.

498
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,820
Come join us.

499
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:46,009
Our scene was the one
where Ethan gives me a letter.

500
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:47,457
This is my plan,

501
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,422
my plan for Alys and Drake.

502
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:50,982
Ethan!

503
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:54,537
So it's our day one of "Seducing
Drake Palma' or "SDP".

504
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:56,470
I'm so excited we're
going to throw lines, okay?

505
00:23:56,495 --> 00:23:57,505
Yeah, let's go!

506
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:02,645
Yeah, you’ll exit, and
he’ll be the one left behind.

507
00:24:02,662 --> 00:24:04,142
When I was there on set,

508
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,017
he made me feel like I'm Sheen.

509
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,305
Once you feel the
setting and your co-actor —

510
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,657
once Rafa is there.

511
00:24:09,742 --> 00:24:12,257
I realized the job’s not hard
— it’s actually pretty easy.

512
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,862
Especially when you
have a supportive director,

513
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:16,411
you have a supportive team.

514
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,045
Happy first day!

515
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,975
The scene we’re doing here is the one
where I’m mad at him.

516
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,811
I’ll give him attitude,
then he’ll run after me.

517
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:25,810
That’s the scene we’re doing right now.

518
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,525
I think this is the first
time I'm being mean.

519
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,129
Because in my last
role, I was the nice one.

520
00:24:30,154 --> 00:24:33,480
So I’m really trying
to be mean today.

521
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:36,445
Of course, I’m really happy to
be in a love team with Rafa again.

522
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,232
And, this is a lot easier for us now.

523
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:40,257
We’re pretty comfortable with each other,

524
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,028
which is easier for me, and I’m thankful.

525
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:46,403
Angela, oh my god, she’s amazing.

526
00:24:46,891 --> 00:24:52,691
We have scenes where we just burst out
laughing after director calls cut.

527
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:57,177
We have ad-libs that
we didn’t expect we’d say,

528
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,502
it’s like the lines just
come out naturally.

529
00:24:59,908 --> 00:25:01,057
Aja!

530
00:25:02,611 --> 00:25:04,548
We have a good dynamics.

531
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:08,005
I survived day one, oh my God!

532
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:10,010
Whoo.. yeah!

533
00:25:10,114 --> 00:25:11,708
More to go!

534
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:14,265
1 out of 38, yehey!

535
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,542
Okay, our first day, I
think was really fun.

536
00:25:18,628 --> 00:25:21,552
Because they're young,
expect them to be energetic.

537
00:25:21,577 --> 00:25:23,400
It's really fun to work with kids.

538
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:25,165
And they're also talented.

539
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,165
I thought I'll be having a hard time but-

540
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,062
Not really, not at all.

541
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:30,108
I only had to fix a few things,

542
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:31,234
I think because of the workshop,

543
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:32,577
the kids did a workshop too.

544
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,811
That really helped a lot.

545
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:35,628
Hi guys! Good morning!

546
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:38,002
It's my first day today as Drake Palma.

547
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:42,120
We're here today at the
tunnel, to shoot two sequences.

548
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:46,038
This is where we’ll do the iconic "Your
my boyfriend now, let's break-up" scene.

549
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,617
Direk Cris is intense —

550
00:25:51,912 --> 00:25:54,009
you have to really prepare,

551
00:25:54,034 --> 00:25:57,262
because he’ll push you until you bring out
the exact emotion he wants.

552
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:59,582
Sometimes the emotion goes overboard,

553
00:25:59,723 --> 00:26:00,771
sometimes it’s not enough.

554
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:03,146
He’s the one who fixed us,

555
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:05,800
but we still need to know what we’re doing.

556
00:26:06,017 --> 00:26:08,209
Working with Rabin is really fun.

557
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,495
'Cause.. actually, he's lucky because
his character is Drake,

558
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,710
he's chill and so laid-back.

559
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,525
That’s not fair — your role is so good!

560
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,497
Because his character
is so complex yet it's chill.

561
00:26:20,582 --> 00:26:22,920
I felt challenged to do my best,

562
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,800
because I want to reach his level.

563
00:26:27,011 --> 00:26:30,800
So in our first scene together,
I hit him with my folder.

564
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:32,980
- And then I felt sorry for him.
- Several times.

565
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:36,640
And her bangs were
already gone in the first scene.

566
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,137
I hope the bangs last the whole day.

567
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,788
You can do it, Angela Muji.

568
00:26:40,925 --> 00:26:42,405
Hi everyone, this is Dylan,

569
00:26:42,405 --> 00:26:44,410
and I'll be playing Tripp Palma.

570
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,308
And my role today... my sequence today is-

571
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:51,222
I'll be the substitute
photographer for the wedding.

572
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:54,525
Of course working with seasoned
artist here in the Philippines.

573
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:57,428
It's a big help with us who
just starting our careers,

574
00:26:57,428 --> 00:26:59,221
because they will be our guide,

575
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:02,388
on how to act the right way in a scene.

576
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:06,394
Hello guys! Good morning, we're
here at Drake Palma's house.

577
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:08,037
Come on, let’s go in.

578
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:09,930
I'll show you our set.

579
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,926
It’s really heartwarming

580
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:23,742
that veteran actors and actresses
joined us and supported us.

581
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,674
Like, Lander Vera Perez; Christopher Roxas,

582
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:31,142
Mark Anthony Fernandez and many more.

583
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:32,925
I am Mark Anthony Fernandez,

584
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,125
and I played the role of Steve Palma.

585
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,057
They’re so light and fun,

586
00:27:39,082 --> 00:27:41,245
I get drawn in when I watch them.

587
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:46,068
Well, I played the role of Angela's mom,

588
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,697
which is Alys Zyril Perez.

589
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:52,982
I’d say it’s refreshing because
I’m working with younger actors.

590
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:55,925
Angela is easy to work with,

591
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,371
she is lively in the set.

592
00:27:57,948 --> 00:28:00,125
So, she’s also really
nice to talk to off cam.

593
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,594
It’s fun — the vibes
on set are are just light.

594
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:06,051
I'm Andy, I'm the father of Alys.

595
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,497
I'm the stepdad of Alys, but caring father.

596
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:12,205
In this living room,

597
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,148
we shot our first sequence
earlier with Angela.

598
00:28:15,188 --> 00:28:17,720
So, we were able to pull it off well.

599
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,342
So, here is my mother's work station.

600
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:26,114
She will be making my cocktail dress,
for our acquaintance party.

601
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,365
And here’s my dad, of course.

602
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:30,785
I'm so honored that they are my parents,

603
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,742
'cause they're veteran
actors and I'm like..

604
00:28:33,742 --> 00:28:35,740
Aah! is this for real?

605
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,285
Like, my parents used to watched them,

606
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,788
and now, they're my parents.

607
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,455
It's such an honor, thank you!

608
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,691
We’re super excited for
every scene we shoot.

609
00:28:45,716 --> 00:28:47,073
We're just happy and-

610
00:28:47,388 --> 00:28:50,120
we helped each other in every scene.

611
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,040
And even off camera, we help each other.

612
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,506
We're solid friends.

613
00:28:55,531 --> 00:29:00,885
As Alys Perez, I'm a hundred and
one percent happy to be her.

614
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:04,625
I feel like, I'm really her.

615
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,914
As I’m reading the book, I’m thinking,
"This is me. This is really me."

616
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:09,407
Hey, I relate to her,

617
00:29:09,432 --> 00:29:13,240
and I feel like many viewers or readers,

618
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,257
will relate to Alys Perez.

619
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,034
Because we all love someone, so much-

620
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,350
to the point that we're willing
to sacrifice a lot for them.

621
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:30,982
We can’t miss the "Seducing Drake Palma".

622
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:41,045
I feel like this series is where
you’ll truly get to see Drake Palma.

623
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:46,443
Rabin Angeles is one of the
rising actors in our generation.

624
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,816
It’s relevant to people because,

625
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:54,474
this is a common experience we all really
went through in high school.

626
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,015
You need to watch this
"Seduing Drake Palma,"

627
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,523
especially those who loves reading Wattpad,

628
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:04,960
because this is such a great project.

629
00:30:04,993 --> 00:30:10,111
And I just wanna say that you
won't regret waiting this long.

630
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:13,662
because I’m sure you won’t be disappointed.

631
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,017
And we really will, truly do our best,

632
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,188
to give you the "Seducing Drake Palma's"
adaptation that you all wanted.

633
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,400
It's intriguing,

634
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:22,842
it's suspenseful,

635
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:24,405
it's chaotic,

636
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:25,969
funny and sweet.

637
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:28,795
I can promise you that we will do our best.

638
00:30:28,897 --> 00:30:30,097
All I can say is-

639
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,548
we give justice to the
characters we're playing.

640
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,022
And we truly enjoyed portraying them.

641
00:30:38,454 --> 00:30:39,745
Very interesting.

642
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,733
It's complicated. It's enjoyable.

643
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:42,837
It's fun.

644
00:30:42,862 --> 00:30:44,988
This is what we're all waiting for.

645
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:46,520
Yehey, I'm so happy.

646
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:50,571
You need to watch this so you
can get to know Drake Palma.

647
00:30:50,937 --> 00:30:53,720
My characters are going through so much.

648
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:56,617
There's also many
plot twist with other cast.

649
00:30:57,965 --> 00:31:00,800
It’s full of good vibes
and just so heart-fluttering.

650
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:03,192
It’s just so much fun to watch,
really light and enjoyable.

651
00:31:03,217 --> 00:31:05,600
And I know a lot of you have been waiting,

652
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,249
for this to be adapted from Wattpad,

653
00:31:07,274 --> 00:31:08,525
and it’s finally here.

654
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,800
So, we need to watch this.

655
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:12,925
We all need to throwback
to this story together.

656
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,296
Life’s so stressful, but
"Seducing Drake Palma" is very..

657
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:17,611
giddy with excitement.

658
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:21,605
You know, this is really our
break from our busy lives.

659
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,548
And as mention before, you can relate here.

660
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,297
It’s like your high school crush,

661
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,685
your best friend from high school,

662
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,085
your heartbreak from high school.

663
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,760
It's very relatable.

664
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:32,337
It's worth the wait. Why?

665
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:34,022
Because I had good actors.

666
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:36,563
We are faithful to the
book, and to the Wattpad.

667
00:31:36,588 --> 00:31:38,480
With my personal touch to it,

668
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,960
I think everyone will love this.

669
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:43,015
So, it's worth the wait, really.

670
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,342
I promise, the wait will be worth it.

671
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:46,319
Promise!

672
00:31:46,344 --> 00:31:51,085
The giddiness, laughter, and good vibes
will definitely be here.

673
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,855
You’re definitely gonna have
a good time watching this.

674
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,388
You’ll enjoy it and this
story will stay with you.

675
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:00,055
What I can promise to everyone,

676
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,272
who will become viewers of
"Seducing Drake Palma" is-

677
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:07,205
your viewing experience
will be absolutely worth it,

678
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,685
because we’ll give everything we’ve got,

679
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:14,182
to make sure this series is beautiful,

680

and as accurate as possible.

681
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,394
We really want the characters and settings
to come alive straight from the book.

682
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:23,765
We want your beloved
characters to bring into life,

683
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,165

this is finally what
you’ve been waiting for.

686
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,577
