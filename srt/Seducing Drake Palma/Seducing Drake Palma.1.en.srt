1
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,393
Really? Are you sure?

2
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,523
They broke up?

3
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,254
How did that happen?

4
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:47,998
I swear, bestie!

5
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:49,340
I was just as shocked!

6
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,445
Weren’t they a power couple?

7
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,471
They’re so perfect
for each other!

8
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,139
Football team captain,

9
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,807
and the president of
the student council.

10
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,851
And he’s running
for class salutatorian…

11
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:03,130
…while she’s the cheer captain
and title holder of Miss St. Collete High!

12
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,180
They were literally
the perfect couple.

13
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:16,284
Such a good match.

14
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,537
- What a waste.
- Why’d they break up though?

15
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,295
Wow! News really travels fast.

16
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,272
Sheen is such a weakling.

17
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,698
Right? He let Kei
go just like that.

18
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,843
The whole school found
out about the breakup first?

19
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,244
But I’m his best friend!

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,401
I heard they broke up
because of the transferee.

21
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,088
Drake Palma!

22
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,440
Drake Palma?!

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,540
- Drake Palma?!
- Drake Palma?!

24
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,691
- Drake Palma?!
- Drake Palma?!

25
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:49,800
- Drake Palma?!
- Drake Palma?!

26
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:50,668
- Drake Palma?!
- Drake Palma?!

27
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,986
- Drake Palma?!
- Drake Palma?!

28
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:53,417
- Drake Palma?!
- Drake Palma?!

29
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,614
Drake Palma?

30
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,366
The cute guy who suddenly
appeared at St. Collete?

31
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,503
Yes! That Drake Palma!

32
00:01:57,528 --> 00:01:59,077
- Drake Palma?
- Exactly.

33
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,159
And because of
that rumor, here I am.

34
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:04,791
Running and running and running.

35
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,668
Checking every corner of the school

36
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,878
just to find the “Man of the Hour.”

37
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:12,600
The center of all the
gossip at St. Collete High.

38
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:29,249
By the way, I’m Alys.

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,546
Senior student.

40
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:32,863
I believe in the saying…

41
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:35,908
If you love someone, go all out!

42
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,569
Give it everything.

43
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,136
And of course,

44
00:02:39,374 --> 00:02:43,791
I’m giving all my time to help
heal the broken heart of My Loves…

45
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,413
…my best friend--

46
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,257
Sheen.

47
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:55,483
Sheen!

48
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:58,921
I knew you’d be here!

49
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:24,164
Kei and I broke up.

50
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:28,523
I know.

51
00:03:30,396 --> 00:03:31,439
How did you know?

52
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:34,012
We just broke up earlier.

53
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:35,859
Kei is the worst.

54
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:38,313
She found someone cuter
and dropped Sheen just like that.

55
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:39,773
Drake Palma?

56
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:40,790
Pfft!

57
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:42,584
Sheen’s way cuter than that guy.

58
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,694
Just be glad they’re done.

59
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:47,948
You’ve been waiting
for this forever, bestie!

60
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:50,867
Fine, I’ll go check on Sheen.

61
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:52,619
For sure, he’s already sulking.

62
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:54,638
Of course!

63
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:55,789
I’m good at this!

64
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,213
Don’t get all emo!

65
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,871
That’s so not you!

66
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,261
I’m just not used
to seeing you sad.

67
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,597
That’s why you
became my best friend…

68
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:14,349
because you’re always smiling.

69
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:16,643
Your good vibes are contagious.

70
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:20,894
I want to sulk, okay.

71
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:26,648
Here.

72
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:29,406
What am I supposed
to do with that?

73
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:30,703
Eyeliner!

74
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:32,534
You want to be an emo, right?

75
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:33,922
Go all in!

76
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:35,382
You’re the worst!

77
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:37,080
No, I’m helping you--

78
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:38,014
- There!
- Use it--

79
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:38,914
Please!

80
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,620
See? You’re not even using it.

81
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,334
What’s up with you?

82
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:53,722
Psst...

83
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:55,281
What?

84
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,148
Seriously.

85
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:00,023
- What is it?
- I want her back!

86
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:01,109
Boogsh!

87
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:02,406
That hurts!

88
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:03,508
Help me out.

89
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:04,508
Ugh.

90
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:06,160
Why is it like this when
you're the best friend?

91
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:07,815
Always the one helping.

92
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,571
Always the one sacrificing.

93
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,062
Always the one secretly in love!

94
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:13,961
Make Drake Palma your boyfriend.

95
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:16,367
Huh?

96
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:17,984
What?

97
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:20,498
Make Drake Palma your boyfriend!

98
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:29,469
Sheen!

99
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:32,531
Hey!

100
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:34,094
Alys!

101
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,240
Wow.

102
00:05:37,265 --> 00:05:39,392
Are you even hearing what
you’re asking me to do?

103
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:41,394
You’ve got some nerve!

104
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,087
You’ve already had,
like, three boyfriends!

105
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:44,976
It’s easy for you!

106
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,092
Unbelievable!

107
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:48,536
As easy as one, two, three? Really?

108
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:51,279
I can’t even go near that guy!

109
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:53,047
His vibe is super scary!

110
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,460
Totally intimidating!

111
00:05:57,827 --> 00:05:59,162
Come on.

112
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:01,711
Come on, please.

113
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:06,531
If a face this handsome
begged you like this…

114
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:08,963
Could you really say no?

115
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:11,711
Fine! You’re so
annoying! I’m in!

116
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:13,218
Girl, wait!

117
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:15,195
Did you really say yes?!

118
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,138
Maybe you
could still take it back--

119
00:06:17,138 --> 00:06:18,223
Thanks, Alys!

120
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,711
You’re the best!

121
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:28,625
Thank you!

122
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,055
Yeah, yeah, thanks my butt!

123
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,295
There’s a fee for
that, you know!

124
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,405
Okay, okay!

125
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:36,574
I’ll treat you to lunch
the whole week. Deal?

126
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,827
Not enough! All meals!

127
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:40,303
Even snacks!

128
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:41,179
You’re such a freeloader!

129
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:42,222
I’m telling your mom!

130
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:44,207
As if you’d dare!

131
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:46,693
I know you love me!

132
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:49,604
What?

133
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,047
- Try me!
- What?

134
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:52,139
What? Come on!

135
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,053
See?

136
00:06:57,594 --> 00:07:00,974
We’re only sweet and romantic
when it’s just the two of us.

137
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:01,825
If I trip--

138
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,434
Wait!

139
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:03,961
Oh, life.

140
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:07,410
Things would have been
so simple and happy.

141
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:09,905
But of course…

142
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:12,498
I know Kei’s the
one he really likes.

143
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:13,524
Wait! Wait!

144
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:14,529
Hold up! Hold up!

145
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:15,530
Stop! Stop!

146
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:16,256
Stop!

147
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,490
You’re all talk!

148
00:07:18,032 --> 00:07:19,187
Come on, just admit it…

149
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:20,855
Are you really heartbroken?

150
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,252
You’re chasing like you
drank a full energy drink!

151
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:25,492
I am broken, okay!

152
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:27,195
It just doesn’t show.

153
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:29,461
And why would I worry…

154
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:31,530
You’re gonna help
me get Kei back, right?

155
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:33,631
What if I can’t?

156
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:35,633
I know you can.

157
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:39,679
Why are you so sure I can?

158
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,391
Because… you’re Alys Perez!

159
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,478
And when you want something,
you get it by hook or by crook!

160
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:49,078
What? Where did that come from?

161
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:54,194
For me, I like you,
but I just can’t have you.

162
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:56,070
Whatever, Sheen!

163
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:57,484
You talk too much!

164
00:07:57,989 --> 00:07:59,782
You know, I wonder…

165
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,035
- Alys.
- Hmm?

166
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:04,746
Most best friends end up
falling for each other, right?

167
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:05,914
So?

168
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:09,734
Why didn’t that ever happen with us?

169
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:12,253
Because ours is unrequited love.

170
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:14,147
You talk about
nothing else but Kei!

171
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,190
Darn it!

172
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:17,367
Makes sense. I’m not into you either.

173
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,289
You talk too much!

174
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:21,196
And you’re clumsy!

175
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:22,363
You know that?

176
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:24,807
And you always flunk
your exams… always--

177
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:25,617
Ouch!

178
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:27,750
What? Do you want help or not?

179
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,128
I’m not done yet.

180
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:32,498
If you weren’t like that,

181
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,567
you wouldn’t be Alys Perez.

182
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:37,362
And if you weren’t Alys Perez…

183
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,648
What would happen
to Sheen Mendoza?

184
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:43,451
K-Drama you say? Ugh!

185
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:46,788
You’re being too sweet, Sheen!

186
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:49,123
Lord, why does it have to be like this?

187
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:52,327
How am I supposed to stay
mad when my best friend who I like…

188
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:54,433
…is hugging me like this?

189
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:57,465
And we both know…

190
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,226
that between me and Kei…

191
00:09:00,364 --> 00:09:02,695
he’ll still end up running
back to Kei in the end.

192
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,667
Fine, Sheen! Fine!

193
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:06,109
I’m heading out.

194
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:07,826
I’ve got a mission to do…

195
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:10,144
all because of you.

196
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:12,438
Love you, Alys!

197
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,793
Bye!

198
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:19,821
I might not be smart
in academics but

199
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:23,616
I know the difference between
friends and more-than-friends.

200
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,884
That “love you”?

201
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:26,995
We’re not taking that seriously!

202
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,518
That’s how real pain
and heartbreak starts.

203
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:32,476
We’re only allowed
to fake sulk, okay?

204
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,391
Where’s my notebook?

205
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:39,486
Damn you, Kei!

206
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:43,547
I really like this guy,
and you’re just making him cry?!

207
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:46,759
Don’t worry, Sheen, My Loves…

208
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:49,914
Drake Palma, you
better watch out!

209
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:52,008
I’m going to get you by hook…

210
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,076
…or by crook!

211
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,852
I love you, Drake Palma!

212
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:48,242
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

213
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:50,536
What? Seriously?

214
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:55,236
Do I look like I'd joke
about something like this?

215
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:59,062
You always believe Sheen
the moment he says anything…

216
00:10:59,087 --> 00:10:59,962
…you're just all go.

217
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:01,280
You don’t even think!

218
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:05,066
Then again, when have
you ever used your brain?

219
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:05,985
Uhm!

220
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,028
You're just as bad!

221
00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:08,357
Are you even really my friend?

222
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:10,556
You’re so mean!

223
00:11:10,848 --> 00:11:12,225
- Oh, come on…
- What?

224
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,268
I was just kidding!
You can’t take a joke?

225
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:16,187
But seriously though…

226
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:18,439
Your mission is challenging.

227
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:21,776
You know that guy's kind of weird.

228
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:25,488
Well actually,
Drake is really weird.

229
00:11:25,702 --> 00:11:29,690
He’s always sleeping in class but always
getting perfect scores on quizzes?

230
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:33,370
While I’m wide
awake and still failing!

231
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:35,081
I really don’t get it.

232
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:36,107
I have no idea.

233
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:39,581
Bestie, please help me!

234
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:42,505
I don’t even have
a boyfriend!

235
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,074
How am I supposed
to help you?

236
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:46,592
Ugh!

237
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:49,653
Life, why are you so hard on me?

238
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:52,180
I just want Sheen to be
my boyfriend, that’s all!

239
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:54,325
Ouch!

240
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,935
You’re so dramatic,
you know that?

241
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:57,553
You’re ruining my day!

242
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,518
Fight me.

243
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:03,917
Sometimes I really
wonder why Aya's my friend.

244
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:06,229
There are so many people better than her.

245
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:09,917
She’s always hitting and hurting me!

246
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:13,987
Sometimes she even
teases me when I fail my exams.

247
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:15,763
Well, she fails, too!

248
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,011
I don’t know anymore.

249
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:21,282
But seriously, you really
don’t have any suggestions?

250
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,768
Tips? Or advice?

251
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:26,776
Bestie.

252
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,315
Bestie.

253
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,065
How exactly are
you going to pull off

254
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,745
“Mission Impossible:
Seducing Drake Palma”?

255
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:46,700
Hi, Drake!

256
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:47,660
Oh, hi, Drake!

257
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:48,952
I didn't see you there.

258
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,120
Hi, Drake!

259
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:51,205
Hi, Drake!

260
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,656
Hi, Drake.

261
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,141
Hi, Drake.

262
00:13:57,534 --> 00:14:01,117
How am I even supposed to
introduce myself to that snob?

263
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,810
Hi, Sheen, My Loves.

264
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,395
Alys?

265
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,643
Yes, Mom?

266
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:16,753
Hi, what's up?

267
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:18,273
Oh, nothing.

268
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:21,458
I'm just here because I've made
a few sketches for the gowns.

269
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:23,518
It’s for the acquaintance ball.

270
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:26,281
So we can prepare early.

271
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:28,258
- Oh. Okay, Mom. I'll check it out.
- Here.

272
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:36,628
Oh, my god, Mom. All
of these are so pretty.

273
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:39,111
You're so good at this, Mom.
You're the best!

274
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:39,919
Hmmm…

275
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:42,760
- You're the best!
- My daughter is such a flatterer.

276
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:45,576
Anyway, Manang
already prepared dinner…

277
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:48,487
…so just come down so
we can eat together, okay?

278
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,472
And then check that one out later.

279
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:52,224
Okay, Mom. I’ll
be right behind you.

280
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:54,619
Okay. Don't take too long.

281
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,354
Yes, Mom.

282
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:12,286
Hi, Drake.

283
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,328
Alys!

284
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:14,620
Yes, Mom. Coming.

285
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:18,162
So, Manang, just bring that
over there, okay?

286
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:22,643
Oh, Dad!

287
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:26,341
You’re here! I thought you
were on a business trip?

288
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,068
Yeah, I was. But…

289
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,678
I missed you and your mom.

290
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:31,622
So I decided to come
home, even just for a bit.

291
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:33,643
- Ahh.
- Oh, before I forget.

292
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:34,875
Just take care of this, Manang.

293
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,924
Surprise!

294
00:15:36,424 --> 00:15:38,315
Oh, my gosh! Dad!

295
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,806
- Oh my--
- This is a lot, Dad!

296
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:43,108
You deserve it.

297
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,703
You know, Alys,
you’re getting spoiled.

298
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:47,863
Why are you getting gifts when…

299
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:50,474
we haven’t even seen
her report card yet.

300
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:53,987
Alys, do your grades
deserve these gifts?

301
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:58,617
I think my grades are fine.

302
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:00,220
- Hmmm…
- I think.

303
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:04,797
Just make sure that
“fine” and “I think”…

304
00:16:04,822 --> 00:16:08,133
…can actually get you into a
good college—if not the best!

305
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:13,080
You know St. Collete Academy
is still the best in the country.

306
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:20,940
Of course, if the
princess gets a gift…

307
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:22,258
…the queen should get one, too.

308
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:25,062
What's that?

309
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:27,359
You didn't have to.

310
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:29,162
- Dad’s so sweet.
- I wanted to.

311
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:30,138
My god.

312
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,420
Let’s try it on.

313
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:32,975
It’s so pretty.

314
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:35,378
- Look.
- Wow, Mom, it really suits you.

315
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:39,439
- So pretty, Mom!
- See? It’s beautiful, right?

316
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,274
- Thank you.
- It suits you!

317
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,425
Thank you, hon.

318
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,578
It looks good, Mom.

319
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:46,880
Alright, well.

320
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:47,961
Eat your dinner now.

321
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,672
Thank you.

322
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,637
They’re having a concert
here this November.

323
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,045
Hmm?

324
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,170
Too bad, my bias still hasn’t
finished military service.

325
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,314
But you’re still going?

326
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:07,704
Hey! I’m asking you! Hey!

327
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:10,261
Hello?

328
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,307
What are you even looking at?

329
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:14,219
Banana.

330
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,815
Let’s follow him,
quick. Let’s go!

331
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,594
Wait, my pizza! My pizza!

332
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,992
I might drop it!

333
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,950
Girl, I’ll just leave it
here for now, okay?

334
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:32,743
Hurry!

335
00:17:34,535 --> 00:17:36,161
Where do you think he’s going?

336
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:38,832
That’s why we’re following him.

337
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:40,042
Calm down, bestie! Relax!

338
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:42,427
We’re following him so we’ll know!

339
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:44,247
Come on! You go first.

340
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:52,554
Wait—do we have
homework for tomorrow?

341
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:55,032
Did you guys know
we have an exam later?

342
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:56,658
- Did you study?
- For Filipino?

343
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:57,701
You studied?

344
00:17:57,726 --> 00:17:58,769
Nice. Nice. Nice.

345
00:17:58,794 --> 00:17:59,971
Thank you! Thank you!

346
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:01,628
Who were those?

347
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,664
Do you know them?

348
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:03,857
Looks like our classmates.

349
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,634
Hurry, before Drake disappears.

350
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,565
Huh?

351
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,800
Nap is life?

352
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,076
Let’s go.

353
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:41,185
He’s just sleeping!

354
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:48,018
Bestie, wait, wait!

355
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:49,878
Ouch, bestie!

356
00:18:49,903 --> 00:18:51,073
There’s a girl, look.

357
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,440
Drake!

358
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:56,551
In fairness, she’s pretty.

359
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:57,260
Hmm.

360
00:18:57,363 --> 00:18:58,907
- Drake Palma!
- What did she say?

361
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:03,208
Come on.

362
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,049
Bestie, you’re too loud!

363
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:08,432
Ouch!

364
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:11,589
I like you, Drake.

365
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:13,671
Can you be my…

366
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,213
…boyfriend?

367
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:19,143
That girl is brave.

368
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:20,672
Go, sis!

369
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:22,922
We salute your fighting spirit.

370
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:25,862
Okay.

371
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,799
What the--

372
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:31,034
That’s it?

373
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:33,924
Really?

374
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:37,206
We’re done.

375
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:41,909
That’s really it?

376
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,830
What do you mean?

377
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:49,174
Drake, we just became
a thing and now…

378
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:51,673
…it’s over? We’re
breaking up already?

379
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:56,303
You want bragging rights, right?

380
00:19:58,185 --> 00:19:59,190
There.

381
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:05,651
Poor girl.

382
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:07,065
Hmp!

383
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:10,784
What just happened, bestie?

384
00:20:12,986 --> 00:20:14,905
Drake Palma, you’re the worst.

385
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:17,466
Karma’s going to get you.

386
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:18,603
Karma’s coming.

387
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:22,579
Well, there you go, bestie.

388
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:25,577
It’s actually easy to make
Drake your boyfriend.

389
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,542
He’s really easy to talk to.

390
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:30,681
I don’t get his logic at all.

391
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,339
What just happened?

392
00:20:32,891 --> 00:20:34,323
A two-second relationship?

393
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:38,096
Yup! And that’s exactly
what you need. Come on!

394
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:40,276
Huh?

395
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:42,574
Listen to me.

396
00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:43,809
Hmm.

397
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,378
Talk to Drake
like what that girl did.

398
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:49,307
Then tell Sheen, Your Loves,
that you already broke up.

399
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,483
See? Problem solved!

400
00:20:58,406 --> 00:20:59,409
Oh--

401
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:03,411
But that’s embarrassing!

402
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:05,472
He’s our classmate!

403
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,998
Come on! That’s fine!

404
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,726
For all you know, he
doesn’t even know you exist.

405
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:11,419
So, don’t worry, bestie!

406
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:14,492
Actually, you have a point there, bestie.

407
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:16,024
But it’s annoying,

408
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,932
he doesn’t even mingle with
our classmates…

409
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:19,596
That jerk, Drake Palma!

410
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:22,514
It really makes me wonder…

411
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:25,475
…why did he even
transfer to St. Collete?

412
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:28,635
I don’t know.

413
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,703
So annoying!

414
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:33,392
But I really felt
bad for that girl earlier.

415
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,189
- Yeah, same.
- I hope she’s okay.

416
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:39,422
Right!

417
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:41,241
So, are you going to do it?

418
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,010
For all the girls who were hurt by Drake!

419
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,556
There you go! That’s the spirit!

420
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:48,784
Game!

421
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,276
I’ll tell him later.

422
00:21:50,763 --> 00:21:51,846
For that girl.

423
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:54,071
But most of all…

424
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:57,088
…for Sheen, My Loves!

425
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,181
That’s my bestie!

426
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:04,651
Letting love make her a fool!

427
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:09,143
You better watch out, Drake Palma!

428
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,143
Good luck with your
mission impossible, bestie.

429
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:15,984
Aja!

430
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:20,633
As always, perfect score…

431
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:22,576
…for Mr. Palma!

432
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,831
A round of applause, please!

433
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,562
- How?
- I don’t know!

434
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:37,562
Maybe that’s just how weirdos are?

435
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:38,899
I know.

436
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:42,213
Ms. Perez? Ms. Pineda?

437
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,324
I said Ms. Perez and Ms. Pineda!

438
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:48,433
Are you with us?

439
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:49,924
Yes, Ma'am!

440
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:51,456
Good! Get your papers.

441
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,593
Ms. Perez, failed.

442
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,807
Pineda, failed.

443
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,987
Hey. Let’s go.

444
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,863
Let’s just eat out our feelings.

445
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:45,115
Let’s go to a karaoke.

446
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:46,825
Go ahead, you go first.

447
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:49,286
Sad much?

448
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:52,622
Come on, you act like you’ve
never had a low score before.

449
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:54,447
What was that again earlier?

450
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:57,023
Idiot! I still have a mission, remember?

451
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:00,121
What? You’re going to beg our teacher?

452
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,691
It’s the promise I made to Sheen!

453
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:14,185
Oh, I got it.

454
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:17,455
You want me to pray for you to St. Collete?

455
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,332
Forget it. Just go. Go!

456
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:22,083
- Okay, fine! Good luck!
- Do your best!

457
00:24:57,741 --> 00:24:58,815
Please don't leave me.

458
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:01,737
Please.

459
00:25:04,694 --> 00:25:05,745
Please come back.

460
00:25:11,124 --> 00:25:12,167
Psst.

461
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:15,587
Psst.

462
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:19,753
Psst.

463
00:25:23,962 --> 00:25:25,690
- Psst.
- What?

464
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,969
What do you want?

465
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:36,622
Uhm…

466
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:38,816
I’m just tying my shoelace.

467
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:39,562
Seriously?

468
00:25:39,562 --> 00:25:41,578
Is it wrong to tie shoelaces now?

469
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:02,710
That was close!

470
00:26:03,302 --> 00:26:04,950
Good thing I got away with it!

471
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,858
Thank you, St. Collete!

472
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:09,493
Thank you, shoe...

473
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,249
...lace.

474
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:15,732
I don’t have a shoelace!

475
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,517
Yes, Alys! You got this!

476
00:26:49,717 --> 00:26:50,899
You can do it!

477
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,669
Let’s go, Alys! You got this!

478
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,487
Yes, Alys! You got this!

479
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:56,781
Get back at him for that girl earlier.

480
00:26:56,923 --> 00:26:58,396
…for everyone he’s hurt—

481
00:26:58,641 --> 00:26:59,699
For Sheen!

482
00:26:59,724 --> 00:27:01,578
Let’s go! You can do this!

483
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,430
Come on. You’re not gonna
let him win. You got this.

484
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,914
You got this. For all the—

485
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:06,013
Oh, crap!

486
00:27:10,115 --> 00:27:11,137
What?

487
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,645
- Oh, my god.
- What?

488
00:27:21,498 --> 00:27:22,552
It's now or never.

489
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:27,693
Drake Palma!

490
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,560
You’re my boyfriend now!

491
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:46,450
Five...

492
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:48,208
Four...

493
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:49,536
Three...

494
00:27:49,692 --> 00:27:50,418
Two...

495
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:51,192
Onee...

496
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:52,385
We’re done!

497
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:56,724
Okay. Bye!

498
00:28:08,977 --> 00:28:12,262
From now on,
you’re my idol, bestie!

499
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:13,997
Damn, you were so cool!

500
00:28:14,408 --> 00:28:17,078
Five, four, three, two, one!

501
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:18,488
We’re done!

502
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:19,426
Bye!

503
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:21,099
Hey! Would you stay quiet?!

504
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:23,849
Oh, my god.

505
00:28:24,894 --> 00:28:26,318
Picture, please!

506
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:35,905
As if he’d even remember
you with all the exes he’s had.

507
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:41,279
It’s fine!

508
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:43,849
At least I’ve already done the request of
Sheen My Loves.

509
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:46,751
Oh, Alys.

510
00:28:47,153 --> 00:28:49,197
My ever-martyr best friend.

511
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,200
You’re really so into Sheen!

512
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,928
When are you going to tell him

513
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:58,644
you’ve completed the mission?

514
00:28:59,012 --> 00:29:01,466
Wait. Let me check if he’s on the rooftop.

515
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:02,988
Bye!

516
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:04,748
Alright. Congrats, bestie!

517
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,240
Kei.

518
00:29:27,604 --> 00:29:29,225
Why’d you ask me to come here!?

519
00:29:29,328 --> 00:29:31,068
I love you and I want you back.

520
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:34,372
Don't you get it, Sheen?

521
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:36,568
We're over!

522
00:29:36,592 --> 00:29:37,885
Why are you acting like this?

523
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:41,974
Is this because of that Drake Palma guy?

524
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:44,560
What do you care?

525
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,490
Come on, Kei.

526
00:29:47,607 --> 00:29:49,203
You know he’s a player.

527
00:29:49,228 --> 00:29:50,581
He always has a new girlfriend.

528
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:51,622
Kei, please!

529
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,700
I know!

530
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:55,793
But he always dumps them anyway.

531
00:29:55,818 --> 00:29:57,779
Then why do you want to chase him?

532
00:29:58,294 --> 00:29:59,888
Do you really think
he’ll take you seriously?

533
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:03,240
I'll show you that he
will take me seriously.

534
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,555
Kei...

535
00:30:32,974 --> 00:30:34,716
I’m taking Drake back.

536
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:37,943
Damn, this life!

537
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:42,046
I’m the one who broke up with him,
and now I’m the one trying to get him back.

538
00:30:43,078 --> 00:30:45,716
But anything for you, Sheen.

539
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:47,865
I got you.

540
00:30:49,926 --> 00:30:52,470
Wow! Kei really said that?

541
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:54,480
Yeah!

542
00:30:54,505 --> 00:30:57,912
So basically, she wants to be
the first girl Drake will take seriously.

543
00:30:57,937 --> 00:30:59,522
That’s why she’s acting like that.

544
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:02,961
So, she’s just feeling challenged by Drake?

545
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,154
Pretty much.

546
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:10,458
So what’s your plan,
Ms. Alys Zyril Perez?

547
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,755
I don’t know.

548
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,544
Looks like I have to get back with Drake.

549
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,794
The way you say it—

550
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:21,693
Like you two were even officially together?

551
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:24,786
Why, weren’t we?

552
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,849
Technically, we were.

553
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,499
And take note!

554
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:31,565
I’m the one who dumped him.

555
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,627
M-E. Me!

556
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:37,224
And you’re also the one
trying to get back with him!

557
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:40,634
Y-O-U. You!

558
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,813
Aya, can you be supportive just once?

559
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:46,464
Try it!

560
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:47,825
Just try!

561
00:31:48,261 --> 00:31:50,685
It’s hard when you look like that.

562
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,189
Come on!

563
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:58,191
I’m just kidding! Fine.

564
00:31:58,191 --> 00:31:59,638
I’ll be serious now.

565
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,708
So what are you gonna do now?

566
00:32:02,913 --> 00:32:04,279
I don’t know!

567
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,292
Does this face look
like it knows what to do?

568
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,333
Huh?

569
00:32:11,345 --> 00:32:13,191
An entrepreneur needs
to have an innovative

570
00:32:13,216 --> 00:32:15,872
mindset if you want to
stand out in the market.

571
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:19,786
You also have to have or
recognize potential markets.

572
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:22,151
Ms. Perez?

573
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:27,045
Oh, shocks! Here we go again.

574
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:31,669
Ms. Perez?

575
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,019
Ms. Perez!

576
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,479
Oh! Yes, ma’am?

577
00:32:36,514 --> 00:32:38,154
Are you even listening?

578
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,656
Yes, Ma'am.

579
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:41,099
Then what did I just say?

580
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:51,724
Okay, ma’am. Let me
just ask for a detention slip.

581
00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:57,896
Go to the admin of the Student Affairs.

582
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,863
Ma'am…

583
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:10,396
Ms. Perez, I really don't know
what I can do with you anymore.

584
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,263
Same, Ma'am. Same.

585
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:23,435
Oh, Alys!

586
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:26,471
All you do is collect problems.

587
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:29,789
Ms. Perez, what brings you here?

588
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,146
Let me guess.

589
00:33:32,454 --> 00:33:33,956
Detention again?

590
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,681
Let’s see where you’re assigned today.

591
00:33:36,706 --> 00:33:39,802
Lord, please let it be the library.

592
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,575
Not the cafeteria.

593
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:43,713
Not the bathroom either, gross!

594
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,940
Please, Lord?

595
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:48,894
Just a little bit of joy, please.

596
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:50,956
There!

597
00:33:51,485 --> 00:33:53,447
You’re assigned to the computer lab.

598
00:33:53,472 --> 00:33:54,807
Thank you, Lord.

599
00:33:54,849 --> 00:34:00,062
You will be detained
together with Sheen Mendoza.

600
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,615
Seriously!?

601
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,418
Sheen!?

602
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,485
Yes, Ms. Perez!

603
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:10,364
He got caught cutting class.

604
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:15,303
What’s going on? This is a first!

605
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:18,325
Sheen’s not a regular in
detention like me.

606
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:22,347
But thank you, Lord.
You’re really easy to talk to!

607
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,186
Alright then, go on.

608
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,623
Head to the computer lab
so you don’t stay too late.

609
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,318
I’d even stay all night!

610
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:32,568
What was that, Ms. Perez?

611
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:34,947
Nothing, Ma’am. Thank you.

612
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:35,974
Bye.

613
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:38,880
Jeez, kids these days…

614
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:41,973
Where is he?

615
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:19,630
Sheen.

616
00:35:56,345 --> 00:35:57,365
Oops!

617
00:35:57,888 --> 00:35:58,888
Sorry.

618
00:36:00,182 --> 00:36:02,779
So, Drake, are you dating anyone now?

619
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,544
Huh?

620
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,611
What the hell?

621
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:18,935
What time is it?

622
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:21,462
Uhm…

623
00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:24,463
It’s 4:30.

624
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:42,943
What’s this?

625
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:47,443
Uhm… a watch?

626
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,499
What do you take me for?

627
00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:51,751
Of course, I know it’s a watch.

628
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,911
But why’d you put it on me?

629
00:36:57,098 --> 00:37:00,279
Alys, you’re a senior.

630
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,247
And you still can’t read analog?

631
00:37:04,246 --> 00:37:06,232
You rely too much on digital.

632
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:09,638
It’s the same time either way.

633
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:16,174
Fine! I’ll learn, okay? Geez.

634
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:18,786
Fine, okay! I’ll practice.

635
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,700
Remember that, okay?

636
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:24,263
Come on.

637
00:37:24,518 --> 00:37:25,911
Let’s start shutting down the computers.

638
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:35,668
Hey, Alys.

639
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,281
Let’s go.

640
00:37:46,622 --> 00:37:49,250
This is my favorite moment.

641
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:53,087
Just the two of us.

642
00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:56,310
You…

643
00:37:58,551 --> 00:37:59,593
Me...

644
00:38:01,203 --> 00:38:02,454
No Kei.

645
00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:06,240
Just me.

646
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,771
I agree.

647
00:38:20,213 --> 00:38:22,883
You and Drake look good together.

648
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,849
Like a perfect girl like me?

649
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,014
For a perfect boy like Drake.

650
00:38:33,497 --> 00:38:34,497
Speaking of…

651
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,927
Aren’t you gonna follow Drake, Kei?

652
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:42,099
No need.

653
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:44,298
I'll make him mine tomorrow.

654
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,241
You sure, girl?

655
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:47,825
Yeah!

656
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,310
What Kei wants…

657
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,146
…Kei gets.

658
00:38:51,439 --> 00:38:52,450
Right?

659
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,005
Let's go, guys.

660
00:39:03,032 --> 00:39:05,879
Alys, I’ll go ahead, okay?

661
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:07,553
Can’t walk you home today, sorry.

662
00:39:07,648 --> 00:39:08,661
Sheen!

663
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:12,583
Huhu. What do I do?

664
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:14,852
Even though I love Sheen so much,

665
00:39:14,877 --> 00:39:16,921
I’d still rather he gets
back together with Kei…

666
00:39:16,946 --> 00:39:20,283
…than see him crying like this every day.

667
00:39:21,638 --> 00:39:23,513
Being in love is such
an inconvenience!

668
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:25,458
Where the heck is Drake, anyway?

669
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:34,240
I need to follow him
and get back together with him.

670
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:37,786
All for Sheen My Loves!

671
00:39:47,571 --> 00:39:49,948
Where are you going, weirdo?

672
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,255
This guy’s house is so far!

673
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:14,021
Are we even still in the Philippines?

674
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:44,820
Huh?

675
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:47,081
A house this big?

676
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,849
It’s impossible they don’t have a car.

677
00:40:49,874 --> 00:40:53,252
Why does he have to walk this far?

678
00:40:56,196 --> 00:40:57,280
Who’s that?

679
00:40:59,566 --> 00:41:01,028
Drake has a live-in partner!

680
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,146
Okay. False alarm.

681
00:41:35,196 --> 00:41:36,822
I was really shocked by that.

682
00:41:58,758 --> 00:41:59,763
Me?

683
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:05,521
Me?!

684
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:15,388
Oh no.

685
00:42:18,632 --> 00:42:21,510
Hey, let me go, Drake.

686
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:23,622
Drake!

687
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:27,292
Hey, let me go.

688
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:32,354
Drake, who is she?

689
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,122
I’m his girlfriend.

690
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,532
I’m Alys.

691
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,175
Alys Zyril Perez...

692
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,086
...soon to be Palma. Hello!

693
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,869
Tss. What does she want now?

694
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:20,135
Yes, Alys! You can do it! You got this!

695
00:43:20,414 --> 00:43:22,492
Let’s go, Alys! You weren’t born a coward!

696
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:23,518
You got this!

697
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:25,760
You can do it.

698
00:43:26,462 --> 00:43:27,568
Oh, crap!

699
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:34,443
It's now or never.

700
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:39,094
Drake Palma!

701
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,427
You’re my boyfriend now!

702
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:45,971
Five...

703
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:47,674
Four…

704
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:49,168
Three...

705
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:49,960
Two...

706
00:43:49,985 --> 00:43:50,627
One...

707
00:43:50,652 --> 00:43:51,831
We’re done!

708
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,229
Okay! Bye!

709
00:43:59,823 --> 00:44:01,096
Well, that's a first.

710
00:44:05,672 --> 00:44:07,604
Did that girl just really break up with me?

711
00:44:09,662 --> 00:44:10,662
Yes!

712
00:44:17,596 --> 00:44:20,891
On the next episode of
Seducing Drake Palma.

713
00:44:21,402 --> 00:44:22,778
Are you stalking me now?

714
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:26,181
Sheen’s here because I’m
introducing him to my boyfriend.

715
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,603
You? Drake’s girlfriend?

716
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,016
Why are you taking my cake?

717
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:32,750
It’s mine now. Just make a new one.

718
00:44:32,775 --> 00:44:34,087
No way! This is mine!

719
00:44:34,112 --> 00:44:35,963
- It’s mine now!
- This is mine!

720
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,453
My cake!

721
00:44:39,478 --> 00:44:42,346
Hey, Drake! You’re my
boyfriend in front of Sheen and Kei!

722
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:43,970
You seriously think I like you?

723
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:45,887
Keep dreaming.

724
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:47,205
You’re ugly.
