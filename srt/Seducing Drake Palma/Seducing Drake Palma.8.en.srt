1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,086
Previously on
Seducing Drake Palma.

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:04,628
But I met someone.

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:05,655
You’re not even good-looking.

4
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:07,340
I don’t want to be handsome,

5
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,968
I just want to be loved.

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,263
By you, perhaps.

7
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,984
I know you’d like her, Mom.

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,413
Alys is right there,
she’s your girlfriend!

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,835
I know, but I want you!

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,027
I said can we break up already?

11
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,236
Why?

12
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:31,565
Because you don’t even like me.

13
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:34,503
I don’t like you either.

14
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:37,971
I don’t want to.

15
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,695
You’re horrible!

16
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,375
Why won’t you let me go?!

17
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,295
You like Aunt Katrina, don’t you?

18
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,797
Katrina’s pregnant.

19
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,052
Alys, what if I’m the father?

20
00:00:54,662 --> 00:00:56,039
What would you do?

21
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,129
Drake…

22
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,800
are you serious?

23
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,021
Come on, Drake.

24
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,150
I said I like you,

25
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,363
I didn’t say you should
make me look like a fool, right?

26
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,409
Why are you like this?

27
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,126
Does Uncle Steve know?

28
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,422
Drake, I feel bad for your Dad.

29
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,176
How about you?

30
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:19,164
How about what you feel?

31
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,896
I still like you?

32
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,691
What do you think
my feelings are—

33
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,444
a toilet you can
just flush down?

34
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,662
Alys!

35
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,752
I’m kidding! I’m not the dad.

36
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,172
What the heck! You
joke around too much!

37
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,943
But, seriously...

38
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,796
Aunt Katrina’s really pregnant?

39
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,572
Mmm.

40
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,534
You’re gonna have a sibling!

41
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:27,186
What’s so great
about having a sibling?

42
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,042
I’m fine by my own.

43
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,671
You know siblings will never
leave you, no matter what.

44
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,550
Sometimes, even
when you’re wrong,

45
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,760
they’ll still take your side.

46
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:46,639
That’s what’s nice
about having a sibling.

47
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,817
I don’t like it when
you speak profoundly.

48
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:57,612
Ugh, annoying!

49
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,365
I like you weird and shallow.

50
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,078
You like me weird and shallow?

51
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,456
So, does that mean you like me?

52
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,253
Annoying!

53
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,632
We’ll get there soon, Alys.

54
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,835
He mentioned my name again.

55
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,734
I love you, Drake Palma!

56
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,448
Miss Alys, Sir Steve is here.

57
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,116
Sir Steve?

58
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,743
Drake’s dad.

59
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,037
Ah, okay! Thank you!

60
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,709
Uncle Steve!

61
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,212
Hi!

62
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,550
Are you here to give me your gift?

63
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:49,564
Alys.

64
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:50,932
Hmm?

65
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,228
Break up with Drake.

66
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,147
Huh?

67
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:58,472
What?

68
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:02,683
Drake and I are just
getting started, and now this?

69
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,761
We’re not even at the climax
yet, and it’s already over?

70
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,117
Uncle, is this a joke?

71
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,286
What’s the reason?

72
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,539
Why is Uncle Steve mad?

73
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,334
Aunt Katrina’s pregnant,

74
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,042
shouldn’t he be happy now?

75
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,669
Besides,

76
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,620
he doesn’t even know about
Drake and Aunt Katrina, right?

77
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,331
Or maybe he knows already?

78
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,409
Alys just break up with
Drake, for everyone’s sake.

79
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,767
I don’t want to.

80
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,060
Come on, Alys!

81
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,687
Come on, Uncle Steve.

82
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,689
Why would I do that

83
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,359
when you haven’t
given me a valid reason?

84
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:44,604
You just won’t understand.

85
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,597
You’re still young.

86
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,784
Leave Drake before you get hurt.

87
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:53,538
Uncle Steve, like they say,

88
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,542
“How would you know
what’s love if there’s no pain?”

89
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,919
That’s why...

90
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:04,424
it keeps getting painful, huh?

91
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,451
Uncle Steve, please don’t cry.

92
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,261
Is something wrong?

93
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,930
You just won’t understand.

94
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,308
I’ll try to understand, promise!

95
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,269
You’re still a kid!

96
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,373
Uncle Steve, age is just a number!

97
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,401
Try me!

98
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,111
Drake even said,
I’m getting more profound now.

99
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:26,818
You sure?

100
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,573
Your Aunt Katrina’s pregnant.

101
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,582
Yes, Drake told me.

102
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,584
What did he tell you?

103
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,401
Honestly, Uncle Steve...

104
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,221
I already knew about
Aunt Katrina and Drake.

105
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,933
So I’m the only
one left in the dark.

106
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,562
Alright Alys, I’m leaving.

107
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,481
Uncle Steve!

108
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,450
Drake.

109
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,496
Mom?

110
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,757
Mom, please don’t leave me.

111
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,515
No one can replace you, Mom.

112
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,685
I’ll make sure Dad
and Katrina split up.

113
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,943
Son...

114
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,581
I’ve been gone a long time.

115
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:52,542
Let me go.

116
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:57,722
Let your dad be happy.

117
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,039
And you too.

118
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,414
You need to be happy—for yourself.

119
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:11,597
It’s time to let go, Drake.

120
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,929
No, Mom.

121
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,865
No, Mom.

122
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,075
Let me go.

123
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
No.

124
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:21,977
No.

125
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,397
Mom.

126
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,083
Mom.

127
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,300
Mom!

128
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,131
Mom!

129
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,009
Let me go.

130
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,394
Mom.

131
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,165
Ma’am, please eat.

132
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,710
Nanny, call Drake.

133
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:28,819
Yes, Sir.

134
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,468
Sir Steve is calling you.

135
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:44,952
What?

136
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:47,680
How long have you been
keeping this relationship from me?

137
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:49,323
Come on, Steve!

138
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,607
Why do you care?

139
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:53,998
Drake, show some
respect. I’m your father.

140
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,697
We’re not in a relationship, Steve.

141
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,075
To be honest,

142
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:01,897
all I feel for Drake is concern.

143
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:03,858
He needs someone to talk to.

144
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,041
Someone to lean on.

145
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,793
That’s what I am to him.

146
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,711
Nothing more than that.

147
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:13,678
Believe me when I say you’re
the father of the baby I’m carrying.

148
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,759
Why would I believe you?

149
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,094
How would I even know for sure?

150
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,137
I’m barely ever home!

151
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:21,957
For all I know, something’s
going on between you two!

152
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,109
I reserve my first time for Alys.

153
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,062
Then why are you
only telling me now?

154
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,439
Why wait until we’re
already fighting?

155
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,441
Because I hate you
for replacing Mom.

156
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,487
I tried getting Katrina
to break you up –

157
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,823
for mom, for me.

158
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,626
I’m very disappointed, Dad.

159
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,537
Drake, if you’ve got a problem,

160
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:46,404
get out of my house!

161
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:48,464
But I’ll buy you your own condo.

162
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,460
Uncle Steve, don’t kick Drake out.

163
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,713
He’s still a minor!

164
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,507
Stupid, I’m already eighteen!

165
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,276
Still!

166
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,379
We’re only in senior
high school, Uncle Steve!

167
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:03,281
Please, don’t kick him out.

168
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,766
This is for the best, Alys.

169
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,784
Trust me.

170
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,977
Best for what?

171
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,647
He’s leaving while
you two are fighting?

172
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,109
Uncle Steve, make love not hate.

173
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,110
Don’t intrude!

174
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,050
I’m still talking to your Dad!

175
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,282
Uncle Steve, please.

176
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,699
Steve…

177
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,189
Come on, Alys.

178
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:31,876
Uncle Steve, can’t it
wait until after graduation?

179
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,894
It’s just two weeks away!

180
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:35,584
I’ve made up my mind.

181
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:36,752
I’ll call the agent.

182
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:39,153
Help Drake pack up.

183
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,679
Don’t you love Drake?

184
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,558
I love him that’s why I’m doing this.

185
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,656
Sorry, Steve.

186
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:29,032
I should’ve told you from the start.

187
00:13:29,805 --> 00:13:33,225
But I was afraid I’d ruin your
relationship with your son.

188
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:39,885
Katrina,

189
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:43,185
do you love me...

190
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:45,018
or are we just fooling around?

191
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:50,412
Because I really love you.

192
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:53,299
I love you, Steve.

193
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:58,126
That’s why I apologized
when I messed up, right?

194
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:04,360
What about Drake—do
you love him too?

195
00:14:04,564 --> 00:14:05,668
No.

196
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:07,111
I don’t love Drake.

197
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,765
Not romantically.

198
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:12,034
I love you.

199
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,105
You heard what he said, right?

200
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:18,205
Why he did all those things.

201
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,105
I just couldn’t tell you...

202
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:24,346
how Drake was treating me,

203
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,815
because I was scared.

204
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:30,965
Scared to lose him?

205
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,277
I’m scared...

206
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:38,252
that I’d ruin your
relationship with your son.

207
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,854
Drake is still young.

208
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,593
He’s full of anger.

209
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,472
The least I could do
was to be there for him.

210
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,932
That’s all it was.

211
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,436
We were okay, Steve.

212
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,002
I didn’t want to cause any trouble.

213
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,025
Especially now.

214
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,694
Okay.

215
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,783
I accept your explanation

216
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,538
Thank you, Steve.

217
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,915
Thank you.

218
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:23,101
Get changed, we’re
going to the OB-GYN

219
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,383
Thank you.

220
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,154
Why?

221
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,030
Sweetie!

222
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,175
Mom?

223
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,035
Come down here, quick!

224
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,327
Mom.

225
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:56,931
What is it?

226
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,848
What is it?

227
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,833
What happened? Is there a fire?

228
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,217
- What?!
- You!

229
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,878
Why didn’t you tell me?

230
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Tell you what?

231
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,905
That you and son-in-law are a thing now!

232
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,010
Hi, Bee!

233
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,616
Alright, I’ll leave you two alone
now so you can have quality time.

234
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,433
Go on.

235
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,458
What the heck, Mom!

236
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,022
Why are you here?

237
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:24,572
And why did you tell Mom that?

238
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,777
Oh, these are real flowers now.

239
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:31,405
And a voodoo doll that
looks exactly like you!

240
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,075
And chocolates!

241
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,014
Sugar-free.

242
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,835
Stop being so extra, Kent Justin!

243
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,225
I’ll kick you!

244
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,545
You’re so brutal, Bee!

245
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,631
Why are you here?

246
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,010
Can’t I visit my girlfriend?

247
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,845
It feels so good saying
you’re my girlfriend!

248
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,163
You’re so over the top!

249
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,283
Mmm, but you love me anyway!

250
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,352
Yuck!

251
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:04,214
Admit it. You’re totally
in love with me, Bee!

252
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,315
You’re so cringe!

253
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,403
Oh well. What can you do, Aya?

254
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,612
You said yes.

255
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,031
So deal with it!

256
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,490
- My gosh!
- Hi, Bee!

257
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,937
Chocolates.

258
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,033
It’s sugar-free, right?

259
00:17:19,058 --> 00:17:20,059
Sugar-free, promise!

260
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:25,017
How to Decipher Drake Palma 101:

261
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,629
If you ask him something
and he doesn’t answer,

262
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,548
that means it’s okay.

263
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,010
Because if it isn’t,
he’ll just go “Tss!”.

264
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:34,361
Okay.

265
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,386
Aja!

266
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
Uhm...

267
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:48,509
Your Dad said you should
start packing your stuff.

268
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,359
Tss.

269
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,214
What are you thinking?

270
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,839
Huh?

271
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,383
You have that weird face, again.

272
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,486
Weird face?

273
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,596
Like you’re trying to
harass me or something.

274
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,597
Tss!

275
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,484
You’re the one who said you’re
“reserving your first” for me!

276
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,711
But you got butterflies, didn’t you?

277
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,080
Huh?

278
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,272
How did he know?

279
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,443
Whatever, Palma!

280
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,075
He barely talks, Lord.
But when he does...

281
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,495
my heart can’t handle it.

282
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,121
Pack my things.

283
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:50,441
This guy has no shame!

284
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,835
Do I look like your maid?

285
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,526
No.

286
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,500
But you like me and
I’ll use that as my advantage.

287
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,070
Wow!

288
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:03,951
Tss.

289
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,429
Fine, I enjoy packing anyway.

290
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:07,992
I’m an expert.

291
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,528
Suitcase number one:

292
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:17,156
Uniform and school stuff.

293
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,816
Suitcase number two: your clothes.

294
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,497
Wow, everything’s for showing off.

295
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,890
You’re such a model.

296
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,792
And then, last but not least...

297
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:30,769
Suitcase number three:

298
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,963
all your grooming essentials.

299
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,298
Aja!

300
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:42,139
I feel like Drake’s housewife,
picking out his outfits.

301
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,604
What am I forgetting?

302
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,690
Shorts? T-shirt?

303
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,209
Shocks!

304
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,234
Underwear?!

305
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,790
Tss.

306
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,129
You’ve got the wrong idea!

307
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,954
Do you even know
what I’m thinking?

308
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,030
My heart, get ready.

309
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:30,729
Here comes another pick-up line
that’ll keep me up all night!

310
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,106
And why are you
holding my underwear?

311
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:35,469
I didn’t mean to!

312
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,500
My hand just landed on it!

313
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,322
Accidentally?

314
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,000
You’re a perv!

315
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,165
Hey, that’s harsh! I’m not!

316
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,055
You just want to see my abs.

317
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,671
You’re the worst!

318
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,138
Satisfied?

319
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,946
Bee, come on.

320
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,698
It’s just a simple math problem.

321
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,171
What’s “simple”
about math problems?

322
00:21:27,196 --> 00:21:28,537
My brain hurts!

323
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,289
Bee, think about it.

324
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,758
The entrance exam’s next week.

325
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,352
Of course, I want us both in SCA.

326
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,880
As if you’ll pass!

327
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,924
Of course, I’m smart!

328
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,592
What about you?

329
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,180
Are you saying I’m dumb?

330
00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:49,658
Even if you were...

331
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,485
I’d still love you to bits.

332
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,898
Gross!

333
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,813
Come on, let’s study again.

334
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,538
Game!

335
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:03,780
I don’t want to anymore!

336
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,574
My brain can’t take it, Kent!

337
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,743
Bee, don’t say you can’t.

338
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:09,407
Say “I got this!”

339
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:11,346
I really can’t!

340
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,956
You’re so pushy!

341
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,417
I’ll never pass!

342
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,085
I’ll just go to Brenford.

343
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,312
Brenford?

344
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,839
So, what’s gonna happen?
You’ll leave me all alone at SCA?

345
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,633
Hmm? Huh?

346
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,177
You’re way too clingy.

347
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,469
Hey, FYI...

348
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,932
our subdivisions are
right next to each other.

349
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:32,524
Yeah, but...

350
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,145
it’s different if we’re
in the same school.

351
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:36,979
I’ll miss you.

352
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:39,505
Tss.

353
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,961
That’s why we’re doing this.

354
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,694
We’re always together, right?

355
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,489
What if you don’t pass SCA?

356
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,353
Should I just go to Brenford too?

357
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,727
You’re so dramatic!

358
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,704
Just go to SCA!

359
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,498
Don’t waste your brain.

360
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,956
Besides,

361
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,024
isn’t it obvious that you’re
welcome here in our house?

362
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,881
My Mom basically worships you.

363
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,567
So study!

364
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,718
You got this, Bee!

365
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,695
This one’s easy, promise!

366
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,846
Focus!

367
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,681
I’m right here to help.

368
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:13,977
- I’m done!
- No, read! There!

369
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,948
Drake, just curious...

370
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,328
you said you want me to be
more honest with you, right?

371
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:36,431
Tss.

372
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,543
Is it really true nothing’s going
on with you and Aunt Katrina?

373
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,090
Because...

374
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,218
you brought her cake before, right?

375
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,303
I saw you kiss her.

376
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,015
Then Aya also saw—

377
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,143
You really are my
stalker, aren’t you?

378
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,440
Did you see us kiss?

379
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,946
That’s because she
always avoids my attempts.

380
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,704
Aki, what are you doing?!

381
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,584
In fairness to her.

382
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,919
I guess...

383
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,172
she really loves my Dad.

384
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,425
Okay.

385
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,928
We’re almost there.

386
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,524
Also...

387
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:48,379
Could you take care of the stuff?

388
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:11,524
Mr. Palma?

389
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,070
Welcome to Cove Tower!

390
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,477
Sir Steve told me
you’d be arriving today.

391
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,587
By the way, I’m the condo manager.

392
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,275
Yes, this is Drake Palma.

393
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,068
Thanks!

394
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,736
Sorry he’s a bit grumpy.

395
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,004
No worries.

396
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,438
Right this way, Sir.

397
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,352
Right this way, sir

398
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,764
This way.

399
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:03,525
Oh my, it’s so nice here.

400
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,657
I want my own condo unit too.

401
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:08,198
Sir Steve chose a
high-end two-bedroom unit.

402
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,653
That offers both space
and comfortability.

403
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,634
And Ma’am, please hold on.

404
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:17,852
Wow, Uncle Steve moves fast!

405
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,912
We just packed and he
already sent your helper...

406
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,706
the address and the passcode.

407
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:28,086
But this is farther from my house than his.

408
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,589
We’ll be in a long‑distance relationship.

409
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,446
Sir, do you want to
change your passcode?

410
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,639
Uhm Drake, they said
change your passcode.

411
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,016
1131.

412
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,060
1131. Okay thank you, Sir.

413
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,328
Thank you!

414
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,353
11-what?

415
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,527
11-31.

416
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,531
November 31.

417
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,824
Our monthsary.

418
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,826
Sometimes...

419
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,107
I don’t even know why I
ended up with a noob like you.

420
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:10,029
Sometimes I don’t even care about
Drake’s harsh words anymore.

421
00:27:10,938 --> 00:27:12,435
That’s just how he is.

422
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,779
Drake isn’t Drake
without the harsh words.

423
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,888
But despite that...

424
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:23,007
the moment he throws
in that classic Drake‑style flirt?

425
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,642
Game over.

426
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,271
Every annoyance disappears.

427
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,387
Kids!

428
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:32,747
- Have some snacks first!
- Hi, Auntie!

429
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,737
Thanks so much!

430
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:41,357
Son‑in‑law, I made
juice as sweet as you!

431
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:46,247
And some sticky rice,
so you’ll stick together!

432
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,974
- Thank you, Auntie.
- Mom, come on!

433
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,851
My head hurts tutoring her.

434
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,019
She’s hopeless.

435
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,130
Oh, son‑in‑law,
be patient with Aya.

436
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,786
When I was pregnant with
her, I almost miscarried.

437
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,982
Maybe it affected her brain!

438
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:02,347
So please be patient, okay?

439
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,683
Of course, future mom‑in‑law.

440
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,781
Well, look at you
dropping “mom‑in‑law”.

441
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,380
Improving!

442
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,272
Obviously we’re
headed there, Bee!

443
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,624
Hmm?

444
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,609
As if I’d follow you to church!

445
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,396
Then city hall it is!

446
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:18,713
You’re so pushy, huh?

447
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,013
Of course—I love you, Bee!

448
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,368
You two are so sweet!

449
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:25,687
Aya, I miss your Dad even more!

450
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:26,974
Whatever, you guys.

451
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,558
Okay, I’ll leave you two for now.

452
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,544
- Thank you, Mommy-in-law!
- Hit the books, you two.

453
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,585
Copy that!

454
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,838
Got you!

455
00:28:35,974 --> 00:28:36,974
So, let’s eat?

456
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:39,013
Will I even pass SCA?

457
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:40,694
What if I don’t?

458
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,719
Bee?

459
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,405
Then you don’t!

460
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,265
If it’s not meant to be, don’t force it.

461
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:47,589
Bee!

462
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:50,112
You look silly smiling alone.

463
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,815
KL.

464
00:28:54,872 --> 00:28:55,872
Mmm?

465
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,446
If you’re at SCA
and I’m at Brenford…

466
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,547
Mm-hmm?

467
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,449
Can I find an MU
partner over there?

468
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,826
And you’re actually
asking me first?

469
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,956
Well, you might
think I’m cheating.

470
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,341
Don’t be like that, Aya.

471
00:29:18,482 --> 00:29:20,404
He just called me
“Aya” for the first time.

472
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:22,701
He must be serious.

473
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,555
He always calls me “Bee.”

474
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,183
You know, all my exes...

475
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,226
cheated on me.

476
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,812
Please don’t join the club.

477
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,888
You’re the one I’m
dead serious about,

478
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,819
and you’d be the
worst heart‑breaker?

479
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,447
Don’t be like that, Aya.

480
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,907
Let’s take a break.

481
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,193
Here, open up.

482
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,632
Open… up!

483
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,676
I know you’re hungry.

484
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,380
Very good, Babe.

485
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,035
It’s the weekend, what are you doing?

486
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,037
It’s boring at home.

487
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,497
So I decided to study instead.

488
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,083
Come, stay here.

489
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,169
Aren’t you taking the SCA exam?

490
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,054
What for? I’m leaving anyway.

491
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,427
It feels so good having
him beside me again.

492
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,647
I don’t even know what I was
thinking when I broke up with him.

493
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,190
He’s so kind,

494
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,024
affectionate,

495
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:03,466
and he really took care of me.

496
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,530
But still, just try!

497
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:07,240
It would be a waste if you don’t!

498
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,076
Would you mind being my tutor?

499
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,785
Sure.

500
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,162
As long as you know how to listen.

501
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,162
Will you listen?

502
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:16,099
Yes, I will.

503
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:21,830
Are you really leaving, Kei?

504
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,107
Everything’s already planned.

505
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,802
I’m leaving after graduation.

506
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,179
Two weeks.

507
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,559
In two weeks, you're leaving.

508
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,812
And in two weeks,
we're graduating.

509
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,566
So much will happen in two weeks.

510
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:46,661
That’s why we need to make
the most of the time we have left.

511
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,160
Do we really have to
break up in two weeks?

512
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,413
I’m going somewhere far, Sheen.

513
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,083
I don’t want to
be unfair to you.

514
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,712
There you go again,

515
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,632
making all the
decisions yourself!

516
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,796
You really think
that’s unfair to me?

517
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,596
Hundreds of miles away...

518
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,181
that’s how far it is!

519
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,101
Hundreds of miles...

520
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,771
but my heart will
always be beside you.

521
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,570
Sounds fair?

522
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,783
You know,

523
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,620
I really love you!

524
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,151
Breakfast, Sir.

525
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,053
Thank you so much, Karen!

526
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,992
Why aren’t you studying?

527
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,279
Hey.

528
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:12,882
Dad.

529
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,101
Why aren’t you studying?

530
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,468
You’re prioritizing
photography again!

531
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,296
That won’t be able to feed you.

532
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,709
Your SCA exam is tomorrow.

533
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,627
You need to get in!

534
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,531
But I don’t want Business Ad, Dad.

535
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,476
Then who’s supposed
to inherit our business?

536
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,351
You’re the only
one I’m counting on.

537
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,055
So now it’s my fault?

538
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,767
You’re always so hard-headed.

539
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,938
Why can’t you be
more like Drake?

540
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,403
Okay fine, I’ll study.

541
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:53,239
Just so I can live up to even a fraction
of the Palma family’s golden boy.

542
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,224
Why don’t you make
Drake your son instead?

543
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,496
At least he’s not a
disappointment, right?

544
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
What now?

545
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,651
What are you staring at?

546
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,277
Open the door.

547
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,922
Why me? You live there.

548
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,947
You do it!

549
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,336
You know the passcode.

550
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,963
I have short-term memory loss.

551
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,590
I forgot it already.

552
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,521
Stand there until you remember.

553
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:07,979
What?

554
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,733
Drake!

555
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,193
Drake!

556
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,905
Hey!

557
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,658
Drake!

558
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,179
That weirdo can totally hear me.

559
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,766
He’s just pretending not to.

560
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,353
Drake!

561
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,378
Hey!

562
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:34,816
Oh no!

563
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,300
Come on, Drake!

564
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,598
I know that weirdo can hear me.

565
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,100
he’s just ignoring me!

566
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,648
Wait.

567
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,649
Okay.

568
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,277
1121.

569
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,197
1124?

570
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,793
1120.

571
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,645
Ugh!

572
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,172
You’re so annoying!

573
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,090
Drake!

574
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,093
Drake!

575
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,136
Tss.

576
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,321
My noob girlfriend!

577
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,181
Hello?!

578
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,961
I know you can hear
me and see me, Drake!

579
00:36:30,445 --> 00:36:31,445
Did she really forget?

580
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,818
How could she forget
such an important date?

581
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,406
Who could possibly remember—

582
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:42,949
Sheen!

583
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,625
Alys?

584
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,044
Hello?

585
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,295
Sheen!

586
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:57,965
Alys, why’d you call?

587
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,759
When is Drake and I’s monthsary again?

588
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,928
Isn’t it November 31?

589
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,096
But Alys, isn’t it—

590
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:04,906
That’s right!

591
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,640
November 31.

592
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,724
Thank you so much,
thank you, thank you!

593
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,687
There’s no November 31, Alys.

594
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,161
What are you saying, of course there is!

595
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,186
Bye.

596
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,272
Okay.

597
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,110
1131.

598
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,196
Yes!

599
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:23,758
Better save that in my notes!

600
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,851
Drake might go into
his weirdo mode again...

601
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:29,360
and leave me stranded
outside his condo!

602
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,592
You jerk!

603
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,888
It’s not my fault
you’re such a noob.

604
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,521
You keep calling me a noob, huh!

605
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,615
Rolling your eyes
like that, so dramatic!

606
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,910
What’s so funny?

607
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,448
You.

608
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,762
You’re so mean!

609
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,369
You’re on a roll!

610
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,161
I know.

611
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,184
You’re so harsh with your words, Drake!

612
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,753
Can you tone it down a bit?

613
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,051
I’m okay with it,

614
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,207
but other people might
think you’re a terrible person.

615
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,349
Can you just tone it down, Drake?

616
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:31,401
Just a little.

617
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,437
They won’t hear my harsh words...

618
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:35,980
because I won’t talk to them.

619
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,024
Why don’t you even talk
to them in the first place?

620
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,483
Why are you such an introvert?

621
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,126
Because they can’t
catch my attention.

622
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,237
Because you are so picky!

623
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,659
You’re the only person I talk to,

624
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,868
in case you haven’t noticed,

625
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,439
because you’re such a noob.

626
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,041
What the heck.

627
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,985
I’m getting butterflies even if
what he’s saying isn’t sweet at all.

628
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,133
So that means...

629
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,345
I got your attention?

630
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,892
Calm down, heart.

631
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:15,877
Don’t palpitate too much.

632
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,940
Catch is an understatement.

633
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,276
You got me whipped,

634
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,656
and smitten hard.

635
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,257
I didn’t realize we finished
sorting out your stuff at 7:00 PM.

636
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,510
Mom will be mad.

637
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,720
Oh, he’s here.

638
00:39:50,361 --> 00:39:51,728
Bye, Drake! I’m heading out!

639
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,228
Bye!

640
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:02,775
Good evening, Sir.

641
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,703
If something happens to her,

642
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,914
I’ll chase you to hell’s end.

643
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,369
Ma’am, your boyfriend is so sweet.

644
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,027
Bye.

645
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,677
I know this! Kent taught me this!

646
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,512
I just need to remember.

647
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,646
Is this in the book?!

648
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,537
What’s the answer?
This is so hard!

649
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,438
Aja! I can do this!

650
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,154
I’m good at guessing!

651
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,610
I need to pass!

652
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,616
So, what do we do now?

653
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,159
Huh?

654
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,453
Hon, relax.

655
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,248
Mom?

656
00:41:47,447 --> 00:41:48,355
Aya, sweetheart!

657
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,342
Come down here,
son-in-law is here!

658
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,553
Bee!

659
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,072
Thank you!

660
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,259
Of course,
mommy-in-law, anytime!

661
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,311
Bee!

662
00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:04,997
What’s that?

663
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,384
My admission letter from SCA!

664
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:07,732
Where’s yours?

665
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,402
Oh, I don’t have one.

666
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,587
I didn’t get one.

667
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,612
What?

668
00:42:12,637 --> 00:42:14,572
But today’s the distribution of letters.

669
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,324
Maybe it’s just late.

670
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,595
I really didn’t get one, Kent!

671
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,663
What if I didn’t pass?

672
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,456
Mom.

673
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,585
So what do you want
to happen now, Alys?

674
00:42:28,303 --> 00:42:29,303
What?

675
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,800
Hon, I’ll handle this.

676
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,052
You deal with her.

677
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,761
Nanny!

678
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,098
Dad.

679
00:42:42,614 --> 00:42:43,621
What’s this?

680
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,439
Notification letter from
Saint Collete Academy.

681
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,025
You didn’t pass.

682
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,487
I know, Dad.

683
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,740
I barely answered
anything on the exam.

684
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,504
What are we going to do now?

685
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,871
I don’t even know how to
convince your mom last night.

686
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,957
She’s about to book your ticket.

687
00:43:07,473 --> 00:43:09,176
You’re really sending
me to Nana’s?

688
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,051
Come on, Alys.

689
00:43:16,421 --> 00:43:17,426
Look...

690
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:21,432
We let you go to a regular school even when
we knew your grades weren’t doing well,

691
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,598
because you said
that’s what you wanted.

692
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,027
You actually did better when
you were homeschooled!

693
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,715
We just wanted you to improve,

694
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,535
but you really tested
your Mom’s patience.

695
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,824
Dad, please don’t
send me to the States.

696
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,202
Okay, here’s the plan...

697
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,348
scare your mom.

698
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,123
Tell her you’ll run away.

699
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,418
Say you’ll take me
and Dane to the States,

700
00:43:48,649 --> 00:43:50,311
and she’ll be left behind.

701
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,004
- Go ahead, tell her that.
- Seriously, Dad?

702
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,147
Yup, she’ll agree.

703
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,840
Thank you, Dad! You’re the best!

704
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,009
So what now, Bee?

705
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,555
I’m not ready for a
long-distance relationship!

706
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,074
That’s so dramatic.

707
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,004
SCA and Brenford are
basically next-door neighbors.

708
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,527
What if I strangle you instead?

709
00:44:08,552 --> 00:44:11,301
Of course I want us to be
in the same school, Bee!

710
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,683
So what do we do?

711
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:20,282
Let’s test how much
this cockroach loves me.

712
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,326
Then just go to Brenford too.

713
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,622
Yeah!

714
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,208
I’m really thinking about it

715
00:44:31,207 --> 00:44:31,935
Seriously?

716
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,337
Yeah, I’m serious!

717
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,660
But I’m still figuring out
how to tell my parents.

718
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,902
They might have a heart attack
when they find out I’m not going to SCA.

719
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:43,946
What do we do, Bee?

720
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,431
My God.

721
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,644
- Uhm, Kent.
- Huh?

722
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,729
What’s this?

723
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,449
Once again, congratulations.

724
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,346
We look forward to
welcoming you to campus…

725
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,080
Bee, you passed!

726
00:45:08,296 --> 00:45:10,298
Oh, my God!

727
00:45:10,323 --> 00:45:11,350
I know.

728
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,584
I was just messing
with you earlier.

729
00:45:13,428 --> 00:45:15,104
That’s so mean, Bee!

730
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,047
You played with my feelings?!

731
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,229
You’re just too gullible.

732
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,693
“Gullible?”

733
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,510
I’m gullible?

734
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,886
- No way!
- I’m gullible?!

735
00:45:22,911 --> 00:45:24,071
I’m gullible?!

736
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,764
- Stop it already!
- Nope! You’re chasing me now!

737
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,674
I’m going to hug you!

738
00:45:35,563 --> 00:45:36,563
Bee...

739
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,485
can I hug you?

740
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,338
Why are you even asking?

741
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,979
I thought you might push me away.

742
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,553
You’ve got violent tendencies.

743
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,578
You’re insane!

744
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,408
If you’re going to
hug me, just do it—

745
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,682
Thank you, Bee!

746
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,073
I’m so proud of you!

747
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,793
You know what,

748
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,838
thank God we’re not doing LDR.

749
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,925
Because I cannot live a
day without you by my side.

750
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:03,736
Whatever.

751
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,221
One more cheesy line and I
swear I’m breaking up with you!

752
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,347
Come on, Bee.

753
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,063
Kent!

754
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,752
Nanny, where’s the kosher salt?

755
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,424
You forgot again?!

756
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,073
Ugh Nanny, I told you
not to forget it.

757
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,675
I need it later!

758
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,700
Mommy?

759
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,996
Nanny always forgets!

760
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:36,250
Mommy.

761
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,925
I’m enrolling at Brenford instead.

762
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:44,902
No.

763
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,002
I filed your
application at NYCU.

764
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,390
Mom, seriously.

765
00:46:50,531 --> 00:46:52,198
Don’t “Mommy” me!

766
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,244
I told you a million times ago,

767
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:59,149
if you fail the SCA exam, we’re
shipping you off to the States!

768
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,363
But it was really hard, Mom.

769
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,096
Alys, it’s not hard!

770
00:47:07,121 --> 00:47:08,121
Aya passed!

771
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,035
Aya passed?

772
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,387
See?

773
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,831
You’re the only
one who didn’t pass!

774
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,135
You disappoint me!

775
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,165
Nanny!

776
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,257
I’m sorry, Mom.

777
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,934
I really tried studying.

778
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:43,210
But no matter how hard I squeezed
my brain, nothing came out.

779
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,338
I just couldn’t do it.

780
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:55,408
Please believe me. I really tried.

781
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:03,397
I really did my best,

782
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,383
but I still failed.

783
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,852
Mommy…

784
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,440
Mommy…

785
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,815
I’m sorry, Alys.

786
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,323
I have so many dreams for you.

787
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,367
Please, don’t let us down.

788
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:36,914
Sorry, Mom.

789
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,999
Stop saying sorry.

790
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,960
You know what, you’re
your Dad’s daughter.

791
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,379
Your Dad is smart.

792
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,557
Too bad he’s dumb
when it comes to love.

793
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,302
That’s why he ended up with Liana.

794
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,638
Mom, come on.

795
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,974
Aunt Liana hasn’t
done anything wrong.

796
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,101
Whatever.

797
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:03,148
Just follow in your Dad’s footsteps, okay?

798
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,776
Show us! You’re smart, sweetheart!

799
00:49:06,793 --> 00:49:09,838
But Mom, what would
I even do at NYCU?

800
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,491
They don’t offer the course I want.

801
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,535
Why? I thought you
liked Advertising?

802
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,135
So, what do you
wanna take up, then?

803
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,584
Baking.

804
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,461
Please?

805
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,022
Please, Mom.

806
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,482
Just one semester, I promise!

807
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,093
Just one sem at Brenford,
and if I get bad grades...

808
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,738
you can send me straight to a
community college in the U.S.

809
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:38,517
Please Mom, just
give me one chance!

810
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,744
Okay, fine.

811
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,479
One semester only, okay?

812
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,141
Thank you, Mommy!

813
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,859
Thank you, so much!

814
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,486
Better than Liana, hmm?

815
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,901
You’re really the best!

816
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,908
Yes, the bestest among everyone!

817
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,451
- That’s good.
- I love you, Mom!

818
00:49:56,476 --> 00:49:57,978
- I love you!
- I love you so much!

819
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:13,801
Tss.

820
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,354
What?

821
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,587
No wonder your bill’s so high.
You bought so much stuff.

822
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,612
Tss.

823
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,449
Why are you here?

824
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:39,994
Choose one.

825
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,695
Your Aunt Katrina’s two months pregnant.

826
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,426
Congrats.

827
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:58,221
I’m sorry you feel that
way about me and Katrina.

828
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,078
But your Mom’s
been gone a long time.

829
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,393
Okay.

830
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,188
I actually don’t care anymore.

831
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,856
Thanks, son.

832
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,735
Here.

833
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:15,968
Your admission at St. Collete Academy.

834
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,909
Once you start
college, your Mom’s will

835
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,204
allows you to access
your trust fund.

836
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,616
But Drake, once
you get the money...

837
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,295
please don’t leave me too.

838
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,254
You’re so soft.

839
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,590
No really, son.

840
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,866
I miss your grumpiness.

841
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,552
Tss.

842
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:40,756
I’m crashing at your place tonight.

843
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,433
Why can’t I?

844
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:46,163
I paid for all of this anyway.

845
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,812
I’ll pay you back.

846
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,190
Relax, I was kidding.

847
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,151
What if we just sleep
side by side tonight?

848
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,652
No.

849
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,226
Alys will stop by later.

850
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,613
You can’t sleep here.

851
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,273
Alys is coming?

852
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,476
Anyway, take care, alright?

853
00:52:02,616 --> 00:52:04,194
But your Uncle Andy said,

854
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,057
look after Alys. Respect her.

855
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,084
Don’t go starting a family just yet.

856
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,544
She’s still young.

857
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,843
You know Uncle Andy?

858
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,046
Of course!

859
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,795
I already met my future in-laws.

860
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,452
Anyway, I’m heading out.

861
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:26,960
By the way, Drake...

862
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,496
Alys is too cute, she convinced me.

863
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,960
She asked me to buy you a car.

864
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,640
I had no choice, so I bought you one.

865
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,902
It’s in the parking
lot right now, waiting.

866
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,240
Don’t you ever look at her
when she’s being cute and all.

867
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,742
That’s only for me to see.

868
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,287
I’m heading out

869
00:52:59,562 --> 00:53:00,859
You passed too, Kei!

870
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,889
Will you study here instead?

871
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,557
Please.

872
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,395
Maybe this is the end for us, Sheen.

873
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,567
At least I got to experience
being loved and how to love.

874
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,612
Are you really leaving?

875
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,656
I’ll come back.

876
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,288
Maybe in five years?

877
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,748
I’m not sure anymore.

878
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,890
Let’s end this now.

879
00:53:40,456 --> 00:53:44,253
Please don’t cry
because I’ll be leaving.

880
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,557
Smile because I’ll be returning.

881
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:49,934
Okay?

882
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,272
You’ll come back.

883
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,026
I’ll wait for you.

884
00:54:00,035 --> 00:54:01,035
I’ll come back.

885
00:54:02,212 --> 00:54:04,973
But if you end up
liking someone else...

886
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,238
don’t stop yourself,

887
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:09,153
just because you still
have feelings for me.

888
00:54:12,698 --> 00:54:16,903
Falling in love, Sheen, is
the prettiest thing in the world.

889
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,590
Okay?

890
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,809
You’re the only one I want, Kei!

891
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,896
But we can’t be sure of that.

892
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,856
You might fall for Aya or Alys,

893
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,801
so please, don’t feel
responsible for me.

894
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:45,948
Okay?

895
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,289
Goodbye, Sheen.

896
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,632
Drake?

897
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,471
Where is he?

898
00:55:50,882 --> 00:55:51,973
Drake?

899
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,686
Where could he be?

900
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,025
Uh, Drake?

901
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,403
Where is he?

902
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,883
LDR!

903
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,210
What the heck?!

904
00:56:29,709 --> 00:56:31,627
I don’t want LDR!

905
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:48,862
Oh, you’re here.

906
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:50,864
Obviously.

907
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,409
Where’d you go?

908
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,174
I took the car for a test drive.

909
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,791
Thanks for convincing Dad.

910
00:57:04,634 --> 00:57:05,634
Did you fail?

911
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,465
Wow, rude much!

912
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,884
Can’t you just ask,
“Did you pass?”

913
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:14,639
“Alys” and “Passing” can’t
be used in one sentence.

914
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:18,809
That’s so mean!

915
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,895
You’re so rude.

916
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,531
Why are you here?

917
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,327
Nothing.

918
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:37,929
Am I not allowed
to hang out here?

919
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,707
Yes, especially when
you’re messing up my condo.

920
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,249
OC!

921
00:57:47,857 --> 00:57:48,857
Uhm...

922
00:57:50,573 --> 00:57:51,573
Drake…

923
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,051
What?

924
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,013
I’ll be enrolling at Brenford.

925
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,680
I know.

926
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:58,974
How did you know?

927
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,607
Because you’re such a noob!

928
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,771
Wow, just because I didn’t
pass, I’m already a noob?

929
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,147
Why?

930
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,833
You really are a noob, aren’t you?

931
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:10,944
I know.

932
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,411
So stop rubbing it in.

933
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,284
It’s not fun to be called
“stupid” all the time.

934
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,368
Okay, fine.

935
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,996
From now on,

936
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:22,831
you’ll be my noob.

937
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:25,918
Your noob?

938
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,045
You’ll be my noob.

939
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,216
Mine and mine only.

940
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,383
Tss!

941
00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:34,725
No effect.

942
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,138
I didn’t feel butterflies at all.

943
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:39,932
How about this?

944
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,019
Alys…

945
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,733
I’ve been dying to kiss you.

946
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,309
Wait. What is it?

947
00:59:24,263 --> 00:59:25,270
Okay.

948
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:26,813
1121.

949
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,942
Did she really forget?

950
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,944
1124?

951
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,576
How could she forget
such an important date?

952
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,539
1120.

953
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,266
Hey!

954
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,792
Ugh, this is so annoying!

955
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:50,752
Drake!

956
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,220
Hello?!

957
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,841
I know you can hear
me and see me, Drake.

958
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,596
Drake!

959
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,766
Alys, come on, remember.

960
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:10,522
You’ve got this, Alys!

961
01:00:13,249 --> 01:00:14,249
Remember.

962
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,074
Alys, remember!

963
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:23,468
1131.

964
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:39,260
On the next episode of
Seducing Drake Palma.

965
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,471
Get your hands off me.

966
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,140
This is scary, I don’t wanna go in.

967
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,935
Lord, please let
me make a friend.

968
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,569
Just one.

969
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,190
Even if they’re ugly, just
as long as they don’t smell.

970
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:53,523
My noob!

971
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,485
What?

972
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,904
Good luck.

973
01:01:03,746 --> 01:01:06,540
I really miss Aya and Sheen.

974
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:08,705
Hey…

975
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,249
do you have a partner already?

976
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,210
I have a boyfriend!

977
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,629
No, I meant for the Freshman Walk.

978
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,922
Do you already have a partner?

979
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:16,981
Let’s just go together.

980
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,944
Drake, wait for me!

981
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,917
You didn’t text me yesterday,
I was waiting for you!

982
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,637
I have class.

983
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,305
Wait, Drake.

984
01:01:33,585 --> 01:01:34,499
What?!

985
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,651
I said be careful!

986
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:41,196
Ouch!

987
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,823
Drake!

988
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,161
Who is that?
