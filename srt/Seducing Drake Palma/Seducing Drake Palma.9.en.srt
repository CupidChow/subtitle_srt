1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,836
Previously on
Seducing Drake Palma.

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,129
Get out of my house.

3
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,256
But I’ll buy you your own condo.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,941
Open the door.

5
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,968
I have short-term memory loss.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,177
I forgot it already.

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,430
Stand there until you remember.

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,098
1121.

9
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,492
My noob girlfriend!

10
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,727
Drake!

11
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,413
You’ve got this, Alys!

12
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,523
1131.

13
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,542
You’re so harsh with your words, Drake!

14
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,027
I’m okay with it,

15
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,571
but other people might
think you’re a terrible person.

16
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,090
They won’t hear my harsh words

17
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,508
because I won’t talk to them.

18
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,160
If something happens to her,

19
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,911
I’ll chase you to hell’s end.

20
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,621
Why are you such an introvert?

21
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,040
Because they can’t
catch my attention.

22
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,625
You’re the only person I talk to,

23
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,586
in case you haven’t noticed,

24
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,253
because you’re such a noob!

25
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,839
So that means…

26
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,758
I got your attention?

27
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,552
Catch is an understatement.

28
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,596
You got me whipped,

29
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,183
and smitten – hard.

30
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,586
Oh, high school.

31
00:01:26,936 --> 00:01:30,090
St. Collete High will
always be a part of who I am.

32
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:32,102
A lot of things happened.

33
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,281
There were moments that will become
my core memories moving forward.

34
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:39,990
I fell in love with
my best friend Sheen.

35
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,312
Sheen, on the other hand...

36
00:01:41,346 --> 00:01:43,156
I love you and I want you back.

37
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:44,182
Don’t you get it, Sheen?

38
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:46,268
We’re over!

39
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:48,353
He experienced his
first heartbreak.

40
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:50,230
Do you still love her?

41
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:51,973
Yes.

42
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:53,583
Of course,

43
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,026
I’ve learned to let go of Sheen

44
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:57,053
and my feelings for him.

45
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:59,529
Make Drake Palma your boyfriend!

46
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:02,170
And I fell in love with a weirdo.

47
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:03,447
Drake Palma!

48
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,126
You’re my boyfriend now!

49
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:11,568
Even my ever-jaded best
friend, Aya, fell in love.

50
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:13,092
I’ll treat you, Bee!

51
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:14,479
Can you believe it?

52
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:15,772
She said yes to Kent!

53
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:17,816
Who would’ve thought?

54
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:19,568
I like you, Bee!

55
00:02:19,593 --> 00:02:22,279
But, I’m genuinely
happy for them.

56
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,335
And for me...

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,527
I’m his girlfriend!

58
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:25,849
I’m Alys.

59
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,894
Alys Zyril Perez, soon to be Palma!

60
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,113
What used to be a mission
impossible to seduce Drake Palma,

61
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:34,733
feels like a mission accomplished.

62
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:35,775
Bestie, time to go home.

63
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:37,792
I think.

64
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:39,082
I’m territorial.

65
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:40,821
I’m territorial.

66
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:42,419
I’m territorial.

67
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:48,256
High school gave me a
roller coaster of emotions.

68
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,749
Keep dreaming. You’re ugly.

69
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:53,545
Happiness and laughter,

70
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,574
Aja!

71
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,059
sadness and tears,

72
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:58,404
But I promise...

73
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:02,022
that I’ll try to fall
while you’re falling.

74
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:04,545
And a ton of heart palpitations.

75
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:13,451
But like all things,

76
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:14,930
there’s an ending.

77
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:18,305
My high school life ends here.

78
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,390
Because let’s be real,

79
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,420
high school isn’t forever.

80
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:26,740
New chapter unlocked!

81
00:03:27,246 --> 00:03:30,201
I’ll miss my friends so much.

82
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:33,924
Even if Brenford is just
a walk away from SCA,

83
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:36,685
I feel like I will
still get FOMO.

84
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:41,412
Just when things seem to be
going well with Drakey baby,

85
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:43,355
now we’re in an LDR.

86
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,280
But whatever!

87
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:49,482
For now, vacation mode!

88
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:52,654
We’re heading to the
US to visit my little brother.

89
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:56,076
Whatever comes next in college life,

90
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:58,803
St. Collete, it’s up to you.

91
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:53,877
I love you, Drake Palma!

92
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:18,128
Tss.

93
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:19,572
What do you want?

94
00:05:20,307 --> 00:05:21,307
You.

95
00:05:22,252 --> 00:05:23,670
Can I have you now?

96
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,569
Tss.

97
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:25,765
Shut up!

98
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:50,675
Tripp Marco Palma!

99
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,480
Tripp Marco Palma!

100
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:03,418
Can you hear me?!

101
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:05,699
What is your problem?!

102
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:08,602
None of your business, Pa.

103
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,180
What?

104
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,657
You didn’t even get into SCA

105
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,176
and now you’re acting like this?

106
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:18,090
Why are you like this?!

107
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:20,625
If you don’t want me,

108
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:22,363
go switch with Uncle Steve.

109
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:23,714
Or better yet,

110
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:25,196
send me back to Mom.

111
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:29,068
You better not –

112
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:13,286
I wonder what Alys is
doing in the States right now.

113
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:18,485
Bird brain.

114
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,566
You’re rude!

115
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:25,171
Miss Blossom.

116
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:29,174
We’ll get there soon, Alys.

117
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,712
Why don’t I have her number?

118
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:37,496
I should have her number.

119
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:38,885
Silly me.

120
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,371
Hey, Palma.

121
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:52,448
Did you miss me?

122
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:54,409
What are you doing here?

123
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:55,817
Silly!

124
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:57,235
I waited for you.

125
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:01,447
Drake!

126
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,824
Stay right there,
I’ll text you later.

127
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,900
Drake, Drake, Drake,
it’s always Drake!

128
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:40,379
Drake this, Drake that!

129
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,573
“Why can’t you be like
your cousin Drake?”

130
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,326
Okay.

131
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,515
Your SCA exam is tomorrow.

132
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:03,189
You need to get in!

133
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:06,075
But I don’t want Business Ad, Dad.

134
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,223
You’re always so hard-headed.

135
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:11,844
Why can’t you be
more like Drake?

136
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:19,517
You didn’t even get into SCA,
and now you’re acting like this?!

137
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:22,359
Why are you like this?!

138
00:09:22,904 --> 00:09:25,615
If you don’t want me,
go switch with Uncle Steve.

139
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:28,849
It’s a good thing
I didn’t get into SCA.

140
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:31,039
For once,

141
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:32,641
I can forge my way through life

142
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,999
without being compared
to my “amazing” cousin.

143
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:38,920
I can live my life here in
Brenford, outside of his shadow.

144
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:44,676
It’s a shame I wasn’t able to find a way
to take Fine Arts like I wanted.

145
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,552
But it’s okay,

146
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,223
I’ll just let Pa have his way
with this Business Ad course.

147
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,100
My plans can wait.

148
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,286
Wrong timing.

149
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:14,707
Maybe next time.

150
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:22,424
Uh, excuse me, Miss!

151
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,838
Excuse me, Miss!
Do you need help?

152
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,552
Where’s the Registrar’s Office?

153
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,642
I need my schedule for tomorrow.

154
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,565
The offices are closed.

155
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,573
What’s your course?

156
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,625
Culinary Arts.

157
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:37,620
Culinary Arts.

158
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:39,200
I know someone in the office.

159
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,453
I can send you your schedule.

160
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:42,801
Really?

161
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:45,044
You’re so nice!

162
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:46,793
Anything for a pretty lady!

163
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:52,202
Can I get your full
name and email address?

164
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,619
Sure!

165
00:10:57,415 --> 00:11:02,503
Alys…Perez…

166
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,092
Thank you.
What’s your name again?

167
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,117
Uhm...

168
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:11,439
Tripp!

169
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:14,629
Should I mention “Palma”?

170
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:15,850
Hmm.

171
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:17,428
Not yet.

172
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:18,895
Uh, Tripp. Tripp Marco.

173
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:20,473
Thanks, Tripp!

174
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:22,022
Bye.

175
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,676
I really approve of
your taste, Drake.

176
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:34,386
We are cousins, after all.

177
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,417
St. Collete,

178
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:44,045
I know I’m not part
of SCA anymore,

179
00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:45,379
but I hope you guide me.

180
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,488
Please guide me.

181
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,320
I hope I’ll meet new
friends in Brenford,

182
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:53,477
and I hope college
life won’t be too hard.

183
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:55,274
Amen.

184
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:56,815
Oh, and P.S.

185
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,016
I hope my relationship
with Drakey Baby goes smoothly, too!

186
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:03,067
Please!

187
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:04,092
Amen again.

188
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:08,825
Let’s go, Alys.

189
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:10,670
Alys Zyril Perez!

190
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:11,947
Aja!

191
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,288
Get your hands off me!

192
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:21,182
I don’t want to!

193
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,141
Tss.

194
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,142
We’ll be late!

195
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,646
I don’t care!

196
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:27,623
It’s scary, I don’t
want to go in!

197
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:29,615
It’s true,

198
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,967
going in is scary.

199
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:35,054
I don’t know a single
person here in Brenford.

200
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,846
It seems I’m in an
alternate world.

201
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:40,457
They’re all at St.
Collete Academy,

202
00:12:40,914 --> 00:12:44,776
and I’m the forsaken one!
Huhuhu!

203
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:46,357
You’re such a child!

204
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,018
Well, I am still a minor!

205
00:12:49,114 --> 00:12:51,299
I’m only seventeen!

206
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,073
Time is running, hands off.

207
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,245
Drake, please!

208
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:01,837
Okay.

209
00:13:06,124 --> 00:13:08,409
Lord, please let me
meet some friends.

210
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:09,352
Even just one!

211
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,300
Even if they’re ugly,
just please not stinky!

212
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:13,317
Noob!

213
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:14,682
Please!

214
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:16,678
My noob!

215
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:19,268
What?

216
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,596
Good luck.

217
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:34,677
Calm down, Alys!

218
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:36,866
It’s just a simple
“good luck”,

219
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,076
but my heart is
fluttering like crazy!

220
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,282
It’s my first day
at my new school.

221
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:47,424
You can do this, Alys.

222
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:48,932
You can do this, Alys.

223
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:49,957
Aja!

224
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:51,814
Good morning!

225
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:10,777
Thank you, everyone!
And welcome again to Brenford University.

226
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,112
You can start your
Freshman Walk now.

227
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:16,155
Why is everyone standing up?

228
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,365
I knew I’d be late.

229
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:21,493
Miss, why is
everyone standing?

230
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:22,518
Freshman walk!

231
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,915
What a snob!

232
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:28,263
She acts like she’s pretty. Tss.

233
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,001
Annoying.

234
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:46,273
I miss Aya and Sheen.

235
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,938
I don’t know anyone here.

236
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:57,706
Hey.

237
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:01,624
Do you have a partner yet?

238
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:05,206
- How about us instead?
- Huh?

239
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,393
I have a boyfriend!

240
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:11,794
No, I meant for the
Freshman Walk.

241
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,245
Do you have a partner yet?

242
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:14,729
Do you want to pair up?

243
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:15,807
Oh.

244
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:18,558
Okay, sure.

245
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,315
Gosh, that was embarrassing!

246
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,073
He might think
I’m assuming he likes me.

247
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:26,245
Was that my fault?

248
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:28,792
His question was misleading.

249
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:33,196
Shall we?

250
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:49,999
What’s your name again, Miss?

251
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:53,207
Alys Zyril Perez. You?

252
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:55,299
Tripp Marco.

253
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:56,762
Nice to meet you.

254
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:01,163
You don’t remember me?

255
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,310
Huh?

256
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:09,338
He looks cute.

257
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,049
That was just yesterday.

258
00:16:15,904 --> 00:16:19,815
Sorry, my memory is weak.

259
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:23,074
So, where exactly
did we meet again?

260
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:25,726
Uh, nowhere.

261
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:29,176
Wait, are you mad?

262
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,269
I’m sorry.

263
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:33,362
This can’t be.

264
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,034
He’s going to be
my first friend here,

265
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,685
and he’s already mad at me?

266
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:39,143
This can’t be happening!

267
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:42,018
Hey, I’m sorry.
Please don’t be mad.

268
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:52,401
Sorry, I’m just kidding.

269
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:53,426
I’m not mad.

270
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:56,573
Ouch!

271
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,598
That hurts, Miss.

272
00:16:57,704 --> 00:16:59,120
You’re mean!

273
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:01,401
I said I’m Alys.

274
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,634
- You’re so mean.
- Then that hurts, Alys.

275
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:07,510
You’re the one hitting
people with your bag.

276
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:08,698
Don’t hit me with your bag!

277
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:16,057
Hey!

278
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,170
What?

279
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:22,768
What was your name again?

280
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:25,301
Tss.

281
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:27,961
Tripp Marco.

282
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:29,645
Remember it.

283
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:30,745
Okay.

284
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,682
Hello, Tripp!

285
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:33,042
I hope we become friends.

286
00:17:34,295 --> 00:17:35,295
Friends?

287
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:37,881
We’ll see.

288
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:42,217
What’s his problem?

289
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:45,936
Drake, wait!

290
00:17:46,578 --> 00:17:48,288
Drake, wait for me!

291
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:51,490
You didn’t text me yesterday,
I was waiting for you!

292
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:53,193
I have class.

293
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,124
Huh?

294
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:57,213
Wait, Drake!

295
00:17:57,971 --> 00:17:59,127
Ahhh!

296
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,790
Ouch!

297
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,425
Ouchy, Drake!

298
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,346
Drake, I sprained
my ankle. Help me!

299
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:09,680
Drake, help me! Ouch!

300
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,065
Ouch!

301
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:12,386
It hurts!

302
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:17,307
Ouch!

303
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:18,604
Ouchy!

304
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,772
It was frustrating earlier,
I couldn’t find any parking space.

305
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,449
What’s taking Aya so long?

306
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,518
My Aya babes is coming.

307
00:18:31,452 --> 00:18:34,038
- “Aya babes”. Must be nice.
- Bee!

308
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,381
Just hold this!

309
00:18:38,232 --> 00:18:40,042
My stomach hurts.

310
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:43,214
You’ll be fine. Just take
some medicine later, okay?

311
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,759
Ouch!

312
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:46,216
Drake!

313
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:47,385
Ouch!

314
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:49,929
Ouch, Drake!

315
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,685
Who’s that?

316
00:18:58,577 --> 00:18:59,577
That’s Shaira.

317
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:00,917
Shaira who?

318
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:02,458
Shaira Silos.

319
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:03,307
Silos?

320
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:04,456
- Mmm.
- Silos, really?

321
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:06,987
Why do you even know her?

322
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:10,292
She was our schoolmate
back in elementary.

323
00:19:11,874 --> 00:19:14,669
Last I heard, she was also
Drake’s classmate in Brenford.

324
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:16,747
Until Drake moved here to SCA.

325
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:19,213
So what if they
were schoolmates?

326
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,949
Does she really
need to be carried?

327
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:24,213
Do you want me to carry you?

328
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,206
Do you want me to smack you?

329
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,209
You’re so cute, Bee!

330
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,862
No, you’re cuter.

331
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:33,151
You’re dramatic.

332
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:34,260
Anyways...

333
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:36,088
Shaira’s first love was Drake.

334
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:39,104
How do you even know that, huh?

335
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:40,175
Yes, how?

336
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:42,173
I already knew that when
I was in elementary.

337
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,858
All our batchmates
knew about it.

338
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:47,522
It’s common knowledge
that Shaira was all about Drake.

339
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:48,987
And Drake, of course,

340
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:50,887
doesn’t care about anyone.

341
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,324
Tss.

342
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:55,333
- Hand me my phone!
- Sorry, Bee.

343
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:57,283
My phone.

344
00:20:01,182 --> 00:20:04,334
Your boyfriend’s
flirting over here!

345
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,229
Just try cheating on Alys,

346
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:12,052
Uncle Andy and
I will castrate you!

347
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:16,237
Kent!

348
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,509
You should rest
your ankle, dear.

349
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,479
Good thing it’s just
the start of classes,

350
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:26,479
nothing major yet.

351
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,107
I advise you to take
a day off, okay?

352
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,466
- Okay. Thank you, Nurse!
- You’re welcome.

353
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:36,201
Ouch.

354
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:39,311
Drake, it really hurts.

355
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,457
Can you take me home?

356
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:42,482
Don’t you have a car?

357
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,375
Drake!

358
00:20:45,737 --> 00:20:48,072
How do you expect
me to step on the gas

359
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:49,673
with this swollen ankle?

360
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,592
I’m really just a girl!

361
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:52,742
Tss.

362
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,119
Please?

363
00:20:55,397 --> 00:20:56,899
Pretty please?

364
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,559
Keys.

365
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:05,515
I knew you wouldn’t let me down.

366
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,860
Carry me.

367
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:13,485
Carry me!

368
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:16,936
Poor me.

369
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:19,499
You’re so annoying.

370
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:23,116
You know, I really
missed you, my husband.

371
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:25,069
I haven’t seen you in so long.

372
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,710
Let’s go?

373
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:40,516
Ouch!

374
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,560
It really hurts!

375
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:46,730
Your fault.

376
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:48,090
Hey, wait.

377
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:51,442
Let’s catch up first.

378
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:53,395
So, how’s my husband?

379
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,901
You know, you look different.

380
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:58,534
More matured, more…

381
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,018
mysterious?

382
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:03,044
Tss.

383
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:06,291
Or maybe not.

384
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:09,378
You’re still the
same Drake I knew

385
00:22:09,457 --> 00:22:11,463
back in elementary
and junior high.

386
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:16,108
And you still care about me.

387
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,971
What are you even talking about?

388
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:20,555
Well,

389
00:22:21,194 --> 00:22:22,629
if you really didn’t
care anymore,

390
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:24,893
then you should’ve
just left me at the clinic.

391
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:27,813
But you stayed.

392
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:32,464
You even offered your
own car to take me home.

393
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:34,672
You carried me, too.

394
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,409
Ouch, it really hurts.

395
00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:47,121
Hubby, can you take me up to my room?

396
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:48,708
Tss.

397
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:12,378
You’re so sweet, Drakey!

398
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:14,776
Thank you, my husband!

399
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:16,708
What will I ever do without you?

400
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:19,484
I’ll just get you home,
so you can rest.

401
00:23:23,496 --> 00:23:24,581
Oopsies!

402
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:26,409
Thanks, hubby!

403
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:29,683
I’ll message you.

404
00:23:30,573 --> 00:23:31,573
You take care!

405
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,670
Hey, Tripp!

406
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,717
How annoying!

407
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,417
That guy’s mood swings are wild!

408
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:26,136
A while ago he was
trying to be friendly,

409
00:24:26,574 --> 00:24:28,116
and now he just keeps
on walking.

410
00:24:28,141 --> 00:24:31,687
Obviously, Alys, it’s
the Freshman Walk.

411
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:34,401
He has to walk all around
the school grounds.

412
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:39,286
Are you giving up?

413
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:43,172
Well, we’ve been walking
without even talking!

414
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:45,111
It’s so boring!

415
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:46,802
If Aya were here,

416
00:24:46,827 --> 00:24:49,580
I wouldn’t mind walking for two hours
at least I’d have someone to talk to.

417
00:24:51,513 --> 00:24:52,639
Alys!

418
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,669
You’re alone here in Brenford,
so deal with it.

419
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:04,409
Why are you so grumpy, anyway?

420
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:07,886
We just met and you’re
already acting like this?

421
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,309
See, now we’re behind the group!

422
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,280
Hey, Tripp!

423
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:26,462
Where are you going?

424
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:31,177
I’m tired already.

425
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:40,005
Why are guys like that?

426
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:42,697
If they’re not saying
“Tss.” they just shrug!

427
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,703
Is it that hard to
form a sentence?

428
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:47,971
Oh, gosh.

429
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:49,674
I’m so tired.

430
00:25:50,264 --> 00:25:52,492
Why couldn’t I have
a girl partner instead?

431
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,978
Life would’ve been
so much easier!

432
00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:58,901
Excuse me, can I buy
one bottled water?

433
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:03,604
Did you order a drink already?

434
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:05,071
It’s taking so long.

435
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:11,690
OMG! Are you alright, Erica?

436
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:14,373
Does she look
alright to you, Kim?

437
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:17,286
My God, you’re too slow
for your own sake!

438
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:22,982
Don’t you know who I am?

439
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,459
Give me that.

440
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:32,848
Next time,

441
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:39,111
take extra care,
Alys Zyril Perez.

442
00:26:40,552 --> 00:26:42,643
Everyone would
love to see you cry.

443
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,271
You freak.

444
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,919
Alys, there you are.

445
00:27:28,094 --> 00:27:31,556
- Alys, what happened to you?
- I don’t even know them!

446
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:33,243
What happened?

447
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,162
They ganged up on me.

448
00:27:36,973 --> 00:27:39,434
Alys, who did this to you?

449
00:27:41,146 --> 00:27:42,146
Who?

450
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,171
I don’t know them.

451
00:27:48,688 --> 00:27:49,744
What happened?

452
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:57,049
Go home first and
change clothes.

453
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,011
It’s still early, we’ll be
here until afternoon.

454
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:00,203
You might get sick.

455
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:05,776
My Mom will see me.

456
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:07,818
Alys.

457
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:13,465
If Mom finds out I’m being
bullied here in Brenford,

458
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:17,896
she might change her
mind and pull me out.

459
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:21,340
I don’t want to go to the States.

460
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:26,930
What do you want to do now?

461
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,720
I’ll just buy new clothes.

462
00:28:38,485 --> 00:28:39,997
Okay.

463
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:48,763
Shhh, don’t cry.

464
00:28:49,152 --> 00:28:50,695
It’s okay.

465
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,714
You’re going to leave like that?

466
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:55,669
Why? What’s wrong
with how I look?

467
00:28:56,407 --> 00:28:58,367
You look like you
fell into a sewer.

468
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,660
And besides…

469
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:09,774
Not a single cab will pick
you up looking like that.

470
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:13,427
So, what am I supposed to do?

471
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:24,950
Isn’t that dangerous?

472
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:27,816
It’s actually fun.

473
00:29:28,622 --> 00:29:30,021
- So, are you game?
- Uhh...

474
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:32,012
But I might fall...

475
00:29:32,393 --> 00:29:33,393
You won’t, come on!

476
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:37,756
Are there any options?
Don’t you have a car?

477
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:40,052
Are you sure about this?

478
00:29:40,284 --> 00:29:41,284
Yup!

479
00:29:42,424 --> 00:29:44,884
Hey, are you sure that’s safe?

480
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:46,682
Is that where I’m getting on?

481
00:29:48,211 --> 00:29:48,962
It’s safe!

482
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,281
Why? Is it your first time
riding a motorbike?

483
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:01,854
Don’t worry, I got you.

484
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:13,918
Tripp?

485
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:47,933
Hop on.

486
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:00,475
Sorry.

487
00:31:05,648 --> 00:31:06,824
This is safe, right?

488
00:31:07,186 --> 00:31:08,480
Are you sure about this?

489
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:09,505
It’s safe.

490
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:12,332
Hey.

491
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:13,672
Just go slow, okay?

492
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:17,634
You’re sure this is safe.

493
00:31:18,426 --> 00:31:19,527
This is safe.

494
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,762
You’re really sure?

495
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:24,431
Hey!

496
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:27,936
What the heck?!

497
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:28,936
Are you ready?

498
00:31:29,575 --> 00:31:30,743
Let’s go!

499
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:34,693
Tripp! Go slow, Tripp!

500
00:31:36,449 --> 00:31:38,159
Tripp, don’t speed up!

501
00:31:38,816 --> 00:31:40,234
Tripp, that’s enough!

502
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:46,954
Tripp!

503
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,670
Slow down!

504
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,854
What?

505
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:58,091
I said slow down!

506
00:31:58,133 --> 00:31:58,984
What?

507
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:00,719
I said slow down!

508
00:32:06,597 --> 00:32:08,348
Come on, slow down!

509
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,293
- What the heck, slow down!
- This is slow!

510
00:32:10,318 --> 00:32:12,778
- I said slow down!
- Fine.

511
00:32:14,024 --> 00:32:15,024
Alright.

512
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:16,943
Ouch!

513
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:18,862
- I said slow down!
- You hit hard, you know!

514
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,707
Thank You, Lord!

515
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:32,843
Ouch!

516
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,169
I thought I’m going
to die because of you!

517
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:36,087
Ouch!

518
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,950
What’s wrong with you?

519
00:32:38,951 --> 00:32:40,160
Wait, I’ll just park.

520
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Wait up!

521
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:44,123
Alys!

522
00:32:44,518 --> 00:32:45,518
Hold on.

523
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,136
Alys!

524
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:06,216
Alys, wait for me!

525
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:08,455
Alys!

526
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,489
Alys, come on.

527
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:14,521
- Alys your face.
- Hey.

528
00:33:15,358 --> 00:33:16,442
What’s taking her so long?

529
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:53,328
You already look pretty.

530
00:33:53,563 --> 00:33:54,563
Let’s go.

531
00:33:55,522 --> 00:33:56,522
Really?

532
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:57,696
I look pretty?

533
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:04,132
You’ve always been beautiful.

534
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:10,407
Alright, I’ll pay now.

535
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,701
Miss Perez, hop in.

536
00:34:30,364 --> 00:34:32,325
Whatever! I don’t want to!

537
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:34,992
What the...

538
00:34:54,704 --> 00:34:56,039
Here, Alys. Hop on.

539
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:57,335
I said I don’t want to!

540
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:58,746
I’ll just take a cab!

541
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:00,315
I’m not riding that
motorbike again!

542
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:02,483
You drive like you own the road.

543
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:04,281
I won’t, promise.

544
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,343
- Promise!
- You said that earlier, too.

545
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,815
You’re so dramatic!

546
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:14,704
Sorry if I love my life.

547
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,081
You’re overreacting.

548
00:35:17,106 --> 00:35:18,774
We made it here
because of my motorbike.

549
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:19,626
Whatever!

550
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:21,920
I’ll just take a cab,
at least I’ll be safe.

551
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:23,210
No, I won’t allow it.

552
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:24,695
- Go home.
- Come on, wear this.

553
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,388
- Speed off on your own!
- Here, take this.

554
00:35:27,055 --> 00:35:28,431
I said I don’t want to!

555
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:29,456
Whatever!

556
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:31,952
Thanks, anyway.

557
00:35:44,234 --> 00:35:45,793
Mister, to Brenford please.

558
00:35:45,818 --> 00:35:46,778
Please take good care of her.

559
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:47,820
Okay, Sir.

560
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:52,033
This jerk seems to be a
gentleman, after all.

561
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:02,312
Your boyfriend…
was flirting?!

562
00:36:03,753 --> 00:36:06,531
Drake, who are you flirting with?

563
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:10,566
Sir, to SCA please.

564
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,633
Where’s the College of
Business Administration again?

565
00:36:32,571 --> 00:36:34,114
This school’s so massive,

566
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:35,932
they might as well
take over the whole city.

567
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:41,125
Why don’t I have
that guy’s number?

568
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:44,202
But I don’t want to
be the first one to ask.

569
00:36:44,227 --> 00:36:45,561
I should be demure,

570
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:47,171
he should be the
one to ask first.

571
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
Yes!

572
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,517
Drake!

573
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:08,195
Why are they staring?

574
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:09,884
There are a lot of Drakes here.

575
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:19,115
Hi, Drakey Baby!

576
00:37:19,263 --> 00:37:20,431
Why are you here?

577
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:23,687
Nothing, I just missed you.

578
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:24,731
Tss.

579
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:26,252
Do it again.

580
00:37:26,252 --> 00:37:27,252
I missed that, too.

581
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:29,870
You’re acting weird again.

582
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:32,398
Have your classes started?

583
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:34,986
Can I sit in?

584
00:37:36,308 --> 00:37:37,518
Why are you even here?

585
00:37:37,543 --> 00:37:38,586
Don’t you have a class?

586
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:42,539
Oh no! You’re right!

587
00:37:44,487 --> 00:37:45,487
Bye, Drake!

588
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:47,319
I’ll see you at your condo,
I’ll be there. Okay?

589
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:48,344
Bye!

590
00:37:57,116 --> 00:37:59,953
Alys, what are you doing?

591
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:01,680
Focus!

592
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:03,484
You don’t want to be sent
back to the States, right?

593
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,842
Why did Aya even text
me something like that?

594
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:08,184
Why now?

595
00:38:08,698 --> 00:38:10,687
It's just the first
day of school!

596
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:12,728
And then when I got there,

597
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:14,379
he wasn’t even
flirting with anyone.

598
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:16,219
I’ll text Aya.

599
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,390
No, I’ll call her instead!

600
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,231
Oh, sorry!

601
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:30,274
What the heck, Miss?
Watch where you’re going!

602
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:31,943
You don’t own the road!

603
00:38:32,072 --> 00:38:33,111
Sorry.

604
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,400
Emotional runner,
first day struggles!

605
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:40,383
You got this.

606
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:43,088
College life, let’s go!

607
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,467
Okay, class, listen!

608
00:38:57,275 --> 00:38:58,994
Welcome to Culinary Arts!

609
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,679
Mr. Palma,

610
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:02,499
can you share with us

611
00:39:03,346 --> 00:39:05,806
what you know about
Business Administration?

612
00:39:06,782 --> 00:39:09,076
Well, Sir, from what I know

613
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:11,705
Business Administration
is about managing

614
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,107
and organizing different
parts of a business.

615
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:17,996
Including marketing,
finance, and operations.

616
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:21,265
It also talks about how
they can grow their business.

617
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:23,961
Do you believe you
are ready to apply

618
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,664
business concepts
to real life situations?

619
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,010
Yes, Sir!

620
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,169
My expectation for this subject is
to learn how the economy works

621
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:34,589
from the basic concepts
of supply and demand,

622
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:35,994
to major economic policies.

623
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:36,591
And of course,

624
00:39:36,616 --> 00:39:38,468
I also want to
understand how the

625
00:39:38,468 --> 00:39:40,178
economy affects our daily lives.

626
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,031
Very good!

627
00:39:44,836 --> 00:39:46,580
On the course of a few months,

628
00:39:47,294 --> 00:39:49,807
we will cover the
fundamentals of business.

629
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,482
You’ll get a well-rounded overview of

630
00:39:52,507 --> 00:39:55,969
how companies are structured,
and how they function.

631
00:39:57,001 --> 00:39:58,001
Understand?

632
00:39:58,613 --> 00:39:59,989
- Yes, Sir.
- Boring.

633
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:01,716
Mr. Palma?

634
00:40:03,174 --> 00:40:04,342
Mr. Palma!

635
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:06,382
Yes, Sir?

636
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,978
Fashion Design is all about turning
ideas to a wearable piece of art.

637
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,853
In this class,

638
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:15,002
you’ll learn to design,

639
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:16,432
pick fabrics,

640
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:19,033
and find your own style.

641
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:21,344
Do you know how to sew?

642
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:23,697
Mmm, just a bit.

643
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
How about you?

644
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,150
Of course!

645
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,261
Do you want to see my portfolio?

646
00:40:33,022 --> 00:40:34,022
Oh no!

647
00:40:37,443 --> 00:40:39,403
Last ten minutes!

648
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:41,932
Guys, double time, okay?

649
00:40:41,957 --> 00:40:43,417
This will serve as your test!

650
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:45,330
Make sure everything’s right!

651
00:40:45,357 --> 00:40:48,777
And after this, you have
to clean all your areas!

652
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:54,596
Guys, please move faster!

653
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:07,681
Hi!

654
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:12,675
How’s your day?

655
00:41:13,187 --> 00:41:14,187
Fine.

656
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:15,643
Your answer is too short.

657
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,643
We made dumplings,

658
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:21,826
but mine turned
out a bit bland.

659
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,210
Noob!

660
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:26,334
You’re harsh!

661
00:41:28,021 --> 00:41:30,311
But honestly, I’m
okay with bland...

662
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:31,879
my seatmate
earlier was annoying!

663
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,162
He kept saying, “That’s wrong!”
“This is how you do it!”

664
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,751
He keeps on interfering.

665
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:38,162
He kept butting in
with instructions.

666
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:39,381
I didn’t even ask for his help.

667
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:42,325
Then guess what?
What he made was super salty!

668
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:44,786
You’ll get kidney stones!

669
00:41:45,177 --> 00:41:46,177
Really?

670
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:51,173
What an adorable baby!

671
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:54,826
- Baby!
- Alys!

672
00:41:57,603 --> 00:41:58,896
You’re too cute!

673
00:41:58,921 --> 00:41:59,921
Stop it!

674
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:01,412
Alys!

675
00:42:04,998 --> 00:42:08,784
Why are you laughing
at my husband?

676
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:19,155
“Husband”?

677
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,159
Tripp?

678
00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:04,799
I should confront him.

679
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:15,850
Wait.

680
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:18,312
Why am I bothered?

681
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:24,802
Hop on.

682
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:37,883
Hey.

683
00:43:38,257 --> 00:43:39,679
Just go slow, okay?

684
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,185
Are you sure this is safe?

685
00:43:43,642 --> 00:43:44,773
This is safe.

686
00:43:45,005 --> 00:43:46,273
Are you sure this is safe?

687
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:55,378
Game?

688
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,171
On the next episode of
Seducing Drake Palma.

689
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:15,476
Okay, if you say so!

690
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:17,156
I’m easy to talk to!

691
00:44:18,216 --> 00:44:19,216
Ouch!

692
00:44:19,363 --> 00:44:21,031
Why are you hitting like that,
acting like you’re my girlfriend?

693
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:23,335
If I were your girlfriend,
you’d be in way more trouble!

694
00:44:24,404 --> 00:44:25,530
What are you doing here?

695
00:44:25,555 --> 00:44:26,555
Did I tell you to leave?

696
00:44:27,316 --> 00:44:29,359
Well, you were with your “wife”.

697
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:33,109
Are you jealous?

698
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:35,092
Why would I be jealous?

699
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:37,720
What are you?

700
00:44:37,982 --> 00:44:39,275
Drake’s groupie?

701
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:41,859
I’m his girlfriend.

702
00:44:42,503 --> 00:44:43,879
What are you doing here, anyway?

703
00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:45,788
I have a date with Drake.

704
00:44:45,813 --> 00:44:47,815
Dates aren’t Drake’s thing.

705
00:44:48,582 --> 00:44:51,167
Well now, it’s his thing.

706
00:44:52,713 --> 00:44:54,256
Hi, Drake! Good morning!

707
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:55,615
Hi, Drakey baby!

708
00:44:56,408 --> 00:44:57,408
Why are you here?

709
00:44:57,831 --> 00:44:59,156
We have a date, right?

710
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:05,168
Stop!

711
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:07,900
I told you so.

712
00:45:08,767 --> 00:45:10,518
“Dates” are our thing.

713
00:45:11,424 --> 00:45:12,509
Ha-ha-ha.
