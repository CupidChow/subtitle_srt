00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,502
Previously on
Seducing Drake Palma.

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:05,814
Hi, Drake!

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,881
Mind if I join you?

4
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,195
Wait!

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,953
Wait!

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,492
What about Shaira?

7
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,687
What if she gets mad?

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,054
I can handle her being mad at me.

9
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,689
I can’t handle you
not talking to me.

10
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,140
- Seriously.
- You know what?

11
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,017
Drake?

12
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:04,066
I just had so much fun
with you, Drake!

13
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,395
Here.

14
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,753
Is this really my role?

15
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,683
The one who hands you a handkerchief
whenever you cry.

16
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,131
You can talk to me, you know.

17
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,081
I’m willing to listen.

18
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,337
I’m waiting.

19
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,771
You don’t know
anything about love.

20
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,569
You’re really underestimating me.

21
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,062
Come on.

22
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,282
Maybe I can actually help you.

23
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:47,217
Why is he like that?

24
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,212
I am his girlfriend, right?

25
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,466
I’m probably entitled...

26
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,137
And I have the right to ask, but…

27
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,022
Then again,

28
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,028
he doesn’t even ask me
anything.

29
00:03:17,637 --> 00:03:18,670
Maybe

30
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,334
I shouldn’t ask him either, right?

31
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:25,311
Drama doesn’t suit you.

32
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,803
You’re an Amazon!

33
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,269
Ouch!

34
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,959
You’re hitting me again!

35
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,982
You’re annoying, you know that?

36
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,600
Why?

37
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:40,420
I’m telling you my problem and
you’re just saying all sorts of nonsense!

38
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,114
Well,

39
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,920
you said I don’t know
anything about love problems,

40
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:51,773
so I’m making do with
what I’m actually good at.

41
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,459
And what exactly are you good at?

42
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,818
Make you laugh.

43
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,418
Why are you looking
at me like that?

44
00:04:21,518 --> 00:04:23,603
I know it’s weird because

45
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,932
we’ve only known each other
for a week.

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,271
But in that one week,
I’ve seen you cry twice.

47
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,449
I don’t know, but…

48
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,446
can I be the one instead?

49
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,286
I promise I won’t make you cry.

50
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,102
Kidding!

51
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
You’re so carried away!

52
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,854
Ouch.

53
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:18,837
Where are you going?

54
00:05:18,862 --> 00:05:19,961
Wait up!

55
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,045
Alys!

56
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,323
I was kidding!

57
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,413
I love you, Drake Palma!

58
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,886
Hey!

59
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,555
You’re sulking again!

60
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,808
My god!

61
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:34,914
Can you get out of my sight?

62
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,606
I’m still pissed about what
you did last weekend.

63
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,417
I’m sorry.

64
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,261
Bad joke.

65
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,321
Do you want some?

66
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,132
- No!
- I already took a bite out of it!

67
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,242
No!

68
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,459
Is that College Algebra, Zy?

69
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,461
That’s so easy!

70
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,630
Well, okay then, smart-ass!

71
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,298
And stop calling me “Zy”.

72
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,718
Please, we’re not close!

73
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,513
Wow, “we’re not close.”

74
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,431
And why not?

75
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,308
“Zyril” sounds cute.

76
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,677
And I don’t like “Alys”.

77
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,788
It’s like your name was cut short.

78
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,814
I’ll tell my mom on you.

79
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,066
You’re in trouble now.

80
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,318
How do you do it?

81
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,866
What’s so funny?

82
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,493
You. What’s all this tattling about?

83
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,287
You sound like a kid.

84
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:37,604
Whatever.

85
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:41,616
Oh, Alys,

86
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:43,129
he’s your only friend
in Brenford,

87
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,089
so just bear with
him when you can, okay?

88
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,226
- Just bear with him.
- Give me that.

89
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:48,342
Give me that!

90
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:50,368
I’ll do it.

91
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,180
Oh, so now you’re
the smart one again.

92
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:54,665
Thanks!

93
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,860
Go ahead, then.

94
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,766
It’s done.

95
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:12,665
Mmm.

96
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,063
Give me that!

97
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:17,514
Such a show-off.

98
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,321
Do you want me to teach you?

99
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,701
No, thanks!

100
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:22,018
Keep dreaming!

101
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,227
Come on!

102
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,504
I’ll teach you, it’s easy.

103
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,482
I said no, give that to me.

104
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,635
You’re going to be a forever
nuisance in my life, Marco!

105
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,543
Oh, wow.

106
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,243
I think you’ve got a
crush on me.

107
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,854
Ugh, will you stop
saying things like that?

108
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:43,712
That’s disgusting.

109
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,566
Then, why did you look so disappointed

110
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,818
when I said “kidding”?

111
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:54,058
This girl’s disgusting,
you’re making a mess.

112
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,052
Hey.

113
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,912
That suits you, ugh!

114
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,391
Because you’re a bully!

115
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,290
But you were disappointed!

116
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,019
I wasn’t disappointed!

117
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,222
I said sorry!

118
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,342
Apology not accepted!

119
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,930
Why are you so mad?

120
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,267
Because you fooled me!

121
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,771
Sorry, Zyril!

122
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,399
The way you’re talking,

123
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,277
it’s like I’m your boyfriend
who just cheated on you.

124
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,154
Wow, you’re really
full of yourself!

125
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,089
I’m sorry, Zyril.

126
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,495
I was only joking because
you wouldn’t stop crying.

127
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,941
So, you’re going to mess
with me every time I cry?

128
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,960
I just panicked.

129
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,246
I never thought

130
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,006
you love Drake that much.

131
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,394
You know Drake?

132
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,141
Uh, you mentioned him once.

133
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,709
Didn’t you?

134
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,558
I told you about him?

135
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,938
Maybe I just forgot.

136
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,026
Yes, you’re just forgetful.

137
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,297
Look who’s here again!

138
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,726
So you’re just going
to stay quiet now?

139
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,356
What? Cat got your tongue?

140
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,028
Why are you
ganging up on me?

141
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,921
You’re funny!

142
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,218
You’re really asking that?

143
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,953
Uhm...yes?

144
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,792
‘Cause you’re so selfish, missy!

145
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,460
You already took Drake,

146
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,585
and you’re involving Tripp, too.

147
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,300
Don’t you think that’s
a little too overboard?

148
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,163
You all know Drake?

149
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,280
He’s our batchmate.

150
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,866
But unfortunately,

151
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,644
he transferred to SCA
for some unknown reason.

152
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,854
And for some very
ruinous reason,

153
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,546
you became his girlfriend.

154
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,754
Oh, right.

155
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,281
Drake is from Brenford High,

156
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:42,811
no wonder the girls
here always stare at me.

157
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,718
Sorry.

158
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,874
Your “sorry” won’t fix anything!

159
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:52,167
Watch your back.

160
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,279
Did they just threaten me?

161
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,978
Why did I even come to
the lair of Drake’s admirers?

162
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,313
Alys!

163
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,698
Am I ready to see Drake?

164
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:23,830
What am I even going to say to him?

165
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,913
Ugh, Alys, why did
you even come here?

166
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,249
What to do?

167
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,753
Fine. I’m already here.

168
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,540
1-1-3-1.

169
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,210
Drake?

170
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:46,022
Drake?

171
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:28,601
Why did I...

172
00:14:29,257 --> 00:14:32,162
Why did I even go
to his condo?

173
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,250
I should’ve just gone home.

174
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,130
You’re so stupid, Alys!

175
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,593
You’re so stupid!

176
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,229
I can only tolerate you
crying five times, Alys.

177
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,858
That’s your third already.

178
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,069
When you reach five,

179
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,576
I’ll make my joke real.

180
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,632
Have some coffee.

181
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,522
You need it.

182
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,663
Try some milk.

183
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:53,960
It’ll taste better.

184
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:57,257
It’s been two weeks
since I last saw Drake.

185
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:02,921
Who would’ve thought I’d
get tired of visiting his condo?

186
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:05,705
It hurts that I’m
the one making the effort,

187
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:09,078
but then I always see him
with Shaira.

188
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:14,072
Oh, hey!
Do you have a class?

189
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,269
My class just ended.

190
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:18,093
How are you?

191
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:21,065
Tired, but happy.

192
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:22,041
Really?

193
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,777
You know cooking’s my passion.

194
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:27,420
I know.

195
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:29,407
You make me your guinea pig.

196
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,245
I mean, I’m your food taster.

197
00:17:34,912 --> 00:17:35,955
I’m sorry!

198
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,624
You get free food,
yet you still look at a loss.

199
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:41,218
Are you complaining?

200
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:43,296
Not really.

201
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,538
Just right.

202
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:48,327
Whatever you say.

203
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,112
- Zy…
- Mmm?

204
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:53,396
How about we go to
SCA’s sem-starter?

205
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,975
They rented the
nearby theme park.

206
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,132
What do you think?

207
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,523
Oh right, it is
SCA’s sem-starter.

208
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,318
It’s open to outsiders.

209
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:08,112
What if we visit Aya, Kent and Sheen?

210
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:11,991
But… Drake’s there.

211
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:15,093
So?

212
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:17,267
I don’t want to.

213
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:19,086
If you want to go,
you can go by yourself.

214
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:21,913
Why?

215
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:23,460
You’re such a buzzkill!

216
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,733
Come on!

217
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,091
Annoying! I said
I don’t want to!

218
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,350
Wow, really?

219
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,352
I thought we were
friends forever?

220
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:40,679
Tss.

221
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,207
Oh wow, you’re
guilt-tripping me?

222
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:45,900
That’s not going to
work on me anymore!

223
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:47,151
You already tried that before!

224
00:18:47,151 --> 00:18:49,695
Come on, you don’t
have classes, anyway.

225
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,114
Keep your voice down!

226
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:52,715
There’s a lot of rides, too!

227
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,533
Hey, keep it down,
we’re in the library!

228
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,116
There’s a lot of rides.

229
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:56,786
We’re in the library,
don’t be noisy!

230
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:01,389
Come on.

231
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:03,626
Please!

232
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,380
You’re not going to stop,
are you?

233
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:10,675
Oh my god...

234
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,522
no wonder so many girls
pick fights with me here –

235
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:16,805
Marco’s smile is deadly.

236
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:20,601
I know you’ll say yes.

237
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:22,249
What else can I do?

238
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,508
You’re so persistent!

239
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:24,993
I know you won’t
stop bothering me.

240
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:26,749
Yes!

241
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:28,734
- Sssshhhh!
- Hey, don’t be noisy!

242
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,570
- Sorry, sorry!
- We’re in the library.

243
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,029
- Peace, peace, peace!
- You’re so noisy.

244
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:38,077
Thank you for letting me
use your locker.

245
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,225
Come on, it’s no big deal.

246
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:46,968
143.

247
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:52,249
That’s the code, 1-4-3!

248
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:55,219
- Ah, got it!
- In case, you might use it.

249
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,096
Okay, thanks.

250
00:19:57,893 --> 00:20:00,533
Whoever put that
dead rat in my locker,

251
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:01,866
I hope they get boils!

252
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:04,495
That’s just mean!

253
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,481
It smells so bad, even
air freshener can’t beat it.

254
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,186
Hey.

255
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:13,093
Can I have this?

256
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:15,682
Let’s not put your
secret admirer’s effort to waste.

257
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:18,784
Hey, wait up!

258
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,100
Wait for me!

259
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:22,663
After you ask for chocolates,
you’ll leave me behind?

260
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,149
- Whatever!
- You’re hurting my feelings, you know?

261
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:48,623
Tripp! Tripp!

262
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,091
- Let’s ride that one, come on!
- Huh?

263
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,311
- Let’s do that later.
- Let’s ride that one!

264
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:52,210
Let’s go.

265
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:55,279
Come on! You invited me here,
then you don’t want to ride anything?

266
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:58,783
You’re just scared of heights!

267
00:20:58,808 --> 00:20:59,800
No, I’m not!

268
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,453
So, why don’t you want to?

269
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:04,271
You’re just scared
and won’t admit it!

270
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,640
Cut it out, Zy!

271
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,542
You’re reckless with your motorcycle
but you don’t want to go on rides?

272
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,858
What kind of person are you?

273
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:10,675
You’re weird!

274
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,118
- I’m not scared!
- Then come on!

275
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:13,603
- I said later!
- I want to go on rides!

276
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:15,650
That's for later.

277
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:16,882
See that ride over there?

278
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:19,340
That’s basic, that’s so easy.

279
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:21,305
There’s a wedding booth!

280
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:24,483
You know what,

281
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:25,851
my mom told me

282
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:27,353
that when she and my
dad were in high school,

283
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,054
they went to a wedding booth
and they got married there.

284
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,708
It’s annoying, you know?

285
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,335
If things were okay
between me and Drake,

286
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,779
I would’ve dragged
him here to marry me.

287
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,718
How about you, Tripp,
who would you want to—?

288
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,210
- Thank you!
- Hey, Tripp!

289
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:48,171
Wow, so you’re just
going to ditch me?

290
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:49,749
I called you.

291
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:51,679
You were the one
busy daydreaming.

292
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:55,671
You want some?

293
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:57,929
Then, buy some.

294
00:21:58,009 --> 00:21:59,260
You’re so annoying!

295
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:00,983
Miss, I’ll buy one.

296
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,296
There’s so many!

297
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:05,725
You know what, in the month
we’ve been together,

298
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:08,394
I’ve learned to bring
a lot of money.

299
00:22:10,104 --> 00:22:12,273
You’re so stingy,
I’d starve because of you.

300
00:22:12,606 --> 00:22:13,835
You’re rich, anyway.

301
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,030
Whatever, that’s
such a lame excuse.

302
00:22:23,012 --> 00:22:24,079
Hey!

303
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:25,420
Yuck!

304
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:28,164
Seriously, you poked me with
the finger that had spit on it?!

305
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:29,765
Gross!

306
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,499
You’re so fussy!

307
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,418
You really are gross!

308
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:33,905
- Fussy!
- Hey, man!

309
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,646
Long time, no talk!

310
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:36,936
How are you?

311
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:40,051
I’m good. You?

312
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,053
Acting all snobbish!

313
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,388
Well, I feel pressured.

314
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:46,307
It’s hard at SCA, too.

315
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:48,075
What about you?

316
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,727
You’ll stay forever in Brenford?

317
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:52,772
Wow, the audacity of this guy!

318
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,424
He’s not even that handsome!

319
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,249
Excuse me, mister!

320
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:59,257
That’s fine, at least we’re still rich.

321
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:01,788
How about you?
How’s business?

322
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:03,358
Are you going bankrupt soon?

323
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:05,368
Nice one, Marco!

324
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,663
You’re still arrogant, Palma!

325
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,163
Wait…

326
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,100
Palma?

327
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:14,374
Palma?

328
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:18,186
At least I have
something to brag about.

329
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,690
Anyway, we’re leaving.

330
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:20,399
Let’s go, Alys.

331
00:23:20,424 --> 00:23:21,692
Hey, what did I just hear?

332
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:22,902
- Alys, let’s go.
- Did I hear that right?

333
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:24,483
- Alys, let’s go!
- Palma?!

334
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:25,733
Huh?!

335
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,725
Just wait a second!

336
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:30,059
- Just a second!
- Come on!

337
00:23:34,188 --> 00:23:35,452
Tripp Marco.

338
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,859
Is “Marco” your last
name, or is it “Palma”?

339
00:23:39,348 --> 00:23:40,678
Why are you asking?

340
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:42,863
I know someone with
the last name Palma.

341
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,965
Who knows, you might be related.

342
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:47,360
Why, are we both handsome?

343
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:49,887
I’m seriously asking!

344
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:50,968
Ouch!

345
00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:56,413
Fine.

346
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:00,921
Tripp Marco Palma, 19, single,

347
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:02,900
and ready to mingle with you.

348
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:03,901
How’s that?

349
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:04,985
Look at you,

350
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,913
you’re pretending you’ve never
had a girlfriend,

351
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,306
but you’re such a flirt!

352
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:10,694
Oh, wow!

353
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:12,761
So, is it my fault I’m
this good-looking?

354
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,210
You’re so full of yourself!

355
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:17,374
But seriously...

356
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:21,735
So, wait...

357
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:23,612
do you know Drake Palma?

358
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,010
- He’s my cousin.
- No way?!

359
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:31,202
Yes!

360
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,132
But of course, I’m
more handsome.

361
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,624
Hey!

362
00:24:43,768 --> 00:24:44,811
Seriously?

363
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:46,861
You’re cousins?!

364
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:48,154
Yes. You’re unbelievable.

365
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,948
You asked me and I answered.
Now, you don’t believe me!

366
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:52,429
You’re so confusing, you know?

367
00:24:52,683 --> 00:24:54,059
Shocks!

368
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,620
You and Drake are cousins?

369
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,581
- For real?!
- Yes.

370
00:24:58,606 --> 00:24:59,582
He’s my cousin.

371
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:01,208
Our dads are brothers.

372
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,671
We’re both Palmas,

373
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:04,257
and both handsome –

374
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:06,380
it runs in the blood.

375
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:07,507
All right?

376
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,091
- Ouch!
- Damn you!

377
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:10,718
- After all the crying I did—
- Ouch!

378
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:11,869
you turn out to be cousins!

379
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,679
Ouch! That hurts!

380
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:14,705
- You’re so annoying!
- Ouch, stop!

381
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,165
So you actually
knew that Sebastian?!

382
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:17,041
- Ouch!
- You’re cousins!

383
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:17,875
You and your cousin
are both annoying!

384
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:18,809
Okay, stop, stop.

385
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:20,061
Stop, it hurts!

386
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:21,921
Why are you even mad at me?!

387
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,106
Of course, because
you’re his cousin!

388
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,108
Blood is thicker than water.

389
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,651
Of course, you’ll take his side.

390
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:28,718
Ouch!

391
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:34,222
But love is the
thickest of them all.

392
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:39,847
Don’t worry, I’ll
always take your side.

393
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,191
You said it.

394
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:45,155
You better stand by it.

395
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:47,249
Yes, I will.

396
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:49,698
My whole body’s
hurting from all your hitting!

397
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:51,050
You deserve it!

398
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:52,358
I’m sorry.

399
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,929
It’s your fault, anyway.

400
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:56,093
So…

401
00:25:56,563 --> 00:25:57,764
You want to try some rides?

402
00:25:58,374 --> 00:25:59,991
- Are you ready for it?
- Of course!

403
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,852
- Yeah, right!
- That’s easy!

404
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:02,836
- Oh, yeah?
- So, let’s go?

405
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:03,837
- Let’s go!
- That’s basic!

406
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:06,280
Basic, huh? Really, now?
“Basic” your face!

407
00:26:06,305 --> 00:26:08,008
Can I back out?!

408
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:08,926
Why would you back—?

409
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:09,969
I’m scared, I don’t
want to anymore!

410
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,155
Why are you getting off?! Hey!

411
00:26:23,941 --> 00:26:24,984
Now I’m getting scared, too!

412
00:26:25,103 --> 00:26:26,913
- Alys, I don’t want to be here!
- Come on!

413
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:28,462
Hey!

414
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:29,713
Mom!

415
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:30,798
Hey, I’m going down!

416
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:31,907
Wow, look at my props!

417
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:34,285
Mine’s better – shining,
shimmering, splendid!

418
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,858
Why are your shades like that?

419
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:37,179
- Can I see yours?
- Mine looks cute.

420
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:38,819
- Mine looks cuter.
- Okay, let’s swap.

421
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:41,058
What? Okay.

422
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,434
Selfish.

423
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:43,752
- Here it is.
- This is big.

424
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:45,944
Alys, I don’t want to!

425
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:47,530
- Tripp!
- I can’t do it!

426
00:26:47,555 --> 00:26:48,745
Alys!

427
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:52,296
Okay, go!

428
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:55,973
Come on, Tripp, do better!

429
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:58,434
Alys! Alys!

430
00:26:58,475 --> 00:26:59,616
Hey!

431
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,334
Smile.

432
00:27:02,146 --> 00:27:03,421
Is it working?

433
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:05,165
- It’s not.
- It isn’t.

434
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,777
Excuse me, we’re
sorry, the SD card’s full.

435
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,237
Would you be able to wait?

436
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,905
We just need to dump some files.

437
00:27:13,282 --> 00:27:14,300
What?

438
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:16,702
Uh, it’s okay. Never mind for now.

439
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:18,250
We’ll just come back later.

440
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,459
Sir, stop!

441
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:26,514
Hey!

442
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:29,798
Stop being a basher,
it just makes my skills show.

443
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:32,426
Tripp! Tripp!

444
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:34,511
Zyril! Zyril!

445
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,266
It won’t shoot!

446
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:44,855
Hey, wake up!

447
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,732
Wake up! It’s over!

448
00:27:46,774 --> 00:27:47,958
We’re done!

449
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:49,280
You can get your prize now.

450
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,671
Can I get the
strawberry keychain?

451
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,008
It’s not enough.

452
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:57,676
One ring, candy.

453
00:27:57,701 --> 00:28:00,913
Two rings, keychain, and
then three or more, plushies.

454
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:03,349
Let’s take a picture!

455
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,655
- Smile!
- Wait.

456
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:08,093
Smile!

457
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:12,881
I feel dizzy.

458
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:15,218
I feel dizzy.

459
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,764
Too bad, I want to get
the strawberry keychain.

460
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:21,311
Can’t we just buy the
strawberry keychain instead?

461
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:23,018
Sorry, you can’t.

462
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:33,253
I’m Tripp!

463
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,561
I’m dizzy!

464
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,591
I’m not scared!

465
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:38,550
Stop it!

466
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:39,785
I didn’t say that!

467
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:44,807
Miss!

468
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:46,433
Come in here
with your boyfriend!

469
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,858
Huh? No!

470
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:49,897
You don’t want to
marry your boyfriend?

471
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:51,647
He’s not my boyfriend.

472
00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:52,960
So, you’re available?

473
00:28:54,508 --> 00:28:55,609
Available...

474
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,052
Oh, so you’re available!

475
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:57,945
Move over!

476
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,179
Hey, available!

477
00:29:05,436 --> 00:29:06,608
Bestie?

478
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:07,734
Bestie!

479
00:29:07,823 --> 00:29:10,190
- Bestie!
- Bestie!

480
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,650
Bestie!

481
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:13,552
I’ve been looking for you!

482
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:15,587
Uh, excuse me, I have class!

483
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:19,158
This girl doesn’t cut classes anymore,
that’s why we only came here now.

484
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:21,132
- Hi, Sheen! I missed you!
- Hi, Alys!

485
00:29:21,157 --> 00:29:22,252
I don’t think you missed us at all!

486
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:22,970
Hi, Kent!

487
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,718
- Just a little.
- “Just a little.”

488
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:27,718
She missed me a lot,
but she missed you guys just a little.

489
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:29,927
Oh, wow!

490
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:32,037
You’re still so in love, Kent!

491
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:33,313
Of course!

492
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,507
Right, bee?

493
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:39,962
I bet he waited for your class to end
so you could come here together.

494
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:43,515
So cute and fluffy, my KenYa!

495
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:46,143
It’s annoying,
I’m a little jealous.

496
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,953
- Bee!
- Thank you, Alys!

497
00:29:47,978 --> 00:29:49,580
You mean clingy!

498
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:51,231
Bee, stop!

499
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:52,166
Oh, sorry!

500
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:54,359
I wish someone
would wait for me, too.

501
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,532
And then we’d walk
together while people stare.

502
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,495
And we wouldn’t care
because they’d just be looking.

503
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:09,917
But of course, that’s just a dream.

504
00:30:10,334 --> 00:30:12,878
Why don’t you tell Drake
about that fantasy of yours?

505
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:20,844
Bestie? Oh my gosh!
You lost weight!

506
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:22,029
Really?

507
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,906
What happened
to you in Brenford?

508
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:25,324
- She seems to have not eaten yet.
- Don’t you have food there?

509
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:26,647
Turn around!

510
00:30:26,938 --> 00:30:27,967
Spin!

511
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:29,530
Then, give me a hip shake.

512
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:31,991
Shake it, like this.

513
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,194
One more spin!

514
00:30:35,316 --> 00:30:38,111
One more, turn around.
That’s it.

515
00:30:38,197 --> 00:30:40,491
What the— stop it,
I’m getting dizzy!

516
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:42,499
You’re so easy to trick!

517
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:46,036
Of course I’ve been eating,
there’s a lot of food in Brenford!

518
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:47,638
I’m studying Culinary
Arts, remember?

519
00:30:47,663 --> 00:30:49,832
It’s because the buildings there
are far from each other.

520
00:30:49,832 --> 00:30:53,335
So between classes, I keep
walking from one place to another.

521
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,729
Well, that’s true,
she walks far.

522
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,398
But bestie, you’re blooming!
You look so pretty today!

523
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,218
You’re absolutely inspired by Kent!

524
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,428
You know, it’s a good
thing your friend’s nicer now.

525
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,531
She doesn’t punch
me anymore.

526
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:06,198
Ouch!

527
00:31:06,223 --> 00:31:08,809
See, that’s what
you get for jinxing it!

528
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,499
Sorry, bee!

529
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:13,405
Is that Tripp?

530
00:31:14,523 --> 00:31:15,858
Oh, yes! Come here!

531
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:19,378
Hi, Tripp!

532
00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:22,030
Tripp, this is Aya, the
one I always tell you about.

533
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:24,283
And this is Kent, and this is Sheen.

534
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:25,300
Hi, bro!

535
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:26,460
I know Sheen.

536
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,719
- Huh?
- Huh?

537
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,762
Sheen.

538
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,472
- You guys know each other?
- Mmm.

539
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:32,207
We were batchmates before
in Brenford.

540
00:31:32,232 --> 00:31:33,350
Ahhh...

541
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:37,004
So, what?
Are we just catching up here?

542
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:40,048
Oh, bestie, treat me some drinks!

543
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:42,734
Why am I always the one
treating you guys?

544
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:44,553
- Do I look like an ATM?!
- Yes!

545
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:47,698
Come on, treat me! You’ve got
more money than me, anyway!

546
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:49,882
Come on, bestie, I
want that – hotdog!

547
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,645
I want hotdog, and
drinks, lots of drinks!

548
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:54,855
I want lots of drinks!

549
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,048
I miss you!

550
00:31:58,692 --> 00:31:59,858
Thank you!

551
00:32:01,111 --> 00:32:02,835
Oh wait, I don’t
want to eat anymore!

552
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:04,381
Here.

553
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:05,382
Come on, bestie!

554
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:07,242
Let’s just look outside.

555
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,705
Look at you, you’re the one
who dragged us there.

556
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,474
Well, I changed my mind.

557
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,335
And just let them be,
they’re already adults.

558
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,332
You’re right.

559
00:32:18,357 --> 00:32:19,460
Let’s leave them be.

560
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,608
Let’s go, let’s do girl bonding.

561
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:23,757
Let’s go. Over there!

562
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,028
Oh, wait!

563
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:27,346
You’ve got a lot to tell me!

564
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:28,827
Yes, let’s go!

565
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,929
One question, one answer –
what’s going on with you and Tripp?

566
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,273
Wow, those eyes
are so judgmental!

567
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,827
Nothing, we’re just friends!

568
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:42,419
Friends?

569
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:43,754
Yes!

570
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:45,124
Really, “friends?”

571
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:47,194
Just friends?

572
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,301
You’re not just friends!

573
00:32:49,326 --> 00:32:51,495
Fine, we’re best friends, if you
don’t believe we’re just friends!

574
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:55,123
You know what, fool Kent
all you want, but not me.

575
00:32:56,893 --> 00:33:02,899
And I feel there’s something
between you and Tripp that I can’t explain.

576
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:04,764
You are such a
gossip, you know that?

577
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,929
And anyway, who would like a guy

578
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:12,557
who’d let you starve and not even treat
you because “you’re rich”?!

579
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,327
It still annoys me every
time I think about it!

580
00:33:15,352 --> 00:33:17,241
I thought you said
there’s nothing?!

581
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,790
There’s really nothing.

582
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:20,691
Nothing!

583
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:24,861
Bestie, spill it, I’m
your only girl best friend!

584
00:33:25,189 --> 00:33:28,154
Fine, I’m sulking
now, there, I’m sulking!

585
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:29,633
Now you have to
make it up to me!

586
00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:30,592
Make it up to me!

587
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:32,177
- Come on, let’s go!
- What am I, Kent?!

588
00:33:32,202 --> 00:33:33,453
What am I, Kent?! Go there!

589
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,680
Okay, fine!

590
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:36,306
“Make it up to me!”

591
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:37,905
Just tell me already!

592
00:33:38,132 --> 00:33:40,519
There’s nothing,
you’re so persistent!

593
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:42,521
What happened
between you and Drake?

594
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:44,022
Come on, spill!

595
00:33:44,464 --> 00:33:46,717
What exactly do you
want to know?

596
00:33:48,677 --> 00:33:49,970
Everything!

597
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:57,200
Aya, I keep thinking
why didn’t I just go to SCA?

598
00:33:57,811 --> 00:33:59,718
I wish I had done better.

599
00:34:00,022 --> 00:34:01,440
That way, we
could’ve been together.

600
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,334
- Hey.
- What?

601
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:06,445
Why do you look
uninterested in my story?

602
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,463
Because that’s not the
story I’m talking about.

603
00:34:08,488 --> 00:34:10,782
Then what story are
you talking about?

604
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,263
Look at my best friend,
you’re so impatient!

605
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,206
We’re just getting
to the exciting part.

606
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:23,977
Okay, so guess what – Drake and
Shaira actually live in the same condo.

607
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:26,231
Same floor and everything.

608
00:34:26,256 --> 00:34:28,233
They’re literally neighbors.

609
00:34:28,842 --> 00:34:33,304
And that clingy octopus
keeps latching onto Drake.

610
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:36,516
She’s even calling him “husband”.

611
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,617
Oh, wow.

612
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,244
See, I knew it!

613
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:41,313
Nothing good will
come from that Shaira.

614
00:34:42,564 --> 00:34:43,889
Why do you say that?

615
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,485
You know what, Shaira and Drake
are always together.

616
00:34:46,943 --> 00:34:49,452
At first, I was annoyed.
Of course, we’re BFFs!

617
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:52,139
And CB keeps telling me,

618
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:55,405
“That’s just how Shaira is,
don’t get annoyed.”

619
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:56,553
But still—

620
00:34:56,578 --> 00:34:59,280
- they’re so irritating!
- They’re always together?

621
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:03,156
The way Drake acts, you’d
think he doesn’t have a girlfriend!

622
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,804
You know what, just
break up with him!

623
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:12,212
Is Aya right?
Should I just break up with Drake?

624
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,850
Just break up already!

625
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:18,809
Thanks, bestie.

626
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,436
I’ve missed this.

627
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,438
In Brenford, I have
no one to talk to.

628
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,222
You know I don’t
have friends there.

629
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:26,374
Why?

630
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:27,651
I’ve got no one to talk to,

631
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,778
since it turns out Drake
and Tripp are cousins.

632
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,030
I can’t rant to his cousin, right?

633
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:37,991
But you know, bestie,
I’m just one text away.

634
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,444
“Friends forever,” remember?

635
00:35:41,164 --> 00:35:43,750
I’m really lucky
to have you, Aya!

636
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:47,646
Of course, we’re soulmates!

637
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:50,232
Come on...
we’re soulmates!

638
00:35:50,257 --> 00:35:54,010
Then Sheen’s second,
and next is Tripp.

639
00:35:54,592 --> 00:35:56,882
You know, even if I have
just a few close friends,

640
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:59,952
I’m thankful because I
know you all love me!

641
00:36:00,006 --> 00:36:01,284
Of course!

642
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:03,061
I’m always here for you.

643
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:05,475
Bestie...

644
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,179
Who’s this?

645
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,936
Who’s that?

646
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:10,919
Let me just get
this, bestie, okay?

647
00:36:10,944 --> 00:36:12,210
Go ahead!

648
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:13,858
Hello?

649
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:19,858
Good thing Tripp dragged
me here. I missed Aya!

650
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:22,622
- Bestie...
- So? What’d they say?

651
00:36:22,796 --> 00:36:24,724
- Sorry!
- What?

652
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:28,128
There’s a problem with our design.
I have to go back to SCA.

653
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:31,613
Wow! New life, bestie!

654
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,108
- Stop teasing me, bestie.
- I’m so proud of you!

655
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:36,303
Kent’s such a great
influence on you.

656
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,281
- I’m so proud of you, bestie!
- Kent?

657
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:41,116
- I forgot Kent!
- What?

658
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:43,201
Ah, never mind,
I’ll just text him.

659
00:36:43,226 --> 00:36:45,395
I’ll tell him I really need
to get back to school.

660
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,705
Okay.

661
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,481
They’re probably
still catching up there.

662
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,041
Alright, bestie!

663
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:52,085
- Bye!
- Bye!

664
00:36:54,237 --> 00:36:55,429
I’m so dramatic!

665
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:57,641
- Aja!
- Aja!

666
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:58,508
- Aja!
- Aja!

667
00:36:58,533 --> 00:36:59,426
Alright!

668
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,385
- Bye, bestie!
- Take care!

669
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,179
- I love you!
- Bestie!

670
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:06,625
Bye!

671
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,585
- Bye!
- Love you, bestie!

672
00:37:09,236 --> 00:37:10,577
That’s so sweet!

673
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,249
Who would’ve thought
she and Kent would last?

674
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:17,027
It’s been months now and counting.

675
00:37:17,052 --> 00:37:18,991
Imagine that – they’re still together?

676
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:21,632
I’m so proud!

677
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,022
Where is he, anyway?

678
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:31,942
How do I get back there?

679
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:34,361
This theme park’s so big!

680
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:35,445
It’s confusing!

681
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:39,343
Oh, Alys!

682
00:37:40,116 --> 00:37:41,952
You really have a goldfish memory!

683
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:54,413
Who’s this?

684
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,969
Unknown number, probably just a scammer!

685
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:05,183
Ugh! Where are you guys?

686
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,218
So annoying!

687
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:18,811
Hello?

688
00:38:19,114 --> 00:38:20,163
To your right.

689
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:22,366
Huh?

690
00:38:22,492 --> 00:38:23,355
Tss.

691
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:24,421
Turn to your right.

692
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:28,387
Drake.

693
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:29,995
Come to me.

694
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,800
Oh no, is Shaira here?

695
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:43,930
I think I’m developing
Shaira-phobia – fear of the octopus!

696
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:54,231
- Drake.
- Sit.

697
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,241
How long have you had my number?

698
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:05,510
A month ago.

699
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:06,628
Huh?

700
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,128
That long?

701
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:10,285
Why didn’t you call me?

702
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,621
Should I have called you?

703
00:39:14,403 --> 00:39:17,948
Lord, I’m really having a hard time.

704
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:22,738
I miss my simple life,

705
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,015
when Math was my only problem.

706
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:28,456
Of course not.

707
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,022
Who am I for you to call, right?

708
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:38,496
My girlfriend?

709
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:41,277
“My girlfriend”?

710
00:39:41,907 --> 00:39:44,605
See? You’re not even
sure if I’m your girlfriend.

711
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,105
Why are you crying?

712
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,230
Nothing.

713
00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:19,863
I’m crying for no reason.

714
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:27,325
It’s not because my
boyfriend ignores me.

715
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:33,289
It’s not because he
prioritizes the girl who

716
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:34,666
claims he’s her first love.

717
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:44,676
It’s not because he
could call me but didn’t.

718
00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:50,441
There’s really no reason to cry.

719
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:57,738
I’m sorry.

720
00:40:59,072 --> 00:41:02,691
I knew it. It was not a good idea
to go here.

721
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:05,336
This is your fault, Tripp.

722
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:08,199
You brought me here.
Now, where are you?

723
00:41:08,812 --> 00:41:10,652
Let’s get out of here.

724
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,011
You’re sorry, but
you’ll just do it again?

725
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,963
Drake, I’m getting tired.

726
00:41:26,488 --> 00:41:29,675
If you don’t want me,
can you just say so?

727
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:32,089
Don’t make me look like a fool.

728
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:35,800
Please?

729
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,839
That’s so unfair.

730
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,424
I’m really sorry, Alys.

731
00:41:47,697 --> 00:41:49,308
I didn’t know
that’s how you feel.

732
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:54,471
You didn’t know
because you never asked –

733
00:41:54,496 --> 00:41:55,847
that’s why you’ll never know!

734
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,152
I did my best, Drake,

735
00:42:09,177 --> 00:42:11,574
but I think this is where we end.

736
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:15,354
Are you breaking up with me?

737
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,313
You know, sometimes your
intelligence actually has a use.

738
00:42:21,564 --> 00:42:24,526
Yes, I’m obviously
calling it quits, Drake!

739
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,322
You’ve inflicted too much damage!

740
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:34,667
Please…please…
please, let me go.

741
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:40,784
Alys Zyril Perez,

742
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:43,503
breaking up is a
mutual decision,

743
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,894
and I don’t wanna
break up with you.

744
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:03,940
Drake, what do you really want?

745
00:43:35,888 --> 00:43:37,167
We’ll fight...

746
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:42,667
then apologize, then text me?

747
00:43:49,485 --> 00:43:51,696
Then I give in again.

748
00:43:57,831 --> 00:44:00,567
Four down, one to go.

749
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:04,834
Just one more, and you’ll
get a feel of my joke.

750
00:44:39,702 --> 00:44:41,346
I did my best, Drake,

751
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:43,706
but I think this is where we end.

752
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:47,644
Are you breaking up with me?

753
00:44:49,671 --> 00:44:50,730
You know, sometimes

754
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:52,722
your intelligence
actually has a use.

755
00:44:53,675 --> 00:44:56,777
Yes, I’m obviously
calling it quits, Drake!

756
00:44:58,471 --> 00:45:00,598
You’ve inflicted too much damage.

757
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:06,140
Please… please…
please, let me go.

758
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:12,152
Alys Zyril Perez,

759
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:14,956
breaking up is a
mutual decision,

760
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:17,441
and I don’t wanna
break up with you.

761
00:45:39,595 --> 00:45:41,378
Am I really that
bad of a boyfriend?

762
00:45:47,061 --> 00:45:48,597
Should I apologize?

763
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:22,221
- “Stop it!”
- I never said that!

764
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:34,709
- Hurry up!
- No!

765
00:46:34,734 --> 00:46:36,819
I’d only do that
if you won earlier,

766
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:38,588
but you didn’t, you
only won candy!

767
00:46:38,613 --> 00:46:40,506
- Come on, just one!
- No, whatever!

768
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,470
No!

769
00:46:41,495 --> 00:46:42,925
- Whatever!
- I don’t like you!

770
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,243
Fine, then I’ll never
treat you again!

771
00:46:44,243 --> 00:46:45,244
Fine, if you win— no!

772
00:46:45,244 --> 00:46:47,330
Can I get the
strawberry keychain?

773
00:46:47,747 --> 00:46:49,015
It’s not enough.

774
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,683
One ring – candy.

775
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,084
Two rings – keychain,

776
00:46:52,084 --> 00:46:53,961
and then three
or more, plushies.

777
00:46:55,755 --> 00:46:58,549
Too bad, I really wanted
the strawberry keychain.

778
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:35,613
On the next episode of
Seducing Drake Palma.

779
00:47:42,844 --> 00:47:43,861
Hello?

780
00:47:43,886 --> 00:47:45,566
Why are you calling?

781
00:47:45,972 --> 00:47:47,496
Do you know Shaira?

782
00:47:47,706 --> 00:47:48,825
Shaira?

783
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,410
He’s asleep!

784
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:53,663
Why would I wake
him up for you, duh?!

785
00:47:53,688 --> 00:47:56,581
This is Drake’s girlfriend, Alys.

786
00:47:57,222 --> 00:47:58,863
Why are you with him?

787
00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:01,746
Are you accusing me
of cheating on you?

788
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:02,964
Why, are you not?!

789
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:05,491
Tell me in the three weeks
we weren’t together, Drake,

790
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:07,261
did I even cross your mind?!

791
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,089
Even just once?

792
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,605
Let’s go home.

793
00:48:14,928 --> 00:48:16,003
What?
