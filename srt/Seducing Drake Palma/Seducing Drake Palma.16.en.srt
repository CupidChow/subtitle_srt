1
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:33,226
Previously on
Seducing Drake Palma.

2
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:35,224
You still haven’t answered
my question, Alys.

3
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:37,382
Do you still feel the
same way about me,

4
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:41,453
or have you forgotten how it
feels like to be in love with me?

5
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,921
I’m going to court Alys.

6
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:46,844
That’s fine with you, right?

7
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:48,750
You like her?

8
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:51,713
Good luck.
She likes breaking hearts.

9
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:54,757
Hey, Alys!

10
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:56,342
Hello, Shaira!

11
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:57,860
OMG!

12
00:00:57,885 --> 00:00:59,470
You two are so perfect together!

13
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:01,639
What’s your problem?

14
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:06,828
You told me that you
don’t like me anymore.

15
00:01:06,853 --> 00:01:08,371
So I’m trying to forget you.

16
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:10,314
But why are you making
it so damn impossible?

17
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:32,721
Date me again, Alys.

18
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:35,029
Secretly date me this time.

19
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:37,018
Are you serious, Drake?

20
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:40,183
I’m really serious, Alys.

21
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:42,722
Maybe you’re just feeling cold.

22
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:45,117
If you don’t want
to hurt anyone,

23
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:47,420
which I doubt would happen,

24
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:50,310
sneak out with me, Alys.

25
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:54,815
I don’t want to see you
with Tripp in broad daylight.

26
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,115
But I’ll still try.

27
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:01,407
As long as I get to be with you

28
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,029
when no one’s looking.

29
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:07,670
Uh, well…

30
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:09,365
Drake?

31
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:11,928
Drake!

32
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:14,212
Drake, where are you?

33
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:15,795
Hubby!

34
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:13,319
I love you, Drake Palma!

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,936
Alys!

36
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:21,279
- It’s Tripp—
- Shh.

37
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:30,538
Walk in first. I’ll follow
after a few minutes.

38
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,166
Huh, why?

39
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,710
Because we’re secret
lovers, you noob.

40
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:38,604
Go.

41
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:39,839
Secret lovers?

42
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:41,287
Go.

43
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:42,600
Okay, fine.

44
00:03:50,224 --> 00:03:52,059
What just happened?

45
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,793
Secret lovers?!

46
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,733
Hey, Zy.
Where have you been?

47
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,889
I’ve been looking for you.

48
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:08,256
What?

49
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:11,547
Why do you look pale?

50
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:14,081
Are you okay?

51
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,835
Hey.

52
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:21,784
My Dad called.

53
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:24,175
He says there’s something
that needs to be done at home.

54
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:25,381
Would it be alright
if we go home now?

55
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:28,577
Huh?

56
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:30,147
Shall we?

57
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:31,532
Is that okay?

58
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:32,617
Yes.

59
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:33,670
Let’s go.

60
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:51,412
Shai, we’ll go ahead.
I still have something to do.

61
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:52,470
What?

62
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:55,209
We’ve just seen each other,
then you’re gonna go early.

63
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:56,787
Seriously?

64
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,294
Our schools are close
to each other, don’t overreact.

65
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:03,064
Come on.
Stay a bit longer.

66
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:04,373
Please?

67
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:06,045
Zy, let’s go.

68
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:14,016
Ugh, boring.

69
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:14,992
Hey.

70
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:17,370
Where have you been, mister?

71
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:19,694
I’ve been looking for you.

72
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:27,224
Why did you and
Drake disappear earlier?

73
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:30,467
Did he see us earlier?

74
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:34,036
Did he see me being
kissed by Drake?

75
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:36,428
Uhm...

76
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:38,249
I just got lost.

77
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:46,132
Do you like lying, Alys?

78
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,397
Every girl always wants Drake.

79
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:11,228
Should I act mean too,
so you’ll want me instead?

80
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:22,209
What do I not have, huh?

81
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:24,765
What does Drake
have that I don’t?

82
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,445
It’s always him that everyone wants.

83
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:35,014
Maybe Dad’s right.

84
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:38,687
Drake’s better than me.

85
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:43,601
Drake.

86
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:45,453
Drake.

87
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,952
Drake! Drake! Drake!

88
00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:50,196
Drake!

89
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:52,198
- Tripp! Tripp, stop!
- Drake! Drake!

90
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,425
It’s not your fault.

91
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,507
Then who’s at fault?

92
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:03,179
You’re not a bad person, right?

93
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:10,531
Just be honest, Zy.

94
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:15,687
If you like someone,
then go for them.

95
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,992
It’s sad for the one
who’ll be left behind.

96
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,022
It hurts to be left behind, Alys.

97
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:19,632
Lord, when will I
move on from Drake?

98
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,871
I’m already hurting
someone else.

99
00:08:29,712 --> 00:08:31,312
Wait, I’ll do it.

100
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:52,273
Alys.

101
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:53,711
Alys, Alys…

102
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:57,489
Sorry about earlier.

103
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:02,179
It’s okay.

104
00:09:02,828 --> 00:09:04,455
I understand, Tripp.

105
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:11,962
But you know we’re
just friends, right?

106
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:16,634
If you only see me as a friend,

107
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:19,553
I don’t see you that way, Alys.

108
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:22,359
Are you numb or what?

109
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,937
Alys...

110
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:28,771
I’ve fallen in love with you.

111
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,172
Don’t you realize?

112
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:13,493
Both Palmas love me.

113
00:10:20,197 --> 00:10:22,109
Still sleeping.

114
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:27,570
Who is it?

115
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:31,850
Someone’s already asleep and someone’s
pestering in the middle of the night.

116
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,419
I’m already sleeping.

117
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:36,867
Ugh!

118
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:50,429
Who—

119
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:51,953
Drake?

120
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:52,997
Good evening, Alys.

121
00:10:53,022 --> 00:10:54,331
Did I wake you?

122
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:55,984
Isn’t it obvious?

123
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:01,604
What are you doing here?

124
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:02,711
What time is it?

125
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:04,437
Alright then, go to sleep.

126
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:06,398
Good night.

127
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:08,023
Alys!

128
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:11,832
What now?

129
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:14,143
I’m here because I’m
trying to sneak out with you.

130
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:15,461
It’s barely midnight.

131
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:19,531
Shall we eat?

132
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:23,226
Let’s go.

133
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:29,304
Oh, my goodness.

134
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:31,836
Wait, what?

135
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:33,336
Sneaking out?

136
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,578
Don’t tell me he’s serious
about what he said before.

137
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,312
Try this one.
This is good, Alys.

138
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:08,601
Go, eat.

139
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:22,544
Drake.

140
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,633
Mmm?

141
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:27,000
I don’t like this setup.

142
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:36,125
You, me – hiding.

143
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:41,562
Tripp, Shaira – being cheated on.

144
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:45,509
Are you really
okay with this setup?

145
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:57,015
Alys...

146
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:00,274
Tripp is my cousin.

147
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:03,360
Shaira is my childhood friend.

148
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,739
Do you think I’m fine
with fooling them?

149
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:10,187
Hmm?

150
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:11,632
Of course not.

151
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,492
But why am I doing this, Alys?

152
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:16,929
The answer is simple.

153
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,251
It’s because I love you.

154
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:21,429
That’s why.

155
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:30,670
I lost my appetite.

156
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:31,738
I’ll see you tomorrow.

157
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,086
For you.

158
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:53,445
Open it later when I leave.

159
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:58,437
Wow. He’s been
ignoring me for a week.

160
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:02,750
And now he shows up to
give me this with a rule?

161
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:04,125
Hmp!

162
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:05,606
But to be fair,

163
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,152
I really missed his
shameless attitude.

164
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,515
What is this?

165
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,655
This is the last one.

166
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,093
I thought about it.

167
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,734
I really do love you, Alys.

168
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:28,172
But I can’t keep chasing
someone who doesn’t want me.

169
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:32,351
- Tripp, come on.
- Sssh.

170
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:35,179
This is my decision.

171
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:41,117
I know I told you that
I’ll always be here.

172
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,545
Yes, I’m here.

173
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:48,976
But only as a friend.

174
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:54,281
I’m a man, Alys.

175
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,253
It doesn’t make me happy
to always be the second option.

176
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,875
Do you know why I
stopped chasing Shaira?

177
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,515
Because she didn’t want me.

178
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:09,528
So as for you,

179
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:14,116
I’ll stop chasing you.

180
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:19,955
Are you mad at me?

181
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,171
Hey, come on.
Tell me the truth.

182
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,882
Maybe I am.

183
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:33,273
Maybe I’m not.

184
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,625
Tripp, be real with me.

185
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,914
That’s my secret.

186
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,783
It’s better you
don’t know, right?

187
00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:50,759
Seriously, you’re not mad at me?

188
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:55,718
Whatever. I’m going.

189
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:34,731
Tripp...

190
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:35,524
Yes?

191
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:37,910
I just left and you
already miss me.

192
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,769
What is this?

193
00:17:44,975 --> 00:17:46,004
I was there.

194
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:49,035
I witnessed all of that.

195
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:58,238
I told you, when you cry for the fifth
time, I won’t leave you alone, right?

196
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:02,879
But that’s not enough, Alys.

197
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:09,833
When you’ve cried ten times,
that’s when I’ll stop.

198
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:12,919
Drake is the reason
you’re crying.

199
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,636
He should be the one
to wipe them away.

200
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,052
Sorry, Alys.

201
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:23,789
I can’t do it anymore.

202
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:46,119
Thank you!

203
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:53,631
I don’t know what to do with you!

204
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:55,437
Sent!

205
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,780
So annoying!

206
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:12,014
Hey, bestie, are you okay?

207
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:14,481
You look stressed out.

208
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,241
I don’t get you. Do whatever
you want with your life!

209
00:19:28,185 --> 00:19:29,931
Are you okay, bestie?

210
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:31,522
It’s like you’re the one
who’s stressed out.

211
00:19:31,915 --> 00:19:33,834
Looks like your fight
with Kent is serious.

212
00:19:35,794 --> 00:19:37,420
I don’t want to talk about it.

213
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:41,007
I just want good vibes.
Just be happy.

214
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:43,635
How about yours?

215
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,350
You’ve been restless since earlier.

216
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:51,373
Should I tell my bestie that my
problem is about the Palma cousins?

217
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,123
She might get bad vibes again
and take out her anger at Kent on me.

218
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:58,553
Nothing, it’s just about school.

219
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:00,850
Are you sure?

220
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:04,489
You met up with me
for “just school”?

221
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:09,420
Bestie, I’m in a really
difficult situation right now.

222
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:13,647
You know, when it comes to culinary
arts courses, I’m doing good.

223
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,170
But when it comes to Math
and other subjects, I’m in trouble.

224
00:20:19,254 --> 00:20:21,631
- Oh my gosh, I’m screwed.
- Bestie...

225
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:23,077
You want that, right?

226
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:24,733
Stand by it.

227
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:26,662
Stand by it!

228
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:33,059
Where are you?

229
00:20:33,728 --> 00:20:34,952
Ignore, ignore.

230
00:20:35,512 --> 00:20:36,653
Goodness!

231
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:39,772
It’s suffocating sometimes.

232
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:41,359
What’s suffocating?

233
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:43,241
Who texted you?

234
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:46,740
Bestie, tell me.

235
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:48,803
It’s Drake.

236
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:50,218
What?

237
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:52,387
Is it true? Really?

238
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:53,305
Yes!

239
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,584
You two are texting again?

240
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:55,765
I said yes!

241
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,209
Why didn’t you reply?

242
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:59,227
I don’t know.

243
00:20:59,252 --> 00:21:02,631
He might as well put a tracking device
on me so he’ll stop bothering me.

244
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:05,842
Bestie, you know what?

245
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:07,287
Mmm?

246
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,905
You’ve come a long way.

247
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,864
Hmm?

248
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:12,069
I mean, look at you.

249
00:21:12,224 --> 00:21:15,076
You were the one going
after Drake before.

250
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:17,147
You even forced him
to be your boyfriend.

251
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:21,600
“Drake Palma, you’re
my boyfriend now!”

252
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:25,587
“One, two, three!
We’re done!”

253
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:27,077
Do I really talk like that?

254
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,756
Yes, you can even do it now.

255
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:32,035
- You jerk.
- Look at you.

256
00:21:32,077 --> 00:21:33,217
You jerk!

257
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:36,514
Now look, he’s the one
going after you.

258
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:37,474
Isn’t it amazing?

259
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:38,350
I don’t know.

260
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,626
What should I say?

261
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:42,037
I’m happy because
Drake is chasing me?

262
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:45,048
Also, that term “being
chased” sounds bad.

263
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:45,465
Oh?

264
00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:48,510
Isn’t being chased mean I’m running
because someone’s chasing me?

265
00:21:48,802 --> 00:21:49,934
That’s so weird.

266
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:53,001
So that’s your setup now?

267
00:21:53,974 --> 00:21:55,895
No wonder you’ve been
spacing out earlier.

268
00:21:56,434 --> 00:21:59,454
That’s why, bestie. I’m
really out of it right now.

269
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,439
And finals are only
two weeks away.

270
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:06,294
And now there’s Drake,
the one I’m always with at night.

271
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,172
And Tripp, the one I’m
always with in the morning.

272
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:10,615
I’m so busy right now, bestie.

273
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:11,841
I’m confused.

274
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:15,043
Wow, you have shifting schedule?

275
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:16,504
Are you a nurse?

276
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:18,999
- “Shifting?”
- “Shifting?”

277
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:21,770
I don’t know.

278
00:22:22,335 --> 00:22:23,211
It’s stressful.

279
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:23,812
Oh!

280
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:25,922
Bestie, isn’t there an event at
Brenford today?

281
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:27,190
So?

282
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:32,988
Well, let’s clean up.
Because we’re going there now.

283
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:35,520
I don’t want to.
You go ahead.

284
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:39,668
Bestie, come on.
We don’t get to bond very often.

285
00:22:39,936 --> 00:22:40,979
Come on, let’s go.

286
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:43,273
Hurry up. Let’s go.

287
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:44,316
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

288
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:45,692
What else can I do?
You’re the one who invited me.

289
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:47,961
See, I haven’t even had a sip.

290
00:22:47,986 --> 00:22:49,840
Come on, let’s go.
Hurry up. You’re so slow.

291
00:22:50,155 --> 00:22:51,911
Wait, hold on!

292
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:56,953
You’re such in a rush, bestie.

293
00:22:57,704 --> 00:22:58,830
This is so good.

294
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:02,959
Is their fight really that bad?

295
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:04,686
Uhm...Bee?

296
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:05,848
Stop it!

297
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:08,715
Why are you here, Mr. Valdez?

298
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:12,293
I already told you
I don’t want to see you!

299
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:14,614
You’re really a stalker, aren’t you?

300
00:23:16,514 --> 00:23:18,575
I saw on your story
that you were here, so…

301
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:20,676
I came to see you.

302
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:27,184
Bee, I’m so sorry!

303
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:30,362
Forgive me, please!

304
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,121
Sorry, huh?

305
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,653
Apology not accepted!

306
00:23:38,036 --> 00:23:41,207
I don’t want to talk,
the aura here is scary.

307
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,567
This aura even beats Drake’s when
he dragged me after seeing me with Tripp.

308
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:47,670
- Bee!
- What?

309
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,633
Excuse me, it looks
like you two need to talk.

310
00:23:55,887 --> 00:23:58,786
It won’t happen again, Bee.
I promise.

311
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:00,301
You won’t do it again?

312
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:02,143
Come on, Kent!

313
00:24:02,837 --> 00:24:04,496
You’re such a mess.

314
00:24:04,896 --> 00:24:06,176
I’m sorry, Bee.

315
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:13,051
I’m so sorry, Bee!
Don’t leave me, please!

316
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:25,041
I wonder how Kent
and Aya are doing.

317
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,085
I hope they’re okay.

318
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:30,672
Ugh, wherever I go,
there’s always drama.

319
00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:35,629
I can’t go to Brenford because
Tripp’s there, I’d feel so guilty.

320
00:24:37,137 --> 00:24:40,056
I can’t go to the condo
either because Drake’s there.

321
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:44,035
It’s better to just
stay here at home.

322
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,676
No one will bother me.

323
00:24:46,646 --> 00:24:48,398
And I can actually study properly.

324
00:24:59,784 --> 00:25:01,149
Aunt Katrina...

325
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:05,123
How are you, Aunt?

326
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,251
I’m fine. And the baby, too.

327
00:25:09,085 --> 00:25:10,587
That’s good to hear.

328
00:25:12,255 --> 00:25:13,610
How about you?

329
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:15,610
How are you and Drake?

330
00:25:16,426 --> 00:25:18,553
Huh? What?

331
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,852
I know I don’t have
the right to say this.

332
00:25:27,854 --> 00:25:29,022
Please don’t hurt him.

333
00:25:30,732 --> 00:25:32,484
What do you mean?

334
00:25:34,194 --> 00:25:35,361
I know him, Alys.

335
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:38,948
Steve and I went
to his unit yesterday.

336
00:25:40,116 --> 00:25:43,036
Even if he doesn’t tell us,
we can tell he’s got a problem.

337
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:46,831
But Drake and I don’t
have any problems, Aunt.

338
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,418
Then good, if you
don’t have problems.

339
00:25:51,753 --> 00:25:52,795
But, Alys,

340
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,715
Drake may look tough,

341
00:25:57,258 --> 00:25:58,738
but inside,

342
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,792
he’s just as vulnerable
as everybody else.

343
00:26:03,598 --> 00:26:04,972
Please keep that in mind.

344
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,102
Thank you, Aunt.

345
00:26:08,978 --> 00:26:11,064
Thank you that you’re
concerned about Drake,

346
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:13,503
your concerned about us.

347
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:15,620
No problem.

348
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:19,972
What’s the baby’s
gender and name?

349
00:26:21,055 --> 00:26:25,267
A boy – and his name is
Ethos Sebastian Palma.

350
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:26,486
Wow!

351
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:28,515
I hope he’s as smart
as his older brother.

352
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,334
Oh, I hope he doesn’t have
the same mood swings as his brother.

353
00:26:34,003 --> 00:26:35,495
Oh, he kicked?

354
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:38,424
He heard us.

355
00:26:39,008 --> 00:26:40,235
You want to listen?

356
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,441
May I?

357
00:26:41,553 --> 00:26:42,667
Come close.

358
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:46,480
Hi, Ethos!

359
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:48,142
Gosh, he can’t stay still.

360
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,520
He kicked again.

361
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:53,690
He’s so active, like a
football player, Aunt.

362
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:56,776
Bee, come on.
I’m sorry, please.

363
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:00,780
Kent, you should’ve thought about
what would come out of your mouth

364
00:27:00,805 --> 00:27:02,287
so you wouldn’t be
apologizing now.

365
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,312
I’m sorry, Bee.

366
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:07,887
I really won’t do
it again, I promise!

367
00:27:07,912 --> 00:27:10,443
Why do you say all
sorts of things?

368
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:11,959
Sheen and I?

369
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:14,889
You should be disgusted!
Eeww!

370
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:16,838
I’m really sorry.

371
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:19,834
I’m just jealous of Sheen.

372
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:22,858
Yuck, Kent!

373
00:27:23,595 --> 00:27:25,888
Has your brain melted
from economics?

374
00:27:26,717 --> 00:27:27,834
Ugh!

375
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:30,226
I’m grossed out by
what you’re saying!

376
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:33,326
Come on, Bee. It’s because
you’re always together.

377
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:35,999
I’m just jealous.

378
00:27:36,024 --> 00:27:37,400
You’re jealous of nothing!

379
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:40,997
Yuck! I’m not into CB!

380
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:43,014
What if Sheen likes you?

381
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:45,584
Sheen doesn’t like me!

382
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:49,178
Besides, you’re my boyfriend.
Isn’t that enough?

383
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:52,123
Wow, you’re so choosy!

384
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:56,967
Go on.

385
00:27:57,387 --> 00:28:01,264
Say this first,
“I love you so much, Kent.”

386
00:28:01,382 --> 00:28:02,483
You wish!

387
00:28:05,146 --> 00:28:06,951
That’s why I love you so much.

388
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:08,826
You’re so mean.

389
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,053
Come on, let’s go on a date!

390
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,831
I missed you, Bee!
We’re good now!

391
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:17,690
Date me, okay?

392
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:19,208
You’re so bipolar, Kent!

393
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:20,960
Stay here. Safety first.

394
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:22,162
Oh, my god!

395
00:28:44,926 --> 00:28:46,006
Coast is clear.

396
00:28:48,304 --> 00:28:51,766
I’m already regretting choosing
a condo unit here.

397
00:28:52,725 --> 00:28:55,037
I could run into Drake anytime.

398
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:57,772
I need to be careful.

399
00:29:01,317 --> 00:29:02,318
Alys.

400
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:05,571
I failed already.

401
00:29:07,323 --> 00:29:09,242
Hi, Drake! I didn’t see you there.

402
00:29:14,497 --> 00:29:15,740
Are you hiding from me?

403
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:18,271
Of course not!

404
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:22,505
So, why didn’t you reply to
my messages since morning?

405
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:25,725
Uhm...

406
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:27,803
Alone time!

407
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:30,182
Sometimes it’s good to
make someone miss you.

408
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:35,326
Come on, hey!

409
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:36,733
Don’t be so serious.

410
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:42,100
Sorry for being this paranoid.

411
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,404
I just can’t help it, Alys.

412
00:29:47,238 --> 00:29:48,451
Please don’t dump me.

413
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:54,537
You can destroy what I have.
And you’re the only one I have left, Alys.

414
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:56,756
Drake.

415
00:29:58,708 --> 00:29:59,709
Let’s have dinner.

416
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:04,797
I already ate at home.

417
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:09,844
Can we talk tomorrow instead?

418
00:30:11,888 --> 00:30:13,222
Is there a problem, Alys?

419
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,102
I’m just tired.

420
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:23,649
I want to rest.

421
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:28,780
Thanks for your honesty.

422
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:31,193
I’ll see you tomorrow.

423
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:01,854
I hope you understand, baby.

424
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:08,486
I agreed to this, Mom.

425
00:31:09,111 --> 00:31:12,725
I agreed that if I fail
even just one subject,

426
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:14,992
you’ll send me to the States.

427
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:20,623
I have no choice but to just
honor my part of the agreement.

428
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:25,279
I’m sorry, Mom.

429
00:31:26,128 --> 00:31:27,296
I really tried.

430
00:31:28,172 --> 00:31:31,483
Sorry, baby.
We had an agreement.

431
00:31:32,385 --> 00:31:33,701
It’s okay, Mom.

432
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:35,770
Thanks for giving me a chance.

433
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:38,272
No problem, baby. I’ll go ahead.

434
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:24,558
What’s that?

435
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:31,581
Who is that?

436
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:46,597
Drake?

437
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:49,871
Good morning!

438
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:54,644
What time is it?

439
00:32:55,384 --> 00:32:57,178
It’s already past 10:00 AM.

440
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,390
Oh, Alys, aren’t you
supposed to avoid him?

441
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:03,893
Should you send him away?

442
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:07,105
But isn’t this what you wanted?

443
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:10,524
That somehow, he’d woo you
and choose you?

444
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:12,167
This is it.

445
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,781
One night ago, he left you
because you didn’t want secrets.

446
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:18,783
But what can you do?

447
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:20,959
And you also sent that...

448
00:33:22,328 --> 00:33:25,206
Has he seen it already?
That’s why he’s here even it’s still early.

449
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:26,988
Drake?

450
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,769
Mmm?

451
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:30,808
I’m sorry.

452
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:33,397
Why?

453
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:35,466
For hurting my feelings
over and over again?

454
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:38,427
I already said sorry.

455
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,513
And have you checked your FB?

456
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:41,644
What?

457
00:33:42,181 --> 00:33:44,225
I said, have you
checked your FB?

458
00:33:46,143 --> 00:33:48,729
What does my FB account
have to do with you hurting me?

459
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:50,597
Just check it.

460
00:33:59,448 --> 00:34:00,509
Log in.

461
00:34:01,943 --> 00:34:03,189
Relationship request?

462
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:05,412
Accept it, okay?

463
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:14,689
And don’t worry, Shaira
and I aren’t friends on FB.

464
00:34:14,714 --> 00:34:18,657
And if she sees it, by any chance,
I’ll explain to her.

465
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:20,118
Is that okay?

466
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:33,384
[In French] Only you. I love you, Alys.

467
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:35,568
Only you. I love you.

468
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:47,907
Why just on the neck?

469
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:51,009
Brush your teeth first
before I kiss you on the lips.

470
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:55,931
Darn it, I was actually feeling giddy. But
he shows some toothbrush spiel he knows.

471
00:34:57,006 --> 00:34:59,091
Oh well, The Drake Palma Way it is.

472
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:06,174
Get dressed after you eat, okay?

473
00:35:07,558 --> 00:35:08,579
Why?

474
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:11,829
Tripp went fishing
with Uncle Tristan.

475
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:13,439
Shaira went shopping
somewhere far away.

476
00:35:14,648 --> 00:35:15,907
So we’re gonna go on a date,

477
00:35:16,752 --> 00:35:17,753
online girlfriend.

478
00:35:23,532 --> 00:35:24,782
OMG!

479
00:35:25,326 --> 00:35:27,111
Sorry, Tripp and Shaira.

480
00:35:27,495 --> 00:35:29,439
I swear I’m going
to tell you both soon.

481
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:33,417
I can’t keep Drake a secret
anymore. My heart will explode.

482
00:35:35,878 --> 00:35:38,415
Uhm, where are we going?

483
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:39,579
Just somewhere.

484
00:35:43,353 --> 00:35:44,368
Noob.

485
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:47,281
Noob!

486
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:48,306
Mmm?

487
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:49,633
Where are we going?

488
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:55,751
Why are we in a cemetery?

489
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:16,720
Here.

490
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,106
Give this to my mom.
She’ll like you.

491
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:34,194
Goodness, Alys!

492
00:36:34,436 --> 00:36:36,747
Don’t expect he’d
open the door for you.

493
00:36:36,772 --> 00:36:40,025
In a year of being together, he never
opened the door for you.

494
00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:42,064
Hmp!

495
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:44,155
Okay, fine.

496
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:14,493
Wow, Drake, your
mom is so pretty.

497
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:16,562
I thought Aunt Katrina
looks like an angel.

498
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:17,822
But she’s even more angelic.

499
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,736
No wonder Drake looks hot.
His mom is pretty.

500
00:37:24,653 --> 00:37:28,103
Hi, mom! This is my
strange girlfriend, Alys.

501
00:37:28,532 --> 00:37:29,970
Alys, this is my mom.

502
00:37:31,202 --> 00:37:34,096
Uhm, hello, Drake’s mom.

503
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:35,126
Tss.

504
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:38,726
She’s my mom.
Call her “Mom”, too.

505
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:41,103
I don’t want to.
We’re not married yet.

506
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,579
If you’ll wait for our marriage just
to call her “Mom,” you’ll wait in vain.

507
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,454
I won’t propose to you
until you turn 28.

508
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:51,212
And why is that?

509
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:53,329
I’m only 18, you know.

510
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:54,850
So I’ll wait for 10 years?

511
00:37:54,892 --> 00:37:59,017
Both your dads made me promise not to
be intimate with you until you turn 20.

512
00:37:59,313 --> 00:38:01,398
And not to propose to you
until you turn 28.

513
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,125
So, yeah, you should wait.

514
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,235
You’re too much.

515
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,272
If you want my body,
Alys, wait for two years.

516
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:12,954
I’ll give in on the night of your
20th birthday, don’t worry.

517
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:16,347
Are you out of your mind?
What are you talking about?

518
00:38:16,372 --> 00:38:17,665
Alys, no, I’m not.

519
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:20,673
If I’m out of my mind,
I’ll kiss you senseless right now.

520
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:23,545
But since I’m not,
I’ll wait for two years.

521
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:28,275
I wish the ground
would swallow me.

522
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,053
I’m embarrassed by what
Palma is saying.

523
00:38:36,475 --> 00:38:37,486
For you.

524
00:38:40,938 --> 00:38:41,947
For you, Mom.

525
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:56,915
As I’ve said, Mom...

526
00:38:57,913 --> 00:38:59,454
This is my girlfriend, Alys.

527
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:05,478
I’ve told you before
that I like pretty girls.

528
00:39:07,193 --> 00:39:08,402
But I love her.

529
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,587
So to hell with physical appearance.
She’s cute, right?

530
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,698
Somebody stop me.

531
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:19,184
I’ll strangle him, even though I
get giddy despite his insults.

532
00:39:20,477 --> 00:39:21,854
Dad will have a baby soon.

533
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:25,314
Hopefully, he’ll be less clingy to me.

534
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:27,220
You’ve met Aunt Katrina, right?

535
00:39:27,651 --> 00:39:30,790
It’s the first time he
called her “Aunt”.

536
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:35,576
She’s been kind to me.
So I’m trying not to hate her anymore.

537
00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:37,478
She’s going to be
my brother’s mom.

538
00:39:37,953 --> 00:39:39,447
I hope you’d like her too, Mom.

539
00:39:39,788 --> 00:39:41,874
Dad loves her…I think.

540
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:44,384
Anyway, Mom —

541
00:39:45,544 --> 00:39:47,921
Alys has everything
I don’t like in a girl.

542
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:52,384
She’s annoying, she’s a noob,
she’s obnoxious, she’s clingy.

543
00:39:53,385 --> 00:39:54,837
But I love her.

544
00:39:56,013 --> 00:39:58,297
Get it together, Drake.
I’ll bite you later.

545
00:39:58,322 --> 00:40:00,157
And she can be
hurtful too, Mom, look.

546
00:40:01,352 --> 00:40:04,275
She always pulls my hair,
she bites me, she kicks me,

547
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:06,203
but I still love her.

548
00:40:15,908 --> 00:40:17,242
Are you proposing?

549
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:21,775
And she’s assuming, Mom.

550
00:40:22,492 --> 00:40:24,259
I don’t even know why I love her.

551
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:27,211
You’ve got a
memory of a bird, Alys.

552
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:30,297
Didn't I tell you I won't propose
to you until you turn 28?

553
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:32,900
Then why do you have a box like that?

554
00:40:32,925 --> 00:40:33,947
This one?

555
00:40:39,298 --> 00:40:41,454
I was supposed to give this
on the night of your birthday.

556
00:40:42,226 --> 00:40:43,352
But I messed up.

557
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:45,579
So I can only give it to you now.

558
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:56,965
Drake!

559
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,535
Oh no! This can’t be!

560
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,353
It’s my birthday today!

561
00:41:02,454 --> 00:41:03,462
Drake?

562
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,502
What really happened
to you on my debut?

563
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:11,923
Alys, that’s not my story to tell.

564
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:14,243
But I’ll still tell you.

565
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,569
You don’t have to answer
if you don’t want to.

566
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:18,642
It’s okay.

567
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:27,896
I should tell you this.

568
00:41:28,772 --> 00:41:31,358
That night, Shaira needed me.

569
00:41:33,777 --> 00:41:35,681
Shaira has suicidal tendencies.

570
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:39,032
I don’t even know why
she has those tendencies.

571
00:41:39,575 --> 00:41:40,909
She has everything —

572
00:41:42,943 --> 00:41:44,142
a complete family,

573
00:41:44,804 --> 00:41:46,282
she gets what she wants.

574
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:50,043
But still, she spirals
when she gets depressed.

575
00:41:51,128 --> 00:41:54,047
That’s why she always
wears bangles and a watch.

576
00:41:59,178 --> 00:42:02,055
Is it to cover her wounds?

577
00:42:03,765 --> 00:42:04,861
That night,

578
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:07,603
I was about to go to your debut.

579
00:42:08,145 --> 00:42:11,064
I was about to get out of the
car to greet you happy birthday,

580
00:42:12,024 --> 00:42:13,901
but then her nanny called.

581
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:15,157
She did it again.

582
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:17,009
What happened, nanny?

583
00:42:17,446 --> 00:42:22,301
Sir Drake, come here!
Hurry! It’s Ma’am Shaira!

584
00:42:22,326 --> 00:42:23,327
Again?

585
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:27,623
I was forced to go.

586
00:42:28,037 --> 00:42:30,623
Because they know I’m the only
one who could stop her.

587
00:42:31,598 --> 00:42:32,641
She’s crazy.

588
00:42:33,827 --> 00:42:34,915
She’s annoying.

589
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:36,462
She’s driving me nuts.

590
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:37,986
Drake!

591
00:42:39,593 --> 00:42:42,767
That’s why I couldn’t leave her.
She’s my best friend.

592
00:42:43,472 --> 00:42:45,098
I needed to break the door.

593
00:42:45,828 --> 00:42:48,345
She locked it and threatened me

594
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,312
that she will hurt herself.

595
00:42:55,651 --> 00:42:56,775
Shaira!

596
00:42:57,748 --> 00:42:59,041
And the night you ran off?

597
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,033
The night you saw us
come out of the bathroom...

598
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:08,069
I know you have a dirty mind, Alys.
So you probably thought wrong.

599
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:11,875
I swear, Alys, my
hands are pure.

600
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:13,986
I think.

601
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:15,627
I didn’t touch her one bit.

602
00:43:16,421 --> 00:43:20,383
Wow, all my doubts
were for nothing?

603
00:43:21,343 --> 00:43:22,553
Now that everything’s clear,

604
00:43:25,597 --> 00:43:29,518
will you accept this strawberry
as a sign of my affection for you?

605
00:43:47,911 --> 00:43:50,956
But why are you
telling me all this now?

606
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,724
Why didn’t you tell me before?

607
00:43:52,749 --> 00:43:53,829
Because…

608
00:43:56,253 --> 00:43:57,314
I don’t know.

609
00:43:58,964 --> 00:44:03,064
Can you not think about the
past and focus on the present?

610
00:44:04,303 --> 00:44:05,804
Let’s just be happy, Alys.

611
00:44:07,306 --> 00:44:09,474
Let’s not think about what’s
going to happen tomorrow.

612
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:12,009
Would that be alright, Alys?

613
00:44:13,645 --> 00:44:15,497
Can you do that for me?

614
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:16,525
For us?

615
00:44:19,026 --> 00:44:20,361
Yes, Drake, but…

616
00:44:20,944 --> 00:44:22,032
But what now?

617
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:25,866
But I’ll be your girlfriend

618
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:28,619
once everything’s okay
with Tripp and Shaira, okay?

619
00:44:29,828 --> 00:44:33,165
I’ll be your girlfriend once again,
if that’s alright with you.

620
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,460
I’ll see you again
tomorrow, after exams.

621
00:44:38,003 --> 00:44:39,630
Thanks for the
strawberry, Drake.

622
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:49,001
I miss you, Mom.

623
00:45:13,246 --> 00:45:16,083
You’re taking lots of pictures.
Just because it’s the last day?

624
00:45:20,045 --> 00:45:21,103
Smile, Zy.

625
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:29,153
You ignored me for days after…

626
00:45:34,518 --> 00:45:38,197
It’s just that,
you’re like my best friend.

627
00:45:38,438 --> 00:45:40,431
Then you start saying
all these things.

628
00:45:44,361 --> 00:45:45,384
Hey.

629
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:48,048
Talk to me, please.

630
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,915
I won’t stop bugging you, swear!

631
00:45:56,498 --> 00:45:58,095
I’ll treat you.
It’s on me.

632
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,835
Whatever.

633
00:46:00,548 --> 00:46:01,767
Wow.

634
00:46:01,878 --> 00:46:03,130
I’m treating you, and
you’re still like that.

635
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,514
Forever grumpy.

636
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,439
Now I can really say you
and Drake are cousins.

637
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:11,392
Come on, please.

638
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,828
Another picture.

639
00:46:17,853 --> 00:46:18,895
- Smile again.
- So, what now?

640
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,868
Let’s go?

641
00:46:21,565 --> 00:46:22,603
Where exactly are you taking me?

642
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,056
Taking you, really?

643
00:46:25,277 --> 00:46:26,337
Acting like a girl, huh?

644
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:30,072
I’m not courting you anymore.

645
00:46:30,657 --> 00:46:31,992
I’ve got the right to be grumpy.

646
00:46:34,077 --> 00:46:35,064
Whatever.

647
00:46:35,203 --> 00:46:35,929
Let’s go!

648
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:37,314
Let’s go somewhere.

649
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:38,775
Let’s hang out.

650
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:40,915
Remember this, Tripp?

651
00:46:44,504 --> 00:46:45,454
Freshman walk.

652
00:46:45,547 --> 00:46:46,648
Exactly!

653
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:47,966
This is where you left me!

654
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:49,478
You’re such a jerk!

655
00:46:55,265 --> 00:46:57,259
- Alys.
- Mmm?

656
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:01,142
I’m leaving.

657
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:02,606
Again?

658
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:04,782
Where are you going this time?

659
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:08,737
- Huh?
- Secret.

660
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,506
You know too much.

661
00:47:11,531 --> 00:47:13,325
So, where are you
going on vacation?

662
00:47:16,912 --> 00:47:17,954
It’s not a vacation.

663
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:23,782
I’m really leaving.

664
00:47:29,508 --> 00:47:30,509
For good.

665
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,064
Seriously?

666
00:47:36,556 --> 00:47:37,572
Not a prank?

667
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:41,384
Is it because of me?

668
00:47:43,647 --> 00:47:45,376
Are you still mad at me?

669
00:47:46,483 --> 00:47:47,943
I thought we were good.

670
00:48:04,918 --> 00:48:06,439
You’re overthinking, Zy.

671
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:09,306
I’ve planned this
for a long time ago.

672
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:12,798
What plan?

673
00:48:19,474 --> 00:48:21,059
I was only staying here for a sem.

674
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:25,423
I never really planned
to enroll in Brenford.

675
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,493
The truth is,

676
00:48:29,067 --> 00:48:31,403
I was planning to study
photography abroad,

677
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,603
even if Dad doesn’t approve.

678
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:37,650
Is that really the reason?

679
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:46,212
I’m good.

680
00:48:47,627 --> 00:48:48,634
Are you okay?

681
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:52,306
So, let’s go home.

682
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:06,798
You’re not mad at me, are you?

683
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:11,611
Believe me, Zy.

684
00:49:13,612 --> 00:49:14,704
I’m not mad at you.

685
00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:24,142
Tripp, I’ll miss you.

686
00:49:26,082 --> 00:49:27,290
I’ll miss you, too.

687
00:50:02,744 --> 00:50:03,995
Goodbye, Alys.

688
00:50:29,145 --> 00:50:30,173
Tripp.

689
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:34,079
Drake.

690
00:50:35,888 --> 00:50:36,899
Let’s talk.

691
00:50:44,911 --> 00:50:45,923
Yeah?

692
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:48,581
What can I do for you, your highness?

693
00:50:49,457 --> 00:50:51,040
I’m here because of Alys.

694
00:50:52,961 --> 00:50:54,379
So, what about Alys?

695
00:50:55,171 --> 00:50:56,415
Because of this exhibit?

696
00:50:57,841 --> 00:50:59,884
Don’t worry, you’re welcome here.

697
00:51:00,677 --> 00:51:01,845
Stay away from her.

698
00:51:05,515 --> 00:51:06,540
Who do you think you are?

699
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:08,435
Leave Alys alone.

700
00:51:09,185 --> 00:51:11,396
We both know you
don’t really like her.

701
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:17,485
Just because you’re smart,
it doesn’t mean you know what I feel.

702
00:51:18,987 --> 00:51:22,407
Yes, at first, I wanted
to get even with you.

703
00:51:26,236 --> 00:51:27,384
But I fell for her.

704
00:51:29,873 --> 00:51:31,048
I love Alys, Drake.

705
00:51:35,837 --> 00:51:36,837
Tripp...

706
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:39,572
Stop chasing after Alys, please.

707
00:51:40,175 --> 00:51:41,439
This time, let it be me.

708
00:51:44,554 --> 00:51:46,189
This time, let it be you?

709
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:50,048
Wow, Drake, really?

710
00:51:51,102 --> 00:51:53,720
What do you mean “this
time,” when it’s always you.

711
00:51:55,573 --> 00:51:56,665
Haven’t you noticed?

712
00:51:59,903 --> 00:52:02,970
In this family, you’re
always the golden boy.

713
00:52:03,615 --> 00:52:04,697
Why?

714
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:07,868
Just because your mom
died when you were young,

715
00:52:08,411 --> 00:52:10,829
the whole family has
to take care of you?

716
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,267
Only Drake is the great one.

717
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,337
Only Drake has to be cared for.

718
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,720
You always want the attention.

719
00:52:22,717 --> 00:52:26,554
Why do you think
I skip family reunions, Tripp?

720
00:52:29,516 --> 00:52:31,673
It’s because you might
think you’re the victim again.

721
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,938
Why did I study at SCA?

722
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,142
Even though I didn’t want to, Tripp.

723
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:41,653
Because I didn’t want you to think
I was competing with you.

724
00:52:42,403 --> 00:52:45,115
Now, am I still the one
who wants attention?

725
00:52:52,497 --> 00:52:53,581
Only this time, Tripp.

726
00:52:53,822 --> 00:52:57,032
I’m begging you.
Stay away from Alys.

727
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,045
It’s your turn to let go.

728
00:53:00,922 --> 00:53:02,257
She’s the only one I want.

729
00:53:04,634 --> 00:53:08,471
Please, Tripp. After this,
only Shaira will be my problem.

730
00:53:10,974 --> 00:53:13,226
You’re not the same
Drake I used to know.

731
00:53:14,936 --> 00:53:16,618
The one who had no stand,

732
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,357
the one giving false hope.

733
00:53:20,514 --> 00:53:22,057
You changed a lot.

734
00:53:23,528 --> 00:53:24,556
For the better.

735
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:29,111
And that’s all because of Alys.

736
00:53:31,244 --> 00:53:32,537
Drake, please.

737
00:53:35,455 --> 00:53:36,790
Don’t hurt her.

738
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:42,714
Don’t waste the time
you get to spend with her.

739
00:53:43,464 --> 00:53:44,556
Hello, son?

740
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:46,843
Yes, Dad? Why?

741
00:53:48,156 --> 00:53:50,704
Are you sure about
what you said last night?

742
00:53:51,316 --> 00:53:52,501
You’re serious?

743
00:53:53,782 --> 00:53:55,643
Oh, yes, Dad.

744
00:53:56,829 --> 00:54:00,439
I don’t want Brenford anymore.
I’ll go to New York.

745
00:54:01,149 --> 00:54:02,353
Alright, son.

746
00:54:02,483 --> 00:54:03,892
That’s a good decision.

747
00:54:04,652 --> 00:54:06,696
I’ll take care of
your transfer papers.

748
00:54:07,155 --> 00:54:08,314
Okay, Dad. Thank you.

749
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:21,517
Drake, I really tried my best.

750
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:24,265
I tried so hard.

751
00:54:25,548 --> 00:54:29,517
But it seems you’ve
made up your mind.

752
00:54:31,221 --> 00:54:37,337
You have the courage now to
fight for Alys... to fight for love.

753
00:54:37,393 --> 00:54:39,145
I guess this is it.

754
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:43,524
I’ll leave the Philippines for now.
It’s too heated here.

755
00:54:44,651 --> 00:54:48,655
I’ll be okay in New York,
so I can get away from Alys.

756
00:54:51,423 --> 00:54:56,037
I didn’t tell you, Drake,
but I’m serious about Alys.

757
00:55:06,881 --> 00:55:08,579
I’m rooting for the both of you.

758
00:55:09,759 --> 00:55:12,011
I hope you and Alys
will be happy.

759
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:14,259
Forever.

760
00:55:18,142 --> 00:55:19,259
Goodbye, Drake.

761
00:55:21,646 --> 00:55:22,790
Go.

762
00:55:22,939 --> 00:55:23,998
Go now.

763
00:55:24,023 --> 00:55:25,032
Go.

764
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,775
Goodbye.

765
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:36,579
Goodbye.

766
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:40,782
Mom...

767
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,420
After you left, I felt so lonely.

768
00:55:46,129 --> 00:55:47,588
But then Alys came.

769
00:55:48,076 --> 00:55:49,150
Drake Palma!

770
00:55:50,204 --> 00:55:51,426
You’re my boyfriend now!

771
00:55:51,426 --> 00:55:52,719
Okay, bye!

772
00:55:53,845 --> 00:55:55,032
She’s a weirdo...

773
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,681
like me.

774
00:55:57,307 --> 00:55:59,183
Keep dreaming. You’re ugly.

775
00:55:59,642 --> 00:56:01,165
She sees through me.

776
00:56:01,477 --> 00:56:04,897
I know behind
that tough exterior,

777
00:56:05,606 --> 00:56:08,084
there’s a lot of angst in him.

778
00:56:08,109 --> 00:56:10,278
I see it in his eyes.

779
00:56:10,903 --> 00:56:13,172
She’s the only person
who understands me.

780
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:14,365
Bestie, time to go home!

781
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,236
Makes me laugh.

782
00:56:17,618 --> 00:56:18,939
Bird brain!

783
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,361
You’re rude!

784
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:25,298
And stays despite my hang-ups.

785
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:28,923
Stand there until you remember.

786
00:56:30,423 --> 00:56:31,462
Huh?

787
00:56:32,091 --> 00:56:33,173
Drake!

788
00:56:33,509 --> 00:56:34,579
Drake!

789
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:37,180
1131.

790
00:56:44,312 --> 00:56:46,368
But, she loves Sheen.

791
00:56:47,023 --> 00:56:47,957
I was hurt.

792
00:56:47,982 --> 00:56:49,917
Can I talk to you
after dismissal?

793
00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:52,754
Alys, Dad wants to see you.

794
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:54,155
I’ll see you after dismissal.

795
00:56:55,831 --> 00:56:56,841
Drake!

796
00:56:56,866 --> 00:57:00,087
For the first time,
I felt really jealous.

797
00:57:00,127 --> 00:57:01,295
Let go of me!

798
00:57:02,121 --> 00:57:04,322
Next time,
when I give you something,

799
00:57:04,749 --> 00:57:06,476
don’t give it to someone else!

800
00:57:06,501 --> 00:57:07,477
Why Sheen?

801
00:57:07,502 --> 00:57:08,728
Are you two on a date?

802
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:10,813
Yes.

803
00:57:10,838 --> 00:57:11,981
Why not me?

804
00:57:12,006 --> 00:57:14,759
I’m not lying, I already
had my first kiss!

805
00:57:15,259 --> 00:57:16,368
With who?

806
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,695
With Sheen!

807
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,973
From that moment, I
realized that I like her.

808
00:57:22,683 --> 00:57:25,923
I know Alys loves
me and I love her, too.

809
00:57:26,604 --> 00:57:28,439
But I feel like I’m difficult to love.

810
00:57:44,122 --> 00:57:48,000
I know you cried more than
five times because of me.

811
00:57:48,405 --> 00:57:49,656
I’m also hurting.

812
00:57:52,286 --> 00:57:54,032
I’m sorry for making you cry.

813
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:57,892
Maybe there are more tears
to shed in the future.

814
00:57:58,803 --> 00:58:00,638
So this I say,
I’m sorry.

815
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:04,118
But this is me.

816
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:13,322
Alys?

817
00:58:15,278 --> 00:58:16,306
Alys?

818
00:58:18,406 --> 00:58:19,657
What if Alys leaves me?

819
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:22,827
I don’t know if I can handle it.

820
00:58:29,237 --> 00:58:30,290
Where are you?

821
00:58:33,546 --> 00:58:34,822
Then Shaira came back.

822
00:58:35,673 --> 00:58:36,732
Hi, Drake!

823
00:58:36,757 --> 00:58:37,758
Mind if I join you?

824
00:58:39,302 --> 00:58:40,511
I’m so excited!

825
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,571
Let's go!

826
00:58:41,596 --> 00:58:43,448
I know she is hurt.

827
00:58:43,656 --> 00:58:45,616
Why did you leave Shaira?

828
00:58:45,641 --> 00:58:47,577
I can handle her
being mad at me,

829
00:58:47,602 --> 00:58:49,270
I can’t handle you
not talking to me.

830
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:52,751
Are you sure this is safe?

831
00:58:52,953 --> 00:58:55,197
Tripp also came into the picture.

832
00:58:55,234 --> 00:58:56,461
Why are you with him?

833
00:58:56,486 --> 00:58:58,946
Are you accusing me
of cheating on you?

834
00:58:58,946 --> 00:59:00,381
Why, aren’t you?

835
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:02,407
Every time I saw them together…

836
00:59:02,658 --> 00:59:03,861
I’m going to court Alys.

837
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,329
…it felt like hell inside me.

838
00:59:06,704 --> 00:59:07,847
You like her?

839
00:59:07,872 --> 00:59:10,541
Good luck.
She likes breaking hearts.

840
00:59:11,735 --> 00:59:13,445
I don’t want to lose Alys.

841
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,671
She’s only mine.

842
00:59:17,131 --> 00:59:20,697
Alys Zyril Perez,
soon to be Palma.

843
00:59:20,903 --> 00:59:22,259
Right, boyfriend?

844
00:59:23,095 --> 00:59:26,618
Because you always hurt
my feelings. Right, girlfriend?

845
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:29,227
I really love Alys.

846
00:59:30,144 --> 00:59:31,228
I should kiss you.

847
00:59:31,812 --> 00:59:34,118
I will fight for Alys until the end.

848
00:59:34,478 --> 00:59:36,901
Once we start college,
we’ll go our separate ways.

849
00:59:37,652 --> 00:59:39,704
Who says that I’m
gonna break up with you?

850
00:59:40,321 --> 00:59:44,133
Alys, please be strong,
because I’m not.

851
00:59:44,158 --> 00:59:46,220
I don’t like it when
you speak profoundly.

852
00:59:47,662 --> 00:59:48,329
So annoying!

853
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:50,873
I like you weird and shallow.

854
00:59:51,415 --> 00:59:53,543
So does that mean you like me?

855
00:59:53,793 --> 00:59:57,672
I’m weak, I’m broken,
and I need you.

856
00:59:58,422 --> 01:00:01,634
You’ll be my noob –
mine and mine only.

857
01:00:02,301 --> 01:00:06,430
I wish I could tell you
all of this, but I can’t.

858
01:00:07,306 --> 01:00:08,939
I hate explaining things.

859
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,812
How am I supposed to
understand if you don’t explain?

860
01:00:13,104 --> 01:00:14,704
Because this is who I am.

861
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:19,694
Breaking up is a mutual decision,
and I don’t wanna break up with you.

862
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:23,470
But I know you love
me for who I am, Alys.

863
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,407
So, I will try to change for you.

864
01:00:27,285 --> 01:00:29,822
It will be baby steps.

865
01:00:30,663 --> 01:00:34,907
But promise, I will try.
Because I love you, Alys.

866
01:00:37,169 --> 01:00:40,715
All I know is that I’ll do
everything even if it hurts me.

867
01:00:44,051 --> 01:00:48,055
Alys Zyril Perez,
I’m crazy for you.

868
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:59,144
Is that her heartbeat or mine?

869
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:05,618
My bird brain.

870
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:07,462
My noob.

871
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:09,618
My seulement vous.

872
01:01:10,737 --> 01:01:11,790
I’m territorial.

873
01:01:34,769 --> 01:01:36,270
5:15 P.M.

874
01:01:41,025 --> 01:01:42,040
Alys.

875
01:01:44,607 --> 01:01:45,755
Drake.

876
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,615
I’ve accepted your
relationship request.

877
01:01:48,991 --> 01:01:50,051
Huh?

878
01:01:50,303 --> 01:01:51,888
I talked to Shaira and Tripp.

879
01:01:53,148 --> 01:01:54,233
And we’re now free.

880
01:02:00,336 --> 01:02:01,384
Wait.

881
01:02:01,782 --> 01:02:03,409
Why are there
baggages in your unit?

882
01:02:08,135 --> 01:02:09,971
I’m sorry, I didn’t
tell you right away.

883
01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:16,185
I’m leaving for New
York in a few days, Drake.

884
01:02:19,021 --> 01:02:22,358
Can you handle having a
girlfriend a million miles away?

885
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,079
This is when things are
getting better,

886
01:02:30,366 --> 01:02:32,009
you’re choosing to leave now?

887
01:02:32,034 --> 01:02:33,636
And New York of all places, Alys?

888
01:02:33,661 --> 01:02:34,745
That’s so far.

889
01:02:37,025 --> 01:02:38,157
LDR?

890
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:39,509
Can you handle it?

891
01:02:42,837 --> 01:02:45,172
I’ve gone from being a secret boyfriend

892
01:02:45,965 --> 01:02:47,758
to being a long distance boyfriend.

893
01:02:49,272 --> 01:02:50,407
Oh, well.

894
01:02:51,238 --> 01:02:53,103
My love life is so weird.

895
01:02:54,932 --> 01:02:57,451
Wow, so you know how
to joke now, huh.

896
01:02:57,476 --> 01:02:59,145
Even now, I miss you already.

897
01:03:00,604 --> 01:03:04,103
But you said you’d propose
when I turn 28, right?

898
01:03:04,859 --> 01:03:06,892
That’s still 10 years from now.

899
01:03:07,069 --> 01:03:09,155
I know. I’m already counting the days.

900
01:03:09,697 --> 01:03:12,408
I’m sure that you’re the one I
wanna spend my boring life with.

901
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:18,539
If I hadn’t made that promise
to Mom, I wouldn’t want to leave.

902
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,626
I’m happy here in the Philippines.

903
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,470
This one’s for you.

904
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:41,520
Engagement ring.

905
01:03:44,523 --> 01:03:45,532
Plastic?

906
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:47,710
Come on, Drake!

907
01:03:47,735 --> 01:03:49,487
Even if it’s plastic and
looks like it’s for kids,

908
01:03:49,528 --> 01:03:51,611
I worked hard to win it
from the arcade machine.

909
01:03:53,157 --> 01:03:58,704
That’s the proof that I’m willing
to be part of your boring life.

910
01:03:59,538 --> 01:04:00,751
Remember that, okay?

911
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:03,939
You’re weird, you know that?

912
01:04:07,755 --> 01:04:09,607
I accept your proposal, Alys.

913
01:04:09,632 --> 01:04:11,692
But since you’ll be flying soon,

914
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:14,790
I’ll kiss you senseless, to
compensate for all the years.

915
01:04:16,138 --> 01:04:17,243
- What?
- Sshh!

916
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,062
Drake will kiss you,
but don’t tell your dads.

917
01:04:23,521 --> 01:04:24,665
They’re gonna kill me.

918
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:46,572
You were just a dare
at first, Drake Palma.

919
01:04:47,419 --> 01:04:48,462
Just a challenge.

920
01:04:49,755 --> 01:04:53,425
But what we went through challenged
me beyond what I could imagine.

921
01:04:54,218 --> 01:04:56,053
I don’t know how
I fell in love with you.

922
01:04:57,429 --> 01:04:59,431
But maybe that’s how love is.

923
01:05:00,057 --> 01:05:03,978
It can’t be explained
– you just feel it.

924
01:05:17,074 --> 01:05:21,845
I can’t explain why I deeply
love you, Alys Zyril Perez.

925
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:23,914
It’s too deep,

926
01:05:23,914 --> 01:05:28,252
to the point that I can’t contain
how my crazy heart beats for you.

927
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:33,329
You’re the only person who
made me realize that love waits,

928
01:05:34,174 --> 01:05:36,844
love understands, and
most of all –

929
01:05:37,304 --> 01:05:38,806
love forgives.

930
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:49,896
[In French] Only you.

931
01:05:52,654 --> 01:05:54,595
I love you, Alys Zyril Perez.

932
01:05:55,404 --> 01:05:59,743
I love you so much too,
Drake Sebastian Palma.

933
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,001
Action!

934
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:43,181
I learned from the best.

935
01:06:48,582 --> 01:06:49,625
Hey.

936
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,214
My child!

937
01:08:19,673 --> 01:08:21,300
You’re talking too much!

938
01:08:22,301 --> 01:08:23,927
That hurts!

939
01:08:31,727 --> 01:08:32,978
Centipede!

940
01:09:59,356 --> 01:10:03,485
It’s a wrap for SDP Season 1!

941
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:08,699
SDP, it’s a wrap!

942
01:10:21,194 --> 01:10:22,528
1...2...

943
01:10:23,528 --> 01:10:24,988
[In French] Only you.

944
01:10:28,218 --> 01:10:30,063
I love you, Alys Zyril Perez.

945
01:10:30,907 --> 01:10:34,243
I love you so much,
Drake Sebastian Palma.

946
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:39,479
2...3...4...5...

947
01:10:39,504 --> 01:10:40,711
And cut!

948
01:10:41,587 --> 01:10:42,617
He said cut!

949
01:10:44,899 --> 01:10:46,067
You wanted more.
