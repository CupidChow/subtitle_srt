1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,503
Previously on Seducing Drake Palma.

2
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:08,805
Hey, Drake.

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,845
Do we have a monthsary?

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,145
Tss.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,170
Oh!

6
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:16,091
The best thing to do

7
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,984
is to take your shirt off.

8
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:22,489
I know!

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,491
Let’s just say we got
together on September 31!

10
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,058
Stupid.

11
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,028
There’s no September 31.

12
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,903
Can we rehearse the garter part?

13
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,172
Drake and Alys, please.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,540
Miss Blossom.

15
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:42,808
Whatever.

16
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,744
Every 31st will be our monthsary,

17
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:47,247
so we only have to celebrate
seven times a year.

18
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:50,477
We’re graduating in
a few months.

19
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,753
Once we start college,
we’ll go our separate ways.

20
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,590
Who says that I’m gonna
break-up with you?

21
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:00,692
Hmm?

22
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,394
I’m territorial.

23
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,933
If someone said that to you,

24
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:38,962
wouldn’t you fold?

25
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:29,037
I love you, Drake Palma!

26
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:32,045
It has been two weeks
after the “I’m territorial” moment.

27
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:34,506
Of course, there’s progress.

28
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:46,303
We have lunch
maybe twice a week.

29
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:50,353
Naturally, the girls were shocked.

30
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,006
They couldn’t contain
their jealousy!

31
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:18,337
We even became a hot
topic in school because...

32
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:21,075
of course, we are always together.

33
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:33,903
We’re doing fine
until Christmas.

34
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:35,727
Merry Christmas!

35
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:42,169
I felt a little sad since
he didn’t give me a gift.

36
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:47,660
But even though it was raining,
he still came to make it up to me.

37
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,857
Thank you!

38
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,110
I  also told him we’ll have a vacation
during Christmas break,

39
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:58,898
so we wouldn’t see each other.

40
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:01,099
He just said, “OK.”

41
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:15,341
Oh, well.

42
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,125
I forgot to save
that annoying guy’s number.

43
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:21,033
And then...

44
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:23,271
New Year came.

45
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:25,005
But…

46
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:27,508
will anything actually change?

47
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,667
Alys!

48
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,569
Come down here, it’s New Year!

49
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,679
Come!

50
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,114
Come on, sweetheart! Let’s go!

51
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,208
Okay, Mom!

52
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,367
I’ll be right there!

53
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:56,514
Hi, Mom.

54
00:04:57,887 --> 00:04:59,225
Dad’s getting married soon.

55
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:02,937
I don’t think I can stop them.

56
00:05:05,374 --> 00:05:06,976
I don’t think there’s
anything I can do.

57
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:10,490
I’m sorry, Mom.

58
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:19,583
But I met someone.

59
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:23,426
She’s interesting.

60
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,474
She’s nice.

61
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:31,367
I know you’d like her, Mom.

62
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:40,805
I miss you, Mom.

63
00:05:57,727 --> 00:05:59,203
Bestie, let’s go!

64
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:01,097
They’re waiting for
us at the wedding!

65
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:02,498
Can’t you wait?

66
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,607
You’re so slow!

67
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:14,210
You’re trying to look
pretty for Drake, aren’t you?

68
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:16,679
She’s trying to make herself pretty.

69
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:17,724
Whatever!

70
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,951
Who told you to
wait for me, anyway?

71
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,216
I don’t know with you!

72
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,687
I told you I don’t
know anyone there!

73
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,248
Why would I go alone?

74
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:29,024
You’re in such a rush, but you’re
not even part of the entourage!

75
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,362
Okay, I’m ready!

76
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:32,169
Let’s go!

77
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:33,662
- Hey, wait a second!
- Let’s go!

78
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:34,663
See?

79
00:06:34,663 --> 00:06:35,693
Bestie, wait up!

80
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,302
Hurry up.

81
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:41,445
Good luck.

82
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,474
Thank you.

83
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:43,773
- Uncle Steve!
- Hi, Uncle!

84
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:44,849
Hello!

85
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:47,243
Wow, you look
good today.

86
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:48,452
You’re so handsome.

87
00:06:48,477 --> 00:06:49,678
Glad your wedding
pushed through.

88
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:51,138
Wasn’t it supposed
to be in October?

89
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:52,665
Moved to February?

90
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:54,792
Just kidding!

91
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:56,952
Go on inside,
the coordinator’s already there.

92
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:58,888
Thanks, Uncle. Congrats!

93
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:00,121
Hurry up!

94
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:11,600
Mom’s so annoying!

95
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,055
She really made me
look like a rice cake!

96
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:19,719
Good thing I convinced her to
let me wear doll shoes instead.

97
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:23,112
Wearing six-inch
heels is so stressful!

98
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:25,281
I feel like a model!

99
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:27,406
Hi, Miss Beautiful!

100
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:34,647
Why are you here, gate crasher?

101
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,250
Come on, Bee.

102
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,344
I’m here because of you.

103
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:42,202
Stop winking like that!
You look crazy!

104
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:44,695
We’re at a wedding,
and you’re acting up!

105
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:47,878
You look beautiful today, Bee!

106
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:50,548
Maybe you dressed up
because of me.

107
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:51,602
Right?

108
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:58,015
Honestly, I don’t know
where you get that nerve!

109
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,857
You’re so handsome, huh?

110
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:00,991
I know!

111
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:02,618
That’s why you’re so
in love with me.

112
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:05,563
Dream on.

113
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:07,131
But sure, tell yourself that.

114
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,750
It’s free to dream!

115
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:10,320
Exactly!

116
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:12,741
Bee, you’re my dream!

117
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:18,648
One more word and
I swear I’ll hurt you!

118
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,430
Bee, wait!

119
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:22,413
Oh no, Bee!

120
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:23,514
I’m sorry!

121
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:25,908
What did you just do,
Kent Justin Valdez?

122
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:27,376
Shh, quiet down!

123
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:28,512
What the hell?!

124
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:30,820
- Be quiet! This is your fault!
- I’m sorry.

125
00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:34,570
I’ll take care of it, Bee.

126
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:37,406
You can thank me in
advance for this.

127
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:39,421
Why are you taking
your clothes off?

128
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,057
I’m saving you.

129
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:52,489
He looks handsome.

130
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:54,870
I’m so lucky to have him.

131
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,773
Thank you.

132
00:08:57,873 --> 00:08:59,016
What about you, Bee?

133
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,251
Are you going to change?

134
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:01,320
What’s the plan?

135
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:04,079
Uh…

136
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:06,365
I’ll buy new clothes.

137
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:08,717
Come on, I’ll go with you.

138
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:31,949
Alright, everyone,
get ready!

139
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:33,538
The bride is here!

140
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:37,513
Entourage, to your places please!

141
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:05,808
We’ve already
practiced this, okay?

142
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:09,445
Sweetheart, are you listening?

143
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,031
Yes.

144
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:13,524
Okay.

145
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:16,785
My heart, can you calm down?

146
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:20,356
This weirdo might find out
I have a crush on him.

147
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:21,382
Shall we?

148
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,901
She’s stunning.

149
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,445
Huhu.

150
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,026
How can my cute face compete with
Aunt Katrina’s goddess beauty?

151
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:44,492
Staring is rude.

152
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:46,815
You think so?

153
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:49,765
You’re not handsome.

154
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:51,507
I know.

155
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:52,749
Good that you know.

156
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:54,390
I don’t want to be handsome.

157
00:10:58,037 --> 00:10:59,287
I just want to be loved.

158
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,731
By you, perhaps?

159
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:11,306
Was that a pick-up line by
Drake Sebastian Palma?

160
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:14,635
Pick-up line–
The Drake Palma Way?

161
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:23,352
Today isn’t just
about vows or rings–

162
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:26,989
it’s about two hearts
choosing each other...

163
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:30,492
fully, freely, and faithfully.

164
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:34,129
In front of God and the
people who matter most.

165
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:35,931
So let me ask you, Steve –

166
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,534
do you receive Katrina
as the love of your life?

167
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:44,453
Do you promise to stand by
her side not just when it’s easy,

168
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:48,636
but when love asks for
patience, grace and courage?

169
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:53,042
Will you be her safe
place, her partner in faith,

170
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:57,519
and her greatest encourager
everyday God gives you together?

171
00:11:58,238 --> 00:11:59,315
Yes, I do.

172
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:01,401
And Katrina,

173
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:06,462
do you receive Steve as your
husband and your heart’s companion?

174
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:09,839
Will you choose him again
and again through storms,

175
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:14,937
through laughter, through every
ordinary day that becomes sacred

176
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,813
because it is shared?

177
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,339
I do.

178
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,745
With the authority
that God has given me,

179
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:24,813
to say the word that you’ve
been waiting for,

180
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:29,284
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

181
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:31,103
You may now kiss the bride.

182
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,330
We’ll get off here, Sir.

183
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,437
- Let’s go, Bee.
- Go down.

184
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:50,205
- Give me your stuff.
- So slow.

185
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:51,406
Here, I’ll help you.

186
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:54,209
- Thank you.
- Hurry up.

187
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,210
Bee, wait up!

188
00:12:55,611 --> 00:12:57,346
See? We missed everything!

189
00:12:58,147 --> 00:12:59,815
We just got here
and now we’re leaving?

190
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:01,244
Annoying.

191
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:06,587
Hey!

192
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:08,314
Why are you scaring me?

193
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:10,526
You’re thinking too deeply.

194
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:12,330
Why are you spacing out?

195
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,165
Why are you dressed like that?

196
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:19,830
Where did you go?

197
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,771
Oh my gosh!
Did something happen?

198
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:24,439
Uhh…

199
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,908
Oh, you see that?

200
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:32,071
Who would've thought that the girl who
is scared of love would eventually give in?

201
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,103
Ouch!

202
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:36,994
You’re talking too much,
you sound crazy!

203
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:40,689
My dress got torn and KL helped me
to get a new one?

204
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:43,492
Yiee, “KL”!

205
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:46,061
They already have a
term of endearment.

206
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:48,597
Shut up.
“KL” means “little pest”!

207
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:49,873
Tss.

208
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:50,607
As if!

209
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:52,134
- You’re the one who’s “KL”!
- What?

210
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:55,370
You’re pretending to not care.

211
00:13:57,272 --> 00:13:58,209
What?

212
00:13:58,234 --> 00:13:59,415
You’re enjoying this too much!

213
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:01,400
Whatever, I’m going home.

214
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:04,354
You just got here and
now you’re leaving again?

215
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,744
Mom and I are going to Batangas.

216
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,484
Dad suddenly planned a family outing.

217
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:12,187
Yiee, KL is coming with you!

218
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:13,228
Is he coming?

219
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,939
It’s a family outing!

220
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:19,294
Why not? KL’s family too, right?

221
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,195
Go ask your Mom!

222
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:27,697
There’s your boyfriend, Bestie!

223
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:32,616
Bye, Bestie!

224
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:33,759
Aja!

225
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:36,220
Bye, Alys!

226
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:37,187
Why are you following me?

227
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:38,513
Of course, I’m coming with you!

228
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:39,781
Where you go, I go!

229
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,026
Oh my gosh, he’s coming closer!

230
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:43,794
Okay.

231
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,759
Should I keep a
poker face or smile?

232
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,376
Shocks, I feel pressured.

233
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:51,059
Breathe, Alys, breathe.

234
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:52,169
Stay calm.

235
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:53,245
Just act cool.

236
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:54,447
Stay cool, okay?

237
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
What?

238
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:01,102
Let’s go.

239
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:02,603
Where?

240
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:04,539
Reception. Stupid.

241
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:09,111
At the hotel! Where else?

242
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:11,086
Why would I go
with you to the hotel?

243
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,586
You’re my crush but
I won’t give you my body.

244
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:19,571
Are you scared?

245
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:21,501
Pervert!

246
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:26,052
I’m your boyfriend,
and you’re my girlfriend.

247
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,731
It’s about time.

248
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:32,903
Drake, stop joking like that!

249
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:33,938
It’s not funny!

250
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:36,872
I’m dead serious...

251
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:38,740
...love.

252
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:40,742
Love?

253
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:44,246
Should I go with him to the hotel?

254
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,345
No!

255
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:49,848
Don’t fall for his sweet talk!

256
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,694
I must go away from
that possessive maniac.

257
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:56,383
Bird brain.

258
00:15:56,992 --> 00:15:58,393
Drake.

259
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:01,605
I’m kidding.

260
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,732
I know the words
“wait” and “respect.”

261
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,202
I’ll wait at our table.

262
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:08,485
Okay?

263
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:22,551
Lord, is it Valentine’s Day today?

264
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:25,620
I’m thriving today!

265
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:37,365
Kei.

266
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,967
What is it now, Sheen?

267
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,027
Can I talk to you?

268
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:43,433
About what?

269
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:46,441
If it’s about getting
back together again,

270
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:48,777
my answer is still no.

271
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:50,161
Kei...

272
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:53,864
why did you leave me?

273
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:56,485
About this again?

274
00:16:57,786 --> 00:16:59,121
I need closure.

275
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:02,020
I love you.

276
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:04,726
And I want to move
on with my life.

277
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:08,481
I still have doubts
about myself.

278
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:12,634
I want to be completely sure
when I say I love you.

279
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,569
I don’t love Drake.

280
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:16,129
I just find him interesting.

281
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:20,409
We wouldn’t have lasted
almost a year if I didn’t love you.

282
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,630
Kei.

283
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,747
I loved you, Sheen.

284
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:27,950
Believe me.

285
00:17:29,284 --> 00:17:30,284
But…

286
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:31,815
I fell out of love.

287
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,990
Kei...

288
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,895
did I do something wrong?

289
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:41,897
None. None, Sheen.

290
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:44,366
I was wrong, not you.

291
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:46,101
You’re too good for me.

292
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:50,138
I’m so sorry.

293
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:52,541
So…

294
00:17:53,092 --> 00:17:54,092
this is it.

295
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:58,512
This is what?

296
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:02,617
I guess...

297
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:05,420
this is goodbye.

298
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:07,956
I loved you, Kei.

299
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:49,297
Drake is taking so long
to come back.

300
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:55,203
- Congratulations, Steve!
- Thanks!

301
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,838
I’ll just be there,
I’ll walk around.

302
00:18:56,838 --> 00:18:58,041
Uncle Steve!

303
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
Alys!

304
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:02,844
Congrats, Uncle Steve!

305
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:03,869
Thanks!

306
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,845
Why is Aya not with you?

307
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:08,750
She left early,
something suddenly came up.

308
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:10,039
Oh, I see.

309
00:19:10,064 --> 00:19:11,580
I’m actually looking for Katrina.

310
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:13,955
Hold on, enjoy yourself
here, I’ll go find her.

311
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:16,025
Sure, Uncle. Congrats again!

312
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,265
Where’s Drake, anyway?

313
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:27,068
He knows I don’t know anyone
here, and he still left me alone.

314
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:45,620
Interesting.

315
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:52,259
Wrong timing.

316
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:54,753
Maybe next time.

317
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:04,973
Stop this, Aki!

318
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,008
Your Dad and I are married!

319
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:09,819
I know.

320
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:10,844
Good!

321
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:12,714
Then stop this already!

322
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:14,648
I can’t.

323
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:17,069
Please, Aki!

324
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:19,788
Alys is here!
She’s your girlfriend!

325
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,081
I know, but I want you!

326
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:31,933
Your Dad and I are married.

327
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,102
What part of that
don’t you understand?

328
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:35,485
I’m blinded by you!

329
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:39,750
Do you think I want this?

330
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:41,703
Hell no!

331
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:44,846
Because you keep
on entertaining me.

332
00:20:46,014 --> 00:20:47,649
I know you want me, too!

333
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,518
I don’t like you, Drake.

334
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,383
Not romantically!

335
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:55,090
You want to know the truth?

336
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:59,027
I’m just concerned about you because I know
how hung up you are on your Mom’s death.

337
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,125
You’re a witch!

338
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:02,796
Maybe I am.

339
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:05,600
But right now, I’m your stepmom.

340
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:08,403
And Alys is in your life.

341
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:11,273
Choose her.

342
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:15,143
Stop messing with her feelings.

343
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:18,113
That’s enough, Drake!

344
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:31,392
I’m sorry, Mom.

345
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:36,689
I could not stop Dad
from marrying her.

346
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,901
But I’ll still try.

347
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:43,071
For you.

348
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:08,496
Where did she go?

349
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:14,736
Why woud you do that, Drake?

350
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:18,540
Why are you playing
with my feelings?

351
00:22:21,276 --> 00:22:22,410
Oh hi, Alys!

352
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,410
You’re still up?

353
00:22:24,063 --> 00:22:25,364
How was the wedding?

354
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:32,087
Princess, are you okay?

355
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,889
Yeah, Mom.
I’m just really thirsty.

356
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:46,101
Are you sure you’re okay?

357
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:53,575
Well, if you’re not feeling well,
just let me know, okay?

358
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:56,286
I’ll go ahead, I’ll rest up.

359
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:57,846
Okay? Good night.

360
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,180
Thanks, Mom.

361
00:23:26,474 --> 00:23:28,243
Why am I crying?

362
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:32,814
I don’t cry this easily.

363
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,697
Only Mom,

364
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:37,504
Dane,

365
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,408
Dad Andy, and Daddy Cyriel
have made me cry like this.

366
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,337
Why am I crying over you...

367
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,535
Drake Sebastian Palma?

368
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:22,867
Bestie,

369
00:24:23,983 --> 00:24:25,318
is something
bothering you?

370
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:27,130
Please, Aki!

371
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:29,740
Alys is here!
She’s your girlfriend!

372
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:31,474
I know, but I want you!

373
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:34,354
I don’t even know
why I’m like this.

374
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,797
I haven’t been able
to sleep for days.

375
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:38,590
Every time I close my eyes,

376
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:41,460
I hear Drake and
Aunt Katrina talking.

377
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,512
I don’t even have
the right to feel hurt.

378
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:46,423
I’m just his girlfriend,
not the one he loves.

379
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:47,791
Hey.

380
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:51,943
Are you sick?

381
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:56,099
Why are you studying?

382
00:24:58,702 --> 00:25:00,579
I thought you’re concerned.

383
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,788
I am concerned.

384
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:04,860
What’s going on with you?

385
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:06,810
I don’t even know.

386
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,829
Maybe this is just how it is.

387
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:11,056
You focus on something else–

388
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:14,326
so you don’t have to
think about the things that hurt you.

389
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,149
What is it?

390
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:18,607
Nothing, I’m just bored.

391
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:20,634
You’re studying
out of boredom?

392
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:23,687
You know what,
let’s just have lunch.

393
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,219
Fight your boredom
with food, Bestie!

394
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:28,832
I don’t want go out.

395
00:25:28,923 --> 00:25:30,826
I’m not ready to see Drake.

396
00:25:30,851 --> 00:25:32,085
I’m still hurting.

397
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,412
Let’s go?

398
00:25:33,554 --> 00:25:35,180
I brought food. You go ahead.

399
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:36,312
Wow!

400
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:37,474
Really? Where is it?

401
00:25:37,474 --> 00:25:38,508
Let me see!

402
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:41,244
From Singapore,

403
00:25:41,244 --> 00:25:43,783
- Wow! That’s a lot.
- it’s from Daddy.

404
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,177
Aunt Liana's based there now.

405
00:25:47,418 --> 00:25:48,664
Your stepmom?

406
00:25:51,263 --> 00:25:55,167
Wow, that’s a
lot and imported too!

407
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,899
Don’t try to steal some.

408
00:25:57,828 --> 00:25:59,563
You’re so selfish.

409
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:01,852
I'm close with Uncle Cy!

410
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,011
Come on, Bestie.
Let me have some.

411
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:07,852
Share your blessings!

412
00:26:08,294 --> 00:26:10,735
I don’t want.

413
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:13,954
Selfish.

414
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:16,360
I’ll just eat by
myself at the cafeteria.

415
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,743
Wow, she really won’t share!

416
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:29,352
Whatever!

417
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:33,408
I’m done with you!

418
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,576
I’m not giving you food.

419
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:50,406
This is all mine.

420
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:51,993
Tss.

421
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:55,575
Lunch.

422
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:58,030
I’m still full.

423
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,775
This is hard.

424
00:27:01,858 --> 00:27:04,002
I can’t just ignore him.

425
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:06,344
I can’t be cold either.

426
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:09,199
It’s not his fault I
ended up liking him.

427
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:12,803
My gosh, life’s so confusing!

428
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:15,674
Why can’t we just like each other,
end of story?

429
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:16,869
Lunch.

430
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,029
I said I’m full.

431
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:56,555
Eat.

432
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,114
There might be poison in here.

433
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:00,119
Then, good!

434
00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:02,319
You’re seriously insane.

435
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:20,812
I really love this ramen.

436
00:28:20,837 --> 00:28:24,307
Wow, even the ramen gets loved.

437
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:26,030
Shut up and eat.

438
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,921
I said I’m still full—

439
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:51,885
Are you trying to kill me?

440
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,112
It’s good, right?

441
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,762
Why would I do
that to my girlfriend?

442
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:06,190
Girlfriend, but he keeps hurting me.

443
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:10,150
About that, Drake...

444
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:12,994
we should break up.

445
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,080
Why is it like this?

446
00:29:19,836 --> 00:29:22,605
Why is he treating me
differently now?

447
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:26,177
I like it better when he’s not
looking at me,

448
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:30,209
when he’s ignoring me,
when he’s not talking to me.

449
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:31,975
I hate this.

450
00:29:32,676 --> 00:29:33,676
Oh, well.

451
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:37,236
I said can we break up already?

452
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:39,574
Why?

453
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:41,869
Because you don’t even like me.

454
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:45,030
And I don’t like you either.

455
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,580
I don’t want to.

456
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:52,074
Let’s just break up, please?

457
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:55,882
Your reason is not
enough, Miss Perez.

458
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,634
I said I don’t want this anymore!

459
00:29:57,634 --> 00:29:59,025
I want out!

460
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:07,202
You’re the one who
volunteered to be my girlfriend.

461
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:11,014
Take responsibility.

462
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:13,964
Eat.

463
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:20,861
I really bought that for you.

464
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:45,348
Don’t make this
hard for me, Drake.

465
00:30:59,162 --> 00:31:00,372
Wow.

466
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:01,846
It’s so serene here.

467
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,255
You’re such a loner here.

468
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:16,451
Sheen!

469
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:19,282
What are you doing here?

470
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:21,451
Nothing. Just for a change.

471
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:23,607
How about you?
Why aren’t you with Kent?

472
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,256
He’s at the cafeteria with Aya.

473
00:31:26,445 --> 00:31:28,224
He’s totally into
your best friend.

474
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:29,633
They’re cute, right?

475
00:31:29,658 --> 00:31:30,693
They look good together.

476
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,677
Sheen, are you okay?

477
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:41,571
We’re really broken up now, Alys.

478
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:44,944
What do you mean "really"?

479
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,100
Weren’t you
broken up already?

480
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:51,046
This time it’s final.

481
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:52,772
We’re really done.

482
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,530
There’s no going back.

483
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,001
It’s fine!

484
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,310
At least now,
I can really move on.

485
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,552
It’s okay, Sheen.

486
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,831
Who knows, once you’re
in St. Collete Academy,

487
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:16,415
you might meet someone
better than Kei, right?

488
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:18,941
I don’t know.

489
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:20,953
Whatever.

490
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:24,080
For now, I’m just going to
enjoy being single.

491
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:26,735
Right, best friend?

492
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,976
Of course!

493
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:29,160
Let’s eat.

494
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,390
That’s for me?

495
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:33,990
Drake!

496
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,442
Drake, what the heck?!

497
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:45,929
Drake, what’s going on?!

498
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:47,421
What was that?!

499
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:49,296
Hey!

500
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,307
What’s your problem?

501
00:32:51,332 --> 00:32:52,976
Why did you do that?

502
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:57,685
Let go of me, Drake!

503
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:00,007
Let go!

504
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,601
Next time,
when I give you something,

505
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,821
don’t give it to someone else!

506
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:07,766
Why are you yelling?!

507
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,257
Because you’re forcing me to!

508
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:13,460
Haven’t you heard
of “sharing is caring”?

509
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:15,373
It’s useless.

510
00:33:16,712 --> 00:33:18,398
I forgot that you’re
in love with him.

511
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:23,234
You’re right.

512
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:26,613
Would you do me a favor
and break up with me?

513
00:33:28,778 --> 00:33:30,647
Since he’s broken up with Kei,

514
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:34,450
maybe I stand—

515
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,752
You don’t stand a chance.

516
00:33:37,654 --> 00:33:38,882
Not when I’m around.

517
00:33:42,886 --> 00:33:44,679
You’re horrible!

518
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,156
You’re so horrible!

519
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:50,597
Why won’t you let me go?!

520
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,664
You like Aunt Katrina, don’t you?!

521
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:00,925
I know, Drake.

522
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:05,038
I know you’re just
playing with me,

523
00:34:05,227 --> 00:34:08,731
so please, let’s end this.

524
00:34:09,043 --> 00:34:11,491
You’re so unfair, Drake.

525
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,794
What if—

526
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,927
I’m already starting
to fall for you?

527
00:34:17,997 --> 00:34:19,038
That’s just it?

528
00:34:20,495 --> 00:34:23,565
I’m the one who gets hurt
because you don’t love me?

529
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:39,316
I can’t promise to
catch you when you fall,

530
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:42,578
but I assure you

531
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,159
that I’ll be here
while you’re falling.

532
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:51,347
Am I supposed to
feel giddy about that?

533
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:52,394
Tss.

534
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:03,702
I can’t promise...

535
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,268
that I’ll learn to love you,

536
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,269
because I don’t make
promises that I can’t keep.

537
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,796
But I promise...

538
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:17,499
that I’ll try to fall
while you’re falling.

539
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:21,390
What if you don’t fall?

540
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:23,269
Then I’ll be left crying again?

541
00:35:24,271 --> 00:35:25,710
I’ll wipe your tears then.

542
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:27,921
Why is it like this?

543
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:32,477
Even if he says he’ll split
my heart into five,

544
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:34,337
I would still feel giddy about it.

545
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:39,407
You're so mean.

546
00:35:40,777 --> 00:35:42,211
I’m not a prince.

547
00:35:42,946 --> 00:35:44,116
I’m not charming.

548
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:48,192
I can cause pain
without realizing it.

549
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:49,519
Game over.

550
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,487
You lost again, Alys.

551
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:55,191
But you’ll try to love me, too.
Right?

552
00:36:00,595 --> 00:36:02,964
You’ll try not to hurt me?

553
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:09,525
And we won’t regret this?

554
00:36:10,573 --> 00:36:11,741
So...

555
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:13,743
can I say this now?

556
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:26,031
I like you so much,
Drake Sebastian Palma!

557
00:36:28,192 --> 00:36:29,226
And I promise

558
00:36:31,127 --> 00:36:33,671
to try and make you fall for me.

559
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,557
Bee, where do
you want to go later?

560
00:36:52,582 --> 00:36:53,984
You want to go the mall?

561
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,476
How about a movie?

562
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:56,850
Dinner date?

563
00:36:57,576 --> 00:36:58,585
Coffee?

564
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:01,367
You’re so persistent, KL!

565
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:02,763
Come on, Bee!

566
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,952
I’ve been courting
you for months!

567
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:07,271
Don’t you have plans
to say yes?

568
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:09,287
Then stop courting me!

569
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:11,634
Bee, you know I
love you so much,

570
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:13,593
that’s why I can’t stop.

571
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:18,070
Then wait for nothing!

572
00:37:19,495 --> 00:37:20,495
Huh?

573
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:25,190
So I really don’t have a chance?

574
00:37:30,276 --> 00:37:31,276
Okay.

575
00:37:42,408 --> 00:37:43,408
Bernadette?

576
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:46,201
What?

577
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,575
That witch broke…

578
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:52,808
…my heart!

579
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:54,554
Ouch!

580
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:56,211
Hey, are you okay?

581
00:37:56,992 --> 00:37:58,070
So, Bernadette…

582
00:38:01,293 --> 00:38:02,945
can you be my girlfriend?

583
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:05,812
Yes, fine! We’re together now!

584
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:07,832
Look at this KL guy!

585
00:38:07,857 --> 00:38:11,861
He has the nerve to say he loves
me, then suddenly gives up?

586
00:38:11,886 --> 00:38:12,812
We’re a couple.

587
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:14,439
You’re a jerk, Kent!

588
00:38:14,464 --> 00:38:17,241
You’re betraying me
after I said yes?

589
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:19,410
- When did you say yes?
- Just now!

590
00:38:19,576 --> 00:38:21,380
Really, Bee? No joke?

591
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:27,261
We’re done.

592
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,412
Bee, I didn’t know
you love me, too!

593
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:30,788
Yes!

594
00:38:31,055 --> 00:38:34,302
It’s hard to have
a playboy boyfriend.

595
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:35,476
My gosh.

596
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:41,099
Hey, why are you turning
your back on me?

597
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:42,491
Wait, Bee!

598
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:45,577
Here’s my diary.

599
00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:48,463
What?

600
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:51,175
- Sheen’s a cry baby.
- Yes.

601
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:53,049
And you keep a diary?

602
00:38:53,169 --> 00:38:55,446
You two are such
weird best friends!

603
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:58,110
Says the girl with a voodoo doll at home!

604
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,499
Why do you even have a diary?

605
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:01,152
Of course!

606
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:03,945
So I won’t forget everything
important that happens to me!

607
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:05,390
Like now!

608
00:39:08,352 --> 00:39:09,382
There!

609
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:11,881
See?

610
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:22,293
February 29.

611
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:40,822
The - witch - said - yes!

612
00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:45,007
Excuse my handwriting.

613
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:55,031
See—ouch!

614
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,577
Don’t hit me on the head!

615
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:00,218
Bee…

616
00:40:06,048 --> 00:40:07,550
- Hi, Sheen!
- Hi, Kei!

617
00:40:08,244 --> 00:40:09,288
What’s up?

618
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:11,981
Nothing much.
Do you want to grab a snack?

619
00:40:12,722 --> 00:40:14,054
Lunch break’s almost over.

620
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:16,427
Oh, is it?

621
00:40:16,452 --> 00:40:17,286
Okay, I’ll just go
by myself then.

622
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,829
I’ll come with you!

623
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:20,726
Let’s skip the first class?

624
00:40:22,321 --> 00:40:23,622
You’re still lazy to study, huh?

625
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:25,391
You’re right.

626
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,835
You know I’m the bad one.

627
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:31,003
Why are you only eating now?

628
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,315
Drake was rude.

629
00:40:34,971 --> 00:40:36,414
Why? What did he do?

630
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:37,910
He threw away my food!

631
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:39,741
Seriously?

632
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:42,757
He’s probably jealous
because I was with Alys earlier.

633
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,554
That’s what you get when you
eat with someone’s girl, Sheen.

634
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:50,903
What can I do?
Alys is my best friend.

635
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:54,062
Let’s go.

636
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:11,038
Home sweet home!

637
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:16,311
Drake!

638
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:18,823
Tss.

639
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:23,210
I missed your grumpiness!

640
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:36,506
Drake, let’s eat later, okay?

641
00:41:58,767 --> 00:41:59,767
What do you want?

642
00:42:00,453 --> 00:42:01,821
Can we talk?

643
00:42:02,535 --> 00:42:03,535
For what?

644
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:06,206
About you and Alys.

645
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,430
Why do you care?

646
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:10,399
Because I’m your stepmom.

647
00:42:10,433 --> 00:42:11,701
Shut up, you’re not my Mom!

648
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:14,243
Please Aki, just help me out!

649
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:15,735
I’m trying here!

650
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:17,055
Okay, then.

651
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:18,636
Stop, will you?

652
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:21,010
You can’t replace my Mom.

653
00:42:22,601 --> 00:42:24,087
At least try, Aki.

654
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:26,719
Just for everything
we’ve been through.

655
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,054
Tss.

656
00:42:31,644 --> 00:42:33,360
For what, huh?

657
00:42:33,556 --> 00:42:35,966
For me to remember that
I lost you to my Dad?

658
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,876
For me to realize how foolish I am
to make me think—

659
00:42:39,061 --> 00:42:40,504
that you’re in love with me?

660
00:42:40,662 --> 00:42:43,041
When in fact you only used
me to get through my Dad.

661
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,649
You want me to consider that?

662
00:42:49,038 --> 00:42:50,298
What is he talking about?

663
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:54,733
Steve, I can explain.

664
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:56,345
Are you having an
affair with my son?

665
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:58,414
You’ve got it wrong.

666
00:42:58,609 --> 00:42:59,743
Get out of my house.

667
00:43:03,052 --> 00:43:04,243
Steve, please.

668
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:06,977
Steve, I’m pregnant!

669
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:15,805
Who’s the father?

670
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:19,794
Drake or me?

671
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:23,550
You got impressive choices.

672
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,509
Father and son.

673
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:31,688
Steve!

674
00:43:37,663 --> 00:43:40,743
This is it, Mom.
This family is yours.

675
00:43:44,193 --> 00:43:45,477
Hey, Kei!

676
00:43:45,684 --> 00:43:46,729
Sheen!

677
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:47,788
Can we talk?

678
00:43:48,305 --> 00:43:49,438
Right now?

679
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,360
Yes, please?

680
00:43:52,234 --> 00:43:53,234
Okay.

681
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:03,770
What is it, Kei?

682
00:44:06,487 --> 00:44:07,922
I’m leaving.

683
00:44:08,751 --> 00:44:09,751
Huh?

684
00:44:11,305 --> 00:44:13,064
I said I’m leaving.

685
00:44:15,304 --> 00:44:16,372
Where are you going?

686
00:44:17,556 --> 00:44:18,991
Russia.

687
00:44:19,328 --> 00:44:20,996
My whole family’s migrating.

688
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,954
Mmm.

689
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:25,734
So why are you telling me this?

690
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:30,555
Call it selfish,
but I don’t care.

691
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,437
Sheen…

692
00:44:38,113 --> 00:44:39,882
can we get back together, please?

693
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:45,020
Just until I leave.

694
00:44:46,552 --> 00:44:47,654
Please.

695
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,782
Please be mine again.

696
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:11,327
Bestie, let’s go to Uncle Steve!

697
00:45:12,715 --> 00:45:14,558
Come on, Bestie.

698
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:17,035
They just got back from Hawaii.

699
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,096
Maybe they have souvenirs
for us, right?

700
00:45:19,421 --> 00:45:21,390
Souvenirs, right? Souvenirs!

701
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,608
You look like a souvenir, Aya!

702
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:29,433
Bestie…

703
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:31,835
Bestie, come on.

704
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:33,765
Let’s go.

705
00:45:34,242 --> 00:45:36,678
Aya, can we do that later?

706
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:37,848
Because...

707
00:45:37,873 --> 00:45:40,484
it’s only 7:00 AM.

708
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:42,650
We’ll end up waking them up!

709
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:45,374
Okay.

710
00:45:45,814 --> 00:45:47,157
Just wake me up when it’s time.

711
00:45:47,182 --> 00:45:49,179
Hey, your shoes!

712
00:45:51,818 --> 00:45:53,311
You’re really feeling it.

713
00:45:57,893 --> 00:45:58,910
Ugh!

714
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:04,900
Good morning, Mom!
Good morning, Dad!

715
00:46:04,934 --> 00:46:06,043
Good morning!

716
00:46:06,068 --> 00:46:07,543
Good morning, princess!

717
00:46:09,074 --> 00:46:11,301
Mom, how’s Dane?

718
00:46:11,874 --> 00:46:13,701
Well, actually he’s doing good!

719
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:15,661
Your Nana told me he
has a girlfriend already.

720
00:46:16,145 --> 00:46:17,200
What?

721
00:46:17,225 --> 00:46:18,789
He already has a girlfriend?

722
00:46:18,814 --> 00:46:20,668
Why does he have a girlfriend?

723
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,019
You’re overreacting!

724
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:26,230
Of course, he’s handsome.
That’s why he has a girlfriend.

725
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:28,799
Who else would he take after? Ahem!

726
00:46:28,832 --> 00:46:30,582
Obviously from his Dad, right?

727
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:36,140
But Mommy, Dane is mine only!

728
00:46:36,165 --> 00:46:39,276
Oh my God, Alys, he’s really yours!

729
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,499
And you know what,
he’s gonna come home soon.

730
00:46:41,804 --> 00:46:42,739
What?

731
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:44,081
He’s coming home soon?

732
00:46:44,106 --> 00:46:46,041
- Yes, really soon!
- When?

733
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,309
He’s gonna continue
his studies here!

734
00:46:47,343 --> 00:46:48,210
Oh my God!

735
00:46:48,243 --> 00:46:49,244
I miss Dane–

736
00:46:50,446 --> 00:46:54,137
Alys, you didn’t
even wake me up!

737
00:47:04,259 --> 00:47:05,535
Oh!

738
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:07,630
You’re here, Uncle, Aunt!

739
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,642
Good morning! Let’s eat!

740
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:12,928
- Good morning!
- So yummy!

741
00:47:12,953 --> 00:47:14,098
It’s really good!

742
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:17,147
It’s so good!

743
00:47:17,172 --> 00:47:18,230
Eat!

744
00:47:21,035 --> 00:47:23,238
Ugh, Uncle Steve’s
not even here.

745
00:47:24,351 --> 00:47:25,652
Where did he go?

746
00:47:26,882 --> 00:47:29,126
It’s Saturday,
they don’t have work.

747
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:30,481
So what?

748
00:47:30,506 --> 00:47:31,674
They can’t go out?

749
00:47:32,071 --> 00:47:33,910
Maybe the couple went on a date.

750
00:47:34,356 --> 00:47:36,381
You stay here, Bestie! I’m out!

751
00:47:36,406 --> 00:47:37,768
It’s boring here!

752
00:47:37,793 --> 00:47:39,332
Hey, Aya!

753
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:40,872
You’re acting up again.

754
00:47:40,896 --> 00:47:42,598
Ma’am, Sir Drake
asked me to give you this.

755
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,691
Oh, thank you.

756
00:47:47,543 --> 00:47:48,652
“Go away.”

757
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:51,121
Fine, then!

758
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,242
What drama is this now, Drake?

759
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:25,115
What do you mean “go away”?

760
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,140
Tss.

761
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:30,034
Are you mad?

762
00:48:32,114 --> 00:48:33,026
Drake!

763
00:48:33,051 --> 00:48:34,419
I’m tired, okay?

764
00:48:36,407 --> 00:48:37,613
Why are you tired?

765
00:48:37,753 --> 00:48:40,297
We don’t even have
any homework or projects.

766
00:48:40,322 --> 00:48:41,465
You’re so annoying.

767
00:48:41,654 --> 00:48:43,363
And what if I am?

768
00:48:44,294 --> 00:48:45,294
Just go home.

769
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,938
Why?

770
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:49,810
I’m in a really bad mood!

771
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:54,011
I’ll also be in a bad mood
if you keep ignoring me!

772
00:48:54,215 --> 00:48:56,138
I’ll keep bothering you.

773
00:48:56,163 --> 00:48:57,131
Do you want that?

774
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,363
Fine!

775
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:14,059
Hi, Aunt!

776
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:43,894
Drake,

777
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,028
is there a problem?

778
00:49:53,255 --> 00:49:54,422
If I tell you,

779
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,012
would you hate me?

780
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,601
I’ll try not to.

781
00:50:03,572 --> 00:50:06,375
Can’t you just say that you
won’t hate me no matter what?

782
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,913
I don’t want to lie to you.

783
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,196
We’re human too, right?

784
00:50:13,221 --> 00:50:14,656
We make mistakes.

785
00:50:16,535 --> 00:50:19,471
And I can’t guarantee
I’ll love you forever—

786
00:50:20,223 --> 00:50:22,558
because things can change, right?

787
00:50:23,406 --> 00:50:24,406
Like now,

788
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,403
whatever you’re going to say,

789
00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:29,506
I can’t promise how I’ll react.

790
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:32,223
But rest assured—

791
00:50:33,217 --> 00:50:36,353
I won’t leave you,
even if I hate you.

792
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,576
Continue being honest, Alys.

793
00:50:43,979 --> 00:50:45,543
I like that about you.

794
00:50:48,316 --> 00:50:50,381
Uhm, Drake?

795
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:52,059
Hmm?

796
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:54,785
This is the first time
you called me “Alys.”

797
00:50:56,758 --> 00:50:57,758
Alys.

798
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:01,541
Alys.

799
00:51:07,978 --> 00:51:13,207
So now, what’s
really the problem?

800
00:51:27,322 --> 00:51:28,490
Katrina’s pregnant.

801
00:51:29,892 --> 00:51:33,059
Oh my gosh!
You’re going to have a sibling!

802
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:34,692
Aren’t you happy?

803
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:37,802
My sibling...

804
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,121
or my child.

805
00:51:40,135 --> 00:51:41,837
What do you mean?

806
00:51:46,975 --> 00:51:48,810
Alys, what if I’m the father?

807
00:51:50,062 --> 00:51:51,263
What would you do?

808
00:51:54,216 --> 00:51:55,851
Are you serious?

809
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,347
Let’s eat.

810
00:52:17,372 --> 00:52:18,465
That’s for me?

811
00:52:21,009 --> 00:52:22,176
Drake!

812
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,762
Drake, what the heck?!

813
00:52:33,352 --> 00:52:35,087
Why is she sharing
what I gave her?

814
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:37,876
Is he that special?

815
00:52:39,677 --> 00:52:41,426
She doesn’t want to eat with me.

816
00:52:42,531 --> 00:52:43,722
But with Sheen?

817
00:52:44,883 --> 00:52:46,885
Is she really in
love with that wimp?

818
00:52:49,262 --> 00:52:50,814
- What’s going on?
- Wait...

819
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:52,417
- He’s just trying to eat!
- Why am I mad?

820
00:52:52,442 --> 00:52:53,848
- Am I jealous?
- Like—what the heck?

821
00:52:56,722 --> 00:52:59,735
I like you so much,
Drake Sebastian Palma!

822
00:53:01,915 --> 00:53:02,950
And I promise

823
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:07,638
to try and make you fall for me.

824
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:14,496
Stay with me, Alys.

825
00:53:14,621 --> 00:53:15,872
Stay.

826
00:53:15,897 --> 00:53:17,224
Bear with me.

827
00:53:17,249 --> 00:53:19,332
Bear with me, please.

828
00:53:22,854 --> 00:53:26,241
On the next episode of
Seducing Drake Palma.

829
00:53:26,266 --> 00:53:27,355
Drake...

830
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:31,079
if you’ve got a problem,
just leave my house.

831
00:53:31,146 --> 00:53:32,914
But I’ll buy you your own condo.

832
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:35,779
Pack my things.

833
00:53:35,804 --> 00:53:36,722
Tss.

834
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:37,747
Fine!

835
00:53:37,753 --> 00:53:39,429
I love packing, anyways.

836
00:53:39,456 --> 00:53:42,791
Suitcase number one:
Uniform and school stuff.

837
00:53:42,816 --> 00:53:45,119
Suitcase number two: Your clothes.

838
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,941
Suitcase number three:
All your beauty products.

839
00:53:49,998 --> 00:53:53,802
I feel like I’m Drake’s housewife,
picking out what he’ll wear.

840
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:01,118
You’ve got it all wrong!

841
00:54:01,143 --> 00:54:02,944
Then why are you
holding my underwear?

842
00:54:03,879 --> 00:54:05,472
It was an accident!

843
00:54:06,181 --> 00:54:07,349
Just an accident?
