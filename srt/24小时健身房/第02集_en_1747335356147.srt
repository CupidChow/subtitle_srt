1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
atter

2
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,400
.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There are many villains in the gym.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Shut up!

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Get out of here!

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Get out of here!

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He has a cool face, but when he's at his limit,

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
he's a hider who reveals his evil nature.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What is this?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's dirty.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He makes other people's feelings wet with his traces.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Aquaman

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, my. I made this for you.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Can't you see my bottle of water?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, I can't.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You said you made that bottle.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What's going on?

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, my. He's new here.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I didn't know the rules here, so I was explaining it to him.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Anyway, you're the only member who thinks about the gym.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Wait a minute. I'm sorry.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm the only one who's here.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The witch uncle who makes a mess in the gym while making a mess.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I need a hero to save this gym that the villains have occupied.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Stop!

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hey, you! What's wrong with you?

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I won't make a sound. I can't see anything.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can't see anything.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Stretch after exercise.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What's this?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Stretch

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Stretch

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Repeat 20 times.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's cool.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's cool.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's cool.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, my.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, my.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It looks so delicious.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's delicious.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, my. I left it in the kitchen.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Alex!

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Change the music.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Change the music.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's so delicious.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What is this?

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I want to dance.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, my.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's already time to dance.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, my.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm going to go now.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going to get hit in the front seat.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The front seat, the front seat, the front seat, the front seat, the front seat.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No, no, no.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, no, no.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I have to go in.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have to go in.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh, my.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, my.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're really cool.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Hello.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Change one's life.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Are you ready?

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you ready to change your life?

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm going to change everything.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Everything.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
From head to toe.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
All right.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's take a look at the body of the member first.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Sir.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Isn't the president really a genius?

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Isn't he?

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's also making a groundbreaking program called Total Life Care.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's so groundbreaking.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, I have a question.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What is it?

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But don't you get muscle cramps when you start working out?

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't want to get muscle cramps.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't like that you're like Ma Dong-seok.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The president is not worried about Ma Dong-seok right now.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's worried about Ma Hoon-ik's physical condition.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Ma... What?

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can't be everything you want to be.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do you know how much protein and sweat it takes to increase muscle mass at 0.1kg?

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Do you think your muscles look light?

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The president looks light, right?

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes, it looks light.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's the muscle that the president has nothing to do with.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't worry.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll make sure no one can look at you lightly from now on.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think the president looks at me the least.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm talking to you. Where are you going?

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Here.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is the In My Body that will analyze the ingredients of your body.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Take off your shoes and go up.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What's wrong?

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Wait a minute. Thank you.

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thank you.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's done.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll go up.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What's wrong with you again?

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I need to know exactly.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll be back. Bye.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I think I've gotten a little lighter now.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll go up.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Should I cut my hair?

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Or should I cut my nails?

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Or...

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I want to know exactly.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hold your hand.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The body doesn't lie.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It remembers exactly what it ate and how it moved.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You said you were on a diet.

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Tteokbokki doesn't make you fat.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Right. Tteokbokki doesn't make you fat.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You make me fat.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hey, you're not supposed to say that when you're eating tteokbokki.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're eating tteokbokki because you're a fan.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Right.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Here it is.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Wait a minute.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Miran, come here for a second.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You have to come here.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Hello.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hello.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is Gangnam-gu Office Station.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It doesn't take 10 minutes to walk there.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's why I said it takes 10 minutes.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What the fat?

139
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What?

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Are you cursing at me?

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What the fat is not cursing.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Fat is fat.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's as terrible as the fat that's unnecessary for our body.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Terrible.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Then it's worse than cursing.

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What's worse is not cursing, but your body.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't do this.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I need to see your ability to exercise.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm dying here.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They're all mine.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Forget it.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is the arm room.

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's see your flexibility first.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Straighten your arms and go down.

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Ms. Kim, go down.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Ms. Kim, a little more.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Go down a little more.

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think I'm going to break.

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Did I tear it?

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't know what it is, but it hurts a lot.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You look like a mannequin.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
A mannequin?

164
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The best flexibility.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Next, we'll do squats.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Sit down deeply.

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And stand up straight.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay.

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Stand up.

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What?

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't use your hands.

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Stand up.

175
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Come on.

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Stand up.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
My legs are numb.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Jin.

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You're quite young.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Is that good?

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're not even born yet.

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The best flexibility.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Water.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Next, we'll do burpees.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Burpees?

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I know what burpees are.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's the time to recover your pride.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Do as much as you can.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
One.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Again?

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
My legs.

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The best flexibility.

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Thank you.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I can't believe it.

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This is what it means to be a living human.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Is that a mannequin?

197
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Flexibility, muscle strength, stamina, endurance, and quickness.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
They're the lowest of all.

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can think of them as zombies.

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Zombies?

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I've been doing this all day.

202
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But there's hope.

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Seeing that I have muscle pain, it means that muscles exist.

204
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
If it's hard to change, can you tell me in advance?

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I need to find another way.

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Another way?

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Another way?

208
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Ms. Kim.

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
There's no other way to make a body.

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Only honest movements.

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Only those movements make your body.

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But you can do it.

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Can I really do it?

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
1.5kg.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
As I was born smaller than that little baby,

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I will make a miracle in Asia.

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I will make a miracle for you, too.

219
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I will make a miracle for you, too.

220
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Don't be a zombie to me.

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't like people who listen to me.

222
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you.

223
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Thank you.

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, my.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Are you okay?

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What are you doing?

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry, Ms. Kim.

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What's this?

229
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Goodbye.

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay.

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Sir.

233
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I know you.

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
First of all, it's exciting.

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
First love, first kiss.

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And...

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You must have cold water again.

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's because of the muscle pain.

239
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I guess it's because of the muscle pain.

240
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's because of cold water.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You know everything just by hearing the scream.

242
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Of course.

243
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The scream of the first muscle pain

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:40,820
is very sweet and

245
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
awafour.

246
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh, my god!

247
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What's with this hair?

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,700
Anybody has a hair youngest or

249
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,000
completelyzogen.

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Look at this.

251
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,500
A hair in τουani snagged.

252
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Welcome v니까!

253
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,800
I didn't wash my hair.

254
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,900
You did wash it.

255
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,100
It's wet.

256
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,040
I like black beans in hair loss.

257
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,940
Shall we go eat some beans?

258
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,940
With me?

259
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,040
What are you talking about?

260
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,540
I'm shy too.

261
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,540
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,600
I'll clean up your hair.

263
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What is this?

264
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Why are you laughing?

265
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm scared.

266
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Where are you?

267
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I couldn't stop laughing at the muscles that were just coming out.

268
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You were there.

269
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why did you show up now?

270
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What are you doing?

271
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm so scared.

272
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Ran, what are you doing?

273
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Honey, I just broke up with her.

274
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I want to see her again.

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Now?

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Not now.

277
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What?

278
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Honey?

279
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Honey?

280
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You scared me!

281
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
What's with your tail?

282
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
My body doesn't move.

283
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Please wash me.

284
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Come on in!

285
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
My body doesn't move.

286
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Please wash me.

287
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
It's too cold.

288
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Then you do it.

289
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
I'm so scared.

290
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Are you done?

291
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
I'm so happy.

292
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Are you a water park?

293
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
No, I'm not.

294
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Scratch my left side.

295
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
You're so annoying.

296
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Here?

297
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Hey, be gentle.

298
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
My whole body hurts every time I move.

299
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Why are you doing this when you're not exercising?

300
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
If you do something you're not exercising, you'll die.

301
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Just kill me.

302
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Just kill me.

303
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Good.

304
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
That was good.

305
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
But the next day is more thrilling.

306
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500
The next day, muscles are more energetic.

307
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Muscles that are made of exercise are more elastic.

308
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
What should I do?

309
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
It's nice to see the retired men.

310
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Sometimes it's hard to handle the hamstrings, but it's thrilling.

311
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Hurry up.

312
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
I'm sorry.

314
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm so jealous that I got to see all the people at once.

315
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,500
You're jealous too, right?

316
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
I'm reminded of the members you've been in charge of.

317
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh, the members I've changed my life for?

318
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes.

319
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm reminded of the day I saved you with that white magic.

320
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Sir?

321
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Sir?

322
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Sir?

323
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Sir?

324
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Sir?

325
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Good morning.

326
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Shit!

327
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Where did he go? Where did he go?

328
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Where? Where? Where?

329
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Sir!

330
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Shit!

331
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Shit!

332
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I'm going to eat it!

333
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
I'm going to eat it!

334
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,500
I've been in line for two hours to eat that money.

335
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
If you're crazy, you won't eat it?

336
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Do you want to eat it in a short period of time?

337
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I want to eat it!

338
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Then, until you smell it in your mouth...

339
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
You ruined your life completely.

340
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
You can't exercise anymore.

341
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Oh, do you want to see the proof of the content you received then again?

342
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!

343
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
That's all the members...

344
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm the one who proves that I'm a different member.

345
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Of course, it'll be hard at first.

346
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'll think about the weak people.

347
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Why did I suffer so much?

348
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,500
Is it really that exercising changes my life?

349
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,000
Or is it that I'm ruining it more?

350
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Then...

351
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
No, no, no.

352
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
No, no, no.

353
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm going to talk about the whole world's temptation.

354
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Hey, look at this.

355
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
It's an easy way, but why do you have to suffer so much?

356
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,500
The weak people will be shaken.

357
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
But...

358
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Ah!

359
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Ah!

360
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Miss, your nose is bleeding.

361
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Why?

362
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You don't have to worry.

363
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Because the hero will appear.

364
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm going to make you give up!

365
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm going to change everything!

366
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Ah!

367
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Ah!

368
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Miss, your nose is bleeding.

369
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
What's this?

370
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I picked it up on my way here.

371
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
This is a slim mirror that makes you look slimmer.

372
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Miss, thank you so much. I'll use it well.

373
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Thank you.

374
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
I thought my arm was going to break.

375
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh, no, no, no.

376
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The old member gave me a hard time getting the mirror.

377
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I have nothing to say, sir.

378
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Do the reverse curl.

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What?

380
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If you lift a mirror that's less than 10kg

381
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,500
and your arm hurts, it means you're weak.

382
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,000
Director Bo!

383
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
To strengthen your muscles,

384
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
do the reverse curl 10 times.

385
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,500
Yes, just like that.

386
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Just like that.

387
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Sorry, sorry.

388
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,500
I'll use the mirror again. Thank you.

389
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Look at the dance.

390
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
It's so nice.

391
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,000
What's nice about it?

392
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
It's great!

393
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
I was thinking about having a photo zone in the gym.

394
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,500
There are photo zones in the popular gym these days.

395
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Like the one at the O-Nan and the gym.

396
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Why do we need photo zones in the gym?

397
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Alex, muscles are not left in photos.

398
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
They're left in the body.

399
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Yes, sir.

400
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Try making it.

401
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
You should try something in the gym.

402
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Yes, thank you.

403
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Do you know what's in front of the hair salon?

404
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
What?

405
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's the 24-hour gym.

406
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,500
Another gym is in front of it?

407
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,500
No, we're going to go there.

408
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,500
If we succeed in the total life care, we'll go there.

409
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
The sun will rise and it'll be great, right?

410
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
I'm dying.

411
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Miran, are you okay?

412
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
What?

413
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You don't have to hide it. I know everything.

414
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,500
Miran, did you finish the package for the fall honeymoon?

415
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes, I got a schedule.

416
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm arranging the schedule because I have a restaurant I want to add.

417
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You must be busy, but please do your best.

418
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yes.

419
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,000
So, Miran, do you know what the busiest job is?

420
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Hmm...

421
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
A travel agent?

422
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,000
A job?

423
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Sir, you're too much.

424
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,000
Sorry, was it boring?

425
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I can't stand this comedy.

426
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You're leaving the package for the fall honeymoon to someone who just broke up.

427
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
What?

428
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,500
It's a job that's easy to do, but it's too painful for me to see my colleague.

429
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Who broke up?

430
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
What? Miran broke up with Junseong?

431
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500
So Junseong applied for the TF team?

432
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
Really?

433
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Miran, is that so?

434
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Miran, there's nothing to hold back.

435
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,000
You've been looking so pale and blabbering.

436
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,500
I worked out yesterday.

437
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,500
If you're tired, you can do this package.

438
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,000
No, I'll do it.

439
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,500
Miran, don't worry.

440
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,500
But you should take this for the next trip.

441
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,500
The hot spring tour.

442
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm really grateful for your concern, but I'm really fine.

443
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,500
I'm good at Hawaiian.

444
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,000
I'll do it.

445
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Miran is a pro.

446
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Are you okay?

447
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm so happy.

448
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,500
I'm so happy.

449
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,000
Did you find someone else?

450
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
No, I didn't.

451
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Then, did Junseong get tired of you?

452
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, we've been dating for a long time.

453
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
That's not it.

454
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But I'm sure you thought I was the one who was dumped.

455
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
No, it's not that.

456
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Miran looks tired.

457
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm trying to be nice to her.

458
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm trying to think of a way to be considerate.

459
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's the same thing for a colleague.

460
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I don't need to be considerate.

461
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I asked you to finish it first.

462
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
What?

463
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You?

464
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Why?

465
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Good morning.

466
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What did you have for breakfast?

467
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Did you find another guy?

468
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Who? Me?

469
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Is it a guy?

470
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
A guy?

471
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What? Did someone find something?

472
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Here.

473
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
What is he doing?

474
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
He's so handsome.

475
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
He's so handsome.

476
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I think it's a great guy.

477
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
He's amazing.

478
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Why would a guy like him...

479
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Why?

480
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
He looks so good with Miran.

481
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I feel sorry for Miran.

482
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I know.

483
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I feel so happy for Miran.

484
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I was worried that Miran would be uncomfortable with my wedding.

485
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Wedding?

486
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Oh, right.

487
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Junseong will come to your wedding.

488
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I was worried that he would be uncomfortable with you.

489
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Why would he be uncomfortable?

491
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Then come with him.

492
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Our restaurant is delicious.

493
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Then we can come together.

494
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yes, we can come together.

495
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Then I'll talk to him.

496
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm looking forward to it.

497
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Good luck.

498
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's amazing.

499
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Oh.

500
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Did you see...

501
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
...my father yesterday?

502
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
No.

503
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You're lying.

504
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
What is it?

505
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
What is it?

506
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Is something wrong?

507
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Come here.

508
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
What is it?

509
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
What is it?

510
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What is it?

511
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Okay, okay.

512
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What is it?

513
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
What?

514
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I need to rest for a few weeks.

515
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Is it because of muscle pain?

516
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's not better to rest.

517
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You need to make a bigger muscle pain...

518
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
...to get rid of your current muscle pain.

519
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'll make it for you.

520
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm not here to make a big muscle pain.

521
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
A muscle pain?

522
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You don't trust my life care?

523
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
If you trust me for three months, you can change your life.

524
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't have time.

525
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I have to wear that combat uniform.

526
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Combat uniform?

527
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yes.

528
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I bought a combat uniform today.

529
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Show me this.

530
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
This?

531
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But this is only a small size.

532
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'll try it on.

533
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Okay.

534
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
What is this?

535
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Are you okay?

536
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Do you want me to recommend another outfit?

537
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
No, this is fine.

538
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
This is his style.

539
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So you're saying that you'll get a shot in the stomach...

540
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
...to put your body in the clothes?

541
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You can cancel it right now.

542
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'll take the shot in the stomach.

543
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I won't cancel it.

544
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Cancel it!

545
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
No, I have to wear that combat uniform.

546
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Cancel it!

547
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'll let you wear that.

548
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Really?

549
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
If you can't wear it, I'll give you a full refund.

550
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Full refund?

551
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Then can you cancel it?

552
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Is that possible?

553
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
1.5kg.

554
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I was born smaller than that little child.

555
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
My body is...

556
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Stop it.

557
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Is that possible?

558
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It's possible.

559
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But it's going to be a hellish time from now on.

560
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's still hell anyway.

561
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let's get started.

562
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
1.5kg.

563
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
What's all this?

564
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You have to reduce your size to one before you meet your ex.

565
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
We will judge your body through three hells.

566
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Judge?

567
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
First, it's a false hell.

568
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Baby!

569
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'll have just one bite.

570
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
This time, I won't eat.

571
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm sorry.

572
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'll have just one bite.

573
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
No, not one bite.

574
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Seriously.

575
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You're eating everything in one bite.

576
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm going to kill myself.

577
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You weren't going to have just one bite from the beginning, were you?

578
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Wasn't it all a lie?

579
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
No, that's my real bite.

580
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Lie, lie, lie!

581
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You lied to me that you would have just one bite.

582
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I will punish you for eating chicken breast shake twice a day.

583
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
If it's a food punishment, I'll eat it.

584
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Is it a lie?

585
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Think of it as a lie.

586
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You're eating everything you want.

587
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Next is the hell of the lie.

588
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
The hell of the lie.

589
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

590
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Hurry up and come here!

591
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Turn off the lights. Good night.

592
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It's so sad.

593
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The menu is set tomorrow.

594
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm going to eat tteokbokki tomorrow.

595
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Eat tteokbokki.

596
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Im Il-han's body is fine, but he's using the minimum movement to de-energize his muscle function.

597
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I was so tired that day.

598
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm going to punish Im Il-han for abandoning his body to Natahya.

599
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
What are you doing?

600
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Don't make a sound. You can't be punished.

601
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
What is that?

602
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'll tell you what it is.

603
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I can't do it. I can't do it.

604
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What is it?

605
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Third, it's time to go to the hell of murder.

606
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Murder? I've never killed anyone.

607
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I can't do it. I can't do it.

608
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I've killed a lot of people who can do it.

609
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What the hell are you talking about?

610
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I can do it.

611
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
What?

612
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I can do it.

613
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I can't do it anymore.

614
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You can do it.

615
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
A little more.

616
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
A little more.

617
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I can't do it. I can't do it.

618
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You can't say you can't do it.

619
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You can do it. You have to believe you can do it.

620
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You can do it.

621
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I can do it.

622
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You can do it.

623
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I can do it.

624
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Good. You can do it.

625
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I can do it.

626
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Look ahead. Open your eyes. We're here.

627
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Here.

628
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Wow.

629
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Look.

630
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I said I couldn't do it, but I did it.

631
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You did it.

632
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Sir, if I get out of this hell one day,

633
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'll be able to stand in front of that man, right?

634
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Of course.

635
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
No.

636
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I really didn't believe in total life care.

637
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
What?

638
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I thought I'd die if I didn't start something,

639
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
so I just threw it away.

640
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
5 million won.

641
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But now I really believe in total life care.

642
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You're more sincere than I am.

643
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So if you say you can do it,

644
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm sure I can do it.

645
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Now I believe in you more than I do.

646
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm glad you know now.

647
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh, my.

648
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Wow, I'm going to escape from hell now.

649
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Did I show you the electric pole?

650
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
No.

651
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Shall I show you?

652
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
How is it?

653
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I saw you in the idol group recently.

654
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Isn't it pretty?

655
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Is this the combat suit?

656
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I heard men like this style.

657
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Let's go back to the lunge.

658
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I felt good, but why are you doing this?

659
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I didn't know you wanted to wear a child's suit.

660
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Get ready for the lunge.

661
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
What's wrong with you?

662
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Ready!

663
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Ready!

664
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Really?

665
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I won't look back.

666
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Let's go!

667
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Heroes save lives.

668
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Absolutely.

669
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Absolutely.

670
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
We're done.

671
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Last one!

672
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Are you okay?

673
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm fine.

674
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I have to wear a combat suit.

675
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You said you'd let me wear this.

676
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
If you can do it, I can do it.

677
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I won't doubt it and I'll do my best.

678
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Can you do it?

679
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Of course.

680
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I can do it!

681
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I think I said too much.

682
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I'm sorry.

683
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'll go now.

684
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Thank you.

685
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I can do it, right?

686
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You can do it!

687
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I can do it!

688
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Min, you can do it.

689
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Because the director said you can do it.

690
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You can do it. You can wear a suit.

691
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Are you afraid, Do Yeon-jong?

692
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Alex, what are you doing?

693
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You have a quick lesson next time.

694
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I'll do it.

695
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You said you'd do it.

696
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I did.

697
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm nervous.

698
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Can you do it for me?

699
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I had a nightmare last night.

700
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
What are you doing?

701
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Aren't you going to study?

702
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I have to lose weight.

703
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Hurry up!

704
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Right now!

705
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Oh, baby.

706
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
The members are coming.

707
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I have a private lesson.

708
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
But...

709
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Are you telling me to cancel the class?

710
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You don't have to.

711
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Don't worry. I'll go.

712
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Hey, what are you doing?

713
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Stop!

714
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Director!

715
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You're my hero!

716
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Get off.

717
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Get off!

718
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Right! Left!

719
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Are you the middle school students?

720
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Don't get tired.

721
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We've been middle school students for three years.

722
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
We're the middle school students.

723
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Stop!

724
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Stop!

725
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Stop!

726
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You're going to kill me!

727
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
What is this?

728
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I want to see the Jjajangmyeon set.

729
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Right now!

730
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Jjajangmyeon!

731
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Hello, boss.

732
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's just the two of us.

733
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I, Do Yoon-jong, have finally found the answer.

734
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
What is this?

735
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I heard that the muscle pain would go away sooner.

736
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I have to give the bird to go away.

737
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
What is this?

738
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
The door opened so fast today.

739
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It looks delicious.

740
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
This well-cooked old man

741
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
is grilled in pork belly oil

742
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
and eaten with meat and rice.

743
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
If you finish it with soybean paste stew,

744
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
why would you eat the fatigue-relieving medicine?

745
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You have to eat this.

746
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Why would you eat the fatigue-relieving medicine?

747
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You have to eat this.

748
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Why am I here?

749
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm sorry.

750
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I have to go.

751
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's grilled chicken.

752
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
This is really hard to find these days.

753
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You dip it in salt and put it in your mouth.

754
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
When you're thirsty,

755
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
you eat a cold kkakdugi.

756
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Your throat will open up and your chest will be full.

757
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Why would you eat the fatigue-relieving medicine?

758
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You have to eat this.

759
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It looks delicious.

760
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
My gosh.

761
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Wow, deli manju.

762
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
It smells better than perfume.

763
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It makes people look around.

764
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Sometimes, I smell deli manju and look around.

765
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Get up.

766
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Junseok.

767
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Let's eat it when it's warm.

768
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
What?

769
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
What are you doing?

770
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You scared me.

771
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
You should be thankful.

772
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
If it weren't for my fist,

773
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I would have put the carbon in it.

774
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Oh, my.

775
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
What is it? Give it to me.

776
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
What is this?

777
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It's to increase the range of motion.

778
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's really a real blood-chilling lecture.

779
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Let's go to the gym.

780
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Wait.

781
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
We're done with the workout today.

782
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Are we doing it again?

783
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
There's no end to the workout.

784
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
What?

785
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
You just have to keep going without giving up.

786
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Let's go.

787
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
No, no, no.

788
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I don't think I can work out anymore.

789
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
If I work out more, I'll die.

790
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I'm dead.

791
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You're alive.

792
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I won't eat it.

793
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I really didn't know that the workout was over

794
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and that my body was changing.

795
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Thank you for your hard work.

796
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Thank you for your hard work.

797
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Yes.

798
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
But I did as the director said.

799
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I hate the days when I hate it.

800
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I get annoyed on the annoying days.

801
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Good, good.

802
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
16.

803
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
We're almost there. 16.

804
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Let's go down.

805
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You can do it, Mr. Director.

806
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You can do it.

807
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
17.

808
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
That was all I could get.

809
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
What did you eat for lunch?

810
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Why?

811
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
You had a sweet scent in your mouth.

812
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I had potato soup.

813
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
If you eat it in your mouth,

814
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
it becomes potato soup.

815
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Then,

816
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
you'll feel the taste of potato soup

817
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
and the sweetness of sweet soup at the same time.

818
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
You're so sexy.

819
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Honey.

820
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Please go in.

821
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Please.

822
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Please.

823
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Please go in.

824
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Please.

825
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Wow.

826
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Wow, this is amazing.

827
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Did I just wear this?

828
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
This is unbelievable.

829
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I didn't know.

830
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Hey, I wore this.

831
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I put my body in this dress.

832
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Hey, I wore this.

833
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Hey, I wore this.

834
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Hello.

835
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I'm here to say hello.

836
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Hey, I wore this.

837
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
What?

838
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
This is the dress.

839
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
What?

840
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
It's nothing.

841
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Oh, my.

842
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
What's wrong with you?

843
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I'll have a drink.

844
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'll have a drink.

845
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Oh, my.

846
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Director.

847
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Director.

848
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Where are you?

849
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Director.

850
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Director.

851
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Director, look at me.

852
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I can wear this, sit down, walk,

853
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
and even run up to here.

854
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I really wore this.

855
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Look at this.

856
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Why are you so happy?

857
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You said you could do it with the natural thing.

858
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
That's right.

859
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
It's all thanks to you.

860
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Then can I ask you one more thing?

861
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
If you're going to quit exercising, don't even start.

862
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Please go to the wedding with me tomorrow.

863
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Wedding?

864
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Go.

865
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Go.

866
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Go.

867
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Go.

868
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
No, tomorrow is the World Cup and the Olympics.

869
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So my coach, the director,

870
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
should be by my side like now.

871
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Hold on.

872
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Hold on.

873
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Hold on.

874
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
All right.

875
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I'll take care of the World Cup until the end.

876
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Hold on.

877
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Now, sir.

878
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Director.

879
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Why don't you do the lower body once more?

880
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I feel good, why are you saying that?

881
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
What should I do?

882
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Can you three do it together?

883
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Goodbye, everyone.

884
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It's a beautiful night.

885
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Fighting.

886
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Bye, director.

887
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Thank you.

888
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Director.

889
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yes?

890
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
This isn't the clothes I saw yesterday.

891
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It looks like the stomach, the latissimus dorsi, and the gluteus maximus are in great danger.

892
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
How can you breathe?

893
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
This is my brother's clothes.

894
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
My combat uniform.

895
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
But I can't breathe.

896
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I can't breathe.

897
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I can't breathe.

898
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I can't breathe.

899
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I can't breathe.

900
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I can't breathe.

901
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I can't breathe.

902
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I can't breathe.

903
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I can't breathe.

904
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I can't breathe.

905
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I can't breathe.

906
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
The combat uniform was torn by that little girl.

907
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But...

908
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
But?

909
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It's actually better.

910
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
This dress is more of that man's style.

911
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And I think the clothes that were hidden deep inside are very expensive.

912
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Nice.

913
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But do you think it's too much?

914
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Yes.

915
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I'm more tired than you think.

916
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'm really annoyed.

917
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Let's go.

918
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I'm annoyed.

919
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Isn't that Mira?

920
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I think that's the one.

921
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
The one who said she was getting a new one.

922
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Where's Mira?

923
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Oh, right.

924
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
How are your thighs after today?

925
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I think you're a bit better.

926
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
My thighs?

927
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
No, you were doing your thighs yesterday.

928
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
What are you talking about?

929
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Yesterday?

930
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Then let's do chest today.

931
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Chest?

932
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
How about your butt?

933
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I'm most excited when I'm doing my butt.

934
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
This is too much.

935
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I'm sorry.

936
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I'm sorry.

937
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
You're here.

938
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Hello.

939
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Hello.

940
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Hello.

941
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Mira, why are you so pretty today?

942
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Oh, come on.

943
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Let's go to the salon.

944
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
You're really pretty today.

945
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Really.

946
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
This is mine.

947
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I know.

948
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
You're the one I'm seeing, right?

949
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Yes.

950
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
The one I'm seeing?

951
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Oh, yes.

952
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You two look very healthy.

953
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
No, you two look very good.

954
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Then we'll go in first.

955
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Yes.

956
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I'm sorry.

957
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I was so embarrassed without realizing it.

958
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
What is it?

959
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Jaehee is crazy today.

960
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Take it out.

961
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Oh, you look like a crazy person.

962
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Oh, let go of me.

963
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Oh, really.

964
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I think you're a crazy person.

965
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
You're not strong enough.

966
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Let's go to the gym today.

967
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I'm going to work out.

968
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
What are you talking about?

969
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
You still have problems with your neck.

970
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Are you really going to the gym?

971
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Of course.

972
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
What's wrong?

973
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Let's just go.

974
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
What?

975
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
The game hasn't even started yet.

976
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I don't think I can do it.

977
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I'm just going to go.

978
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
No.

979
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Are you running away?

980
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Yes, that's right.

981
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I don't think I can do it.

982
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I don't think I can do it.

983
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
No.

984
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You can do it, Mr. Miran.

985
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Do you know what's the hardest thing in the gym?

986
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It's coming to the gym every day.

987
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
The person who did the hard thing is you.

988
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I said I couldn't do the squat that I used to do with the empty bags,

989
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
but you're now 30kg.

990
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
You used to be able to do 5 sets of burpees,

991
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
but now you can do 10 sets of 3 sets.

992
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
And most of all, you, Mr. Miran,

993
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
are a miracle of 1.5kg.

994
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I learned this from Do Hyun-joon.

995
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Oh, really?

996
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Hey,

997
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
give me strength in the lower body.

998
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Lower your shoulders, straighten your back, and straighten your chest.

999
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Hey,

1000
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
lower your trapezius tension.

1001
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Okay.

1002
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Good.

1003
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's go.

1004
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Stand up confidently.

1005
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Okay.

1006
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Mr. Jun-seok.

1007
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
How have you been?

1008
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's been a while.

1009
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Oh, Miran.

1010
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
You...

1011
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
You look good.

1012
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
You look different.

1013
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I started working out.

1014
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Okay,

1015
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
now the groom will enter.

1016
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Please give him a big round of applause.

1017
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
The groom enters.

1018
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Miran,

1019
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
you know,

1020
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
that day,

1021
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
when I was a kid,

1022
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I was a little scared of heights,

1023
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
but I was able to walk on the ground.

1024
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I was able to do that.

1025
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And I was able to do that.

1026
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
It's a miracle.

1027
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Miran,

1028
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
you did a good job.

1029
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
You did a good job.

1030
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Miran,

1031
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
you did a good job.

1032
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I'm glad you did a good job.

1033
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
You did a great job.

1034
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Oh, my God.

1035
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Look at this.

1036
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
You look like a bride.

1037
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Miran,

1038
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
until the end...

1039
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Goodness.

1040
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
He's a bride.

1041
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Okay,

1042
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
the most beautiful bride,

1043
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
of all.

1044
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Let's enter.

1045
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
What should I do?

1046
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
What should I do?

1047
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Director.

1048
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Let's go, Director.

1049
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Director.

1050
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Director.

1051
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Director.

1052
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Director.

1053
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Director.

1054
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It's still a wedding.

1055
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
You should be polite.

1056
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Director.

1057
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
You passed the design test,

1058
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
but your arms are too short.

1059
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
My arms aren't going up.

1060
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
When did I buy this kind of clothes?

1061
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I can't breathe. I'm out.

1062
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah.

1063
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Simple is best.

1064
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Director.

1065
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Director.

1066
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I can't see the movement.

1067
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It's done.

1068
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Thank you.

1069
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I think the one who ruins you the most is yourself.

1070
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Do I ruin myself?

1071
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
You said you'd pay me back.

1072
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
If the trainer sympathizes, do you get muscles?

1073
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I hope you don't care about me anymore.

1074
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I'll eat well and live well.

1075
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It's been a while, Do Yeon-joo.

1076
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
What the hell?

1077
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
What?

1078
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I think the members are going to the gym.

1079
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Did you set up a gym in front of us because of them?

1080
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Shouldn't you be responsible as the director?

1081
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I'll make it my membership.

1082
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
What if you fail?

1083
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Can you promise to quit the management position and go to the gym?

1084
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Please help me.

1085
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Come to me.
