00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,100
Come back!

188
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,090
Director!

189
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,800
You're losing all of your muscles!

190
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,630
I guess you didn't find him.

191
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,260
No.

192
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,300
I don't even know where to look anymore.

193
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,010
Come join me, then.

194
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,970
Let's eat tteokbokki.

195
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,060
It's Grandma Tteobokki.

196
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,470
Yes, I thought you could use it.

197
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,100
Nothing comforts us as much as tteokbokki.

198
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,740
I added glass noodles and sausages, too.

199
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,520
Let's eat.

200
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,300
It's tasty.

201
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,870
Director disappeared,

202
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,390
but I still enjoy tteokbokki.

203
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,550
How could it be?

204
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,510
He'll come back eventually.

205
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,210
Stop looking for him.

206
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,580
You said you'd wait for him.

207
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,020
I was going to,

208
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,620
but I don't think I can.

209
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,570
I don't look for him because I'm worried about him.

210
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,540
It's because it's too hard for me.

211
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,390
I think I'd die at this rate.

212
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,160
I worry about myself more than him.

213
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,770
Aren't I so awful?

214
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,610
If missing the person you like makes you awful,

215
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,290
I'm the worst person in the world.

216
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,900
Have you not heard from Dan yet?

217
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,170
No. What a jerk.

218
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,670
Is the right side better?

219
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,000
Or this side?

220
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,210
To the right. To the right.

221
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,950
Hey, Bu Yeong.

222
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,980
Huh? Unni, you came.

223
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,610
Your husband is waiting outside. Go see him.

224
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,060
What made him come without a word?

225
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,460
I need to go, Unni.

226
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,300
Yes, yes.

227
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,980
Thank you, Unni.

228
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,230
Here.
Yes.

229
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,520
You did good.
I'll leave you to it, Unni.

230
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,970
Okay.
I'm leaving.

231
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,130
See you.

232
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,840
Let's see.

233
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,250
Which workout should I do?

234
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,850
Director Do told me to stretch first.

235
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,470
You came, Ms. Im.

236
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,510
Hi, Alex.

237
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,130
You guys are doing too much.

238
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,250
We could've stood guard ourselves.

239
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,860
Don't say that.

240
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,900
The members need to stay here

241
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,640
so those cyberbullies won't dare to hurt us.

242
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,370
Thank you.

243
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,060
Don't mention it.

244
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,680
You guys are going through a lot.

245
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,040
The Director isn't even here.

246
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,380
It's okay.

247
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,250
As long as he comes back,

248
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,960
I can wait as long as it takes.

249
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,800
By the way, how did you come to know Director Do?

250
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,360
Pardon?
I was always curious.

251
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,130
You're always on his side.

252
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,180
Director Do...

253
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,880
saved my life.

254
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,190
What?

255
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,300
That's why I will protect him, no matter what.

256
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,890
The Director will return! He will! He will!

257
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,200
Your words dictate the future.
Oh, okay.

258
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,450
That's cool.

259
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,120
Thank you.

260
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,770
By the way, your shirt is inside out.

261
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,340
You're right.

262
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,500
Geez, where did Director Do go

263
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,180
leaving that fool behind?

264
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,000
Aigoo. Aigoo!

265
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,330
Wait.

266
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,650
Hold on a second!

267
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,730
Hello.

268
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,630
You haven't reached Director Do yet?

269
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,930
No.

270
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,450
What's this about?

271
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,690
You need to move out within a month.

272
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,470
Pardon?
Someone offered twice as much in rent.

273
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,250
W-Who'd pay that much
for a semi-basement like this?

274
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,110
I know. That's why I need to seize this chance.

275
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,260
But still, we can't move out in a month.

276
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,300
And you're breaching the contract.
According to the Tenant Protection Act-

277
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,560
I knew you'd bring that up.

278
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,990
Look at the contract.

279
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,910
"If you miss the payment more than twice,

280
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,390
the landlord can request the business to move."

281
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,790
We haven't missed a payment recently.

282
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,260
We paid the rent we owed since Director Do came-

283
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,960
Whatever, whatever, whatever.

284
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,300
You missed it at least twice before.

285
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,860
Anyway, move out in a month.

286
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,020
I'm signing a new contract soon, just so you know.

287
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,780
Sir.

288
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,780
Sir!

289
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,150
I wonder if the Director ate.

290
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,310
He needs to consume enough protein.

291
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,020
Did you see the video about
that gym the cyberbullies posted?

292
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,740
Yes, I saw it.

293
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,410
They say Kang Sol died because of the director.

294
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,680
Yes.
Geez, what nonsense.

295
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,640
He said he can treat cancer patients

296
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,800
and told her not to get chemotherapy.

297
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,270
According to the cyberbullies,

298
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,490
the old director there almost died
because of him, too.

299
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,740
Maybe he meant to kill Kang Sol.

300
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,400
Excuse me, it's not like that.

301
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,830
What's he saying?

302
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,750
Ahjussi, just eat the chicken breast.

303
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,820
Why does he care?

304
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,430
Is he really defending a murderer?

305
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,740
He's not a murderer. Take it back.

306
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,900
What else should we call a murderer, then?

307
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,940
That's what I'm saying. He is a murderer.

308
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,200
I said he's not a murderer.

309
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,770
Take back what you said just now.

310
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,010
I don't want to.

311
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,360
Murderer.

312
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,580
Murderer.

313
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,360
Murderer, murderer, murderer.

314
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,550
Murderer, murderer.

315
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,250
He's scared. He's scared.
Leaving?

316
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,680
Hey, hey!
Chicken breast!

317
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,380
Hey, hey!
Where are you going?

318
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,340
Who's paying twice as much for a place like this

319
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,840
unless they have ill feelings toward us?

320
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,850
Director, where are you?

321
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,640
The landlord wants us to move out.

322
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,810
Please answer your phone.

323
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,140
It's a tough situation.

324
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,840
They're resisting hard right now.

325
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,080
It's not easy to convince them, but I'll try.

326
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,500
I'll deposit double the rent right now.

327
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,900
I'm in your care.
Deposit?

328
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Gosh, the abs are hard.

329
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,400
You know my account number, right?
Yes, yes.

330
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,950
Let me know when you receive it.

331
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,990
He was after our gym?

332
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,060
I said the Director isn't a murderer.

333
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,100
I said the Director isn't a murderer!
Hey, wait...

334
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,770
Our director saves people's lives!

335
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,870
You were the petty and cowardly bastard

336
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,470
who was after us while he's gone.

337
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,880
Pardon?

338
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,860
I know you feel insecure toward the Director,

339
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,210
but you're worse than I thought.

340
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,210
What are you talking about-

341
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,370
Hey! Why, why...

342
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,860
W-Why would you do this? I just got this today.

343
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,990
This is a warning.

344
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,980
Don't look down on us just
because Director Do isn't here.

345
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,070
We aren't just willing to tolerate you.

346
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,660
H-H-Hey...

347
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,080
This month went well, too.

348
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,320
Should we go get something tasty?

349
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,420
Yes, sounds good.

350
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,230
Are you craving something, Chief?

351
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,700
What am I craving...

352
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,770
Do you know what the weather's like in Italy now?

353
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,530
Weather in Italy?

354
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,290
Let me look it up.

355
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,820
It's humid.*
(Sounds like "spaghetti")

356
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,270
Mi Ran, is everything okay?

357
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,460
I haven't seen you laughing lately.

358
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,340
No, it sounds good. Spaghetti.

359
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,210
Here.

360
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,190
This place?

361
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,400
Does spaghetti sound good?

362
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,940
Yes.

363
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,520
Sounds good...

364
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,440
Wait, that posture...

365
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,160
Director?

366
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,080
Mi Ran, do you know a good spaghetti place?

367
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,450
I'm sorry. I need to go now.

368
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,100
W-W-What?

369
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,020
Where did he go?

370
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,110
Director!

371
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,000
Director, Director...

372
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,880
Director...

373
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,450
No.

374
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,920
Director!

375
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,700
Director!

376
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,680
Where... You've got to be kidding me.

377
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,610
Huh? I see him. I see him.

378
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,480
It's the Director.

379
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,220
Hold on.

380
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,800
Tenth floor. Tenth floor.

381
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,980
You can do it, Ms. Lee.

382
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,240
Feel it more. Go lower.

383
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,970
Go lower!

384
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,150
Put pressure on your glutes. More!

385
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,590
Don't give up.

386
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,790
You need to believe in yourself.

387
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,470
Nice. You can do it!

388
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,770
Gosh, gosh...

389
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,700
I can't do it. It's too hard.

390
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,770
Do it once more when you want to give up

391
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,290
to achieve what you want.

392
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,620
One!

393
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,070
One.

394
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,390
Nice, you're almost there. Almost there.

395
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,590
This is it! Do it once more!

396
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,550
Director.

397
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,520
Ms. Lee.

398
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,100
What led me to find him...

399
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,250
was him in the end.

400
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,590
How did you find me here?

401
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,310
As you said,

402
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,280
I believed I could do it without giving up.

403
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,860
Where are you going? Let's talk for a second.

404
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,490
I need to go.

405
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,720
No.

406
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,340
Were you exercising here instead of in the gym?

407
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,700
While climbing up and down the stairs?

408
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,940
Just work out at the gym instead.

409
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,170
Move.

410
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,970
I'm behind schedule.

411
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,380
No.

412
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,110
Are you saying you're behind
schedule for your workout?

413
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,680
Delivery.

414
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,510
I'm running behind the delivery schedule.

415
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,960
Pardon?

416
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,200
The noodles are getting soggy, Ms. Lee.

417
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,540
T-The noodles are getting soggy?

418
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,930
Are you all done now?

419
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,460
I need to go back if I get a call.

420
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,540
Where are you staying?

421
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,920
Have you been sleeping or eating?

422
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,600
Don't worry.

423
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,740
I'm doing well.

424
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,530
New order.

425
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,600
I'll get going now.
A-Already?

426
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,360
Is that what you're doing after abandoning us?

427
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,070
Are you delivering the high-calorie food

428
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,280
that you insisted we can't eat?

429
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,190
Gosh...

430
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,660
Come back.

431
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,370
You'll be back, right?

432
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,410
The members are working overnight shifts

433
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,660
to protect the gym from cyberbullies.

434
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,960
And since I'm not working out with you,

435
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,340
I'm losing my muscles.

436
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,290
My cardio endurance is getting worse, too.

437
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,860
And... and...

438
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,600
I really missed you.

439
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,380
♪ Every time I think
of you all day and night ♪

440
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,000
♪ Anywhere, anywhere ♪

441
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,990
Director, I...

442
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,880
♪ Every time I think of you,
even in dreams, anywhere ♪

443
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,910
It's faster to go that way.

444
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,330
Excuse me?

445
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,600
A big guy like that was holding
a scary weapon, too.

446
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,950
Isn't this attempted murder?

447
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,330
There's no need to argue further.

448
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,200
Let's follow the law!
I'm sorry.

449
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,890
Please calm down.

450
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,100
Let's try to settle-
Settle?

451
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,540
Look what he did to our kids.

452
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,220
What do you mean, settle?
Seriously!

453
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,940
Well, uh...

454
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,270
They don't appear to be injured.

455
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,410
Their spirits were hurt.
Their spirits. Can't you tell?

456
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,090
He would've killed us any moment.

457
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,610
He suddenly approached us with a weapon.

458
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:24,080
Our director saves people's lives!

459
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,060
No, no.

460
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,160
Is he crazy?

461
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,600
Hey, hey...

462
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,880
I said our director saves people's lives!

463
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,940
So, using the monkey wrench,

464
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,170
you disassembled their bicycles?

465
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,620
All of them.

466
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,500
My mom got it for me
for getting 80 points on a test.

467
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,730
Imagine how scared my baby must've been.

468
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,320
I'll put it back together if they apologize.

469
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,790
What?

470
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,150
We'll compensate you as much as possible.

471
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,520
Please don't be angry.

472
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,590
The bicycles aren't the problem.

473
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,800
He disassembled them cruelly!

474
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,170
They're the ones who spoke cruelly first.

475
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,750
Alex.
Whatever.

476
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,960
We have no interest in settling.

477
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,340
Follow the law! Follow the law!

478
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,300
Let's just follow the law!

479
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,890
Apologize now!
No way!

480
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,610
Apologize now!

481
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,860
Please forgive...
Be quiet.

482
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,720
Excuse me.

483
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,480
Talk to us from now on.

484
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,290
Who are you...

485
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,310
Mom.

486
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,620
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

487
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,010
No.

488
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,360
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

489
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,460
Okay.

490
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,310
I'm sorry, Rosa.

491
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,240
Why did you do that to kids...

492
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,620
They agreed to settle.

493
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,360
They won't cause you any more trouble, Director.

494
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,270
Well done.

495
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,170
Your clothes are too light.

496
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,000
You catch a cold easily.

497
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,720
Hello.

498
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,100
I'm Alex's co-worker.

499
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,850
I work as a trainer with him.

500
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,050
A trainer co-worker?

501
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,150
Yes, nice to meet you.

502
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,890
Yes.

503
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,630
Call me whenever you're in trouble.

504
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,410
Okay?

505
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,890
Don't worry.

506
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,500
I won't tell you to go back to medical school.

507
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,670
Dress warmly, okay?

508
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,680
Take care, ma'am.

509
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,800
Call me.

510
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,890
I'll be waiting.

511
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,300
Medical school? M-Medical school?

512
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,090
M-Medical school?

513
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,240
Is that what I think it is...

514
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,630
Alex, were you a medical student?

515
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,010
Yes.

516
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,300
Why did you hide that?

517
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,250
I never hid it.

518
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,240
It's not that you hid it...

519
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,860
You always acted kind of idiotic...

520
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,550
Pardon? What do you mean, idiotic?

521
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,250
Spit out your words now.

522
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,930
Spit them out.

523
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,780
Spit, spit, spit.

524
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,300
Got them.

525
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,830
Director.

526
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,300
Hello.

527
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,750
Hello, Director.

528
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,900
Director, assist me.

529
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,270
Director!

530
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,700
The toilet is clogged again.

531
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,220
Director, this is sugar-free shikhye.

532
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,390
It's so tasty.

533
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,790
Try it, try it, try it.

534
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,730
Good morning, Director.

535
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,050
Thank you. Take care.
Take care.

536
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,830
The Director is delivering food
instead of working out.

537
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,030
I guess he's not coming back.

538
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,730
Delivering food?

539
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,750
He used to yell at us not to eat delivery food.

540
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,400
That fitness fanatic quit exercising.

541
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,030
He must be determined.

542
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,020
F***!

543
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,570
I didn't think he was like this.

544
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,580
He really is a bastard.

545
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,750
Ms. Im.

546
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,550
The gym members are waiting for him.

547
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,850
What kind of a director does this?

548
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,060
Unni, calm down.

549
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,460
What do you mean, calm down?

550
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,420
I can only calm down so much.

551
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,300
I'll report to them.

552
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,080
Report? Report what?

553
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,030
Unni, what are you trying to do?

554
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,810
I'll tell them about how much of a bastard

555
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,810
Director Do is in great detail.

556
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,480
Ms. Im, Ms. Im!

557
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,820
Unni! Wait for me!
Stop her! Stop her!

558
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,190
Darn it...

559
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,390
Gosh, my stomach... my stomach...

560
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,760
Shit.

561
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,470
I tried to get over the breakup
with tteokbokki like Mi Ran

562
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,830
and got an upset stomach instead.

563
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,700
How many times has it been?

564
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,180
Geez, my stomach...

565
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,780
It's acute pancreatitis.

566
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,000
Get some fluids since you might get dehydrated.

567
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,970
Dang it.

568
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,880
I'd get better quickly

569
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,950
if Dan massaged my stomach instead.

570
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,000
Gosh, it really hurts.

571
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,880
I'm dying. Seriously.

572
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,850
Am I dead?

573
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,020
Are you the Grim Reaper?

574
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,780
Take me.

575
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,280
My life without Dan

576
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,840
is meaningless, anyway.

577
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,690
Lee Ji Ran!

578
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,560
I asked if you're okay!

579
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,360
Babe!

580
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,560
I thought I died because

581
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,610
I missed you so much.

582
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,240
What happened, by the way?

583
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,790
Noona gave me a call.

584
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,020
You're so cold.

585
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,210
You used to call her Sister-in-law.

586
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,300
You call her Noona as soon as we broke up.

587
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,030
By the way, what's with the outfit?

588
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,610
I've actually been summoned by the country.

589
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,880
What country summoned you?

590
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,850
I'm guarding a palace for the borough office.

591
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,380
As a public service worker.

592
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,570
If so, did we break up because...

593
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,250
You were anxious when we were apart
for 40 minutes and 23 seconds.

594
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,030
I wonder if you could've lasted

595
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,010
four weeks, 672 hours
while I was at the training center?

596
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,780
You would've been miserable.

597
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,640
So,

598
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,330
you mean you left me for my happiness?

599
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,910
I know you're alive now.

600
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,550
I'll leave now.

601
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:06,340
So, we broke up because...

602
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,250
You coward!

603
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,050
You're finally here.

604
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,920
Ms. Lee.
I thought I had to order 20 times to see you.

605
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,500
But this was my 13th time. So Honolulu.

606
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,670
What happened?

607
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,990
Did you order tteokbokki until I came to deliver it?

608
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,670
I told you that I'll never give up.

609
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,500
It's no use, no matter what you say.

610
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,770
I'll leave.

611
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,750
I'll have to eat all of this by myself, then.

612
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,700
Fine, leave.

613
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,580
Is all of this about 50,000 calories?

614
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,790
I'll keep eating and eating while I wait for you

615
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,580
and I'd become a giant tteokbokki.

616
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,310
Are you planning to eat all of that yourself?

617
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,220
Of course.

618
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,770
With you, I mean.

619
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,090
Come on. Come have a seat.

620
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,450
Sit down, please?

621
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,750
I thought about how I should comfort you,

622
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,630
but I couldn't figure it out.

623
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,400
How do I comfort a fitness fanatic
who doesn't want to work out anymore?

624
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,270
So, I decided to do it my way.

625
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,010
Ta-da.

626
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,820
You'll comfort me with tteokbokki?

627
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,910
Yes.

628
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:48,000
Tteokbokki is a kind friend
who always comforts you

629
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,800
better than anyone right by your side.

630
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,820
This carb bomb is kind?

631
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,950
Of course, it is.

632
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,020
It's always approachable for anyone.

633
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,110
Look at it now. While I was waiting for you,

634
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,890
thirteen servings of tteokbokki came here for me.

635
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,540
I eat flour ttoekbokki when I feel down.

636
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,060
The thoroughly absorbed sauce

637
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,230
comforts me with sweetness whenever I chew.

638
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,900
And...

639
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,600
when I'm feeling mixed emotions,
I eat rosé tteokbokki.

640
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,330
The combination of gochujang and cream sauce

641
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,530
tells me feeling mixed emotions
doesn't mean struggles.

642
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,520
And the jjajang tteobokki.

643
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,670
You eat jjajang tteokbokki when you're irritated.

644
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,690
I won't get into it since it's common sense.

645
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,460
What kind of nonsense is that?

646
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,700
And right now, you're in pain. Say, ah.

647
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,410
What's this?

648
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,300
What do you think? Isn't your pain going away?

649
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,130
It's too spicy.
Right?

650
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,060
You don't feel any other pain but the spiciness.

651
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,700
It's good, right?
You're asking if this is good?

652
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,500
Isn't it good?

653
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,590
It sounds good.

654
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,660
Did I order too spicy?

655
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,240
It's too spicy, isn't it? Hold on.

656
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,000
Let me give you this. Say, ah.

657
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,640
Are you okay?

658
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,300
Are you okay, Director?

659
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,090
I'm sorry. I got it too spicy.

660
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,940
Are you okay?

661
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,820
You're okay, right?

662
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,210
Pardon?

663
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,240
It's not tasty. Don't laugh.

664
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,190
I'm sorry. I got too spicy.

665
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,380
So sorry. Try chewing. Chew.

666
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,620
Do you want another one?

667
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,910
Another one?

668
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,760
Wow, we ate all this.

669
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,700
You ate more than me.

670
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,120
But it's okay.

671
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,210
I can work out and lose weight again.

672
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,750
I know you can help me with that soon.

673
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,860
Let's get going.

674
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,360
The dinner orders will be flooding in soon.

675
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,720
It's not your fault, Director.

676
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:33,310
I was thinking while looking
at Sol's funeral portrait.

677
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,960
Why did it have to be that picture?

678
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,260
But...

679
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,120
I realized while I was looking at it.

680
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,360
Maybe she wanted to say that

681
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:54,330
she tried her best without
giving up even for a moment.

682
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,710
So, she has no regrets.

683
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,100
Let's not be so sad.

684
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,620
She reached a happy ending
by working hard until the end.

685
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,830
We can't make it a sad ending for her on our own.

686
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,980
I'll be on a YouTube show today.

687
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,600
I'll be exposing Do Hyeon Joong. Please watch.

688
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,990
"Revealing the truth about Do Hyeon Joong"?

689
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,950
Revealing what?

690
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,390
Yeah, here's breaking news.

691
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,630
The gym members are finally

692
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:45,000
revealing the truth about Director Do Hyeon Joong.

693
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,060
Let's hear them out.

694
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,200
All right. You came here to personally reveal

695
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Director Do's wrongdoings, right?

696
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,820
Of course.

697
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,270
Director Do is so cutthroat.

698
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:02,680
He's so cruel to the gym members.
It's unbelievable.

699
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,140
When there was a young mom at the gym,

700
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,150
he held the crying baby like this and...

701
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:14,400
did the lunges in sweat for a whole hour.

702
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,450
And he said,

703
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,720
the gym is open to anyone who works out.

704
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,320
Seriously.

705
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,810
Wasn't he just trying to make money?

706
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:29,000
Yes, he was trying to make money.

707
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,900
Whenever a client is in a slump,

708
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,180
he makes them try different sports

709
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,460
to help them overcome it.

710
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,660
It didn't even make him any money.

711
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,200
He had a very strange business strategy.

712
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,680
And he-
Kang Sol...

713
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,000
missed the timing for treatment
while working out excessively.

714
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,300
Didn't he push her too much?

715
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,530
Gosh, you're right.

716
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,820
He did, you know.

717
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,410
Can we hear about that in detail, then?

718
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,820
Directo Do...

719
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:08,540
kept pushing Ms. Kang excessively.

720
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,210
So she won't come to the gym.

721
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,360
Thinking about it now,

722
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,730
while Sol was alive,

723
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:22,350
she wanted to have the ideal body

724
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:25,040
created by Do Hyeon Joong.

725
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,500
Right?

726
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,690
Come on.

727
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,950
But still, he did force a sick person to work out.

728
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,180
He basically killed her, then.

729
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,990
What did you say, you bastard?

730
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,020
Let go. Let go.

731
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,460
Who do you think you are?

732
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,110
Hold on. Let go. Let go.

733
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,250
He didn't kill her!

734
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,060
Our director saves people's lives.

735
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,690
He doesn't kill.

736
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,190
He saved my life, too.

737
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,490
Before I became a trainer,

738
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,150
I...

739
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,650
was a medical student.

740
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,720
Medical student?
Medical student...

741
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,730
L-Let's sit.

742
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,130
What the medical student?

743
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,070
He was a medical student? Really?

744
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,130
Alex...

745
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:19,550
I studied hard to satisfy my mother,
who's a hospital director.

746
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,390
I got good grades

747
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,790
and I went to medical school
as if it was a given.

748
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,170
But...

749
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,870

Sir!
Alex!

752
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,330
Are you okay? Alex!
But...

753
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:55,290
I couldn't become a doctor.

754
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,800
The moment I realized that...

755
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,110
I became a useless person.

756
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,370
I started destroying myself.

757
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:31,740
Because working hard was what I was good at.

758
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:10,310
But, but...

759
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:13,380

What did you say?

764
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,260
Don't you want to die?

765
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,390
How about you lose weight and reconsider?

766
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,880
That's when I met the Director.

767

I can't. I can't. I can't.

770
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,380
You said you wanted to die.

771
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,960
You decided to die,
but this is the best you can do?

772

You've never been in my shoes.

773

Don't speak so lightly.

Speak lightly?

I weigh the same as you now.

776
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,910
It's not the weight. You aren't fit enough.

777
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,550
Excuses only make you do more squats.

Yes.

I started working out so I could die.

797

But the more I worked out with the Director,

798
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,440
the more I wanted to live.

I thought it was because I liked you too much.

Yes.

921
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:29,200
That's a relief.

922
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,460
I was scared because

923
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,830
he acted like he'd never come back.

924
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,770
That bastard.

925
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:43,740
Let me ask you a favor,

926
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,710
Director Lee Roy.

927
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:52,960
Check on our gym often when I'm gone.

928
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,510
What are you talking about right now?

929
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,440
[Kang Sol]

930
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,080
I can't go on any longer.

931
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,640
What are you thinking right now?

932
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,610
Hey, where are you going?

933
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,380
Where are you going?

934
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,630
Hey!

935
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:20,000
I'll take over your gym if you leave.

936
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,710
Hey!

937
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,420
You aren't going far away, right?

938
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,850
Okay, I'll protect it for now!

939
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:31,320
So, come back soon. Okay?

940
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,640
Even if you call me Bong Won, then,

941
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,140
I won't get angry at you!

942
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:41,110
So, make sure to come back!

943
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:42,880
Bastard.

944
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:50,110
I'm relieved that he's back.

945
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,210
Mr. Lee,

946
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,680
come to the Zumba class next time.

947
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,810
I'll look out for you.

948
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,330
Well, okay. Sure.

949
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,280
Let's see.

950
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,640
Director!

951
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,190
Ms. Lee.

952
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,520
Here. Doesn't this tteokbokki look good?

953
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,000
Come on, Unni. You have no sense of direction.

954
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,720
It's all about the water for the yellow tail.

955
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,570
W-What are you doing?

956
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,260
What the...

957
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,140
Come on. Walk faster.

958
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:25,150
The fish restaurant might close soon.

959
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,870
Well, Ms. Lee-
Quiet.

960
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:31,960
I only bought two servings.

961
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:34,490
Are they gone?

962
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,310
Check if they're gone.

963
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,920
Hurry up and check.

964
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,050
They're about to close.

965
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,120
I'll get angry if they're closed.

966
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,530
Are they gone?

967
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,880
Well, not yet.

968
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,410
They aren't gone yet?

969
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:55,780
What do we do?

970
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,110
It can't get soggy.

971
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:01,170
But it's okay. This is flour-tteok.

972
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,270
It's good when it's soggy.

973
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,700
Do you like soggy tteok, Director?

974
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,790
Yes.

975
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,330
I do.

976
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,670
I think I like it now.
