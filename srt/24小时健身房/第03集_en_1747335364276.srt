1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What?

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,220
You said you'd pay me back, Mr. Miran.

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Yes.

4
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,360
Why? You want me to pay you back for not losing weight?

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,020
I can't. Who can't?

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,760
I even let you wear that child's clothes.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,200
Then why are you paying me back?

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
That's...

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,900
Gosh.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well...

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,600
Ms. Kim, let's go to the gym.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,800
Let's go for a mental checkup.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
No.

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,300
Yes.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,100
I know how to get my mind back.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
No...

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ms. Kim.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,500
The last straw.

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,500
Are you saying you want to get your mind back?

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,500
I told you, you short-mouthed man I respect.

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,100
When you're in a bad mood, move forward.

22
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,400
This isn't meat. It's fat.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,000
Fight, fight, fight.

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,100
And I told you, you're the best when you're in a bad mood.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,100
What are you doing?

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,400
What you made with the gym clothes

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,200
is not the clothes, but what's inside your body.

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,700
Why don't you eat this instead?

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,400
I have to eat at 8 p.m.

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,900
I'm giving you this especially.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,700
Eat up, Mr. Director.

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,900
At 8 p.m.

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,100
You can't put this in your body.

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,900
Mind your own business. It's my body.

35
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,400
It's my body.

36
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,400
It's annoying.

37
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,100
What?

38
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,900
Wow.

39
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,700
That's amazing.

40
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,900
That's amazing.

41
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
What's wrong with you?

42
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,500
You've been eating bad food and quit working out

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,600
whenever something bad happens.

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,500
Is that how you've been maximizing your body?

45
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,300
Maximizing?

46
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,100
You treat your body so carelessly,

47
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,800
so that man treats you carelessly too.

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,400
In my opinion, you're the one who ruins you the most.

49
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
I...

50
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,100
ruin myself?

51
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Director, it's not that.

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,600
I tried too.

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,200
I didn't expect anything big.

54
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,800
What I wanted was just

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,500
to see the last image of me

56
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,200
that the man I liked remembered

57
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,900
and to see me feel less sorry and feel less ashamed.

58
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,200
That was all I wanted.

59
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,500
But...

60
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,600
I can't give up no matter how hard I try!

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Wow.

62
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,000
You must have been really upset.

63
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,800
I was upset.

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,600
Not you, Director. It was Director Miran.

65
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,000
What?

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,300
You didn't eat it in the end, did you?

67
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm not upset. I'm relieved.

68
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,300
You're dying to eat some?

69
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,700
You're just a trainer's basic...

70
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:28,000
I mean, a human's basic

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,800
If we don't change anything,

72
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,700
we're really going to fail.

73
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,900
Don't say that, Director.

74
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,100
I saw it in the book.

75
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,300
It'll come true.

76
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,000
Just quit.

77
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,000
I came here because I didn't want to fail.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,600
So...

79
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,800
Everyone, get a grip.

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,400
Our VIPs are coming soon.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,300
If they're VIPs, are they the SMEN?

82
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,500
Did you really cast them?

83
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,000
What?

84
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,100
Ten years ago,

85
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,200
it was a day when the typhoon was really strong.

86
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,500
A man disappeared and came back in three days.

87
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,600
The man said he flew away in the wind,

88
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,600
but no one believed him.

89
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,800
They asked how the typhoon disappears.

90
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,300
So the man who flew away

91
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,700
gathered people who could relate to his work.

92
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,300
120,000 people gathered and they were

93
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,700
named after one person.

94
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
SMEN.

95
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,500
Pa.

96
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,100
Skinny.

97
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,500
Men.

98
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,700
Fighting.

99
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,300
What the...

100
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,800
SMEN.

101
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,200
I need more people to work out,

102
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,600
but I need 120,000 people who work out more.

103
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,800
I'll make them my members.

104
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,700
If one person succeeds, he gets 120,000 members.

105
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,100
But if one person fails,

106
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,900
he gets 120,000 anti-fans.

107
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,400
There's no way he'll fail.

108
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,800
What if he fails?

109
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,000
If he fails, he'll quit his job

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,700
and go to the gym.

111
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,100
Let's make a promise.

112
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Sir.

113
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Alex.

114
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,600
Don't worry.

115
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,400
I'll never leave.

116
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,600
What did you want to see us about?

117
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,000
We want to sponsor SMEN's bar.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,200
Sponsor?

119
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,500
Yes. We're going to host a free PT

120
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,600
for bulk-ups at the gym.

121
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,300
Just take the PT

122
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,300
and leave us a quick review of the bar.

123
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,600
We've been offered a lot of things,

124
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,500
but we don't have many members

125
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,700
who are interested in working out.

126
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,000
But if you take it,

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,300
we're really confident.

128
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,000
Excuse me. I'll give you the skin.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
We didn't order this.

130
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,800
It's free.

131
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Enjoy.

132
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,800
Thank you.

133
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,900
Why do people give out free services

134
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,400
without asking?

135
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,700
If we leave this,

136
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,200
we'll get 3,000 won for environmental pressure.

137
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
People don't acknowledge the news of men.

138
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,800
There's environmental pressure,

139
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,200
but there's no stomach pressure.

140
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Oh, right.

141
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,900
Now, guys.

142
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,800
This stomach is also a muscle.

143
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,400
If you work out your stomach,

144
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,200
you'll digest better and lessen the pressure.

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,500
Why don't you start with a light upper body?

146
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Oh, so that's why

147
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,800
you're saying this is why you have a stomach?

148
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,300
You don't even know the word.

149
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,200
Sir.

150
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,900
Are these anchovies except for the birds?

151
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,700
Yes, yes.

152
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
Anchovies here and there?

153
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,200
Ma'am, what's anchovies?

154
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,100
These people are not anchovies. They're people.

155
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,000
Would you like to be called a pig by someone?

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,900
What?

157
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
A pig?

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,200
I want all the anchovy noodles.

159
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,100
Here you go.

160
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,300
Thank you.

161
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Darn it!

162
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
I can tell who's looking at us as anchovies.

163
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,500
Let's go, everyone.

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,100
Do you know why we don't go to the gym?

165
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,000
Because people like you are ignoring us.

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
You should eat all the anchovy noodles.

167
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm full. I'll go now.

168
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,000
Sir! Sir!

169
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,800
Darn it.

170
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,600
Sir, we didn't mean to...

171
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,400
What do we do, sir?

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,400
Don't worry, Alex.

173
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,600
We'll think of a way to get over it.

174
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Okay.

175
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Hello. This is the gym at 2 p.m.

176
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
We're recruiting members to work out with us

177
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,700
and change our lives.

178
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,400
We'll take care of your health

179
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,000
by working with you.

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,300
Sir!

181
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,400
You've been writing to us for hours already.

182
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,900
I will never give up on our gym.

183
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,900
I think you really love our gym.

184
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,200
I can feel it.

185
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,600
You trusted me for the first time.

186
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
What?

187
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
You started working out late,

188
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,200
but you never went to the gym.

189
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,400
You're old, and you don't have any experience.

190
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,200
But only Director Bong trusted me.

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,800
He saw my shoulder and left.

192
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
He saw how sincere I was in my work out.

193
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,200
So I will protect you.

194
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,800
This is the 37th comment.

195
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,500
Snack

196
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,400
Anyway, it's fascinating.

197
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Why?

198
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,760
How can you eat something so delicious with soy sauce and egg?

199
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,960
Give me a bite.

200
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,600
Don't overdo it.

201
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,700
I was so embarrassed because of you yesterday.

202
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,200
I want to mix you up with the egg.

203
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,000
Why are you taking off your clothes?

204
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,860
Say one more thing.

205
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,500
Okay.

206
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,160
Why aren't you leaving early today?

207
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,420
Isn't it time for the fitness class?

208
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,960
I don't work out anymore.

209
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Why not?

210
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,620
It's not fun.

211
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,020
What?

212
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,660
I'm going.

213
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,060
Okay.

214
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
Bye.

215
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Honey, I'm off.

216
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,460
You left home 24 minutes later than usual.

217
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,460
I know.

218
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Honey!

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,100
She's really kicking it out.

220
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,600
Eye рез ver.

221
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,620
What's that?

222
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,760
I don't know.

223
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,600
I think she thinks I'm some crazy madman

224
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,320
who exchanged 27 minutes running errands that morning.

225
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:51,460
Hello.

226
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,460
Did I just resign?

227
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:03,460
Did I just resign?

228
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:10,460
I'll get this ready.

229
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,460
I'll get this ready.

230
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,460
Let's have a beer next time.

231
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,460
That's a good idea.

232
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,460
Let's go.

233
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:24,460
Yes.

234
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
Good morning.

235
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:31,460
Oh, you're here.

236
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,460
Junseong.

237
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,460
Yes.

238
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,460
Excuse me.

239
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
What?

240
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,460
What do you want to talk about?

241
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,460
I'm wearing that at Yejin's wedding.

242
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,460
I heard it's changed with your brother.

243
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,460
Junseong explained everything to me earlier.

244
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,460
Miran is even fun to my brother.

245
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Junseong?

246
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,460
Yeah, we were so worried about Miran's misunderstanding.

247
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
Didn't you two break up?

248
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,460
I'm so jealous.

249
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,460
I want someone to be so close even though they broke up.

250
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,460
Do you think that's why it's so common?

251
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:17,460
You can't.

252
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
What's with Junseok?

253
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,460
When are you going to leave me with a scar?

254
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,460
Why are you taking care of me in front of people?

255
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,460
Do you want me to be a regret?

256
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,460
I hope you don't mind me in the future.

257
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,460
I'll eat well and live well on my own.

258
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,460
Eight feelings.

259
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:42,460
Junseok, thank you for caring.

260
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:56,460
Miran.

261
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,460
Yes.

262
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:11,460
I prepared a five-day product.

263
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:21,460
I'm going to be home at 6.50.

264
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:27,460
Oh, I heard you're opening this building soon.

265
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,460
Really? What store?

266
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:40,460
Something really amazing happened.

267
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,460
Hey!

268
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:54,460
It's been a while, Do Yeon-joo.

269
00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:04,460
What?

270
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,460
What a big house.

271
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,460
A gym in front of a gym?

272
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:13,460
I told you I thought I'd get a gym.

273
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,460
Surprise.

274
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,460
What do you think?

275
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:23,460
I worked hard to surprise you.

276
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
Do you know him?

277
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,460
I don't have to care.

278
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,460
You don't have to care.

279
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,460
I'm sorry to say that.

280
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,460
We're so close.

281
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,460
I don't think anyone knows who Do Hyun-joong is better than me.

282
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,460
If you're curious about Hyun-joong, come over anytime.

283
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
I'll tell you everything.

284
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
You're still the same.

285
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
You don't exercise and talk a lot.

286
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Hey, if you have time, raise your body a little more.

287
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:58,460
You're going to get a hangover.

288
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,460
I'm working hard, but it's not working.

289
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Is it because I don't do medicine like anyone else?

290
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,460
Medicine?

291
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Excuse me.

292
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,460
He's our director's natural.

293
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,460
What kind of natural is he?

294
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,460
You're talking like a real game.

295
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,460
Look at that.

296
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,460
If Do Hyun-joong is natural, why did he run away just before doping?

297
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,460
Are you embarrassed to be caught?

298
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,460
I heard the director fainted because of you.

299
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
What?

300
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,460
What did you do to the director?

301
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:31,460
Hyun-joong, you're better than you think.

302
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,460
Everyone's so naive.

303
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,460
Anyway, don't trust him too much.

304
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,460
Betrayal is a habit.

305
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:47,460
I'm going to the natural.

306
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,460
Shall we have a natural dinner today?

307
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,460
You're so annoying.

308
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,460
Let's go eat this.

309
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:07,460
Yes.

310
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,460
Everyone got this, right?

311
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:17,460
Something like this.

312
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,460
Hot water is coming out.

313
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
Hot water?

314
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
There's a sauna.

315
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
Sauna?

316
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,460
Just standing there is a machine that loses weight.

317
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,460
You're a genius.

318
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,460
It looks good.

319
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,460
Is it a betrayal to go?

320
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:46,460
But I still have feelings for him.

321
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,460
Oh, my.

322
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,460
What is this?

323
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Are you okay?

324
00:19:52,460 --> 00:20:02,460
Yes.

325
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,460
The sauna is dry.

326
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:11,460
It's completely new.

327
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,460
The membership is moving.

328
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,460
Let's go.

329
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,460
Where are you going?

330
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
Where should I go?

331
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,460
Shall I go to the 4th floor?

332
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
The weather is so nice.

333
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,460
What's that?

334
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Over there?

335
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,460
Where?

336
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,460
Over there.

337
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,460
That's the gym.

338
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,460
Did he set up a gym in front of us because of you?

339
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,460
You don't have to worry.

340
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
How did you not care?

341
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,460
There's a gym in front of the gym.

342
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
What?

343
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,460
I think the members are going to the gym over there.

344
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,460
Look at that.

345
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,460
The members are leaving.

346
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,460
If such a large gym comes in, we won't last long.

347
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,460
Don't worry.

348
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,460
The gym is big over there, but the body is big over there.

349
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,460
That's right, sir.

350
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,460
They're going to be ruined.

351
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,460
What?

352
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,460
I told you there would be a gym in front of us.

353
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,460
Did you see that?

354
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,460
I'm going to tell you to go there 10 times a day.

355
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,460
You...

356
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,460
You...

357
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,460
Because of you, the gym was built in front of us,

358
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,460
and all the members were taken away.

359
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,460
The last hope was the smasher.

360
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,460
Shouldn't we at least take responsibility as the head?

361
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
I told you not to worry.

362
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,460
The new member is here.

363
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,460
Oh, my goodness.

364
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,460
Welcome.

365
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,460
Hello.

366
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Do you remember me?

367
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,460
At the meat restaurant.

368
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,460
Of course.

369
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,460
Shaking chopsticks, weak arms,

370
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,460
a bent back because of lack of muscles,

371
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,460
and a skinny, slender body.

372
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,460
I can't forget that.

373
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,460
Is it true?

374
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
You were born with 1.5kg

375
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,460
and you made your body with exercise.

376
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,460
1.5kg.

377
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,460
It was a smaller body than this pink dumbbell.

378
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,460
If I do this, can I lift it like you?

379
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,460
If I can get the exact position,

380
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,460
I can lift it like you.

381
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,460
If I can get the exact position,

382
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,460
I want to be strong like you.

383
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,460
Okay.

384
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,460
But exercise made me stronger than anyone else.

385
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,460
You too, like me...

386
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,460
I don't want to be like you.

387
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,460
I don't want my name to be a mess.

388
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,460
I'm afraid that my name with skinny body

389
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,460
and a slender belly is Kang Cheol-nam.

390
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,460
Don't worry.

391
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,460
I'll make you Iron Man,

392
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,460
the perfect body for Kang Cheol-nam.

393
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,460
But I'm scared.

394
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,460
I won't hurt you.

395
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,460
Someone is staring at me.

396
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Let's do burpees.

397
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,460
Burpees are good exercise

398
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,460
that makes your whole body strong.

399
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,460
Breathe enough.

400
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,460
If I say, one, you can come up.

401
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,460
One, one.

402
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,460
Sir, you shouldn't lie down. You should get up.

403
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,460
I know, but I have a laryngitis.

404
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
Give me some time.

405
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,460
Laryngitis again?

406
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,460
Open your eyes.

407
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,460
Our body strength comes from our lower body,

408
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,460
especially from our thighs.

409
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Lift your legs slowly.

410
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,460
One, one.

411
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Is this right?

412
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
Is this right?

413
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,460
Come down.

414
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,460
What should I do?

415
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,460
I'm scared.

416
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,460
Give me a hug.

417
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,460
I'm scared.

418
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,460
Let's go to the next machine.

419
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,460
Oh, my.

420
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,460
Oh, my.

421
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,460
I can't hear the sound of the window.

422
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,460
Oh, my. Look at this.

423
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,460
It smells good from the towel.

424
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,460
Oh, my.

425
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,460
Oh, my.

426
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Oh, my.

427
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,460
Oh, my.

428
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,460
Hello. Hello.

429
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,460
Do you exercise comfortably?

430
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,460
Yes, yes.

431
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,460
Yes, I know.

432
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,460
I think I've seen him somewhere.

433
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,460
Well,

434
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,460
he's not the one who does mukbang with her husband on YouTube.

435
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,460
He's the one who does mukbang with her husband on YouTube.

436
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,460
So small.

437
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,460
So small.

438
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,460
Let's go.

439
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,460
It's fun.

440
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,460
Oh, my.

441
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,460
He's so kind and nice.

442
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,460
When I was with you,

443
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,460
you couldn't take your phone out of your eyes.

444
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
Why are you chewing on it?

445
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,460
Why? What is it? What is it?

446
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,460
Why are you explaining it to me? Why?

447
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
Oh, my.

448
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,460
Hey, why are you driving like that?

449
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
Are you crazy to die?

450
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,460
Oh, my.

451
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,460
Are you all right?

452
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,460
Are you all right?

453
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,460
I stood.

454
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,460
I stood alone.

455
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
Squats are a very helpful exercise

456
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,460
to strengthen the core and strengthen the whole body.

457
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,460
It's a good exercise to stand up

458
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,460
and strengthen your body.

459
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,460
The reason why you made it an exercise

460
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,460
is not because of your clothes, but because it's inside your body.

461
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,460
Wow, you're really good at it.

462
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,460
Oh, my.

463
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,460
You're strong.

464
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,460
It's a good exercise.

465
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,460
Wow, it's so cool.

466
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,460
Wow, it's so cool.

467
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,460
Oh, my.

468
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,460
But, honey,

469
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,460
are you going to go practice right after eating ramen?

470
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,460
Why?

471
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,460
Should I practice something else instead of going?

472
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
What kind of practice?

473
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,460
Practice like this?

474
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,460
Hi.

475
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,460
Hey!

476
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Oh, my.

477
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
Hi, Choyeon.

478
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,460
Why are you coming in all of a sudden?

479
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
Then why are you coming into my house?

480
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,460
Push it.

481
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,460
What?

482
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,460
Push it.

483
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,460
What a mess.

484
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,460
You can't push it, can you?

485
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,460
What?

486
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,460
Did you miss the key?

487
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
What are you doing?

488
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,460
Let me push it for you.

489
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,460
Oh, yes.

490
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,460
Let go.

491
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,460
What?

492
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,460
You can't push it, can you?

493
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
Yes.

494
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,460
Come on in.

495
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,460
Yes.

496
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,460
I fell today.

497
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,460
What?

498
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,460
I fell down today, but I stood alone.

499
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,460
What are you doing? Tell me clearly.

500
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,460
I'm not the one who stands up, I'm the one who stands alone.

501
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,460
I'm the one who stands alone.

502
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,460
I love you.

503
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,460
I was supposed to get my refund,

504
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,460
but if I were to work out again,

505
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,460
the gym would be so laughing.

506
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,460
Is this the only gym?

507
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
I'll go somewhere else.

508
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
But this place is more comfortable

509
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,460
than the new one.

510
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,460
I'm so embarrassed.

511
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,460
I can't do it.

512
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,460
I'm so embarrassed.

513
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,460
Are you an athlete?

514
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,460
Just looking at your back,

515
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,460
I can tell that you're an athlete.

516
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,460
Am I an athlete?

517
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,460
Of course.

518
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,460
I can tell.

519
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,460
Wait a minute.

520
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,460
I'm two o'clock and you're three o'clock.

521
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,460
Do you want to work out with me today?

522
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,460
You can go out for free.

523
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,460
Free?

524
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,460
Yes, free.

525
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,460
I'll make time for you.

526
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,460
Let's go.

527
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,460
Okay.

528
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,460
It's been less than a week since we opened.

529
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,460
Turn down the music.

530
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,460
The music will explode.

531
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,460
The equipment is new, I'm new,

532
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,460
the members are new,

533
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,460
everybody is new.

534
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,460
It's amazing.

535
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,460
New, new.

536
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,460
But you're amazing.

537
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,460
You're a student,

538
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,460
you don't have time,

539
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,460
you're an athlete.

540
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,460
I'm a student?

541
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,460
Aren't you a high school student?

542
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,460
I was a high school student.

543
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,460
A long time ago.

544
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,460
You're lying.

545
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,460
I thought you were a student.

546
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,460
I've never heard that before.

547
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,460
Anyway, we don't have time,

548
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,460
so let's start working out.

549
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,460
Baby.

550
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
Okay.

551
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,460
Let's start with the pretty white

552
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,460
that suits you.

553
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
Let's start with 1kg.

554
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,460
Hold it.

555
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,460
1kg?

556
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,460
No, it's 5kg.

557
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,460
Isn't it too heavy from the start?

558
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,460
It's not the dumbbell that's heavy,

559
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,460
it's your body.

560
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,460
You can do it.

561
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,460
You don't know it by yourself, do you?

562
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Let's go.

563
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,460
It's heavy.

564
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,460
It was really heavy.

565
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,460
Yes, I think I've done this before.

566
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,460
Five, yes, good.

567
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,460
Six, great.

568
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,460
You have a great posture.

569
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,460
Why are you complimenting me

570
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,460
in between the numbers?

571
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,460
Stop, stop.

572
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,460
You're making the compliment members leave.

573
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,460
There's nothing to criticize.

574
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
Nine.

575
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
It's already five?

576
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,460
Please, just count it in the right posture.

577
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
That's right.

578
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,460
Put it down.

579
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,460
Already?

580
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,460
Why? Does it hurt?

581
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,460
No.

582
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460
Stop?

583
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,460
Was the heat really the last one?

584
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,460
I said I'd do up to 10,

585
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,460
and I did one more, one more,

586
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,460
and I had to cool it down to 15.

587
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,460
Isn't that the rule?

588
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,460
I'll go get some water.

589
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,460
Yes, yes, go ahead.

590
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,460
This way.

591
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,460
Yes.

592
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,460
Yes.

593
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,460
Sir, when you go in,

594
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,460
you have to go in the lunge position.

595
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,460
The lunge position doesn't get out of hand.

596
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,460
Sit deeper, deeper.

597
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,460
Come in.

598
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,460
I'm dead.

599
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,460
You don't go in.

600
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,460
Isn't it natural to tell them to go in the lunge position

601
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,460
when they go in for water?

602
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,460
Is it the same?

603
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,460
The members are playing,

604
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,460
why are you playing too?

605
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,460
You did two.

606
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,460
Here.

607
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,460
Please sign here.

608
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,460
Sign?

609
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,460
Yes.

610
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,460
That's it for today.

611
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,460
See you next time.

612
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
Already?

613
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,460
Yes, it's been an hour.

614
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,460
I guess you didn't know

615
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,460
that it was going to be too fun.

616
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,460
The concentration is the best.

617
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,460
I agree.

618
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,460
Anyway, thank you.

619
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
See you tomorrow.

620
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
Baby.

621
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,460
Hye-won.

622
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,460
You didn't lose any weight.

623
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,460
You look like you're getting more belly fat.

624
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,460
Isn't the PT supposed to be

625
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,460
until Hye-won falls down?

626
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,460
What is this uncomfortable feeling?

627
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,460
I worked out,

628
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,460
but my legs are not flabby.

629
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,460
My armpits are very soft.

630
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,460
I feel very bad.

631
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,460
It's the order of the order.

632
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,460
I saw that you have a lot of energy left.

633
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,460
Raise your arms.

634
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,460
What is this?

635
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,460
I got a call.

636
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,460
Why are you so nervous?

637
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,460
I'm going to post it.

638
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,460
I'm going to post it.

639
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
I'm going to post it.

640
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,460
I'm scared.

641
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,460
I'm scared.

642
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,460
I'm alive.

643
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,460
Hye-won is alive.

644
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,460
I'm going to die.

645
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,460
I'm going to die.

646
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
What are you doing?

647
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,460
Help me.

648
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,460
Director Do.

649
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,460
Stop it.

650
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,460
You'll get me in trouble.

651
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,460
That director is so kind to the members.

652
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,460
I'm kind, too.

653
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,460
What?

654
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
The shoulders of the member.

655
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
I'm saying, hurray.

656
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
Hurray.

657
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,460
I'm going to do overhead press from now on.

658
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,460
15 sets of three.

659
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,460
Start.

660
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,460
It's not time to press.

661
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,460
I'm going to die.

662
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,460
Yes, you punk.

663
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
10kg.

664
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,460
You ate a lot.

665
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,460
Pant.

666
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,460
Pant.

667
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,460
Is this that heavy?

668
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,460
Are you okay?

669
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,460
A little.

670
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,460
It was light, but it wasn't as light as sadness.

671
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Don't do it.

672
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,460
It's a hit.

673
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,460
Give it to me.

674
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,460
Wait a minute.

675
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,460
Can you tell when it is?

676
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,460
Shut up.

677
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,460
You should be the one who hits it.

678
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,460
Stop it.

679
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,460
Sir, do you have a cigarette?

680
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,460
No, I don't.

681
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,460
You don't have a cigarette.

682
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,460
Take it with you if you give me a cigarette.

683
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,460
I'm sorry.

684
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
Are you okay?

685
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,460
Are you okay?

686
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,460
Where did you go after you hit your member?

687
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,460
You almost got in trouble.

688
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,460
I did it alone.

689
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,460
No, this is our responsibility.

690
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,460
No, I did it alone.

691
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,460
Don't get too angry.

692
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
I'm sorry.

693
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,460
This is the deep smell of emptiness.

694
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,460
This is the smell of being in a place

695
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,460
that is deep in the stomach when you are empty for more than 18 hours.

696
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,460
The members' breath smells like nothing.

697
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,460
Sir.

698
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,460
You didn't keep the diet I gave you, did you?

699
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,460
I ate vitamins and I was full.

700
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,460
That's hot.

701
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,460
What's wrong?

702
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,460
Sir, here's some protein.

703
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,460
I can't do this.

704
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,460
Here goes the protein plane.

705
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,460
What are you going to do?

706
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,460
Tell me what you want to eat.

707
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
I want to eat that.

708
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,460
It's my first time having a problem.

709
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,460
I want to eat something.

710
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,460
Sir.

711
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,460
What brings you here?

712
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,460
I'm not your member anymore.

713
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,460
Please help me.

714
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,460
I'm sorry.

715
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,460
I'm sorry.

716
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,460
I'm sorry.

717
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,460
Please help me.

718
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,460
I need you to find something for me.

719
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,460
What do you need me to find?

720
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,460
Oh, my goodness.

721
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,460
My appetite.

722
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,460
This is weird.

723
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,460
I'm worried because I gained weight just by drinking water.

724
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,460
And you're worried because you didn't gain weight no matter how much you drank.

725
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,460
You didn't drink water.

726
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,460
And you didn't eat much either.

727
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,460
But it's okay.

728
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,460
I have a secret weapon.

729
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,460
A secret weapon?

730
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,460
I didn't know you'd put this in here.

731
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,460
What is this?

732
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,460
It's a map of the food I collected myself.

733
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,460
Map of the food?

734
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:59,460
A map of my own restaurant that I marked on each visit by myself.

735
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:05,460
From now on, we're going to find Cheolnam's lost appetite through this map of the food.

736
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,460
Operation meat-sucking.

737
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,460
Operation meat-sucking?

738
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,460
Shall we go conquer the land first?

739
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,460
Meat is meat no matter what.

740
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,460
It's my first time, so I chose this place where I can give a lot of variations of taste.

741
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:29,460
Jokbal is a variety of flavors that can be chosen with the front and back feet.

742
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:35,460
First, try a boiled jokbal with a shrimp sauce.

743
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:41,460
When the jokbal is soaked in the chewy texture, the shrimp adds a sense of presence and adds a salty taste to the sea.

744
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,460
Now, try it.

745
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,460
It looks delicious.

746
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,460
It's the taste that makes me dance.

747
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,460
Cheolnam, you're eating well.

748
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,460
You're talented.

749
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,460
Aren't you on a diet right now?

750
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,460
I'm on a diet.

751
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,460
I don't think I can do it anymore. My stomach is already full.

752
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:33,460
But it's okay. This time, I'm going to fill up something else.

753
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,460
Something else?

754
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,460
Didn't you say you'd fill up something else?

755
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,460
This is filling up your heart.

756
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,460
Look at this.

757
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,460
Look at the open sea and take a bite.

758
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,460
Look at the red dust and take a bite.

759
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,460
Take a bite.

760
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,460
I'm tired anymore.

761
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:02,460
Cheolnam, when you can't eat anymore, take another bite.

762
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,460
Then your stomach will grow.

763
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,460
I don't think I can lift it up anymore.

764
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,460
When I lift one more, it's like my muscles are getting bigger.

765
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,460
Bingo!

766
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,460
You're so good.

767
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,460
I'm going to eat it.

768
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,460
Cheolnam, with this.

769
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,460
You two can't eat chili paste, right?

770
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,460
Do you know how bad the constipation is?

771
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,460
Okay, let's eat this.

772
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,460
Oh, chili paste.

773
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,460
Cheolnam, you can't drink soda right now.

774
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,460
I can't digest it.

775
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,460
Okay, I got it.

776
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,460
Then shall we go eat real digestive medicine?

777
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,460
It's heaven's food.

778
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,460
Heaven's food?

779
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,460
Shall we go eat real digestive medicine?

780
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,460
It's heaven's food.

781
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,460
What?

782
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,460
Is that heaven's food?

783
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,460
If you eat sweets, you feel like you're flying in the sky.

784
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,460
That's because insulin, which causes blood sugar spikes, is thin.

785
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,460
Is insulin thin?

786
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,460
Yes.

787
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,460
What do you mean thin?

788
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,460
I feel thin like this.

789
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,460
Eat it.

790
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,460
Excessive liquid is the worst.

791
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,460
Let go of your hand.

792
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,460
What are you doing?

793
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,460
I'm in class. Let go of this.

794
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,460
Let go of your hand.

795
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,460
Let go of your hand.

796
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,460
What are you doing?

797
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,460
Open your eyes.

798
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,460
Open your eyes pretty.

799
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,460
It's pretty. How can I open it?

800
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,460
I can't see it like that.

801
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,460
Oh, my God.

802
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,460
Actor!

803
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,460
It's okay.

804
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,460
Oh, I'm dead.

805
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,460
Oh, I shouldn't die.

806
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,460
Call 911, please.

807
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,460
Actor.

808
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,460
It's acute insomnia.

809
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,460
Please take care of your water intake and nerves so that it doesn't degrade.

810
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,460
You can leave if you get all the water.

811
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,460
Thank you.

812
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,460
Oh, my God.

813
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,460
I'm sorry. I overreacted because of me.

814
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,460
It's not your fault.

815
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,460
It's because my body is like yours.

816
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,460
Oh, my God.

817
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,460
I'll be back soon if I recover and exercise.

818
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,460
Yes, I'll be back.

819
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,460
I'll be back as a weak and skinny body.

820
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,460
This is the reason for a skinny man.

821
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,460
It's not like I'm going through it for the first time.

822
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:17,460
But I wanted to change this time.

823
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:23,460
There's a truck parking next to my cafe.

824
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,460
Sir.

825
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,460
You can't park here.

826
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,460
Sir.

827
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,460
You can't park here.

828
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,460
Oh, I'm sorry.

829
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:38,460
But as soon as I saw my body, he changed his attitude.

830
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,460
Then where should I park my car?

831
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,460
Oh, here's the public parking lot.

832
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,460
Where do I park my car if no one can do it?

833
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,460
It's just for a moment.

834
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:51,460
Okay?

835
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,460
It's just for a moment.

836
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:59,460
One day, two days, and a few weeks.

837
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,460
Now even if there's a parking lot in another place,

838
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,460
they block our store from opening.

839
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,460
Do you understand?

840
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,460
It's the easiest and weakest.

841
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,460
That's why you have to get stronger.

842
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:15,460
I was born with 1.5kg and I was able to have this body with exercise.

843
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,460
No, I don't think I can.

844
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:26,460
Nothing changes even if you try.

845
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,460
I always fell off that bus.

846
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:33,460
If you turn here, you turn here, and if you turn there, you turn there.

847
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:37,460
But not long ago, the bus was emergency, and I was the only one standing.

848
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,460
Everyone else fell, but I was the only one standing.

849
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,460
I realized it when I was alone.

850
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,460
My body was changing without me knowing.

851
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:52,460
I'm sure your body is changing too, just like me.

852
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:23,460
I'll tell them.

853
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:29,460
I told you not to park the store!

854
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:39,460
What is it?

855
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:49,460
Oh, sir?

856
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,460
Our body remembers us.

857
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:22,460
I'll make constant efforts to lift the bar.

858
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,460
It's parking right now.

859
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:34,460
It's not moving even if you're standing there.

860
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,460
I think I need to stop him.

861
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:57,460
I'll take it out.

862
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,460
You can take it out.

863
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:11,460
Take it out!

864
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,460
Why did you put that stone in?

865
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,460
I was surprised because I thought I was breaking my head.

866
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,460
I'm going to put it in because it's a little steep here.

867
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,460
It's dangerous if the car is pushed.

868
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:34,460
You're a nice person even in the middle.

869
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,460
I'll start working out again when I get my pedal.

870
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:44,460
I don't know when it will be, but I'll keep being like the director.

871
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:54,460
Let's go!

872
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,460
I think Cheollam is amazing.

873
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,460
It wouldn't have been easy to be brave.

874
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,460
Thanks to the chairman.

875
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:07,460
Thank you.

876
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,460
You're here already.

877
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,460
Excuse me, the chairman...

878
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,460
The chairman...

879
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,460
You go first.

880
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,460
Well...

881
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:25,460
Let's go back to work out together.

882
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,460
What?

883
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:37,460
Baby, did you come to work out?

884
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,460
You started working out somewhere else.

885
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,460
You did a great job.

886
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,460
I just got a new machine.

887
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:50,460
This is supposed to go into the hotel, but I bought it.

888
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,460
Let's go.

889
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,460
I'll go now.

890
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:07,460
Bye.

891
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,460
Don't go.

892
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:19,460
Don't go.

893
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,460
What are you doing?

894
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,460
Let go of me.

895
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,460
You let go.

896
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,460
You let go.

897
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,460
You let go.

898
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:32,460
Today, a mirror with lights will be in the center.

899
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,460
Work out with me and take a picture of your life.

900
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,460
Get more than 22,000 likes.

901
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,460
22,000 likes?

902
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,460
Yes.

903
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,460
Let's go.

904
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,460
Is the gym a photo studio?

905
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,460
No.

906
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:53,460
No?

907
00:52:53,460 --> 00:53:20,240
I can get rid of the fat that's

908
00:53:50,240 --> 00:54:00,240
I'll be right back.

909
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:16,240
I'll go get my sneakers.

910
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,240
I won't count unless it's the right posture.

911
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
One.

912
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,240
One.

913
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,240
One.

914
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,240
Let's move on.

915
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,240
How many times do I have to say one?

916
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,240
Look straight ahead and pull.

917
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,240
One.

918
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,240
One.

919
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:39,240
I shouldn't have come.

920
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,240
Push forward.

921
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:46,240
One.

922
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,240
If Cheon Nam uploaded it, a lot of people would come.

923
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,240
That's not easy.

924
00:54:51,240 --> 00:55:03,240
If you fail again this time, you'll be responsible.

925
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:13,240
What?

926
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:21,240
Here we go.

927
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,240
What's with those faces?

928
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,240
Does anyone who came to work out feel bad?

929
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,240
Yes.

930
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,240
I said about 120,000 members would react.

931
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,240
120,000 members?

932
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,240
Did the fee go up?

933
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,240
Is it 120,000 won?

934
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,240
No, 30,000 won.

935
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,240
Oh, 30,000 won.

936
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,240
If it's 120,000 won, I wouldn't come here.

937
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,240
It's still early morning.

938
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:51,240
Everyone's busy.

939
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,240
I'm going to cry.

940
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,240
Are you coming?

941
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,240
I'm coming.

942
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,240
Come on.

943
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,240
I told you I was coming.

944
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:10,240
Oh, my.

945
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:15,240
We're here.

946
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,240
Oh, my.

947
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,240
Were we waiting for you?

948
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:26,240
Why? Why were you waiting?

949
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,240
You admit it, right?

950
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,240
The membership rule failed.

951
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,240
It's still before work.

952
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:46,240
I admit it's a failure.

953
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:56,240
Oh, my.

954
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:01,240
It's a smurf.

955
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:09,240
No, that's...

956
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,240
I've seen him a lot.

957
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,240
Me, too.

958
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,240
He's the national team's player, Yoon Sung-bin.

959
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:28,240
Iron Man, you have to live 60 to 70 centimeters.

960
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,240
I heard from the cafe owner that this is a good place for the lower body.

961
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,240
Can you do 70 centimeters of thigh?

962
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,240
Yes, I can.

963
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,240
Alex!

964
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:44,240
Come this way.

965
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,240
What's wrong?

966
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:52,240
There's a bug down there.

967
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,240
Oh, it's a shrewd bug.

968
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,240
You're afraid of things like this.

969
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,240
It's so cute.

970
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,240
I'm scared of bugs.

971
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,240
It's safe.

972
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,240
Come down.

973
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,240
Come this way.

974
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,240
Go in.

975
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,240
Go in.

976
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:13,240
You're cute.

977
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,240
It's a success.

978
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:20,240
I just barely passed this month, but I won't ask you to leave.

979
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:26,240
No, you have to go out.

980
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:34,240
What?

981
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:44,240
You want me to leave?

982
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,240
Three.

983
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,240
That's great.

984
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,240
Three.

985
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,240
That's great.

986
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:56,240
Five.

987
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:02,240
You're in there.

988
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,240
One, two, three.

989
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,240
But I can't feel anything.

990
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:14,240
You have to weigh that.

991
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:24,240
Who are you?

992
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:54,240
I want to go to the gym.

993
00:59:54,240 --> 01:00:04,240
I want to go to the gym.

994
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,240
Stop it, Mr. Lu.

995
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,240
Why are you doing this to me?

996
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,240
The trainer is a body.

997
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,240
Who needs more in this gym?

998
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,240
You said you couldn't.

999
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,240
It's too heavy for me.

1000
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,240
Oh, my God.

1001
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,240
Mom's coming.

1002
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,240
You're losing weight.

1003
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,240
Jun Su-hwi is not getting married.

1004
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,240
Jun Su-hwi is nice, so I'll meet you.

1005
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,240
If you were an ordinary man, it would've been over.

1006
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,240
I don't like my mother-in-law and I don't like her.

1007
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,240
Who likes me?

1008
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,240
I wish I had just one person like that.

1009
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:44,240
I don't think I'm that half-lover.
