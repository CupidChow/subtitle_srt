1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Let's go.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Show me how to run.

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,600
Let's go.

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,900
Let's go.

5
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,200
Let's go.

6
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,800
Show me how to run.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What are you doing?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll do an interval training from today.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What's that?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Wait a minute?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's very effective.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is an interval training.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You have to do 60 seconds of running and 60 seconds of rest.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll make a mistake that your body is doing a high-intensity exercise.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now, I have an important appointment.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Please listen.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Didn't you say you had an important appointment?

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The most important appointment is my heart and promise.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, good.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's so delicious.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's a good idea, right?

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, my nose is coming out.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's a good idea.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh, my.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, my.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, my.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How did you overcome the pregnancy?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, yes.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, good job.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Mr. Do was very relieved because Miran wasn't coming out.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think it's a breakup with a lover.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Aren't you two a couple?

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No, that's not it.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, that's not it.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Mom, are you forgetting our past memories?

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I thought you were a drama man.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No, I'm not.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You don't like someone else other than your mom.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I love my sister.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was going to tell my heart in the mirror earlier.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What?

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're the best of mine.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, my.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's a good idea to have a baby.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No, it's not.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, my.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, my.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Who is it?

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think it's the first time I've seen it.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, my.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think I'm going to get a facial mask.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, your waist is this big.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think it's less inside.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, my.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, my.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, my.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't think I've seen it anywhere.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I saw it on TV.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I see.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think I've seen that person somewhere.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What is it?

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What is it?

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What is it?

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a lecture meeting.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why did the influencer with over 1 million followers come all the way here?

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Aren't you curious?

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes, I'm not curious.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why?

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I sent you a DM.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You did well, right?

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's amazing.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's amazing.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Can you tell me that Alex sent you a DM and Kang Seol-hyeon came here?

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What does our health center not make sense?

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Director, I don't know who Kang Seol-hyeon is.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Kang Seol-hyeon is a mega influencer with over 1 million followers.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
1 million!

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Where Kang Seol-hyeon is wearing?

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is the entrance ticket.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Everyone sold out.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Where Kang Seol is going?

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's a hot place.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:06,000
When Kang Seol eats it, it becomes a secret restaurant.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, my God.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What are you doing there?

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey, come here.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you doing in the English language?

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Get out of here.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What?

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, my God.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's paparazzi.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If you use that much influence, you can be sponsored by a very good hotel center.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But why are we in the health center?

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Director, how can I come out?

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, my God.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm so tired.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm so tired.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, my God.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't know why I came here or how I came here, but we have to catch that sash.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is a huge opportunity that the sky gave me.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can't catch it.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why?

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm going to give it to you.

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What do you mean?

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Everyone can't focus on exercise because they're looking at me.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The person who interferes with exercise can't be left in the health center.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Then, please go out.

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The director is the most disturbed.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Chairman.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is there a lot of music here?

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Kang Su-ae.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't know what you're thinking about, but this is not where you are.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Attention!

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Everyone pays attention.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, my God.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, I'm going to pay attention.

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why, why, why?

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
From now on, I will tell you about the new rules that you have to follow in the health club at 24.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Rules?

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Aren't you saying not to eat?

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
First of all, everyone is forbidden to interfere with other people's exercise.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The distance between a fancy top, a fancy high, and a fancy makeup is very far.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This new health center is a sports center.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's not a fashion store.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you don't want to, go out right now.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No, this is not a high school in the 70s.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There's a complex.

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I like the bright color.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a cool summer.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I heard that the director only looks at the body and muscles.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I guess you're more concerned about something else.

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
People here don't seem to be interested in other people's fashion.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What does it matter if you wear this or that when you exercise?

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You could be a little more interested in fashion.

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You're making a fuss.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Next!

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In the health club, it is forbidden to interfere with other people's exercise.

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Is there anyone like that?

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm not.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm not either.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Then...

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm not either.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Then who are you talking about?

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I...

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Me?

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hey, you're the director.

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Is there anyone with a personal feelings?

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No, I'm not.

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Stop it.

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What kind of a person is that?

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What's wrong with you?

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's go inside.

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's okay.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What are you doing?

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm really...

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I know what you want to say.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm Anna's brother.

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's PT time.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Shall we go to exercise?

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Director Do Hyun-joon?

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
First, we'll do a deadlift.

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Deadlift...

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It means you're pulling something.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's romantic.

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The deadlift I'm doing is not romantic.

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Let's start.

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
One!

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Two!

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Three!

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes!

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Make the posture accurate! One more time!

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Kang Sol.

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't know why you're here, but I can't come out of my gym again.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm going to make you hurt.

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The hurtful thing you gave me.

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's break up.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
One more time!

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Live your life alone with a heart that's not useless.

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Two!

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
One, two, three!

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Three!

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Four!

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Director Do Hyun-joon!

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You can't do a deadlift because of her.

198
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Five!

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If it's hard to follow, it's better to give up here.

200
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This is the beginning.

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No, it's too good.

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's more than expected.

203
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think you did a good job.

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What are you thinking about?

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm so happy to see you have a granddaughter.

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You look good together.

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You're so bad at it.

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What's wrong?

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's wrong?

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's not good to have a recommendation.

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm screwed.

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I want to eat tteokbokki.

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Suddenly?

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Always always always always always.

215
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hello.

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This is your house.

217
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm just going to go in.

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Hello, I'm here at the convenience store.

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Welcome to my house.

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Hello, Cha-young.

221
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Thanks to you, I'm safe.

222
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's a relief.

223
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What are you doing?

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Interval.

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What is that?

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It makes my body mistaken.

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm eating tteokbokki right now, but I'm eating salad.

228
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Your body is making you mistaken.

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What are you talking about?

230
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I was in the rolling machine for an interview today.

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Even though I didn't pull the rolling machine, my heart rate is so high.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It was quite effective.

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So I'm going to apply it to the restaurant.

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Honey.

235
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes?

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Are you stupid?

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I think I'm just a pig.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hey, you little bastard.

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Do you want to see a pig?

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Thank you.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's really swollen.

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I guess the restaurant doesn't have an interview.

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What's that from the morning?

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Director Kwon?

245
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No.

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I know.

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Who likes to go to the dentist?

248
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You look good.

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What is it?

250
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Wait.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What is it?

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Hold on.

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's okay.

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're a fan of dust, so you keep getting dust in your eyes.

255
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You're not in yet.

256
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Don't overdo it.

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why are you so mean?

258
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I know you don't look good with 24 hours.

259
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Listen to me, please.

260
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Mungwon.

261
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Roy.

262
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
My name is Roy.

263
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Mungwon.

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The one who doesn't look good is you and Roy.

265
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay?

266
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm going to work out.

267
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Bye.

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What do you think you're doing?

269
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You're going to be so angry.

270
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Director, good morning.

271
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes.

272
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Start working out with a squat 50.

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What do you mean by working out with a squat 50?

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Then what is tteokbokki you eat before you eat salad?

275
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What?

276
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
How can I...

277
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hold on.

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The right side is the chair and the left side is the shit.

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Didn't you say you only ate salad for me?

280
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Are you crazy?

281
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I did a test.

282
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm not sure if you can get used to the interview.

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm serious.

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Squat 70.

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
70.

286
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
50.

287
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't think about losing weight.

288
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You're a fool.

289
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm going to work out.

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I can see everything from here.

291
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I like your eyes.

292
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's 2.0.

293
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
2.0.

294
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Sit deeper.

295
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Sit deeper.

296
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What?

297
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Please.

306
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I saw it.

307
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Did you see it?

308
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Was that picture accurate?

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Stop.

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It burst my ranking.

311
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Gosh.

312
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I should probably go to the other room.

313
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Kang So-hyun, what are you doing?

314
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You're going to make all my members on your side?

315
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
How can you be so hard on me?

316
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's okay. I didn't see anything. Really.

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Really?

318
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Of course.

319
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh, thank god.

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But I guess you like the cat character, right?

321
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, you're good.

322
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Don't worry. I'm the only one who saw it. Really.

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But that's a relief.

324
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I bought a cute panty today.

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I really like a love panty.

326
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I forgot about the love panty that I heard in the hole on this day.

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Really?

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm so glad you didn't.

329
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, is it too much?

330
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
No.

331
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's so cool.

332
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Why are you so good at that?

333
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You can't do anything.

334
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What do you do if you're already ruined?

335
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I can't turn back time.

336
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll give you this leggings even if I don't have time.

337
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm so grateful.

338
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's okay.

339
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm giving it as a gift.

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No, leggings look expensive.

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I have to give it back.

342
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Well, if it's a little too much to just buy it, you can just be friends.

343
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Friends?

344
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes, we're friends from today.

345
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Do you do anything?

346
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What do you do?

347
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
About eye-tickling?

348
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What is it? Why are there so many followers?

349
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You were a very famous person.

350
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh, I saw it somewhere.

351
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I saw it here.

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, do you like Kang Seol, too?

353
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No, he's very famous.

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Of course. He's the most famous person these days.

355
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Kang Seol's clothes and food are all my wannabe.

356
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I want to see him in person.

357
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What?

358
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What?

359
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Did Kang Seol follow you first?

360
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes, she already did.

361
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No, why?

362
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Why are you following me, Kang Seol, the human Kang Seol?

363
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Go to the gym.

364
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No matter what.

365
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Mi-ran, come here a little bit.

366
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Don't be late and come here.

367
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, my.

368
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What?

369
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Why is this person in our gym?

370
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What?

371
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, my.

372
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, my friend.

373
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Wait a minute.

374
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll open it for you.

375
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Oh, my.

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh, my.

377
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You were there last time, right?

378
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Wait, wait, wait.

379
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's a special force if you have a weapon. I know it.

380
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You know it?

381
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Get off.

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Get off.

383
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Get off the dangerous thing.

384
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh, my.

385
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What's wrong?

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Raise your hand.

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I know it.

388
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Move.

389
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Smile.

390
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I was going to the police station because of me.

392
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No, I didn't pay the price today. It's okay.

393
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What?

394
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And the one who saved me was Sol.

395
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You're really good at fighting. What's this?

396
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I've done a lot of fighting.

397
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, my.

398
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Here you go.

399
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Thank you.

400
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Be careful.

401
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yes.

402
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Enjoy your meal.

403
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yes.

404
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But is this okay?

405
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I wanted to buy you something delicious.

406
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Don't say that.

407
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:58,000
There's nothing more delicious than this in the world.

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's delicious.

409
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But don't you think it's a little boring to eat this?

410
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
One drink.

411
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Cheers.

412
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But it's really amazing.

413
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What?

414
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm eating with Sol.

415
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I was sent to the health club at 24 o'clock.

416
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Me?

417
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
On the day I was bullied and bullied by my boyfriend on the street, it was my worst day in my life.

418
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But Sol sent me to the health center.

419
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Your ending is not here.

420
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You can change your life, too.

421
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Of course, I saw you drunk and drunk.

422
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you.

423
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I guess it was fate.

424
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What?

425
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm a friend like this.

426
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's salty.

427
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Why is it so sweet today?

428
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But I think I'm the only one who's drunk.

429
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's okay.

430
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Milan is cute, too.

431
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Thank you.

432
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm not really hoping for a big thing.

433
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm not as much as I love you.

434
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm just asking if you can like me as much as you like.

435
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I know you well.

436
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Sol?

437
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I don't think Sol had anything like that.

438
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Who?

439
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Who can be like Kang Sol?

440
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I have.

441
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You're crazy, Il Chi-kwang.

442
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Hurry up and try it.

443
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sorry, but I'll just take it.

444
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Why?

445
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I had something to fight.

446
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Who?

447
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It was someone who didn't even care about me for a single time.

448
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm embarrassed.

449
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'll be right out.

450
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Where are you going?

451
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Oppa.

452
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What's more important than me is your body.

453
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oppa, what should we do after the competition?

454
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Do you have anything you want to eat?

455
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Well, now I have to.

456
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Do you know it's my birthday today?

457
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's go eat seasoned ribs today.

458
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Huh?

459
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm going to eat seasoned ribs with you today.

460
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay.

461
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You eat seasoned ribs.

462
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'll eat it with the pork chop.

463
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I knew it then.

464
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I can't be the first place for him forever.

465
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Live your life alone with a wide heart without a use.

466
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's why you hurt him on purpose.

467
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
With the word that hurts him the most.

468
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So that the heart of that man hurts.

469
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Well, I don't know if it hurt, but...

470
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Anyway, don't ever meet a guy who works out.

471
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You know how your heart is stimulated.

472
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
People who don't know about women's heart pain.

473
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You bad guy.

474
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Break your heart.

475
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Like this.

476
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
No, like this.

477
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What's wrong, director?

478
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I love the heart.

479
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
What?

480
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Oh, what's wrong with you?

481
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Why?

482
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Did you drink and get into an accident again?

483
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Did you hurt your tongue?

484
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm full before I drank.

485
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Then what's wrong?

486
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What did you do after drinking?

487
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's delicious.

488
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Excuse me.

489
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Do you want to go on a blind date tomorrow?

490
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I just remembered someone who posted it on Miran.

491
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Don't lie.

492
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You really don't?

493
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Really?

494
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You haven't called yet?

495
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What?

496
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'll call you right away.

497
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm full!

498
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm going on a blind date.

499
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
What?

500
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
A blind date?

501
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I was going to see you today.

502
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I really don't want to go.

503
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I can't drink. I have to clean up.

504
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
What is it?

505
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I smell alcohol.

506
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh, it's me.

507
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I smell...

508
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's the best to have a small heart.

509
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Oh, until the 27th?

510
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh, okay.

511
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Thank you.

512
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I think my heart is beating a bit these days.

513
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm massaging.

514
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Where are you coming in?

515
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Why can't you go in?

516
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's a place for our gym and our members to use.

517
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Get out of here.

518
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Really?

519
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Then I'll just be here to see you.

520
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'll do it.

521
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Here's the membership.

522
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I think Hyo-ri will come here often, too.

523
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
What are you doing?

524
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I don't have a card.

525
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
We only register monthly.

526
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
One month?

527
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
200,000 won.

528
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's 30,000 won.

529
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
To be properly registered, one year is...

530
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I should register.

531
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
One year?

532
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Why not?

533
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
How long should I let you go?

534
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Wait a minute.

535
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's...

536
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Okay, please do it.

537
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
What?

538
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
One ten.

539
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
One ten.

540
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
One ten.

541
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Okay?

542
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
One ten.

543
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Thank you.

544
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But the card name is Lee Bong-won.

545
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Who is Lee Bong-won?

546
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Stop.

547
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yes.

548
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Thank you.

549
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Now that I'm here, did I have the right to talk to you?

550
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I don't know what you're thinking about, but stop right now.

551
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't think you're going to worry about that.

552
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Are you embarrassed?

553
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I couldn't even pose because of the woman on an important day.

554
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Please sign here.

555
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I've cut it off with 200,000 won.

556
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
240,000 won.

557
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's 242,000 won in December.

558
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Sorry.

559
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I gave you a service for the towel and sports uniform.

560
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yes.

561
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Welcome, madam.

562
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Have a good time.

563
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay.

564
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Don't hurt me anymore.

565
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
If you don't want to be a mousse again.

566
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
See you later.

567
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yes.

568
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Goodbye.

569
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Goodbye.

570
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:53,000
What's wrong?

571
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Are you going to the blind date?

572
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Like someone who's going to the library?

573
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I really don't want to go.

574
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
What do you hate so much?

575
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Look.

576
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'll make you pretty.

577
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I hate your makeup.

578
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm going to blind date you.

579
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's okay.

580
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I can't take a break.

581
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
If I take a break, I'll die of love.

582
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You were alive?

583
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Do you know?

584
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You're so handsome, you're nice, and you have a good personality.

585
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Why does that person come out of my blind date?

586
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Don't come out of the blind date.

587
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Stay still.

588
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It's all done.

589
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Just do it.

590
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
How is it?

591
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Isn't it so pretty?

592
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What is this?

593
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's a cute cat.

594
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's not a tiger to live.

595
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You have to go like this.

596
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm so scared.

597
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm sorry.

598
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
No, you have to do this.

599
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I think I'm going to catch a person.

600
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It was almost late because of this.

601
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I think you're going to look good with me.

602
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Oh, oh, let's go.

603
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Hello.

604
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Are you in the right place today?

605
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Oh, yes.

606
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Oh, yes?

607
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You came early.

608
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Did I come a little late?

609
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It's not late, but I didn't come in a second.

610
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
What?

611
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Usually, you come 10 minutes first in this seat.

612
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Oh, yes.

613
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm sorry.

614
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The car is a little blocked when I'm coming.

615
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's not time to go outside.

616
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It's not time to go to work, it's not time to go home, it's not time to have lunch.

617
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
4 o'clock.

618
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
4 o'clock.

619
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yes, yes.

620
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's not blocking.

621
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I guess you really like coffee.

622
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
He's my band.

623
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yes.

624
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So I think I prefer 4 o'clock after Saturday for the time of the blind date.

625
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Why?

626
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I can't even close the car and drink coffee like this and judge.

627
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'll have dinner and find out more about the other person.

628
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Or drink coffee and break up neatly.

629
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Oh, oh.

630
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You're so...

631
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You're a manager.

632
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What's the manager?

633
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Oh, I guess you were a British scholar.

634
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm a major.

635
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh, you're a major.

636
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Do you order a drink?

637
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
What?

638
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It says 1 and 1 and 1.

639
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
1 and 1 and 1.

640
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I already ordered a manor.

641
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Oh, a manor?

642
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Oh, yes.

643
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yes, yes.

644
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Hello.

645
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm Park Jung-han, a friend of Sol.

646
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm here to see you today.

647
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
What?

648
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You're here to see me today?

649
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Awesome.

650
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Awesome.

651
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Awesome.

652
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm a little late, right?

653
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Who are you?

654
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm sorry.

655
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I think I had a plan today.

656
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Oh, thank God.

657
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I haven't ordered a drink yet.

658
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It says 1 and 1 and 1 here.

659
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh, really?

660
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yes.

661
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'll buy it for you.

662
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
No, no.

663
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Yes, over there.

664
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Bye.

665
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Fighting.

666
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Bye.

667
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm sorry I'm late today.

668
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's my first time here, so I'm not on the right track.

669
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
No, you might be. It's okay.

670
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What is it?

671
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Why is a fine guy coming out of the blind date?

672
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It says this place is famous for cakes.

673
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Try it.

674
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh, yes.

675
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I thought you were ordering a chocolate cake.

676
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's not latte, it's just for eating.

677
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Chocolate cake goes well with Americano.

678
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
What?

679
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Would you like to change mine?

680
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
No, no, no, no, no.

681
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I like latte.

682
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It's going to be more delicious.

683
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yes.

684
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
What?

685
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Why are you so sensitive?

686
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Let's go.

687
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Are you uncomfortable?

688
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Well...

689
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I guess my body has been weak these days.

690
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
When I eat sweets, I get a little stiff.

691
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I guess you should go to the dentist.

692
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Do you have a dentist's insurance?

693
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Yes, that's right.

694
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
This time, it's a dental insurance.

695
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm getting older, so the dentist is not afraid of treatment.

696
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's afraid of treatment.

697
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So I...

698
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Jeonghan, I have a dental insurance.

699
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
What?

700
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
There are all kinds of dental insurance, dental insurance, and dental insurance.

701
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You've already heard all the insurance and you're diligent.

702
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
If you have a good product, please introduce me to one.

703
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I was looking into it.

704
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I really wanted to get a recommendation, but it worked out well.

705
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
What?

706
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Shall we get up now?

707
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I made a reservation near the restaurant.

708
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Restaurant?

709
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
We have to eat something delicious together to open our hearts.

710
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Let's go.

711
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'll take care of it.

712
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
What time is it?

713
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Why are you taking it out?

714
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Thank you.

715
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm sorry.

716
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Don't be too focused on your self-care.

717
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm so nervous.

718
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Oh, my God.

719
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Hey, look at the camera.

720
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Okay.

721
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Oh, my God.

722
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Oh, my God.

723
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Where are you?

724
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Hurry up and tell me.

725
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Hurry up and tell me.

726
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Thank you.

727
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Hey, where did you come from?

728
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm worried about you.

729
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So did you eat something delicious?

730
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What did you eat?

731
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Did you have a lucky day from today?

732
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm also a brother now.

733
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
What brother?

734
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I ate a lot.

735
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Then you can choose.

736
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So I said, let's meet again next time.

737
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I don't know.

738
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's a little weird.

739
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Why?

740
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm going to eat dinner with you.

741
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's all cooked.

742
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Enjoy your meal.

743
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Enjoy your meal.

744
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It looks really good.

745
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Eat it.

746
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Eat it.

747
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I can't eat it today.

748
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'll get it.

749
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'll get it.

750
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But I dropped the spoon after eating and went to the table.

751
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That's like a nail on your ankle.

752
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It looked like a crime scene.

753
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Were you a criminal?

754
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Are you okay?

755
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,000
What's that on your ankle?

756
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
What's that?

757
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
What's that?

758
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Wait a minute.

759
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
This is a swimming pool locker.

760
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
What kind of swimming pool locker does it look like?

761
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I was nervous about the blind date today, so I forgot to wear a sportswear.

762
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
If I hadn't told you, I would have been in the car.

763
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You really solved it.

764
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I heard you were learning swimming.

765
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I even saw your hair.

766
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's weird.

767
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
It's a little weird, right?

768
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You brought ten of the locker.

769
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You were a criminal.

770
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm not sure.

771
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You can't swim.

772
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I can tell you how to swim.

773
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Then it'll work.

774
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But the weird thing is that something urgent happened.

775
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm going to go to my studio for a while.

776
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
What? You're going to the studio from the first meeting?

777
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
This is totally a player.

778
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So? Did you follow me?

779
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yes, I did.

780
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It was a little scary.

781
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It was dark.

782
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
What's that?

783
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I didn't even hear a big sound.

784
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I couldn't hear it outside.

785
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh, my gosh.

786
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Were you surprised?

787
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
No.

788
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Mi-ran.

789
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Why are you...

790
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I have something prepared for you.

791
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But you don't have a pen.

792
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's a strange thing.

793
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Wait a minute. What's that in your hand?

794
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
A little long and shiny?

795
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Knife! Knife!

796
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It doesn't hurt. What is it?

797
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's all flowers.

798
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The only one who doesn't come on Saturday.

799
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I just bought it.

800
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's warm.

801
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I just bought soy sauce.

802
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I like gochujang.

803
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The food I like the most is...

804
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Bingo!

805
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's weird.

806
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I think he's a good guy.

807
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It doesn't feel right with me.

808
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I don't have anything to pull.

809
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm not good at pulling or pulling.

810
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I can't listen to you anymore.

811
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
What?

812
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Are you still Jun-seok?

813
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Are you crazy?

814
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Then?

815
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Are you a guy who likes someone else?

816
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Then why are you doing this?

817
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Unnie, don't catch a useless guy.

818
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Don't take care of him.

819
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Okay. Let's find out.

820
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Miran, how was the blind date today?

821
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Jeong-an said she really liked you.

822
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I think we've met a few times.

823
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Jeong-an is a really good person.

824
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yes. Thank you, Sol.

825
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Don't hurt me anymore. Let's do it right away.

826
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
If you don't want to be a heart that can't be used again...

827
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
What is this?

828
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I'll guess it right.

829
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
This is the sound of your muscles.

830
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
No, this is the sound of your cold water.

831
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
What is this?

832
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
What is this?

833
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
What is this?

834
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Oh, this is the sound of your muscles.

835
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
No, this is the sound of your cold water.

836
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Have this. It's water.

837
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I don't need it.

838
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Are you cold?

839
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
No.

840
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh, my. The boiler is too old. It's completely broken.

841
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's old, so there's no part. You just have to replace it.

842
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Oh, I mean...

843
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'll just put the boiler on.

844
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Yes, I think that's what I should do.

845
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The cold water is the help of the construction site.

846
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Please replace it. You can change it right away, right?

847
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Then I'll start the construction today.

848
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Yes, thank you.

849
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Thank you.

850
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
No, sir. If you start the construction like this...

851
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's okay, sir.

852
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
This time, thanks to the director of the construction site,

853
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
there are a lot of new features.

854
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Thanks to the director of the construction site?

855
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Yes.

856
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
The director of the construction site put our health department on the feed.

857
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Not the story, but the feed.

858
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I thought the interior of our health department was a concept because the director of the construction site was there.

859
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I really knew it.

860
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
The director of the construction site is really like a person of luck.

861
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Please give me a thank you greeting during the class next time.

862
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Thank you greeting.

863
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Our health department is on the feed.

864
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Okay, I'll be sure to do it.

865
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yes.

866
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Alex, let's go and see.

867
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I have something to say. Let's see outside for a while.

868
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What do you think?

869
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Did you ask me to learn this?

870
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Eat it.

871
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I chose it as my favorite high-end white rice cake.

872
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
The eel tail.

873
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
The eel tail is very good for stamina.

874
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
You have to eat well because your body is a property.

875
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'll take care of stamina well.

876
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Tell me what to say.

877
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Why did you come back to me?

878
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Let's eat first.

879
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
You have to consume protein in two hours after exercising.

880
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
There are 100g of eel and 179g of protein.

881
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Are you not going to eat it?

882
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Eat this all.

883
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Let's go somewhere.

884
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Hello.

885
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
What is this place?

886
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
How big is it?

887
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Is it about 2X?

888
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It's 3X.

889
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It's a lot bigger.

890
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Red, blue.

891
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Red.

892
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Blue is so cute.

893
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Next, you have to have a basic one.

894
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Try this on.

895
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Try this on.

896
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Why should I try this on?

897
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I'll explain it to you when you try this on.

898
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Okay.

899
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You look good in blue.

900
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
You're cute.

901
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
No, no.

902
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Next.

903
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
You have to cut it.

904
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
What's wrong with your face?

905
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Smile.

906
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Next.

907
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Next.

908
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Yes, simple is the best.

909
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
The most confident pose.

910
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm good.

911
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
This is it.

912
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Give me everything you've worn today.

913
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Okay.

914
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Am I a liar?

915
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
You're a liar.

916
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
No?

917
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
No.

918
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Tell me now.

919
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
What's the reason you're doing this?

920
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It's going to be a fly.

921
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Take it.

922
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You have to get off or I'll have to go.

923
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I thought about why you came here.

924
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I didn't come here because I didn't have anything to do with exercise.

925
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I'm sorry.

926
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I can't accept your heart.

927
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Who wants to be my wife?

928
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Then why did you come?

929
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Not your wife.

930
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Did you get anything else?

931
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
What?

932
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Among the things you have,

933
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
the best one.

934
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
The best one among the things I have?

935
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'll call you tomorrow. Take it.

936
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Get off.

937
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Among the things you have,

938
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
the best one.

939
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Is it possible that you want to...

940
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Seorak.

941
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Why did you get so lonely?

942
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
How about tomorrow evening?

943
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I have a restaurant I want to go with you.

944
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I didn't think you'd want to see me.

945
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
No.

946
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I'm just a few years older than you.

947
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'm expecting someone who's older than me.

948
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
You like meeting people, right?

949
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
If I see you...

950
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Why is that...

951
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Isn't that still on the stage?

952
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Who is it?

953
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Who keeps putting in tissue in the toilet?

954
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
How many times have I told you not to put tissue in the toilet because the math is weak?

955
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It's not me.

956
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It's not me either.

957
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I'm not sure.

958
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I'm not sure.

959
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I'm not sure.

960
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I'm not sure.

961
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I'm not sure.

962
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm not sure.

963
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm not sure.

964
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I'm not sure.

965
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I'm not sure.

966
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I'm not sure.

967
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm not sure either.

968
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
What is this?

969
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I didn't do an interview.

970
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Why is my heart beating?

971
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
What is this?

972
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It's a failure.

973
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
What's going on?

974
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I can't even breathe.

975
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Let's go.

976
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Yes.

977
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Who is it this time?

978
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
It's a failure.

979
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It's a failure.

980
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It's a failure.

981
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm sorry for the sudden change.

982
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I think it's important to fix it.

983
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Eun-ah, start!

984
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yes!

985
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I'm annoyed.

986
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I haven't turned it off yet.

987
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I must be crazy.

988
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I'm not sure.

989
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I'm not sure.

990
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I'm not sure either.

991
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I'm not sure either.

992
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Ms. Lee!

993
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
What is this?

994
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
What is this?

995
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
You must be careful with your tissue.

996
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I'll be careful with my tissue.

997
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It's a failure.

998
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I'm so mad.

999
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I'm so mad.

1000
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
What are you doing here?

1001
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I was left out.

1002
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Didn't I have a lot of bruises?

1003
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
When I was thrown away in a house like that,

1004
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I was thrown to the water and got hit by a bush.

1005
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Why did you do that to a man who had bruises?

1006
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Why did you do that?

1007
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I'm so sad.

1008
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I'm so sad.

1009
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Sad?

1010
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Even if you forget your feelings soon,

1011
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
you can't forget your body.

1012
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
You can't forget your body.

1013
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Why are you so mean?

1014
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
The medicine is the scariest thing about your body.

1015
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
What?

1016
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm so sad.

1017
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
See you at the new hotel at 7 tomorrow.

1018
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I'll tell you the reason tomorrow.

1019
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Do you really have feelings for me?

1020
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
When did I ask you to meet me?

1021
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Ask me the best thing about you.

1022
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Let's be in the eyes.

1023
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I'll do it.

1024
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I'll do it.

1025
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I'll do it.

1026
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I was in the car.

1027
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Stop it.

1028
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Stop watching TV shows at the beach.

1029
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
beach

1030
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Do you meet me at 7 at the new hotel?

1031
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
The best thing about you is that you came to see me.

1032
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
What are you thinking about?

1033
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Do Hyunjoo is not going.

1034
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
No.

1035
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm not going.

1036
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I'm not going.

1037
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I'm not going.

1038
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I'm not going.

1039
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I have something to tell you.

1040
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Kang Sol.

1041
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
There are two new members at the new hotel.

1042
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Kang Sol is coming to see you.

1043
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Is that so?

1044
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You have to pay for the change.

1045
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Pay?

1046
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's okay to be here.

1047
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
The building owner was making a fuss about the beach every time we meet.

1048
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
He changed his face because he was famous.

1049
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Shouldn't we give him a present?

1050
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
A present?

1051
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Ask him if he wants anything.

1052
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
He has to pay for it.

1053
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
If you want something, you can't give it to him.

1054
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
What's there to give to Eunin?

1055
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
You have to pay for everything.

1056
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Give it to him.

1057
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Give it to him.

1058
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Give it to him?

1059
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You have to give it to him.

1060
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Two new members came today.

1061
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Two?

1062
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
The manager has to do everything for the head.

1063
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
The manager is responsible for everything to protect the head.

1064
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Thank you.

1065
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Okay.

1066
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I know everything about the health center.

1067
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm sorry.

1068
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Sol?

1069
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Come in.

1070
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm sorry.

1071
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Okay.

1072
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I can't miss the best opportunity in my life because of that.

1073
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Okay. I'll go crazy.

1074
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Our manager...

1075
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You look desperate.

1076
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Thank you for your help, Mr. Sol.

1077
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
What?

1078
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I'm so tired.

1079
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I saw too many things.

1080
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
No, no, no.

1081
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Get your hands off me.

1082
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Good luck, Miran.

1083
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Hello.

1084
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Look at this.

1085
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You're so sweet.

1086
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
You even take out the chair.

1087
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
What are you doing?

1088
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Run.

1089
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Are you okay?

1090
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
The steak here is good.

1091
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And the fish is good.

1092
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Okay.

1093
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Hey, Miran.

1094
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Why do you always say that to a guy who buys you something delicious?

1095
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Why are you still?

1096
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Are you out of your mind?

1097
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Have some of this, too.

1098
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Thank you.

1099
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
What the...

1100
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I'm here for the steak!

1101
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I told you several times to eat with confidence when I'm eating beef.

1102
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I'm here!

1103
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
If you don't have enough oil, you'll have the most protein on your conscience.

1104
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Just dip the sauce a little bit.

1105
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
A little bit?

1106
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
What the...

1107
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
What are you doing?

1108
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm here for the steak.

1109
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
What the...

1110
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
What the...

1111
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
What the...

1112
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
What?

1113
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
What the...

1114
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I'm sorry, Jeonghan.

1115
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I was really...

1116
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I was crazy.

1117
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I'll pay for it.

1118
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I'm really sorry.

1119
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
What's wrong with me?

1120
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Miran.

1121
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Miran is crazy.

1122
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
She's the perfect man.

1123
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
She's the best.

1124
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Did you miss her?

1125
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
She's crazy.

1126
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
She's crazy.

1127
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Are you done?

1128
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
My mom.

1129
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
What?

1130
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Let's go.

1131
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I was tired.

1132
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I should go to the hospital to get the protein.

1133
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
What's that?

1134
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Even if Seol-yi likes it,

1135
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
it won't do anything.

1136
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Even if Seol-yi likes it,

1137
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
it won't do anything.

1138
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Was it the director?

1139
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I wanted to believe that it was an interview.

1140
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I wanted to believe that my heart was in the wrong.

1141
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,000
But I ended up falling in love again.

1142
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Are you here, oppa?

1143
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Come in.

1144
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Come in.

1145
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
What did you do to the two of you?

1146
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I just wanted to show you the room.

1147
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
When will you do this next time?

1148
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Next week?

1149
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
How can I wait for you next time?

1150
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm so curious.

1151
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
You're crazy.

1152
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I know.

1153
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I'm a thinker.

1154
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's good to see someone you want to see

1155
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
when you like a trainer.

1156
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
But...

1157
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
You two are definitely different.

1158
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I've never seen you look like that.

1159
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Do you know how different I am?

1160
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I didn't want to be a part of Choa's side.

1161
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Do you have someone you like?

1162
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Director, what's your relationship with Sol?
