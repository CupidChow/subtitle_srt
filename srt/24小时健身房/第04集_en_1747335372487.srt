1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
See you again, Sang Param!

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:21,640
This is Sang Param, the topmost

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
The solution to the complaints of the members,

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,700
cleaning the gym,

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,900
and chatting with the members, etc.

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,000
All are prohibited.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,900
Prohibited?

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,100
That's the funniest thing.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,000
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,300
What's wrong with you, Mr. Ro?

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,300
Mr. Ro decided to leave.

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,400
Leave?

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,000
Where are you going?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,200
Are you going to leave Mr. Ro?

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,500
You have to leave this time.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Navi Korea.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,200
You want me to compete?

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,400
A trainer is a proof of his ability.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,800
Prove it.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Who needs this gym more.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,300
Members.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,300
Have some food.

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,500
Have some.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,800
My goodness.

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
My goodness.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,000
Our gym is the best, right?

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,500
Gosh.

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,600
I have something to lose.

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,000
I just went there.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think she's upset. She's staring at me.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,300
Our gym is the best

32
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,800
because we can eat sweet potatoes.

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,100
Right.

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,400
I still don't feel at ease.

35
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,800
Why not?

36
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,300
You're being too harsh.

37
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,300
How old are you?

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,600
You're so young.

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,100
You're telling her to compete.

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,800
No.

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,100
Stay still.

42
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,700
Is she really going to compete?

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,000
Why is Mr. Do telling her to compete?

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,200
They're so mean.

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,900
You're telling her to compete.

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,100
She's just trying to embarrass him

47
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,200
and make him leave.

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,500
She's so mean.

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,400
That's not it.

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,500
Stop talking.

51
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,300
Why is she trying to send Ms. Rosa out?

52
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,200
Why?

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,900
She doesn't want to.

54
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,100
She doesn't even have a trainer.

55
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,400
Would it be easier for her?

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,200
Gosh, you're being too harsh.

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
She might just move to a new gym.

58
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,400
Are you really going to do this?

59
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Eat.

60
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,900
Eat.

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,300
What the sweet potatoes?

62
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,800
Get rid of them right now.

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,400
The players are training outside.

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,700
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,700
We're here to eat these.

66
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,500
There's a saying in the gym.

67
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,600
To train a bodybuilder,

68
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,100
you need to work hard at the gym.

69
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
What?

70
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,300
I believe all the members

71
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,100
will help Ms. Rosa focus on the gym.

72
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,400
Alex, the members.

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,700
Put the sweet potatoes down and go to the gym.

74
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,800
To the gym?

75
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,500
Sir!

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,800
No, no.

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,700
No, no.

78
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,200
That's too much.

79
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,100
Let's go.

80
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Mr. Do.

81
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,400
Don't interrupt us because we're training.

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Sir.

83
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
Let's go.

84
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Are you going to do this?

85
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
Let's go.

86
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's go.

87
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay.

88
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,500
Today, we're going to learn the dumbbell curl.

89
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,200
It's a double curl.

90
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,100
What?

91
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
Look forward.

92
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,200
Put the dumbbell on your hands.

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,800
Put your elbows on your side.

94
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
Up, down.

95
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,800
Why do you keep whispering in my ear?

96
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,500
The body of the athletes is growing in the gym.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,200
Oh.

98
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,900
To build the best body,

99
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,100
bodybuilders need to reduce carbohydrates

100
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,600
and do a lot of strength exercises.

101
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,300
That's why the senses of the body

102
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,800
develop so sensitively that they can't control themselves.

103
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Like a super power.

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,500
Super power?

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,900
You have to be quiet.

106
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,500
First, the ear.

107
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,600
Move a little bit to the beat.

108
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,600
Hey, drink this.

109
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,800
Make it more delicious.

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
Second, the taste.

111
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,200
Alex pass.

112
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,900
Nice catch.

113
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,000
What are you doing?

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,700
Don't you know sugar water is a gold water for athletes?

115
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,200
Sugar water?

116
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,700
I worked so hard last night to buy that.

117
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,000
Think about how hard you have to work

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,900
to get that sugar water.

119
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,500
Oh, my.

120
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,700
Oh, my.

121
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,300
That's why I told you to give me a good punch.

122
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,500
You punk.

123
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,100
Third, the after-shoot.

124
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,400
After-shoot?

125
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,400
After-shoot.

126
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,300
What are you doing?

127
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,100
Present for you.

128
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,400
Thank you.

129
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,700
To build a body,

130
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,400
you need to work hard at the gym.

131
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,300
I have something urgent to do.

132
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,500
I have to go.

133
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,700
Thank you. Bye.

134
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,900
There are two more sets left.

135
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
Sir, there are more.

136
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,100
Sir.

137
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,100
Hey, don't overreact to the members.

138
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,700
It's too much.

139
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm not overreacting.

140
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,300
As a trainer,

141
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
I did what the athletes needed the most.

142
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Who told you to be my trainer?

143
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,800
I'll take care of my competition.

144
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,200
My competition.

145
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,800
My competition.

146
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,600
Oh, no.

147
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,400
Mom is coming.

148
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,800
This is an emergency.

149
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,600
Mom's sudden attack on her house

150
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,800
is like a sudden search

151
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,000
for a company that was hit by a military unit.

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
If you get caught,

153
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,200
you have to go back to your parents' house

154
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
and work six hours a day.

155
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
It's a terrible decision.

156
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,600
You can make a terrible result.

157
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Don't move.

158
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Don't move.

159
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Oh, my God.

160
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Mom, please be nice to your family.

161
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm going to announce an emergency.

162
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Yes.

163
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Yes.

164
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Everyone, get ready for the operation.

165
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Get ready.

166
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,600
The refrigerator is the place where you are most polite.

167
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
If you know that the side dishes you made are damaged,

168
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
you're dead.

169
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
What are you doing?

170
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,600
You have to erase all traces of delivery food.

171
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Clothes cabinet.

172
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
The space where mom understands our financial condition.

173
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,600
You have to avoid new clothes, bags, shoes, and everything.

174
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
If you do something wrong,

175
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
you can be confiscated from your mom's bank account.

176
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Oh, my God.

177
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Oh, my God.

178
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
It's essential to remove hair.

179
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Mom is one of the most powerful people

180
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
who understands visitors to our house

181
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
just by the length and color of her hair.

182
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
And the most important thing is

183
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
to give the feeling that you were always in this state.

184
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
If you feel like you're clean because your mom came,

185
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
you'll be more suspicious.

186
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Good job.

187
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
All right.

188
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
I'm so proud of you.

189
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Okay.

190
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I'm sweating.

191
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Hey, why are you here?

192
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I've been here for a while.

193
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Ji-won.

194
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Min-joo.

195
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Here.

196
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Okay.

197
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Why didn't you call me?

198
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
I would've gone out to greet you.

199
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Did you lose weight or something?

200
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
I lost a lot of weight.

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Do you know?

203
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
I was robbed recently.

204
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
What? Robbed?

205
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Rice thief.

206
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Mom's crab is so delicious that

207
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm a total thief.

208
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,600
But I heard you eat two bowls of rice.

209
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
The rice in the rice bowl is the same.

210
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Then...

211
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
You bought more, right?

212
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Yes.

213
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
You ate it all, right?

214
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
You bought more, right?

215
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
What's this?

217
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
What's this?

218
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
What's this?

219
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
A book.

220
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Oh, my.

221
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
What are you doing?

222
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Sit down.

223
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Okay, okay.

224
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Sit down.

225
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Sit down.

226
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
You guys.

227
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Don't wear anything.

228
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
When you start wearing loose clothes,

229
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
you'll get fat quickly.

230
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Got it?

231
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Okay.

232
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
I'll go get some clothes.

233
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Okay.

234
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Okay.

235
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Okay.

236
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Okay.

237
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Okay.

238
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Okay.

239
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Okay.

240
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Okay.

241
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Okay.

242
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Got it?

243
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Yes!

244
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I know, I know!

245
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
We're Nugot girls.

246
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Don't you know Moon Se-kyung Lee of Daegu?

247
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Great.

248
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I bought it for you too.

249
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Try it on.

250
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Oh, that's cute.

251
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Are you in an elementary school uniform?

252
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Gosh.

253
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I don't have any talent for that.

254
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,800
I've never seen a dress that's as white as yours.

255
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Give me a hug.

256
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,800
I'll try it on.

257
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,100
You'll look pretty in that.

258
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,700
You're a pretty girl.

259
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,900
It's because I look like you.

260
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,700
You're so pretty.

261
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,800
You have more skin.

262
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,700
Don't lose weight.

263
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,700
You'll look older if you lose more weight.

264
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,800
Okay.

265
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,000
You're a big sister.

266
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You should've been a good daughter.

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You were busy preparing for your job.

268
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,300
Preparing for my job?

269
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,400
I'm preparing to get married.

270
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,800
I'm going to date every day.

271
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,000
Hey.

272
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
What about you?

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,500
Aren't you going to marry Junsu?

274
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,100
What?

275
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,500
It's been a year since we met.

276
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,000
Don't be so long.

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,200
Get married soon.

278
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,600
I'm not that old.

279
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,100
Why are you talking about marriage?

280
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,000
I can see that you're not that old.

281
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
What's wrong?

282
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,700
I can see that you two have a good taste.

283
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,500
Taste?

284
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
That's my taste.

285
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
I'm?

286
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,500
Don't be so long.

287
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,700
Let's meet at Junseok's.

288
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
I'll ask him to eat.

289
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,500
Mom, Junseok...

290
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,200
Okay, I'll talk to him.

291
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Wait, I'll go out.

292
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,700
I have an urgent matter at work.

293
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,700
I'll be back.

294
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,200
I'm late.

295
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,200
This is crazy.

296
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I'll text you when I fall asleep.

297
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,200
18!

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,200
19! Focus!

299
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,700
You can put some weight on it next time.

300
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,200
I've already gained 10kg.

301
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,700
Then I'll gain 15kg next time.

302
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,200
Where are you going?

303
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm going to do some posing practice.

304
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,700
Posing?

305
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,200
Posing is the key to bodybuilding.

306
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,700
No matter how well you make your muscles,

307
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,200
you can't show them properly

308
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
unless you do proper posing.

309
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,900
I don't have any.

310
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,400
Look carefully.

311
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,900
This is the best posing in the world.

312
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,900
Front position.

313
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Make it look like a swan.

314
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,400
Show me all the sweat and tears

315
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,900
that you've shed.

316
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,900
Second, quarter-tone light.

317
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,900
When you do quarter-tone light,

318
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
make it look like a swan.

319
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
Make it look powerful.

320
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,900
Especially your shoulders.

321
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,900
Other athletes can't touch them.

322
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,900
Last, rear-side pose.

323
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
When you do quarter-tone back,

324
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
you have to make the muscles feel rhythm

325
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,900
as if you're a tap dancer.

326
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,900
The last, front-side pose.

327
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Practice for 30 minutes every day.

328
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,700
Can I go wash now?

329
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,900
No.

330
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,400
I'm going to get on the train.

331
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,500
I worked hard on the cardio today.

332
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,000
What more do you want?

333
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,200
You can't get on the train if you only burn fat.

334
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
You have to burn fat too.

335
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,700
Burn it evenly. Front, back.

336
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Especially on your armpits,

337
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
which are easy to miss.

338
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,700
Why are you so obsessed with my competition?

339
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
I'm not good for you because I'm getting on the train.

340
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,200
It's good for me.

341
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,700
Because the best athlete, Do Hyun-joong,

342
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,700
is getting rid of the best athlete.

343
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
You don't think I'll be the one to get on the train.

344
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
No, I don't think I'll get on the train.

345
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
I think I'll win.

346
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Can I start now?

347
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm sorry.

348
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,700
Ta-da.

349
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,900
It's protein time.

350
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,100
I made this lunch box myself.

351
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,900
You can have it every four hours.

352
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,200
I'll pay for it, so you can leave first.

353
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,000
As the gym's representative and trainer,

354
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,700
I'm giving you a free lunch.

355
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,700
You tanned the photo for the blog event,

356
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,900
so I'll take a picture of you.

357
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,900
I'll take it.

358
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,400
Come this way.

359
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,900
I'll look at you a little more.

360
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
Do you have any other pose?

361
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,400
Wow, Do Hyun-joong is working hard.

362
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,100
He's going to build a building.

363
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,200
How do you know this?

364
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,400
Is this the person who registered as a player

365
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,500
at the 24th city?

366
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,600
Say hello. I'm Yuna.

367
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,100
I'm a friend who's learning from Roy.

368
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,100
I've been a muscle queen at Miss Seoul for two years.

369
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Roy?

370
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,100
Who's Roy?

371
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,800
Hey, I changed my name.

372
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,300
Lee Roy.

373
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,200
It's easy to pronounce it right,

374
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,400
but it's easy to pronounce it wrong.

375
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,500
Remember that.

376
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,200
Lee Bong-won, come this way.

377
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Okay, I'm coming.

378
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,300
Yes, Bong-won.

379
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,400
You look best with Bong-won.

380
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,500
Bong-won, go in.

381
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,200
You're the one who registered as a player?

382
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,300
You're Bong-won?

383
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,100
I said I'm Roy, not Bong-won.

384
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,700
How many times do I have to tell you?

385
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,900
Come this way.

386
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Why is there only a gym?

387
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100
I hope the director isn't here.

388
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
He'll make me work out if I see him again.

389
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,100
I should be in the gym.

390
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,100
It's finally time for me to work out alone.

391
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,400
Yes! Come on!

392
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
What? Why did I get a stomach ache?

393
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,600
I'm a sportsman.

394
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,100
I should be in the gym while looking at my body.

395
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,600
Freedom!

396
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,600
Who are you?

397
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,400
Is this the GX room?

398
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
Yes.

399
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
Who are you?

400
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,100
I'm the man in the church.

401
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Come out!

402
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
What?

403
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
What?

404
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,100
He's so big that he's really scary.

405
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
What?

406
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Is this open?

407
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
What?

408
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,600
Is this where he lives?

409
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Oh, my.

410
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,100
You're studying a lot.

411
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,100
This book...

412
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,100
I'm going to read it.

413
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,100
I'm going to read it.

414
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
What?

415
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
What? He reads books like this?

416
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
What?

417
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
He's really weird.

418
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
The more I get to know him, the weirder he gets.

419
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Mom's sleeping. Come on in.

420
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
How do I open this?

421
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,600
Sir.

422
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Alex.

423
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
I'm sorry.

424
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
I think there's something weird about the gym.

425
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,600
Something weird?

426
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,100
Have you ever heard of anything like rumors about the gym?

427
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,600
For example, the scary sound of a ghost or something.

428
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,100
Scary sound?

429
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,100
I heard a really scary rumor.

430
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,600
What rumor?

431
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,100
That way!

432
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,600
Rumors say that there's a really scary athlete at the gym.

433
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
He's really big.

434
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
He's the first in the front row for two years.

435
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,100
I'm so scared.

436
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
Scared?

437
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm so scared.

438
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,100
Hello?

439
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,600
Yes, this is the Nabi Korea's business division.

440
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Are you Choi Ro-seo?

441
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,100
Yes, I am.

442
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,600
I called you to check the documents.

443
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,600
You were born in 1982, right?

444
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Yes, why do you ask?

445
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
No, I was a little old.

446
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
I called you to check if there was anything wrong.

447
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,100
I'll see you on the day of the competition.

448
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,600
Sir, didn't you say you'd add more weights?

449
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,100
I'll add more weights.

450
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,600
No, I know my own weight.

451
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,100
No, I don't think you know your own weight.

452
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
If you're tired after adding more weights,

453
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
you can reduce the number of times.

454
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
No, I can't.

455
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,600
I can do it.

456
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,100
No, I can't.

457
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
I can do it.

458
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,600
I can't. No, I can't.

459
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,100
Are you okay?

460
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,600
Are you okay?

461
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,600
I told you no.

462
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
I told you I can't.

463
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
It's too heavy for me.

464
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,100
I know the weight that fits me.

465
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
I'm not going to this competition.

466
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Sir.

467
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,600
Director Do,

468
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
you can't use that kind of person.

469
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,100
No matter how much you hate him,

470
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,600
he's too much for a old Rosa.

471
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,100
Anyway, if you quit,

472
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,100
we'll all quit.

473
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,600
I hope he doesn't get hurt.

474
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,100
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

475
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
What?

476
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,100
Do you have a date?

477
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,100
No, I'm going to have dinner with my mom later.

478
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,100
What?

479
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,100
You're having dinner with your mom,

480
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,100
and you're putting on so much makeup?

481
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,100
My mom doesn't like me going around.

482
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
You're a cool guy.

483
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,600
Well...

484
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,100
I'm sorry. Wait a minute.

485
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
Mom called.

486
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
She's not answering.

487
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,100
I'm sorry.

488
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
I'm sorry.

489
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,100
I'm sorry.

490
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
I'm sorry.

491
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,100
I'm sorry.

492
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
Go downstairs now.

493
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,100
When you get back, bring Junseok with you.

494
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Junseok?

495
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Why Junseok?

496
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Why all of a sudden?

497
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
I'm here. I'll see him.

498
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Go downstairs now. Wait a minute.

499
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,100
Okay.

500
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,100
Where are you waiting for your mom?

501
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,100
In front of the company.

502
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
What are you having for dinner?

503
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
I'm going to a high-end restaurant.

504
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
Hello?

505
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Oh, my.

506
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
Why isn't he coming out?

507
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
He's coming out.

508
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Oh, no.

509
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
He's here.

510
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
Junseok.

511
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Thank you.

512
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
Thank you, sir.

513
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,100
Oh, my.

514
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Mom.

515
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,100
I've been waiting for you.

516
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
You'll be back soon after work, right?

517
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
I'm sorry. I'm so tired of eating and sleeping.

518
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,100
I'm sorry.

519
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
What about Junseok?

520
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Mom, Junseok and...

521
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Junseok moved to the department.

522
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,100
He's not here today because of a business trip.

523
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
Oh, really?

524
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
I think I saw him earlier.

525
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,100
Is he not here?

526
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,100
Let's go.

527
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
I found a really good restaurant in this area.

528
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
Let's go.

529
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Let's go.

530
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
Mom, you're a ghost.

531
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,100
How can you see me when I'm on a business trip?

532
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Oh, this is the restaurant with a high rating

533
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
and a long line of celebrities.

534
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Take a look.

535
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
Mom, look.

536
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,100
I get fat if I eat flour.

537
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,100
You're going to eat this kind of place at night.

538
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
You're not fat just because you eat it once.

539
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,100
You're pretty. You're really pretty.

540
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
Did Junseok go far on business trips?

541
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
He said he'd stop by if he was on his way.

542
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
I'm busy.

543
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,100
No matter how busy you are, you're going to eat, right?

544
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
Call him.

545
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
It's okay. It's burdensome.

546
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
What's burdensome?

547
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,100
That's the problem.

548
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,100
A woman should be kind and considerate.

549
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
You're always standing there like a bully.

550
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
It's not like that, so stop it.

551
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
Junseo is nice, so I'll meet you.

552
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,100
If you were like a normal guy, it would've been over.

553
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Okay, so stop it.

554
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
What do you mean stop it?

555
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,100
Mom, Junseok and I broke up.

556
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,100
Hey.

557
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,100
Hey.

558
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Oh, my God.

559
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,100
Break up?

560
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,100
Why?

561
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Why did you break up?

562
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,100
We broke up because we didn't fit.

563
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
What do you mean by that?

564
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,100
Oh, no.

565
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
I'll call Junseok.

566
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
I'll have his number.

567
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
He said he can't call me.

568
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
He can't sleep with me.

569
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
What?

570
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
What did you say?

571
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
What?

572
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
He said he can't call me.

573
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,100
He said I can't see because I'm a woman.

574
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
He ran away from his bed.

575
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
Is that okay?

576
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
You're a bad guy.

577
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,100
That's why I told you to lose some weight

578
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
and look pretty.

579
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,100
Why are you walking around like this?

580
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
You idiot.

581
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
I'm an idiot.

582
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,100
I can't say anything even if you say that.

583
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,100
My mom doesn't like me because I'm so ugly.

584
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
Who likes me?

585
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
What?

586
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,100
Look at what you're saying.

587
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
Why are you asking me?

588
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,100
If you're a man, why don't you pretend you don't know?

589
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Why are you asking me?

590
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,100
Oh, my God.

591
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Where are you going?

592
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,100
You're not eating.

593
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
I'm not eating.

594
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
You said you were going to gain weight.

595
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Get up.

596
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,100
You don't know what it's like to be hated.

597
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,100
People like you for whatever you do.

598
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
No matter how high the calories are,

599
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,100
no matter how much the price goes up,

600
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
no matter how much you get 5,000 won for delivery,

601
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
everyone likes you.

602
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
I should've been born like that.

603
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
Everyone loves me.

604
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
I really don't know.

605
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,100
I didn't mean to eat this.

606
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,100
I was going to eat chicken breast.

607
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,100
I really don't know where it came from.

608
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
Oh, my God.

609
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,100
I didn't mean to eat all this because you did something wrong.

610
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,100
I was just going to eat chicken breast.

611
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
What are you doing?

612
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
You're punishing me.

613
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
What?

614
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,100
You're punishing me for putting all the fat in my body.

615
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,100
Why are you asking me to do that?

616
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,100
What?

617
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
Under my judgment,

618
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
Ms. Ro-sa got hurt.

619
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,100
I'm sorry.

620
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
Ms. Ro-sa got hurt? Why?

621
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
I thought I could do it.

622
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
Stop it.

623
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
I envy you, Ro-sa.

624
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,100
You trust your teacher more than yourself.

625
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
I'm the only one.

626
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,100
I wish there was only one person like that.

627
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Then I think I can live well.

628
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,100
I don't think there's only one person like that.

629
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
Even you...

630
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Even you...

631
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,100
One person.

632
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
Two people?

633
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
What's wrong with you?

634
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,100
What?

635
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,100
I think I should say hello to the person next to me.

636
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,100
Hello.

637
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,100
Are you okay?

638
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,100
Ms. Ro-sa.

639
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,100
There are two people.

640
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,100
What's wrong with you?

641
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,100
Why are you using this?

642
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
This is soju.

643
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,100
What the soju?

644
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,100
I'm sorry.

645
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
Ms. Ro-sa.

646
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,100
Looking at you...

647
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,100
I'm a complete fool.

648
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,100
What the f**k?

649
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,100
Oh, my.

650
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
Ms. Ro-sa.

651
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,100
I can't believe this.

652
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
What the f**k?

653
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
I'm a complete fool.

654
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,100
This isn't protein bar.

655
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,100
Don't touch it.

656
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
This isn't yours.

657
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
Whose is it?

658
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
There's a girl who's a complete fool.

659
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,100
Then it's me.

660
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,100
No.

661
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,100
It's puppy.

662
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
It's puppy.

663
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,100
Let's sit together.

664
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,100
Let's go.

665
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100
Wait.

666
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,100
Wait.

667
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,100
Stop it.

668
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,100
I'm so tired.

669
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Can you move a little?

670
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Do you see this?

671
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,100
I'm dragging the weight.

672
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
I'm dragging the weight.

673
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
I'm a complete fool.

674
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,100
Don't film this.

675
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
I'm not crazy.

676
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
I'm just a healthy person.

677
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,100
Don't film this.

678
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,100
I'm a complete fool.

679
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,100
No, no.

680
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Don't film this.

681
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,100
Send me the video.

682
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
24 hours healthy club.

683
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
I'm performing.

684
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
I'm a complete fool.

685
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Be careful.

686
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Teacher.

687
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Teacher.

688
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,100
It's really heavy.

689
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Okay, okay.

690
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,100
It's this heavy.

691
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Come on.

692
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,100
Come on.

693
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,100
I'm tired.

694
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
I can't even hold a glass of soju

695
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
after working out.

696
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,100
I'm tired.

697
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
I'm running out of sugar.

698
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,100
It's not yours.

699
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,100
Don't eat it.

700
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,100
I don't eat it because I'm drunk.

701
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
I don't eat it because I'm drunk.

702
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,100
What the f**k?

703
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
You don't even touch the floor.

704
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Someone's coming.

705
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Someone's coming.

706
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
What?

707
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,100
A ghost.

708
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,100
A ghost?

709
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,100
No, a ghost.

710
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
A ghost?

711
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,100
A ghost?

712
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,100
I can't work out because a ghost is here.

713
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,100
You're scared.

714
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Be careful.

715
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
If you get caught,

716
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,100
you'll be in trouble.

717
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,100
What?

718
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,100
Get up.

719
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Can you do that?

720
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
No, I can't do that.

721
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
Right?

722
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Sir.

723
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,100
Yes?

724
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Please help me tomorrow.

725
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
I'll do it.

726
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
It's okay.

727
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,100
I'll do it.

728
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Ms. Noh.

729
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,100
I heard you have a big leg.

730
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Oh, my.

731
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,100
I'm so happy.

732
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
Try this beef bone soup.

733
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
I've been working out for 12 hours.

734
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
If you get hurt,

735
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
you won't be able to work out.

736
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Today is the competition.

737
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
I'm going to the gym.

738
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,100
I'm going to the gym.

739
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,100
I'm going to the gym.

740
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
Today is the competition.

741
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
I worked out so hard.

742
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
I'm not sure if I'm happy.

743
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,100
Think of it as a success.

744
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
What's the point of going there?

745
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
You'll be embarrassed in front of the kids.

746
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
Here.

747
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
Drink it.

748
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
Beef bone soup.

749
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:36,100
One shot. One shot.

750
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,100
Wait!

751
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Mr. Do.

752
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
What's wrong with you?

753
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Don't worry.

754
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,100
Here's more.

755
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Oh, my.

756
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
I'm so tired.

757
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Please go somewhere with me.

758
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
Where are you going?

759
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,100
Wait.

760
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
Good morning, Ms. Rosa.

761
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Hello, Mr. Do.

762
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
Where are you going?

763
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,100
Get on.

764
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,100
Be careful.

765
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Sir.

766
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,100
You're going to get hurt.

767
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,100
Sir.

768
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
Where are you going?

769
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,100
To fix your leg.

770
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,100
Belt. Belt.

771
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,100
Wait.

772
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Wouldn't it be better if I got in front of you?

773
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
Please leave. Thank you.

774
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Wait.

775
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Wait.

776
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Oh, my.

777
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,100
Come here.

778
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
Where are the sick people going?

779
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Can we not go?

780
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,100
We should go.

781
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
Taxi.

782
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Let's go.

783
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
Let's go.

784
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,100
Yes.

785
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,100
Is this the venue for the leg fix?

786
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Yes.

787
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,100
To fix your injured leg,

788
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
you have to go to the competition.

789
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,100
What are you talking about?

790
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Good luck.

791
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,100
Thank you.

792
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,100
Thank you.

793
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,100
Thank you.

794
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Thank you.

795
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,100
Thank you.

796
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,100
Thank you.

797
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,100
Thank you.

798
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
Thank you.

799
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,100
Thank you.

800
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,100
Excuse me.

801
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
How much more do you want to be humiliated?

802
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,100
Why are you doing this to me?

803
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,100
How long are you going to lie?

804
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
Lie?

805
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,100
I guess I told you.

806
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,100
You're making me a mess again.

807
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,100
You're making me a mess again.

808
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,100
The butterfly Korea 6 fitness competition

809
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,100
will begin from now on.

810
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,100
Please be seated.

811
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
It must begin.

812
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,100
Should we just go where we think is the best?

813
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,100
Sir.

814
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,100
Mr. Noh.

815
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,100
Now, let's invite the butterfly Korea athletes.

816
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Player 1, Seok Hyeonbong.

817
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,100
Player 2, Park Heejun.

818
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,100
Player 3, Kim Heejun.

819
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,100
Player 4, Yoon Nayoung.

820
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,100
Player 5, Choi Dae.

821
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,100
Player 6, Lee Eunha.

822
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,100
Lee Eunha, let's go.

823
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,100
Eunha is pretty.

824
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,100
And the last, player 7, Choi Rosa.

825
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
What's going on?

826
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,100
What's going on?

827
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,100
It didn't come out?

828
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,100
It didn't come out?

829
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Why?

830
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
Sir.

831
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Please stop lying.

832
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,100
I know you want to go to the competition.

833
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,100
Don't think whatever you want.

834
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,100
No, I saw everything.

835
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,100
Unbelievable.

836
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,100
Unbelievable.

837
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,100
Why is he so fine?

838
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,100
I should tell him.

839
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,100
Don't disturb him.

840
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
He's crazy right now.

841
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,100
He's the best player I've ever seen.

842
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,100
Eat right after the competition.

843
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,100
It will help you to cheer up.

844
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,100
Choi Rosa, you didn't come out?

845
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
Oh, it's working.

846
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,100
Oh, it's working.

847
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,100
Good luck.

848
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,100
Oh, it's working.

849
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Good luck.

850
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,100
Is it working?

851
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,100
It's amazing.

852
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,100
I told you I shouldn't come here.

853
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,100
Good luck.

854
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,100
Good luck.

855
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,100
Your body can't lie.

856
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,100
That hand.

857
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,100
That hand that has lost weight several times.

858
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,100
That hand that can't be made without working out.

859
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,100
I'm telling you now.

860
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,100
I'm ready.

861
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,100
What should I do?

862
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,100
I'm so cool.

863
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,100
Good luck.

864
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,100
You're cool, Rosa.

865
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,100
Good luck.

866
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,100
You're cool, Rosa.

867
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,100
Good luck.

868
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,100
First, the front flip position.

869
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,100
Yuna, that's better.

870
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
That's better.

871
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,100
Now, the players.

872
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,100
The quarter-turn right.

873
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,100
You're so cool.

874
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,100
The most confident backflip pose.

875
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,100
The quarter-turn back.

876
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,100
I want to be like that too.

877
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,100
My role model.

878
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,100
Again, the quarter-turn right.

879
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,100
The last free pose.

880
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,100
Pose down.

881
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,100
Is it supposed to be off?

882
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,100
I don't know the music.

883
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,100
If the music isn't playing, please check it out.

884
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,100
Look at Rosa.

885
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,100
Number 1 is relaxed.

886
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,100
Cool.

887
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,100
The new singer, Rosa.

888
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,100
Heart.

889
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,100
This is heart.

890
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,100
Heart.

891
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,100
What are you doing with the heart?

892
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,100
I'm sending a heart right now.

893
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,100
It's the most perfect balance in my body.

894
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,100
We're the same.

895
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,100
Heart.

896
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,100
Good luck.

897
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,100
Good luck.

898
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,100
Good luck.

899
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,100
Wow, that was amazing.

900
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,100
A trophy from the first competition.

901
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,100
You were so cool.

902
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,100
No matter how cool I am,

903
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,100
I always call you sister.

904
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,100
If you're cool, I'm your sister.

905
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,100
Sister.

906
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,100
Rosa's sister.

907
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,100
Did you see that?

908
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,100
I told you I could do it.

909
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,100
That's just a prize.

910
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,100
A prize?

911
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,100
You're giving it to the one who made it to the finals.

912
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,100
Of course. That's amazing.

913
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,100
Are you mad that you couldn't make it to the finals?

914
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,100
No.

915
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,100
Then what is it?

916
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,100
I want to do better.

917
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,100
When are you going to the next competition?

918
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,100
Are you going to leave again?

919
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,100
Of course. It's just the beginning.

920
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,100
What are you doing?

921
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,100
Sir, please leave.

922
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,100
Sir?

923
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,100
Yes. Why?

924
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,100
You don't like it? Sir?

925
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,100
Then let's just do what we did before.

926
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,100
No.

927
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,100
I'll do the finishing exercise for you.

928
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,100
Wow.

929
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,100
Did you see that?

930
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,100
You think you're the best?

931
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,100
Why are you so mad?

932
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,100
I'm just kidding.

933
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,100
What are they?

934
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,100
They're just like the first place winners.

935
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,100
What do you want to eat today?

936
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,100
I'll buy you everything.

937
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,100
Noodles? Sweet and sour pork?

938
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,100
I have an appointment. I'm sorry.

939
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,100
Okay. Go.

940
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
Okay.

941
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,100
You're not taking this?

942
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,100
I feel like I lost because I'm so bitter.

943
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,100
You said you were leaving early today.

944
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,100
You're still here?

945
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,100
I have to go so you can come back early.

946
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,100
Sit down.

947
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,100
I'm going to feed my daughter.

948
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,100
She's coming to go.

949
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,100
You said you were going to stop eating because you were getting fat.

950
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:15,100
Who says you can stop asking your child?

951
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,100
When you lost,

952
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:37,100
I lost more than 10kg.

953
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,100
You're the same weight as me.

954
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,100
I can't weigh you.

955
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,100
You were born over 2kg.

956
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,100
I'm so sorry.

957
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,100
You're so cute in school.

958
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:07,100
I think you're not hungry because of me.

959
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,100
I cry every day because you've gained weight.

960
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,100
My stomach is full.

961
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,100
It's me again.

962
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,100
Don't give up.

963
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:31,100
If you die, I'll die of hunger.

964
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,100
Do you understand?

965
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,100
Eat a lot.

966
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,100
What's that?

967
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,100
You always go with Tan.

968
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:09,100
This is what bodybuilders apply when they go to competitions.

969
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,100
Bodybuilder?

970
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,100
Look at this.

971
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,100
Cool, right?

972
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,100
I worked out really hard to become like this.

973
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,100
This is really...

974
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,100
What kind of guy likes this body?

975
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,100
Don't do it.

976
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,100
I don't want to see you.

977
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,100
Mom.

978
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,100
What?

979
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,100
I like it.

980
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,100
I want to be like this.

981
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,100
Then it's okay.

982
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,100
Okay.

983
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,100
Don't be so stingy.

984
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,100
Okay.

985
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,100
Where's your mom?

986
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,100
I don't know.

987
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,100
I don't know where she is.

988
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,100
I'm going to the makeup artist.

989
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,100
Are you a jerk?

990
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,100
If you ever mess with my sister again,

991
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:32,100
I know your next day will be broken.

992
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,100
I'm going to the makeup artist.

993
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,100
I like it when you come.

994
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,100
You eat a lot of delicious food.

995
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,100
Then I'll do it in a few days.

996
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,100
I'll do some more.

997
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,100
What are you talking about?

998
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,100
I don't have anything to do.

999
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,100
I'll do it in a day.

1000
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,100
I'm going to unpack.

1001
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,100
Mom, mom, mom.

1002
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,100
It's time for you to go.

1003
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,100
It's time for the train.

1004
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,100
Come on, come on, come on.

1005
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,100
I'm going to miss the train.

1006
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,100
Mom, by the way.

1007
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,100
Put it in the bag.

1008
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,100
Are you going to take this train?

1009
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,100
It's better than I thought.

1010
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,100
Oh, my God.

1011
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,100
It's hard.

1012
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,100
I worked out.

1013
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,100
Oh, my God.

1014
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,100
Oh, my God.

1015
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,100
Oh, my God.

1016
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,100
This is too wet.

1017
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,100
You have to make it tight.

1018
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,100
Sir, make it tight.

1019
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,100
Wait a minute.

1020
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,100
I used my left hand too much.

1021
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,100
I need to change it to the right hand.

1022
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,100
The balance of the occipitalis is important,

1023
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,100
but the balance of my body is more important.

1024
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,100
Don't overreact.

1025
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,100
What's wrong with the main line?

1026
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,100
But Alex, you have to go a little further.

1027
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,100
Yes.

1028
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:09,100
But Rosa, you've changed a little.

1029
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,100
You're prettier.

1030
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,100
Me?

1031
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,100
It's because of the sense of muscle.

1032
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,100
The confidence that muscles give.

1033
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,100
You know it's all thanks to me, right?

1034
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,100
Sir, please control that sense of muscle.

1035
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,100
Confidence without a basis.

1036
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,100
No basis?

1037
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,100
Look at this body.

1038
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,100
This body is the basis.

1039
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,100
What is it?

1040
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,100
Are you copying me from yesterday's competition?

1041
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,100
I'll make sure to improve my body.

1042
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,100
I passed the smile test.

1043
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,100
How was it, Alex?

1044
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,100
Did I do it wrong?

1045
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,100
It's so funny.

1046
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:54,100
But I think there's only exercise in your head.

1047
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,100
I don't think you have any friends

1048
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,100
or have ever dated.

1049
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,100
I heard from Alex.

1050
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:05,100
I heard there was a girl he liked a lot.

1051
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,100
That's right.

1052
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,100
It's the love of the first love.

1053
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,100
Is it the director?

1054
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,100
What kind of girl would do that?

1055
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,100
Dad?

1056
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,100
Oh, my God.

1057
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,100
It's a girl from the gym.

1058
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,100
Hey, who are you?

1059
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,100
Who are you?

1060
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,100
How old are you?

1061
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,100
Where's Mom?

1062
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,100
You came to find me.

1063
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,100
Where could Dad be?

1064
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,100
Where?

1065
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,100
I'm sorry, but come here.

1066
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,100
Dad!

1067
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,100
Dad?

1068
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,100
Dad?

1069
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,100
Dad?

1070
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,100
Dad?

1071
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,100
Dad?

1072
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,100
Dad!

1073
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,100
Dad?

1074
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,100
Dad.

1075
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,100
Director.

1076
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,100
Director.

1077
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,100
Be quiet.

1078
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,100
It's normal if you don't open your mouth.

1079
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,100
Dad.

1080
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,100
Dad.

1081
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,100
Did you hear that?

1082
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,100
What is it?

1083
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,100
Dan Yang Geng.

1084
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,100
I'm going to be a star.

1085
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,100
Live market?

1086
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,100
Cheer up.

1087
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,100
It looks twice as bad on TV.

1088
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,100
I can't care about it.

1089
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,100
From today on, we're not allowed to export flour.

1090
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,100
Director Do, did you have a child?

1091
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:37,100
You're a genius who will lead the future fitness industry.

1092
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,100
What the Jjajangmyeon!

1093
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,100
I said no to export flour!

1094
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,100
Director, you're very sensitive right now.

1095
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,100
I think you're tired of seeing your baby, so you're not very judgmental.

1096
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,100
If you're going to do that, just eat the flour.

1097
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,100
What if I succeed?

1098
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,100
I'm going to be a star.

1099
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,100
I'm going to be a star.

1100
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,100
I'm going to be a star.

1101
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,100
I'm going to be a star.

1102
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,100
I'm going to be a star.

1103
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,100
I'm going to be a star.

1104
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,100
I'm going to be a star.

1105
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,100
I'm going to be a star.

1106
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,100
I'm going to be a star.

1107
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,100
I'm going to be a star.

1108
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,100
I'm going to be a star.

1109
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,100
I'm going to be a star.

1110
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,100
I'm going to be a star.

1111
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,100
I'm going to be a star.

1112
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,100
I'm going to be a star.

1113
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,100
I'm going to be a star.

1114
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,100
I'm going to be a star.

1115
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,100
I'm going to be a star.

1116
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,100
I'm going to be a star.

1117
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,100
I'm going to be a star.

1118
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,100
I'm going to be a star.

1119
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,100
I'm going to be a star.
