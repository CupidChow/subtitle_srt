[Episode 11]
I'm very much in love.

7
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,820
I've never felt this way before.

8
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,370
I know I shouldn't do this,

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,000
but I can't bring myself to stop.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,700
I'm...

11
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,410
already in love.

12
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,380
Director,

13
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,910
you can't.

14
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,460
Please reconsider just once.

15
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,690
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,740
How... How could you be so cold?

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,220
I bet on my pectoral muscles. I'm serious.

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,940
Your pectoral muscles?

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,210
Look at you, fighting over a tteok.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,900
They must love tteokbokki.

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,030
I know.

22
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,900
I thought he was confessing his love for her.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,610
Why would you bet on pectoral muscles?

24
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,910
I mean it.

Please.
Hey.

29
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,540
This is on the house. Eat.

30
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,930
You didn't have to.

31
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,710
You didn't, but I'm grateful that you did.

32
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,110
Is it that tasty?

33
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,510
Seriously, for how many days have you been here?

34
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,220
I know. It's tasty.

35
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,670
I've never had anything tastier than my chest.

36
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,580
Well, he's talking about
working out. Chest workout.

37
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,390
He means it's more enjoyable than a chest workout.

38
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,950
Yes, yes...

39
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,540
Don't say stuff like that so loudly.

40

Let me eat.

41
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,350
Aren't you eating too fast?

42
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,180
Seriously. It's mine.

44

By the way, are you okay, Director?

45
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,880
What do you mean?

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,380
You used to say flour was sinful.

47
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,980
But you've been eating nothing
but tteokbokki for days.

48
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,630
Don't worry.

49
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,820
Flour is only sinful to you.

50
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,830
It's okay to me.

51
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,940
Our bodies are homeostatic.

52
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,700
Homeostatic?

53
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,150
It's a force that makes
our bodies go back to normal

54
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,090
after it's been stimulated.

55
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,920
My body tries to maintain a fat level of 4%.

Trainer Rosa?

185
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,610
The alcohol smell.

186
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,150
How much did you drink?

187
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,730
I drank a bit because I was upset.

188
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,470
You aren't having any snacks.

189
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,940
Please eat this.

190
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,150
What are you so upset about, by the way?

191
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,640
If this is about my misunderstanding,

192
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,050
I really am-

193
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,700
I can see why you were mistaken.

194
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,170
It's because I'm not good enough.

195
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,100
That's not true, Mr. Lee.

196
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,140
I'm not as good as Do Hyeon Joong.

197
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,260
I'm nowhere near him. I'm no good at all.

198
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,300
A pathetic bastard. Lee Bong Won.

199
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,820
Did something happen today?

200
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
I've always started things first.

201
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,860
I liked Sol first

202
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,090
and started working out first, too.

203
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,240
I wanted to be on Muscle Man Korea first, too.

204
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,910
This is crazy.

205
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,170
What's the most important thing
for building muscles quickly?

206
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,470
Six times a day?

207
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,100
Crazy.

208
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,980
Muscle Man Korea.

209
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,730
You read this, too, Lee Bong Won.

210
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,240
Everyone reads this.

211
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,570
It's like the Bible for the fitness buffs.

212
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,600
The Bible for the fitness buffs?

213
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,760
That's so true.

214
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,750
Because I, the fitness icon, will be in it.

215
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,450
What?

216
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,070
You?

217
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,810
W-Why would you...

218
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,140
Why you? Why you? Why you?

219
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,020
They want the reincarnation of David on the cover.

220
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,930
Hold on. Y-You'll...

221
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,970
You'll be on the cover of Muscle Man Korea? You?

222
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,040
That's why I have many worries.

223
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,930
The cover is one-dimensional, but my muscles

224
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,700
are multi-dimensional.

225
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,750
Biceps? Latissimus dorsi?

226
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,750
Is it all about the abs, after all?

227
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,880
Anyway, I have many worries, Bong Won.

228
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,700
Why is it always my job to watch?

229
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,510
What's so great about Do Hyeon Joong?

230
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,850
Is it his voluminous biceps?

231
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,230
Is it his defined glutes and thighs?

232
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,260
Okay, okay.

233
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,950
Is it the voluminous abs

234
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,710
that any man would want?

235
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,900
You have to be born with that stuff.

236
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,570
If you want to look like that,

237
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,740
you have to be born again.

238
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,330
Do Hyeon Joong, that bastard

239
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,810
has no flaws at all.

240
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,430
That makes me hate it more. Hate it.

241
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,730
Let me find one.

242
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,610
Director Do...

243
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,240
looks terrible in suits.

244
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,750
It's because of the trapezius and dorsal muscles.

245
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,960
That's considered the best compliment to us.

246
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,590
I was known for looking bad in suits, too.

247
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,830
But Do Hyeon Joong...

248
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,720
can just tear apart the dress shirts.

249
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,100
Don't worry and leave. Leave.

250
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,000
This is my friend tonight.

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,080
Mr. Lee, this isn't your friend tonight.

252
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,760
It's me.

253
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,860
Pardon?

254
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,600
My client is suffering.

255
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,810
No trainer would ignore that.

256
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,500
Rosa.

257
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:59,110
Rosa, my best feature is...

258
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,870
my shoulders.

259
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,170
Wow. Nice, nice.

260
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,410
Gosh, looking great.

261
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,670
My shoulders aren't so bad, either.

262
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,690
Go ahead and feel them.

263
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,760
Wow, the trapezius muscle and shoulders.

264
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,390
It's so beautiful.

265
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,550
I worked so hard to get this going.

266
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,910
I'm so impressed.

267
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,350
You're really solid, too.

268
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,500
Rosa, it's cold out.

269
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,880
Want to consume protein at my gym?

270
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,580
I, Do Hyeon Joong,

271
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,510
was born smaller than a 1.5 kg dumbell.

272
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,780
Everyone had given up on my weak body.

273
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,210
But my body is stronger than anyone's now.

274
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,140
I made the impossible possible.

275
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,200
I'll go back to being a 5% man.

276
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,060
Let's go.

277
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,060
This is tasty.

278
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,290
It's perfect.

279
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,900
I heard in the market yesterday that

280
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,800
Director Do goes to a tteokbokki
shop often with a woman.

281
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,000
Director Do gets tteokbokki with a woman?

282
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,050
Yes.
Gosh.

283
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,040
It's about time he becomes human, too.

284
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,040
He now enjoys tteokbokki, and he dates a woman.

285
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,080
That'd make him more generous.

286
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,360
We probably could stop eating
in the locker room and

287
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,650
eat outside now, right?

288
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,560
We can't!

289
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,480
Bon appetit!

290
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,050
What's Director Do eating?

291
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,370
What's he eating without us?

292
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,330
What's he eating?

293
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,170
Director Do!
What was that?

294
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,960
Where's the Director Do?

295
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
What are you eating...

296
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,870
Yummy.

297
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,430
I knew it.

298
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,840
That fitness fanatic doesn't eat anything.

299
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
I got excited for no reason.

300
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,470
Looks tasty.

301
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,140
We should go get something tasty, too.

302
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,970
Let's go.
Okay.

303
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,180
Yummy.

304
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,970
Cardio with an empty stomach for an hour.

305
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,010
Muscle training for the
major areas for four hours.

306
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,610
A light nap for an hour to recharge.

307
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,050
Detailed muscle training

308
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,350
and abs training for four hours.

309
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,200
Yummy.

310
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,340
Light. Heavy.

311
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,710
Cardio for two hours.

312
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,110
I believe in my muscles' homeostasis.

313
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,220
[Lee Roy Gym]

314
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,540
Shit.

315
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,800
Wait. What's this?

316
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,680
You're up.

317
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,320
What am I doing here?

318
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,680
Don't you remember?

319
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,670
How disappointing.

320
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,290
Last night...

321
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,970
we had a great time.

322
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,030
You're the first woman

323
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,760
who took...

324
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,210
the lead with me. Yes.

325
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,230
People must be coming.

326
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,400
Is it that time already?

327
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,500
I'll get going now. Is there a back door here?

328
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,400
What? Why? Why take the back door?

329
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,100
I'm your competitor. What would
people think if they saw me here?

330
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,260
Hurry.

331
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,340
Right. That way. That way.

332
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,260
Geez, seriously.

333
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,590
Rosa, where are you going?

334
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,810
You came early.

335
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,400
No. I didn't come early.

336
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,950
You're late, aren't you?

337
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,620
I was so tired.

338
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,090
What were you doing that made you so tired...

339
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,590
Hold on.

340
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,750
What's with your clothes?

341
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,750
Rosa, last night, did you...

342
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,730
have a hot...
Hot?

343
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,380
Me? Hot? I...

344
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,790
I really remember nothing.

345
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,240
No, I'm asking if you boiled clothes

346
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,900
in hot water, you know.

347
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,200
I told you.

348
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,770
We'd better boil the gym clothes and towels once.

349
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,430
I know. I must've gotten tired from doing laundry.

350
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,880
Good work. Good work.

351
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,380
You need to boil cotton in hot water

352
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,630
so it doesn't smell.

353
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,620
You sure are the expert in housekeeping.

354
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,060
I'll go get ready, then.

355
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,780
Well done.

356
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,720
Talking about boiling clothes

357
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,830
makes me crave noodles.

358
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,200
The chicken breast smoothie
after a workout is the tastiest treat.

359
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,050
How clean-tasting and chewy.

360
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,560
Good morning, Director.

361
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,000
Gosh, isn't this tteok so chewy?

362
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,010
So chewy.

363
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,490
What's with him?

364
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,950
What's this, Do Hyeon Joong?

365
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,060
Did you think of tteokbokki looking at her?

366
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,950
Wake up, Do Hyeon Joong.

367
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,250
The chewiest thing in the world isn't

368
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,010
tteokbokki, but this chicken breast smoothie.

369
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,340
It's spicier than usual today.

370
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,740
Add fish cake.

371
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,260
And add the flat glass noodles.

372
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,740
And then... Yes.

373
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,860
Sausage and Fenhaozi noodles, too.

374
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,000
What's this, Do Hyeon Joong?

375
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,520
Were you trying to order
tteokbokki with sausage?

376
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,640
You were born smaller than a 1.5 kg dumbbell

377
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,490
and became stronger than anyone.

378
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,460
But you couldn't resist tteokbokki?

379
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,600
This is no good. Run a bit.

380
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,710
The legs do the thinking, not the head.

381
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,430
We can do it today.

382
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,540
It feels so good to rub with this.

383
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,040
And...

384
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,030
What the rice ball?

385
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,240
Try it.

386
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,280
It's amazing with the tteokbokki sauce. Here.

387
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,300
Say, ah.

388
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,400
W-What's wrong?

389
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,980
What are you doing, Do Hyeon Joong?

390
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,920
Who's Do Hyeon Joong?

391
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,330
Oh...

392
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,260
I'm sorry.

393
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,020
I think of tteokbokki
whenever I see Ms. Lee.

394
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,140
As if Pavlov's dog heard the bell sound.

395
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,040
Hello?

396
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,570
Yes, Mr. Do.

397
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,490
I'm so sorry,

398
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,500
but can we move up the shoot a week earlier?

399
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,710
A week?

400
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,040
The next month's model
suddenly canceled on us.

401
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,320
I remember you saying you could even do it tomorrow.

402
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,710
Of course.

403
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,100
You can shoot next week, then?

404
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,530
I'm so impressed.

405
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,440
Gosh, it's nothing.

406
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,830
See you next week.

407
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,320
Yes.

408
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,530
I can do it.

409
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,170
You can do it, Do Hyeon Joong!

410
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,390
What the tteokbokki?
[What the tteokbokki]

411
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,800
Director.

412
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,140
As long as I avoid Ms. Lee.

413
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,610
Huh? Director.

414
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,880
Director!

415
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,360
What?

416
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,120
Why is he avoiding me?

417
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,190
Yes, Oppa. I'm home now.

418
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,720
I'm home.
You want to see me tomorrow, too?

419
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,820
I'm not sure.

420
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,260
What are you doing?

421
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,540
I need to go. My sister's back.

422
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,610
Good night.

423
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,190
Did you finally make up with Kang Dan?

424
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,590
No. You think I'm crazy?

425
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,110
What? Who was it, then?

426
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,860
Someone I'm flirting with.
What?

427
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,460
You're flirting with someone already?

428
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,720
Why not?

429
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,340
Love is all about techniques, too.

430
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,380
You get rusty if you take a break.

431
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,840
You won't get rusty

432
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,210
but you'll overheat and break down.

433
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,150
You'll break down, and I'll get rusted.

434
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,850
What's the deal? Are things not
working out with the Director?

435
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,090
You used to get tteokbokki together all the time.

436
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,400
I thought things were going well.

437
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,770
I thought so, too.

438
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,350
But he keeps avoiding me.

439
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,530
All of a sudden?

440
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,700
Yes.

441
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,100
Is he sick of tteokbokki?

442
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,170
Should we eat something else?

443
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,040
If he's sick of tteokbokki, he would've said so.

444
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,600
Are you sure you didn't mess up?

445
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,910
Mess up?

446
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,770
No, I never did.

447
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,890
If it's not for tteokbokki,

448
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,420
I have no reason to see him outside the gym.

449
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,420
This is no good. I need to confess my love.

450
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,870
All of a sudden? You were
glad you didn't last time.

451
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,490
But you want to suddenly tell him now?

452
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,340
Can't I?

453
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,690
Of course, you can't.

454
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,560
You're the one who's overheated with love.

455
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,070
There's an order in dating, too.

456
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,360
Why don't you try flirting instead?

457
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,920
Make him confess his love to you instead.

458
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,280
You saw him.

459
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,320
Flirting won't work for someone like him.

460
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,690
It's because you didn't flirt properly

461
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,620
because he's a fitness fanatic.

462
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,140
There's nothing better than being romantic.

463
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,430
Classic flirting is the best.

464
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,860
Classic flirting?

465
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,340
Listen carefully.

466
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,620
Flirting is all about kissing.

467
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,870
Kissing?
Flirting technique, Chapter 1.

468
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,570
Kissing with eyes.

469
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,640
Love starts with an eye contact.

470
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:39,520
Make eye contact with him
as often as possible.

471
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,810
And if you happen to lock eyes...

472
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,890
Lock eyes?

473
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,580
You need to smile. Subtly.

474
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,980
Reveal your feelings with your eyes.

475
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,690
Subtly.

476
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,500
Reveal my feelings with...

477
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,270
my eyes.

478
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,270
M-Mi Ran, when you smile,

479
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,820
your teeth get very prominent.

480
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,930
I can see all of them.

481
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,400
Say, cheese.
Cheese.

482
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,980
Gosh, she could chew rocks.

483
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,890
Healthy teeth are a blessing.

484
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,380
You must be happy.

485
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,820
Show me your teeth.

486
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,670
Look. Nice!

487
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,250
You're binge eating again.

488
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,880
Are you stressed about something?

489
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,380
What? Flirting?

490
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,700
Kiss? Make eye contact and smile?

491
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,060
How dare you embarrass me like that?

492
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,430
I made eye contact and smiled,

493
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,060
and I was told I have healthy teeth.

494
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,800
It's as I expected.

495
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,400
Of course, that fitness fanatic
didn't respond in the first stage.

496
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,760
You preheated things.

497
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,280
Let's raise the intensity.

498
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,850
Flirting technique, Chapter 2.

499
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,250
Kiss with skin.

500
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,920
Skin?
Starting now,

501
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,390
you start touching a bit.

502
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,090
Men can't resist touching.

503
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:18,350
If subtle and natural touching doesn't work,

504
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,250
it means he's not a man.

505
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,370
Subtle and natural touching?

506
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,100
That's it for today.

507
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,990
Do the final stretching.

508
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,100
Thank you.
Director.

509
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,490
Yes?

510
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,050
You have something on your face.

511
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,240
There's something...

512
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,620
There's something on your face...

513
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,610
What? Director avoided it?

514
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,650
I won't flirt. I can't do it.

515
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,100
I want to stop.

516
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,600
Instead of being humiliated,
I should just tell him.

517
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,110
Wow, this is more hopeful than I expected.

518
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,090
Hopeful?

519
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,400
Avoiding means...

520
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,420
he's aware of you, at least.

521
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,750
Is that what it means?
Yes.

522
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,950
Here comes the last move.

523
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,080
Energy attack!

524
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,600
Let's do it.

525
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,420
I won't believe what you say anymore.

526
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,410
You'll make me do something weird again, right?

527
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,250
The final chapter in flirting techniques.

528
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,630
Kissing with the tongue.

529
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,130
Wow, that's so interesting.

530
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,620
How do you do that?

531
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,380
The tongue is the most
sensitive part of our bodies.

532
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,740
If you eat the food you like

533
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,480
and talk about it together,

534
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,570
you can't help but like that person.

535
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,440
You know better than anyone.

536
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,240
That's what you're best at, too.

537
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,400
Of course. It's my specialty.

538
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,130
Five.

539
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,450
Six.

540
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,630
Director,

541
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,360
you know Grandma Tteobokki?

542
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,040
Focus on the workout.

543
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,430
They added flat glass noodles as an option.

544
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,950
No personal conversations while working out.

545
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,010
Focus. Focus!

546
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,200
Come on.

547
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,410
Wrap the chewy flour tteok
with the drenched flat noodles.

548
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,850
It's so delicious.

549
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,800
Let's go when you're free-

550
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,160
Stop, stop!

551
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,310
That damn tteokbokki, tteokbokki, tteokbokki!

552
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,490
Could you please stop talking about it?

553
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,480
Why? You like tteokbokki, too.

554
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,400
When did I like that evil and scary stuff?

555
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,440
I'm begging you to stop bringing it up!

556
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,830
I'm sick and tired of it!

557
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,940
Sick and tired?

558
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,980
Are you sick and tired of me?

559
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,360
Pardon?

560
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,170
No, that's not what I meant.

561
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,610
I'm sorry I keep suggesting getting

562
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,550
tteokbokki without reading the air.

563
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,700
I thought you liked it, too.

564
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,990
Yes. I thought so, too, but-

565
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,080
I'm tired. I'll get going now.

566
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,860
I'm begging you to stop bringing it up.

567
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,680

568
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,400

571
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,630
Do you mean the report?

572
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,670
N-No, it's nothing.

573
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,740
I have very, very good news to

574
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,710
lift up your mood now.

575
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,340
Good news?
Yes.

576
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,680
The company is starting a branch in Hawaii

577
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,720
and they're hiring someone
to work locally for a year.

578
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,670
Really?
Yes.

579
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,530
Your live stream was a hit, you know.

580
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:24,460
They're using it to develop
the Hawaii package further.

581
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,140
You'll apply, right?

582
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:31,440
You almost got sick and tired
of thinking about Hawaii.

583
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,460
Yes, I was getting sick and
tired thinking about it.

584
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,980

585
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,340

588
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,160
Yes, I-I-

589
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,600

590
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,670
Okay, guys.

591
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,060

592

597
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,710
Take a breath!

598
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,110
Let's gather around.

599
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,840
This way.

600
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,140
Make it fun!

601
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,270
Are you okay?

602
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,160
Let's go!

603
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,530
Guys!

604
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,970

Here we go! One, two, three, four!

607

Shake it off.

608

One more time!

609
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,570
You're crazy. You're crazy. You're crazy!

610
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,740
Doesn't this remind you of that class?

611
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,110
The class with Director Do.

612
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,990

613
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,940
Call for jjajangmyeon.

614
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,130
Yes, sir.

615
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,720
Bring us three bowls of jjajangmyeon.

616
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,090
Yes, it's Dul Hui. Dul Hui. Thank you.

618
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,750
I enjoyed your class.

619
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,470
Oh, really?

620
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,520
It reminded me of that night, too.

621
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,800
That night?

622
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,000
How about we satisfy each other
whenever we have the urge?

623
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,850
I'll satisfy you when you need me, too.

624
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,940
It will be amazing.
Pardon?

625
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,320
Rosa, help me over here.

626
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,870
Okay. Coming.

627
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,100
You'll do it, right?

628
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,680
Be my partner?

629
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,490

00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,740
Gosh, that's-

I'll beg you until you say yes.

Okay.
What?

633
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,140
You agreed to it just now.

634
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,500
Okay, I said.

638
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,630
The ropes are about to break!

639
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,580
Is everything okay, Rosa?

640
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,740
Of course. How about you?

641
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,150

I'm begging you to stop bringing it up!

644
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,740
I got angry with my client over tteokbokki.

645
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,450
Over tteokbokki.

646
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,610

Can I still tell my clients to be on a diet?

650
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,640
Do I have the right?

651
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,020

Ma'am,

655
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,560
did the tteokbokki recipe change?

656
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,550
No. It's the same.

657
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,030
I think something's changed.

658
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,750
Do you remember the woman I was with last time?

659
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,600
She knows how to enjoy food properly.

660
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,520
She fills up her cheeks like a squirrel

661
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,120
and she hums after she eats
because she's so happy.

662
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,600

Of course, it is.

Why do you keep asking?

669
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,580
It's because I think the taste changed.

670
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,830
It didn't change.

671
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,540

And these are the supplements for her health.

733
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:18,160
Ms. Lee, take 22 g of protein and forgive me.

734
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,670
It's a third of the daily recommended amount.

735
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,930
No.

736
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,850
It's a third of the daily recommended amount.

737
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,590
What the...

738
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,350
I'd like to talk to you.

739
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,240
I'd like to talk to you, too.

740
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,120
Get me a new trainer starting today.

741
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,290
Pardon?

742
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,530
What do you mean-

743
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,660
I'll work with Alex from now on.
That's okay, right?

744
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,320
Me?

745
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,520
Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?

746
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,520
Gosh, my toes were crushed...

747
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,360
They weren't.

748
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,200
What a relief.
I know.

749
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,820
One.

750
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:38,340
Nice. Two.

751
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:40,960
Two.

752
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,960
Three.
Alex,

753
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,830
that's too much weight.

754
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,830
Ms. Lee said this was her regular weight.

755
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,360
Can't you tell she's struggling?

756
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,090
You're right. I'm sorry.

757
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,890
And why did you start with the upper body?

758
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:57,380
The workout log-
Ms. Lee prefers the lower body.

759
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,280
I'm sorry, but could one of you lift this-

760
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,950
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

761
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,920
Are you okay?

762
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,490
Step aside now, Director.

763
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,330
My trainer is Alex now.

764
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,420
Should we move on?

765
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,840
Yes.

766
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,300
Slowly.

767
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,120
One.

768
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,240
Two.

769
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,510
Three. Yes.

770
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,800
Four.

771
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,340
She develops trapezius muscles easily.

772
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,930
So-

773
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,700
Should we go somewhere else?
Yes.

774
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,890
Okay. Bend your knees more.

775
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,310
Three.

776
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,630
Nice.

777
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,240
Alex, she has bad knees.

778
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,840
Her body age is about 50.

779
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,930
Make sure she doesn't get
injured while doing squats.

780
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,300
Do something that doesn't affect the knees-
Start with the abs.

781
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,120
She's concerned about the visceral fat.

782
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,670
She needs to do abs daily.

783
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,170
That's enough.

784
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,150
I have huge shoulders since
my trapezius muscles are big,

785
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,090
my body age is 50, and I have visceral fat?

786
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:23,360
Why would you nag me about it,
following me around?

787
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,720
Well, it's not that-
I'll work out alone today.

788
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,830
Okay.
Geez.

789
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,460
Dang it.

790
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,340
Ms. Lee!

791
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:42,730
What's wrong with this now? Come on. Geez.

792
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,780
I went to the tteokbokki shop alone

793
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,610
not because I dislike you.

794
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,350
I went there alone because...

795
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,270
I kept thinking about it, no matter
how much I tried to forget.

796
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,820
But...

797
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,920
I realized it clearly at the
tteokbokki shop yesterday.

798
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,890
What I like...

799
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,440
So, I mean...

800
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,650
So, you mean...

801
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,190
Geez, seriously.

802
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,800
Are you okay?

803
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,700
Don't look in the mirror.

804
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,650
You said you were sick and tired of me.

805
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,300
Now, you say you keep thinking
about me. Why would you confuse me?

806
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,230
Hold on a moment. Let me apply ointment for you.

807
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,690
Forget it.

808
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:09,100
I don't get affected by comments
like that anymore.

809
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,230
And I don't like someone who doesn't like me.

810
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,550

00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,740
Well, the partner-

813
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:34,560
Why did I agree to it, anyway?

814
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,210
Rosa!

815
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,220

816
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,410
Rosa.

817

I...

818
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,010
will be on the cover of Muscle Man Korea.

819
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

820
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,540
Hyeon Joong gave up being on the cover

821
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,190
and recommended me for the job.

822
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,430
Wow.

823
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:11,720
Congrats.

824
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,470
I need to sweat with you now.

825
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,770
I can't wait any longer.

826
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,920
Right now?

827
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,880
You're working now, right?

828
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,030
Geez, I want to do it so badly.

829
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:27,150
How about at my gym after work?

830
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,380
No one will be there.

831
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,660
No.

832
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,230
Why not?

833
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,350
What happened at the gym when we got drunk

834
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,020
was a mistake for me.

835
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,590
I was so drunk.

836
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,230
It was an accident caused by alcohol.

837
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,700
So...

838
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,600
well...

If you want a partner to sleep with,

00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,220

What are you talking about?

842
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,490
A partner to sleep with?

843
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:00,920
You wanted me to be your partner
whenever you needed me.

844
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,930
Yes, a partner.

845
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,200
Workout partner. W.P.

846
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,290
I suggested we help each other working out.

847
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,310
We worked out together that night.

848
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:14,540
After you sobered up. Weren't you sober?

849
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,000
We did squats and bench presses.

850
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:23,800
Nice. Hold tightly!

851
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:27,080
Okay. Eight!

Nice. Yes, nice.

Nice, nice, nice!

00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:42,560
By chance, did you think we did something else?

856
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,460
Yes.

to the gym in three days.

00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,920
I no longer enjoy the chest workout

864
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,580
and the thigh workout was no fun.

It's the first snow of this year.

Ta-da. Don't his abs look great?

977
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:56,610
No. A snowman shouldn't have abs.

978

What about yours? He's too skinny.

979
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,710
