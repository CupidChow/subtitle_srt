Mi Ran!

10
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,500
Did you wait a long time? You must be cold.

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,120
It's okay. Right.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,750
Here.

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,220
What's this?

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,790
It's a warm protein shake.

15

With chicken breast.

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,900
Sweet. It's good.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,980
Thank you.

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,730
You must've been cold.

19
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,330
Why did you dress so nicely today?

20
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,780
Did I?

21
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,370
I started dating the fitness fanatic.

Go out and eat.

25
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,670
It's scary to lose muscles.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,970
It's okay.

27
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,220
There's something I'm more afraid of losing.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,680
it's a bit extra special.

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,990
Did I beat your pectoral muscles?

30
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,470
You beat the biceps, triceps, and glutes.

31
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,660
Don't open your eyes.

32
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,590
I want to surprise you.

Come on. What is it?

34
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,140
Okay. One, two, three.

35
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,770
Director, this is...

36
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,760
A perfect mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercise.

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,540
The stimulation you get from it is heavenly.

It's the Stairway to Heaven.

39
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,620
Didn't you overdo it?

40
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,490
This is really expensive stuff.

41
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,050
I didn't overdo it.

42
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,310
Just like how I was born weighing 1.5 kg

43
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,560

Why are you laughing?

57
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,410
I used to find your fitness fanatic comments

58
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,100
off-putting, you know.

59
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,760
But now...

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,410
But now?

61
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,030
I find it so romantic.

62
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,160
It's so cute.

That's how our secretive

66

Don't give up.

00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,920
Don't give up until the end.

69
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,360

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,910

Start over.

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,710

Four.

84
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,210
Five.

85
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,310
Mi Ran, let's eat sweet potatoes together.

86
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,240
Sweet potatoes sound good.

87
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,030
Can we meet outside?

88
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,480
How about the outdoor gym?

89
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,560
Sounds good. I'll be there in five minutes.

90
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,240
Goodness.

91
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,580
What's this?

92
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,480
Are you two going on a date?

93
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,180
No, w-what do you mean...

94
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,810
W-Why would I go on a date?

95
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,010
A couple can go on a date.

96
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,220
Why are you so shocked?

97
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,540
A couple?

98
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,430
Gosh, I know you're dating.

99
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,030
Does anyone not know about that?

100
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,400
Your secret relationship

101
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,180
is only a secret between you two.

102
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,690
If so...

103
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,600
What made you think we wouldn't know?

104
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,930
When you do squats,

105
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,280
we hear you laughing instead of screaming.

106
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,810
The gym is filled with a sweet smell

107
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,000
instead of a sweat smell.

108
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,250
I didn't know.

109
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,670
How strange. I only smell sweat.

110
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,080
Right?
Yes.

111
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,420
Anyway, just date openly. Go ahead.

112
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,380
It's even harder to play ignorant
about a secret relationship.

113
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,680
Okay, got it. We'll go public.

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,850
Oh, my gosh!

115
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,130
You guys look great.

116
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,940
Okay, then.

117
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,180
No way!

118
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,130
What's wrong?

119
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,860
Would it be okay?

120
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,390
What do you mean?

121
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,880
I'm a director, and you're a client.

122
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,320
I'm a director, and you're a client, I said.

123
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,780
There are three things that can't be hidden.

124
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,340
Muscle growth, muscle loss, and...

125
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,240
a fluttering heart.

126
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,340
Come on.

127
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,080
Wow, it's tastier than usual today.

128
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,920
What is? The tteokbokki or...

129
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,950
our thighs?

130
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,940
Gosh, my legs hurt.

131
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,410
It hurts too much. I can't do it anymore.

132
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,200
Get back in position now.

133
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,050
You need to exercise this much to eat tteokbokki.

134
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,230
What's the deal?

135
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,970
You used to say you couldn't let me do

136
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,180
hard workouts because you like me so much.

137
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,840
Did you lose your feelings for me already?

138
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,010
Don't get the wrong idea.

139
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,470
I want you to be rich.

140
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,110
According to a study result,

141
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,290
1 kg of muscle is worth way more
than four million won.

142
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,950
Seriously. Study result, my foot.

143
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,810
Okay.

144
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,450
I'll be rich quickly by being with you, right?

145
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,760
I'll make you a chaebol.

146
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,350
By staying close to you for the rest of my life.

147
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,320
Director.

148
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's spend the night together.

149
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,900
I did all 100, right?

150
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,570
It's a new record.

151
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,940
Should we go since I set a new record?

152
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,350
Will you just leave?

153
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,740
There's something really important left.

154
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,640
What the leak?

155
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,530
Director.

156
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,510
The water flow must've been bad and

157
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,910
the boiler couldn't have worked well.
Didn't you notice?

158
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,150
I didn't think it was a plumbing issue.

159
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,930
I stopped the leak temporarily,

160
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,200
but it won't last long.

161
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,780
The building is so old

162
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,880
and so are the pipes.

163
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,180
If you want to stay here,

164
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,230
you need to rip out the ceiling and flooring

165
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,230
and redo everything.

166
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,170
Rip off everything?

167
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,980
This is why you should've managed things.

168
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,410
You're borrowing my building.

169
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,430
You can't use it without any care.

170
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,310
The plumbing in the ceiling and floor is old.

171
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,060
How are we supposed to manage it?

172
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,340
The landlord should-

173
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,760
Whatever, whatever, whatever.

174
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,140
Don't even ask me to repair it. I have no money.

175
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,010
Move out if you don't want to stay.
Oh, my gosh...

176
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,090
I can't believe these people.
Oh, my!

177
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,060
Think about it and let me know.

178
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,910
Thank you.

179
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,190
Goodness. We've been through this countless times.

180
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,030
You managed more difficult things than this.

181
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,980
I know. You were born weighing 1.5 kg

182
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,460
and became the David of Asia.

183
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,640
Yes, you're not alone here, Director.

184
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,530
You have your members, too.

185
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,840
Guys...

186
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,300
Don't worry.

187
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,410
No matter what happens,

188
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,630
I'll make sure you don't lose muscles.

189
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,980
The Director was so happy when he got that.

190
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,450
But it became the first thing we're selling.

191
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,920
I know.

192
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,460
It's brand new.

193
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,330
I'll buy it.

194
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,850
Here.

195
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,730
Take good care of Mi Cheon.

196
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,730
Mi Cheon?

197
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,990
Mi Cheon is...

198
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,350
a helpful fellow who lets you
burn calories quickly.

199
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,580
Use it for over 30 minutes daily.

200
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,200
So he doesn't feel lonely.

201
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Don't forget to wipe it
with a dry towel after you're done.

202
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,590
It doesn't operate well if it gets corroded.

203
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,850
Okay. Just help me move it.

204
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,130
Goodbye, Mi Cheon.

205
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,940
Having a proper form is important when lifting.

206
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,050
You get injured easily otherwise.

207
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,370
Okay. Open up your chest.

208
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,310
Make sure not to relax your core.

209
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,120
We'll lift at a count to three.

210
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,080
One, two, three.

211
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,930
I can't do it.

212
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,630
Director!

213
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,820
Director, Director.

214
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,000
Director, Director.

215
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,260
Director. Gosh!

216
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,270
Director!

217
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,440
What happened, Director?

218
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,660
You're all about your body.

219
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,860
I'm sorry. Does it hurt?

220
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,160
I-I'm okay.

221
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,870
It's just a light sprain. A light sprain.

222
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,840
You came, Ms. Lee.

223
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,860
What happened?

224
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,960
He fractured his ribs slightly
while moving a machine.

225
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,990
His wrist and ankle ligaments were stretched.

226
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,600
He needs to be hospitalized for a while.

227
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,340
H-How about exercising?

228
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,170
You can't, Director.

229
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,160
How about just lightly?

230
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,230
What the injury?

231
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,380
Selling the leg press machine

232
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,620
used by the David of Asia.

233
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,880
We have all sorts of stuff.

234
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,820
Come check it out.

235
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,530
Rosa,

236
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,670
let's sell all this, redo the plumbing,

237
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,260
and get really nice equipment.

238
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,880
Okay.

239
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,870
What's this?

240
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,080
We need to get new light bulbs, too.

241
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,360
What the outage?

242
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,850
Are you okay?

243
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,230
Of course.

244
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,160
I've always told you that

245
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,690
life supercompensates.

246
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,710
As long as I overcome this,

247
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,570
our gym will grow even bigger.

248
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,360
You're lying.

249
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,040
A body shows a person's soul.

250
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,520
Your shoulders are drooping

251
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,120
and so are your eyes.

252
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,660
To be honest,

253
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,810
I'm a bit scared.

254
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,290
24-Hour Health Club was my home.

255
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,800
I was abandoned by everyone,
but it accepted me first.

256
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,130
I'm afraid I might lose

257
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,380
a place like that.

258
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,420
You don't have to be afraid.

259
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,270
Everyone abandoned you when you

260
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,660
were weak and weighed 1.5 kg.

261
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,090
But right now, you have

262
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,750
the trainers, members, and me

263
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,900
who will stay by your side no matter

264
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,210
what state you're in.

265
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,800
So you can feel free to be vulnerable.

266
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,580
Come into my arms.

267
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,600
I worked on my biceps for this.

268
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,150
By the way,

269
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:11,460
it's better to use the triceps
than the biceps when hugging.

270
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,670
There.

271
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,850
Gosh, I'm sorry.

272
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,020
Good mor-

273
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,750
Is something going on? What's wrong, everyone?

274
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,810
Mi Ran, I'm sorry.

275
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,550
The company is letting you go.

276
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,550
What are you talking about?

277
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,350
To Hawaii.

278
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,370
Hawaii!

279
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,000
What do you mean? Hawaii?

280
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,960
You applied to the branch in Hawaii.

281
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,880
They decided to go with you.

282
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,240
Me?
Congrats, Mi Ran.

283
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,470
You wanted to go to Hawaii badly. Congrats.

284
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,290
Your dream came true, Mi Ran!

285
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,330
By the way, what's with this reaction?

286
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:29,050
By chance, are you speechless
because you're so happy?

287
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,240
Yes...

288
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,440
Yes, when something you wanted badly comes true,

289
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,890
it's hard to believe it.

290
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,830
But they will have an orientation
with the new team.

291
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,780
I'm sure it will feel real once you start.

292
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,690
Hold on. Where should we have a send-off party?

293
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,290
S-Send-off party?

294
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,640
Yes, we won't see you for a year if you leave.

295
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,850
Let's make it really grand
and impressive this time.

296
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,750
What would be the best place for a send-off party

297
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,600
for people to say it was amazing?

298
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,000
How about we...

299
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,790
go inside and have a meeting?

300
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,040
This is an important matter.

301
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,720
What do I do?

302
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,720
Mi Ran,

303
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,470
how does it feel to be sent to Hawaii?

304
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,100
Oh, well...

305
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,180
this is just so sudden.

306
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,080
I thought you really wanted to go to Hawaii.

307
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,510
Yes, I wanted to, but...

308
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,900
But?

309
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,630
I'm torn now that I'm actually told to go.

310
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,540
I'm worried.

311
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,130
What?
I'm worried.

312
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,090
Whenever I write lyrics, they're...

313
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,770
too good.

314
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,860
Babe, I wrote this much in a week already.

315
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,990
Wow.

316
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,990
Am I a genius songwriter?

317
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,630
You've always been a genius.

318
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,960
You're a genius in looks,

319
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,470
love,

320
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,020
and...

321
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,820
genius in...

322
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,410
Come on.

323
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,420
Should I prove how much of a genius I am?

324
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,020
Prove it. Go ahead.

325
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,400
Hang tight.

326
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,130
I'm home.

327
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,260
You're back, Sister-in-law.

328
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,280
At ease.
Oh, okay.

329
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,570
Guys,

330
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,870
I'd like to ask you something.

331
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,830
Is everything okay?

332
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,750
How would you feel

333
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,420
if your significant other says

334
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,200
they can't be with you
when you're having a tough time?

335
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,820
What's the reason they can't be together?

336
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,470
I know.

337
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,000
Is it death?

338
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,430
No, it's not like that.

339
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,420
There are unavoidable situations, you know.

340
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:13,090
Maybe they got a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

341
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,930
I think I'd break up with them.

342
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,520
Me, too.

343
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,800
What?

344
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,670
It means you love something more than me.

345
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,630
While I was away from Ji Ran
for six weeks, 1008 hours,

346
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,310
I learned a lot.

347
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,790
Love means you stay together

348
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,790
even through happiness or hardship.

349
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,660
Right. It's love when you're together.
Yes.

350
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,680
You stay together through struggles, especially.

351
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,750
If not, it'd be a betrayal.

352
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,830
But why would you suddenly ask that?

353
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,700
Will you betray the Director
because his business failed?

354
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,190
No. What do you mean, betray?

355
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,280
And his business hasn't failed yet.

356
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,790
Please don't do that.

357
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,790
You can't leave someone when they're down and out.

358
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,150
I'm not leaving him.

359
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,600
We're very happy right now.

360
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,690
You'd better not say you're breaking up again.

361
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,520
Go to bed early.

362
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,890
What's wrong with her?

363
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,490
Director.

364
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,010
Director.

365
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,220
Could he be...

366
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,280
Director.

367
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,460
Mi Ran.

368
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,220
Why are you here in your condition?

369
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,470
I heard we lost electricity,
and the leaks are getting worse.

370
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,940
What brings you here so late, Mi Ran?

371
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,460
I came to eat something tasty with you.

372
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,640
Mi Ran,

373
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,770
can I really...

374
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,510
count on you and be vulnerable?

375
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,330
I...

376
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,880
think I need to give up on the gym.

377
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,510
I think I should let go of this place.

378
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,110
Thank you...

379
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,300
for staying with me.

380
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,760
Where are you, Chief? I need
to tell you something.

381
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,730
I'm coming up now.

382
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,000
I'll be waiting in the break room.

383
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,020
Mi Ran,

384
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,540
when is the Hawaii team meeting?

385
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,240
Well, the thing is...

386
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,260
You must have a ton to prepare.

387
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,100
I decided not to go to Hawaii.

388
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,120
You aren't going to Hawaii?

389
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,280
No.

390
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,000
There's something more important
than Hawaii to me right now.

391
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Whoa, I knew you were torn about it.

392
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,350
What?
What's more important?

393
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,830
You acted like you were Hawaii, and Hawaii was you.

394
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,960
You refused to let anyone else have it.

395
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,070
What's more important than Hawaii now?

396
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,300
Well, I...

397
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,190
You're so annoying.

398
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,340
What did you say?

399
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,320
Think about it.

400
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,170
You took opportunities that I didn't get

401
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,440
several times, but you're always weighing things.

402
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,400
But everyone always wants you.

403
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,870
The Chief, Joon Seok, and our entire team.

404
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,160
It's because I've worked harder than you.

405
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,110
Why are you refusing to go, then?

406
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,770
You've worked so hard,
but why are you refusing to go?

407
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,940
It's none of your business.

408
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,820
It's none of your business whether I go or not.

409
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,070
Why do you keep crossing the line?

410
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,730
Do I look that easy?
You're looking down on this job.

411
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,210
Mi Ran.

412
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,110
Joon Seok.

413
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,780
Chief.

414
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,360
Mi Ran, are you really not going to Hawaii?

415
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,600
No, that's why I wanted
to have a meeting with you.

416
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,470
Let's talk outside for a moment.

417
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,950
Okay.

418
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,000
I'll leave the task force and

419
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,630
return to the team soon.

420
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,540
That much time passed already.

421
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,940
Why aren't you going? You wanted to go

422
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,620
to Hawaii.

423
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,650
I wanted to.

424
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,480
But I wanted to go because

425
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,640
I wanted to prove myself to the one I loved.

426
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,870
Hawaii is the island of love for me.

427
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,420
You get loved and love someone back

428
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,210
on the island of love.

429
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,910
It's because of him.

430
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,160
Mi Ran,

431
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,740
this is a very important opportunity for you.

432
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,720
He's an important opportunity to me, too.

433
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,950
He's the first one who loved me

434
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,460
exactly as I am.

435
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,470
That's why I want to stay with him.

436
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,510
He's not the first.

437
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,660
I liked you, too.

438
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,720
It's because...

439
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,520
I liked you too much that night.

440
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,260
Why won't you sleep with me?

441
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,590
Gosh. Stop, I said.

442
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,630
We stopped that night because...

443
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,350
It's because I can't do it with you.

444
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,140
What?

445
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,370
I can't do it with you, I said.

446
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,420
That's enough.

447
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,080
It's not your fault.

448
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,910
It's my fault.

449
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,330
What?

450
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,900
Joon Seok.

451
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,180
The hair growth pills can show side effects to

452
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,860
1% of men, apparently.

453
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,320
And I fell into that unfortunate 1%.

454
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,130
I was so afraid that

455
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,480
you'd be disappointed in me.

456
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,290
That's why...

457
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,570
I blamed you instead of myself.

458
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,740
Like a coward.

459
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,900
I'm sorry.

460
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,780
So, you were trying not to disappoint me?

461
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,910
Not because you didn't like me?

462
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,380
I really loved you.

463
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,030
I mean it.

464
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,590
My body wasn't the reason I wasn't loved.

465
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,270
Thank you, Joon Seok.

466
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,410
What for?

467
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,380
I realized how I really feel, thanks to you.

468
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,780
And...

469
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,300
it wouldn't have mattered even
if you had been honest with me that day.

470
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,960
You look great.

471
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,610
I'll go now.

472
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,860
I've wanted to be loved my whole life.

473
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,190
I've always wondered why

474
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,620
no one ever loved me.

475
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,960
I finally found out the answer to that mystery.

476
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:59,480
It wasn't other people who didn't love me.

477
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,450
It was me.

478
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,790
Mi Ran?

479
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,190
Director.

480
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,770
Mi Ran,

481
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,440
did something happen?

482
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,620
You were smaller than this dumbbell,

483
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,010
but you worked out and became the David of Asia.

484
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,950
While working out with you,

485
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,780
I realized what I really wanted.

486
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,100
I'm...

487
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,410
leaving for Hawaii.

488
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,250
Hawaii?

489
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,880
I kept telling myself countless
times that I need to stay

490
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,280
with you since you're struggling right now.

491
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,040
I'm afraid you'd be disappointed in me, too.

492
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,310
But this time,

493
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,100
I want to try doing what I want.

494
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,950
Since I love myself,

495
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,370
I want to show Hawaii to myself, too.

496
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,790
Can I ask you to wait for me?

497
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,630
The best girlfriend I could ask
for finally got to go to

498
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,480
Hawaii she so wanted to go.

499
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,690
Did you think I'd be disappointed?

500
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,760
Even after seeing my broad pectoral muscles?

501
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,410
Don't you hate me?

502
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,940
I hate you.

503
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,300
Because I almost lost

504
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,030
my precious muscles because of your silly worries.

505
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,020
Mi Ran,

506
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,620
you should let yourself enjoy Hawaii

507
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,060
all you want.

508
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,590
I'm sorry that I can't stay with you
through your hardship.

509
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,680
Don't say you're sorry anymore.

510
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,360
Okay.

511
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,410
Starting now,

512
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,810
you'll lower the shoulder joints,

513
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,690
straighten your back,

514
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,910
relax the trapezius muscles,

515
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,610
lift up your head, and...

516
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:33,600
♪ You are there in all the beautiful memories ♪

517
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,980
♪ In that beautiful season ♪

518
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:43,460
♪ You exist with the happy moments ♪

519
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:49,130
♪ It was always you for a long time ♪

520
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,800
♪ My heart ♪

521
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:59,240
♪ My heart is heading to you ♪

522
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,250
I need to tell you something.

523
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:19,570
Someone made great offers to you.

524
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,000
I don't know how this might sound,

525
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,290
but if 24-Hour Health Club closes,

526
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,420
can I bring Alex and Rosa

527
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,820
to my gym?

528
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,670
What?

529
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,230
You know, too. It's hard to find

530
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,560
a reliable and talented trainer in this field.

531
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,030
That's up to them to decide.

532
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,560
I know you don't like me, but

533
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,280
if you try talking to them-

534
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,200
Bong Won.
Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy.

535
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,880
It's R.O.Y. R.O.Y.

536
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,790
I prefer your old name, Bong Won.

537
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,760
I like you.

538
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,870
I know you're a good person.

539
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,760
I'll try talking to them.

540
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,320
Thank you.

541
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,030
Bong Won is a great gym director.

542
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,830
If you go there, both of you

543
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,870
could work in a better condition.

544
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,270
Go somewhere bigger, guys.

545
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,320
Did you pack all of your stuff?

546
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,340
I didn't know you'd actually close.

547
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,840
I know. We've always said it'd close,

548
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,060
but you always overcame everything.

549
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,780
I thought you'd do the same again.

550
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:53,050
Can we not eat sweet potatoes at the gym anymore?

551
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,420
Don't worry.

552
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:58,170
This isn't the end of the 24-Hour Health Club.

553
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,140
Just wait six months.

554
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,950

00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:35,990
I called you many times.

925
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,520
I've been a bit busy.

926
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,430
I was studying for a year.

927
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,070
Study?

928
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,330
I've always been curious

929
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,910
as to why you hate exercising so much.

930
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,500
Why do you struggle with even easy moves?

931
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,010
I needed to properly study...

932
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,960
your lives.

933
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:59,880
I tried living as an office worker.

934
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,870
From nine to six,

935
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:04,990
you're bound to your desks.

936
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,570
Hyeon Joong,

937
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,070
I asked you to do this a long time ago.
You're still doing it?

938
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,030
I'm doing it now.

939
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,820
What are you doing right now?

940
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,640
It takes some time to use both hands equally,

941
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,310
but switching from left to right is best.

942
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,230
Where did we get this psycho?

943
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:27,860
W-Who hired this assistant?

944
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,300
Who could it be?

945
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,950
You hired him yourself, Chief.

946
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,820
Yes, Chief.

947
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,120
Stretching.

948
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,970
I tried doing housework all day, too.

949
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:44,100
You don't even get to leave that work.

950
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,330
I kept finding more chores to do.

951
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,730
63.

952
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:51,520
Excuse me.

953
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,290
What are you doing right now?

954
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:55,600
I thought you came to clean.

955
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,000
I'm cleaning right now.

956
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,140
Aren't you exercising?

957
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,730
Gym member-

958
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:05,150
Customer, try using this method when you clean.

959
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,310
You can exercise and clean.

960
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:09,200
You catch two birds with one stone.

961
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,840
And when you clean the windows,

962
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,980
use the back deltoid and dorsal muscles like this.

963
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,690
One. Two. Three.

964
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:24,480
Four. Five. Six.

965
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,760
Seven. Eight.

966
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,680
So, did you learn...

967
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,500
why it was so hard for them?

968
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,070
Yes, I realized more clearly...

969
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,010
that we need to exercise

970
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,110
no matter what.

971
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,480
What?

972
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,550
I'm determined now.

973
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,810
