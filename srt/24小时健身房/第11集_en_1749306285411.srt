I'm very much in love.

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,820
I've never felt this way before.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,370
I know I shouldn't do this,

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,000
but I can't bring myself to stop.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,700
I'm...

00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,410
already in love.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,380
Director,

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,910
you can't.

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,460
Please reconsider just once.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,690
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,740
How... How could you be so cold?

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,220
I bet on my pectoral muscles. I'm serious.

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,940
Your pectoral muscles?

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,210
Look at you, fighting over a tteok.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,900
They must love tteokbokki.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,030
I know.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,900
I thought he was confessing his love for her.

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,610
Why would you bet on pectoral muscles?

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,910
I mean it.
I mean it, too.

00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,410
Please.
Hey.

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,540
This is on the house. Eat.

28
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,930
You didn't have to.

29
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,710
You didn't, but I'm grateful that you did.

30
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,110
Is it that tasty?

31
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,510
Seriously, for how many days have you been here?

32
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,220
I know. It's tasty.

33

I've never had anything tastier than my chest.

34
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,580
Well, he's talking about
working out. Chest workout.

35
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,390
He means it's more enjoyable than a chest workout.

36
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,950
Yes, yes...

37
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,540
Don't say stuff like that so loudly.

38
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,420
Let me eat.

39
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,350
Aren't you eating too fast?

42
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,670
By the way, are you okay, Director?

43
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,880
What do you mean?

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,380
You used to say flour was sinful.

45
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,980
But you've been eating nothing
but tteokbokki for days.

46
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,630
Don't worry.

47
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,820
Flour is only sinful to you.

48
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,830
It's okay to me.

49
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,940
Our bodies are homeostatic.

50
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,700
Homeostatic?

51
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,150
It's a force that makes
our bodies go back to normal

52
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,090
after it's been stimulated.

53
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,920

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,150
How much did you drink?

185
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,730
I drank a bit because I was upset.

186
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,470
You aren't having any snacks.

187
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,940
Please eat this.

188
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,150
What are you so upset about, by the way?

189
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,640
If this is about my misunderstanding,

190
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,050
I really am-

191
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,700
I can see why you were mistaken.

192
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,170
It's because I'm not good enough.

193
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,100
That's not true, Mr. Lee.

194
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,140
I'm not as good as Do Hyeon Joong.

195
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,260
I'm nowhere near him. I'm no good at all.

196
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,300
A pathetic bastard. Lee Bong Won.

197
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,820
Did something happen today?

198
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
I've always started things first.

199
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,860
I liked Sol first

200
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,090
and started working out first, too.

201
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,240
I wanted to be on Muscle Man Korea first, too.

202
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,910
This is crazy.

203
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,170
What's the most important thing
for building muscles quickly?

204
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,470
Six times a day?

205
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,100
Crazy.

206
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,980
Muscle Man Korea.

207
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,730
You read this, too, Lee Bong Won.

208
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,240
Everyone reads this.

209
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,570
It's like the Bible for the fitness buffs.

210
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,600
The Bible for the fitness buffs?

211
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
That's so true.

212
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,750
Because I, the fitness icon, will be in it.

213
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,450
What?

214
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,070
You?

215
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,810
W-Why would you...

216
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,140
Why you? Why you? Why you?

217
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,020
They want the reincarnation of David on the cover.

218
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,930
Hold on. Y-You'll...

219
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,970
You'll be on the cover of Muscle Man Korea? You?

220
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,040
That's why I have many worries.

221
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,930
The cover is one-dimensional, but my muscles

222
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,700
are multi-dimensional.

223
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,750
Biceps? Latissimus dorsi?

224
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,750
Is it all about the abs, after all?

225
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,880
Anyway, I have many worries, Bong Won.

226
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,700
Why is it always my job to watch?

227
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,510
What's so great about Do Hyeon Joong?

228
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,850
Is it his voluminous biceps?

229
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,230
Is it his defined glutes and thighs?

230
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,260
Okay, okay.

231
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,950
Is it the voluminous abs

232
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,710
that any man would want?

233
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,900
You have to be born with that stuff.

234
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,570
If you want to look like that,

235
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,740
you have to be born again.

236
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,330
Do Hyeon Joong, that bastard

237
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,810
has no flaws at all.

238
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,430
That makes me hate it more. Hate it.

239
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,730
Let me find one.

240
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,610
Director Do...

241
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,240
looks terrible in suits.

242
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,750
It's because of the trapezius and dorsal muscles.

243
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,960
That's considered the best compliment to us.

244
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,590
I was known for looking bad in suits, too.

245
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,830
But Do Hyeon Joong...

246
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,720
can just tear apart the dress shirts.

247
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,100
Don't worry and leave. Leave.

248
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,000
This is my friend tonight.

249
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,080
Mr. Lee, this isn't your friend tonight.

250
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,760
It's me.

251
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,860
Pardon?

252
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,600
My client is suffering.

253
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,810
No trainer would ignore that.

254
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,500
Rosa.

255
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:29,110
Rosa, my best feature is...

256
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,870
my shoulders.

257
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,170
Wow. Nice, nice.

258
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,410
Gosh, looking great.

259
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,670
My shoulders aren't so bad, either.

260
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,690
Go ahead and feel them.

261
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,760
Wow, the trapezius muscle and shoulders.

262
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,390
It's so beautiful.

263
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,550
I worked so hard to get this going.

264
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,910
I'm so impressed.

265
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,350
You're really solid, too.

266
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,500
Rosa, it's cold out.

267
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,880
Want to consume protein at my gym?

268
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,580
I, Do Hyeon Joong,

269
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,510
was born smaller than a 1.5 kg dumbell.

270
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,780
Everyone had given up on my weak body.

271
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,210
But my body is stronger than anyone's now.

272
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,140
I made the impossible possible.

273
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,200
I'll go back to being a 5% man.

274
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,060
Let's go.

275
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,060
This is tasty.

276
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,290
It's perfect.

277
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,900
I heard in the market yesterday that

278
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,800
Director Do goes to a tteokbokki
shop often with a woman.

279
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,000
Director Do gets tteokbokki with a woman?

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,050
Yes.
Gosh.

281
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,040
It's about time he becomes human, too.

282
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,040
He now enjoys tteokbokki, and he dates a woman.

283
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,080
That'd make him more generous.

284
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,360
We probably could stop eating
in the locker room and

285
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,650
eat outside now, right?

286
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,560
We can't!

287
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,480
Bon appetit!

288
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,050
What's Director Do eating?

289
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,370
What's he eating without us?

290
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,330
What's he eating?

291
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,170
Director Do!
What was that?

292
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,960
Where's the Director Do?

293
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,960
What are you eating...

294
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,870
Yummy.

295
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,430
I knew it.

296
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,840
That fitness fanatic doesn't eat anything.

297
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,840
I got excited for no reason.

298
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,470
Looks tasty.

299
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,140
We should go get something tasty, too.

300
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,970
Let's go.
Okay.

301
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,180
Yummy.

302
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,970
Cardio with an empty stomach for an hour.

303
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,010
Muscle training for the
major areas for four hours.

304
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,610
A light nap for an hour to recharge.

305
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,050
Detailed muscle training

306
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,350
and abs training for four hours.

307
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,200
Yummy.

308
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,340
Light. Heavy.

309
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,710
Cardio for two hours.

310
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,110
I believe in my muscles' homeostasis.

311
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,220
[Lee Roy Gym]

312
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,540
Shit.

313
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,800
Wait. What's this?

314
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,680
You're up.

315
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,320
What am I doing here?

316
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,680
Don't you remember?

317
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,670
How disappointing.

318
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,290
Last night...

319
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,970
we had a great time.

320
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,030
You're the first woman

321
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,760
who took...

322
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,210
the lead with me. Yes.

323
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,230
People must be coming.

324
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,400
Is it that time already?

325
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,500
I'll get going now. Is there a back door here?

326
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,400
What? Why? Why take the back door?

327
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,100
I'm your competitor. What would
people think if they saw me here?

328
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,260
Hurry.

329
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,340
Right. That way. That way.

330
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,260
Geez, seriously.

331
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,590
Rosa, where are you going?

332
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,810
You came early.

333
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,400
No. I didn't come early.

334
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,950
You're late, aren't you?

335
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,620
I was so tired.

336
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,090
What were you doing that made you so tired...

337
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,590
Hold on.

338
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,750
What's with your clothes?

339
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,750
Rosa, last night, did you...

340
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,730
have a hot...
Hot?

341
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,380
Me? Hot? I...

342
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,790
I really remember nothing.

343
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,240
No, I'm asking if you boiled clothes

344
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,900
in hot water, you know.

345
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,200
I told you.

346
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,770
We'd better boil the gym clothes and towels once.

347
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,430
I know. I must've gotten tired from doing laundry.

348
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,880
Good work. Good work.

349
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,380
You need to boil cotton in hot water

350
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,630
so it doesn't smell.

351
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,620
You sure are the expert in housekeeping.

352
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,060
I'll go get ready, then.

353
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,780
Well done.

354
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,720
Talking about boiling clothes

355
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,830
makes me crave noodles.

356
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,200
The chicken breast smoothie
after a workout is the tastiest treat.

357
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,050
How clean-tasting and chewy.

358
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,560
Good morning, Director.

359
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,000
Gosh, isn't this tteok so chewy?

360
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,010
So chewy.

361
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,490
What's with him?

362
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,950
What's this, Do Hyeon Joong?

363
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,060
Did you think of tteokbokki looking at her?

364
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,950
Wake up, Do Hyeon Joong.

365
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,250
The chewiest thing in the world isn't

366
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,010
tteokbokki, but this chicken breast smoothie.

367
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,340
It's spicier than usual today.

368
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,740
Add fish cake.

369
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,260
And add the flat glass noodles.

370
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,740
And then... Yes.

371
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,860
Sausage and Fenhaozi noodles, too.

372
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,000
What's this, Do Hyeon Joong?

373
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,520
Were you trying to order
tteokbokki with sausage?

374
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,640
You were born smaller than a 1.5 kg dumbbell

375
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,490
and became stronger than anyone.

376
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,460
But you couldn't resist tteokbokki?

377
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,600
This is no good. Run a bit.

378
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,710
The legs do the thinking, not the head.

379
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,430
We can do it today.

380
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,540
It feels so good to rub with this.

381
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,040
And...

382
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,030
What the rice ball?

383
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,240
Try it.

384
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,280
It's amazing with the tteokbokki sauce. Here.

385
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,300
Say, ah.

386
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,400
W-What's wrong?

387
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,980
What are you doing, Do Hyeon Joong?

388
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,920
Who's Do Hyeon Joong?

389
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,330
Oh...

390
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,260
I'm sorry.

391
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,020
I think of tteokbokki
whenever I see Ms. Lee.

392
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,140
As if Pavlov's dog heard the bell sound.

393
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,040
Hello?

394
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,570
Yes, Mr. Do.

395
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,490
I'm so sorry,

396
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:34,500
but can we move up the shoot a week earlier?

397
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,710
A week?

398
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,040
The next month's model
suddenly canceled on us.

399
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,320
I remember you saying you could even do it tomorrow.

400
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,710
Of course.

401
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,100
You can shoot next week, then?

402
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,530
I'm so impressed.

403
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,440
Gosh, it's nothing.

404
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,830
See you next week.

405
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,320
Yes.

406
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,530
I can do it.

407
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,170
You can do it, Do Hyeon Joong!

408
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,390
What the tteokbokki?
[What the tteokbokki]

409
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,800
Director.

410
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,140
As long as I avoid Ms. Lee.

411
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,610
Huh? Director.

412
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,880
Director!

413
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,360
What?

414
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,120
Why is he avoiding me?

415
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,190
Yes, Oppa. I'm home now.

416
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,720
I'm home.
You want to see me tomorrow, too?

417
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,820
I'm not sure.

418
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,260
What are you doing?

419
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,540
I need to go. My sister's back.

420
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,610
Good night.

421
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,190
Did you finally make up with Kang Dan?

422
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,590
No. You think I'm crazy?

423
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,110
What? Who was it, then?

424
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,860
Someone I'm flirting with.
What?

425
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,460
You're flirting with someone already?

426
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,720
Why not?

427
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,340
Love is all about techniques, too.

428
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,380
You get rusty if you take a break.

429
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,840
You won't get rusty

430
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,210
but you'll overheat and break down.

431
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,150
You'll break down, and I'll get rusted.

432
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,850
What's the deal? Are things not
working out with the Director?

433
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,090
You used to get tteokbokki together all the time.

434
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,400
I thought things were going well.

435
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,770
I thought so, too.

436
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,350
But he keeps avoiding me.

437
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,530
All of a sudden?

438
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,700
Yes.

439
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,100
Is he sick of tteokbokki?

440
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,170
Should we eat something else?

441
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,040
If he's sick of tteokbokki, he would've said so.

442
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,600
Are you sure you didn't mess up?

443
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,910
Mess up?

444
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,770
No, I never did.

445
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,890
If it's not for tteokbokki,

446
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,420
I have no reason to see him outside the gym.

447
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,420
This is no good. I need to confess my love.

448
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,870
All of a sudden? You were
glad you didn't last time.

449
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,490
But you want to suddenly tell him now?

450
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,340
Can't I?

451
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,690
Of course, you can't.

452
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,560
You're the one who's overheated with love.

453
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,070
There's an order in dating, too.

454
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,360
Why don't you try flirting instead?

455
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,920
Make him confess his love to you instead.

456
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,280
You saw him.

457
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,320
Flirting won't work for someone like him.

458
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,690
It's because you didn't flirt properly

459
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,620
because he's a fitness fanatic.

460
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,140
There's nothing better than being romantic.

461
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,430
Classic flirting is the best.

462
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,860
Classic flirting?

463
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,340
Listen carefully.

464
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,620
Flirting is all about kissing.

465
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,870
Kissing?
Flirting technique, Chapter 1.

466
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,570
Kissing with eyes.

467
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,640
Love starts with an eye contact.

468
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,520
Make eye contact with him
as often as possible.

469
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,810
And if you happen to lock eyes...

470
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,890
Lock eyes?

471
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,580
You need to smile. Subtly.

472
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,980
Reveal your feelings with your eyes.

473
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,690
Subtly.

474
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,500
Reveal my feelings with...

475
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,270
my eyes.

476
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,270
M-Mi Ran, when you smile,

477
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,820
your teeth get very prominent.

478
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,930
I can see all of them.

479
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,400
Say, cheese.
Cheese.

480
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,980
Gosh, she could chew rocks.

481
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,890
Healthy teeth are a blessing.

482
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,380
You must be happy.

483
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,820
Show me your teeth.

484
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,670
Look. Nice!

485
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,250
You're binge eating again.

486
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,880
Are you stressed about something?

487
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,380
What? Flirting?

488
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,700
Kiss? Make eye contact and smile?

489
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,060
How dare you embarrass me like that?

490
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,430
I made eye contact and smiled,

491
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,060
and I was told I have healthy teeth.

492
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,800
It's as I expected.

493
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,400
Of course, that fitness fanatic
didn't respond in the first stage.

494
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,760
You preheated things.

495
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,280
Let's raise the intensity.

496
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,850
Flirting technique, Chapter 2.

497
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,250
Kiss with skin.

498
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,920
Skin?
Starting now,

499
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,390
you start touching a bit.

500
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,090
Men can't resist touching.

501
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:48,350
If subtle and natural touching doesn't work,

502
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,250
it means he's not a man.

503
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,370
Subtle and natural touching?

504
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,100
That's it for today.

505
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,990
Do the final stretching.

506
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,100
Thank you.
Director.

507
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,490
Yes?

508
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,050
You have something on your face.

509
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,240
There's something...

510
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,620
There's something on your face...

511
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,610
What? Director avoided it?

512
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,650
I won't flirt. I can't do it.

513
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,100
I want to stop.

514
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,600
Instead of being humiliated,
I should just tell him.

515
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,110
Wow, this is more hopeful than I expected.

516
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,090
Hopeful?

517
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,400
Avoiding means...

518
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,420
he's aware of you, at least.

519
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,750
Is that what it means?
Yes.

520
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,950
Here comes the last move.

521
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,080
Energy attack!

522
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,600
Let's do it.

523
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,420
I won't believe what you say anymore.

524
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,410
You'll make me do something weird again, right?

525
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,250
The final chapter in flirting techniques.

526
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,630
Kissing with the tongue.

527
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,130
Wow, that's so interesting.

528
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,620
How do you do that?

529
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,380
The tongue is the most
sensitive part of our bodies.

530
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,740
If you eat the food you like

531
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,480
and talk about it together,

532
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,570
you can't help but like that person.

533
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,440
You know better than anyone.

534
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,240
That's what you're best at, too.

535
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,400
Of course. It's my specialty.

536
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,130
Five.

537
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,450
Six.

538
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,630
Director,

539
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,360
you know Grandma Tteobokki?

540
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,040
Focus on the workout.

541
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,430
They added flat glass noodles as an option.

542
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,950
No personal conversations while working out.

543
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,010
Focus. Focus!

544
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,200
Come on.

545
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,410
Wrap the chewy flour tteok
with the drenched flat noodles.

546
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,850
It's so delicious.

547
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,800
Let's go when you're free-

548
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,160
Stop, stop!

549
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,310
That damn tteokbokki, tteokbokki, tteokbokki!

550
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,490
Could you please stop talking about it?

551
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,480
Why? You like tteokbokki, too.

552
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,400
When did I like that evil and scary stuff?

553
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,440
I'm begging you to stop bringing it up!

554
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,830
I'm sick and tired of it!

555
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,940
Sick and tired?

556
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,980
Are you sick and tired of me?

557
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,360
Pardon?

558
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,170
No, that's not what I meant.

559
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,610
I'm sorry I keep suggesting getting

560
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,550
tteokbokki without reading the air.

561
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,700
I thought you liked it, too.

562
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,990
Yes. I thought so, too, but-

563
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,080
I'm tired. I'll get going now.

564
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,860
I'm begging you to stop bringing it up.

565
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,680

Geez. Sick and tired of it?

568
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,210
What's wrong? What are you sick and tired of?

569
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,630
Do you mean the report?

570
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,670
N-No, it's nothing.

571
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,740
I have very, very good news to

572
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,710
lift up your mood now.

573
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,340
Good news?
Yes.

574
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,680
The company is starting a branch in Hawaii

575
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,720
and they're hiring someone
to work locally for a year.

576
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,670
Really?
Yes.

577
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,530
Your live stream was a hit, you know.

578
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:54,460
They're using it to develop
the Hawaii package further.

579
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,140
You'll apply, right?

580
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,440
You almost got sick and tired
of thinking about Hawaii.

581
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,460
Yes, I was getting sick and
tired thinking about it.

582
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,980

583

586
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,160

588
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,670
Okay, guys.

589

Take a breath!

596
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,110
Let's gather around.

597
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,840
This way.

598
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,140
Make it fun!

599
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,270
Are you okay?

600
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,160
Let's go!

601
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,530

You're crazy. You're crazy. You're crazy!

608
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,740
Doesn't this remind you of that class?

609
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,110
The class with Director Do.

610

611
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,940
Call for jjajangmyeon.

612
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,130
Yes, sir.

613
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,720
Bring us three bowls of jjajangmyeon.

614
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,090

616
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,750
I enjoyed your class.

617
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,470
Oh, really?

618
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:55,520
It reminded me of that night, too.

619
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,800
That night?

620
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,000
How about we satisfy each other
whenever we have the urge?

621
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,850
I'll satisfy you when you need me, too.

622
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,940
It will be amazing.
Pardon?

623
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,320
Rosa, help me over here.

624
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,870
Okay. Coming.

625
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,100
You'll do it, right?

626
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,680
Be my partner?

I'll beg you until you say yes.

Okay.

631
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,140
You agreed to it just now.

632
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,500

633
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,770
Yes.

635
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,630

637
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,740
Of course. How about you?

638
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,150

642
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,450
Over tteokbokki.

643
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,610

647
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,640
Do I have the right?

648
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,020
Yes.

651
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,140
Ma'am,

652
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,560
did the tteokbokki recipe change?

653
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,550
No. It's the same.

654
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,030
I think something's changed.

655
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:26,750
Do you remember the woman I was with last time?

656
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,600
She knows how to enjoy food properly.

657
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,520
She fills up her cheeks like a squirrel

658
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,120
and she hums after she eats
because she's so happy.

659
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,600

Of course, it is.

Why do you keep asking?

666
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,580
It's because I think the taste changed.

667
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,830
It didn't change.

668
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,540

00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,930
No.

733
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,850
It's a third of the daily recommended amount.

734
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,590
What the...

735
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,350
I'd like to talk to you.

736
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,240
I'd like to talk to you, too.

737
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,120
Get me a new trainer starting today.

738
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,290
Pardon?

739
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:40,530
What do you mean-

740
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:43,660
I'll work with Alex from now on.
That's okay, right?

741
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,320
Me?

742
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,520
Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?

743
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
Gosh, my toes were crushed...

744
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,360
They weren't.

745
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,200
What a relief.
I know.

746
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,820
One.

747
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:08,340
Nice. Two.

748
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,960
Two.

749
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Three.
Alex,

750
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,830
that's too much weight.

751
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,830
Ms. Lee said this was her regular weight.

752
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:20,360
Can't you tell she's struggling?

753
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,090
You're right. I'm sorry.

754
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,890
And why did you start with the upper body?

755
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:27,380
The workout log-
Ms. Lee prefers the lower body.

756
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,280
I'm sorry, but could one of you lift this-

757
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,950
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

758
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,920
Are you okay?

759
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,490
Step aside now, Director.

760
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:40,330
My trainer is Alex now.

761
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,420
Should we move on?

762
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,840
Yes.

763
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,300
Slowly.

764
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,120
One.

765
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,240
Two.

766
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,510
Three. Yes.

767
00:45:58,510 --> 00:45:59,800
Four.

768
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,340
She develops trapezius muscles easily.

769
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,930
So-

770
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,700
Should we go somewhere else?
Yes.

771
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,890
Okay. Bend your knees more.

772
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,310
Three.

773
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,630
Nice.

774
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,240
Alex, she has bad knees.

775
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,840
Her body age is about 50.

776
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,930
Make sure she doesn't get
injured while doing squats.

777
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,300
Do something that doesn't affect the knees-
Start with the abs.

778
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,120
She's concerned about the visceral fat.

779
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,670
She needs to do abs daily.

780
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,170
That's enough.

781
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,150
I have huge shoulders since
my trapezius muscles are big,

782
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,090
my body age is 50, and I have visceral fat?

783
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,360
Why would you nag me about it,
following me around?

784
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,720
Well, it's not that-
I'll work out alone today.

785
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,830
Okay.
Geez.

786
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,460
Dang it.

787
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:04,340
Ms. Lee!

788
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:12,730
What's wrong with this now? Come on. Geez.

789
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,780
I went to the tteokbokki shop alone

790
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,610
not because I dislike you.

791
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:31,350
I went there alone because...

792
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,270
I kept thinking about it, no matter
how much I tried to forget.

793
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,820
But...

794
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,920
I realized it clearly at the
tteokbokki shop yesterday.

795
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,890
What I like...

796
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,440
So, I mean...

797
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,650
So, you mean...

798
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,190
Geez, seriously.

799
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,800
Are you okay?

800
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,700
Don't look in the mirror.

801
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,650
You said you were sick and tired of me.

802
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,300
Now, you say you keep thinking
about me. Why would you confuse me?

803
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,230
Hold on a moment. Let me apply ointment for you.

804
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,690
Forget it.

805
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:39,100
I don't get affected by comments
like that anymore.

806
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,230
And I don't like someone who doesn't like me.

807
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,550
I-It's not like that...

[Lee Roy Gym]

809
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,740
Well, the partner-

810
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:04,560
Why did I agree to it, anyway?

811
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,210
Rosa!

812
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,220
Rosa!

813
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,410
Rosa.

814
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:24,400
I...

815
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,010
will be on the cover of Muscle Man Korea.

816
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

817
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,540
Hyeon Joong gave up being on the cover

818
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,190
and recommended me for the job.

819
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,430
Wow.

820
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:41,720
Congrats.

821
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,470
I need to sweat with you now.

822
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:46,770
I can't wait any longer.

823
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:48,920
Right now?

824
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,880
You're working now, right?

825
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,030
Geez, I want to do it so badly.

826
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:57,150
How about at my gym after work?

827
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:59,380
No one will be there.

828
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,660
No.

829
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,230
Why not?

830
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,350
What happened at the gym when we got drunk

831
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,020
was a mistake for me.

832
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,590
I was so drunk.

833
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,230
It was an accident caused by alcohol.

834
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:15,700
So...

835
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,600
well...

836
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,880
If you want a partner to sleep with,

837
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,220
find someone else.

838
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,380
What are you talking about?

839
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,490
A partner to sleep with?

840
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:30,920
You wanted me to be your partner
whenever you needed me.

841
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,930
Yes, a partner.

842
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:36,200
Workout partner. W.P.

843
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,290
I suggested we help each other working out.

844
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,310
We worked out together that night.

845
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,540
After you sobered up. Weren't you sober?

846
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,000
We did squats and bench presses.

847
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:53,800
Nice. Hold tightly!

848
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:57,080
Okay. Eight!

849
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,140
Nice.

850
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,180
Nice. Yes, nice.

851
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,880
Nice, nice, nice!

852
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:12,560
By chance, did you think we did something else?

853
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,460
Yes.

854
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,910

Ms. Lee hasn't come
to the gym in three days.

860
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,920
I no longer enjoy the chest workout

861
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,580
and the thigh workout was no fun.

862
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,760
No muscle workout is enjoyable anymore.

Is Ms. Lee not coming today, either?

867
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,100
I haven't seen her in the last few days.
Is she sick, by chance?

868
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,050
She said she won't come to the gym.

869
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,460
She said you're sick of her.

00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,210
Pardon? What are you talking about?

871
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,130

Ta-da. Don't his abs look great?

970
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:26,610
