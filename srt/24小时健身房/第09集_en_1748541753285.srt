1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,060
I

3
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,980
See good

4
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,860
If I can says my forever

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm so sick of it

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a real picture

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What did I do in my life that I fought?

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Did I meet a man like you?

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Didn't you save the country too?

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I saved the universe

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Guys, let's eat chicken!

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, the timing is really...

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Just the moment you're hungry

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Is it good?

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's good

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to eat slowly

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Here, here, here

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Thank you, Choyong

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, thanks

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hey, you eat a lot too

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What's this? What about this Octan?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What's an Octan?

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The sharpness of the eye and the angle of the eyebrows

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The move that lost the path

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's the face that you look like when you're on OctanBuri

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And the decisive evidence!

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Even though the chicken is in front of you

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The tail is too much

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Even if the sound of the chicken comes out, it should be instinctively hidden

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What's with that tail?

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Isn't it?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He's like a professional pilot

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Not a professional pilot, a professional pilot

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I'm just shooting one shot because I'm doing a good thing today

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't be a fool

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Good thing?

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Today, I succeeded for the first time in my life

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm a professional pilot

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What?

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You know, how many number of times I've had a hard time in my life

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You know, if it were me, I would have been already a guest

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I avoided that today, really, actively

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What are you talking about?

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I almost confessed my lie today

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Confess? Who?

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Are you talking about the blind man?

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You're talking about the director?

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm talking about you

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What?

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How do you know?

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I saw you when you were working out for the first time in the company

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Your face that fell in love looked like me

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Like my face looking at the mirror

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Honey

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I thought it was the blind man at first

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But in the end, I liked him

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
After I recognized his feelings, I was really screwed

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Do you know what I saw in the middle of the time?

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Kang Sol and the director coming out of the hotel

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Isn't this really a relief?

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I mean, the man who likes you?

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a relief that you're coming out of the hotel with another woman?

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's a relief! I confessed and I saw that

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How embarrassing!

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you're embarrassed, you can't even exercise

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But if I'm not there, I won't even exercise

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Because I'm addicted to the exercise of the gym

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Then I would have been in the middle of the gym

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I would have been in the middle of the gym

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is a total of 1,000 won!

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But isn't it all about dating because you're coming out of the hotel with a man and a woman?

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, that's right

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It doesn't matter

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why? Why doesn't it matter?

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I thought about it on my way back

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I confessed and I saw that

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Then the next thing I saw was the problem

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Is it really happy to be in a relationship with that Harry Chigwang?

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What's wrong?

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, another ghost!

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ghost?

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The ghost in your neck doesn't match at all

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What are you doing?

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What's wrong with you?

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's right

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Look up

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You should only worry about your ex-girlfriend's financial problems

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You must have endured it and married her with your love

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Then that person must have...

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wake up!

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Love!

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Wake up!

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Love!

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Love!

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Love!

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Love!

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Love!

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Love!

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Love!

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're my girl

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're going to get a lot of trouble if you don't worry about your muscles

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Then you'll get married and live anyway

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm coming out soon!

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
One!

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
One!

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Two!

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Two!

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Three!

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Three?

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Bam!

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Give me a break!

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey, are you buying it?

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Isn't it so terrible just thinking about it?

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But you can't do this because you're not starting

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is a total mess

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What do you mean by a total mess?

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're so lucky

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I thought we'd even get married

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm crying

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're not even dating a guy

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You're even imagining things

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why?

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You should have a 100-year-old and even a 4-year-old

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You wouldn't cry even when you're 4-year-old

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Why?

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Because you're a big-hearted girl

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm already done

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You're imagining things

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hey, please, I like you more

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's so noisy

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't worry, I'm fine

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm the one who's mistaken

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm the one who's mistaken

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But before we even start

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm so lucky that I can give up on my own

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Anyway, you're not a fool anymore

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're not even crying because you're not dating a guy

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay?

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm going in

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I guess he's having a hard time

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He keeps singing

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He's not just turning around

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What should I do?

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What should I do?

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The director always says

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Human body is always the beginning of recovery

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The beginning of recovery

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The muscles become stronger after the wound gets healed

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The body of the future president is getting stronger

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
right now

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
More! More!

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Did the wounds of love that I've been wearing

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
make me run away?

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That day, I thought I was really fine

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Director

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hello

160
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You look in a good condition today

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes, I worked out

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and I think I'm feeling better

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Fighting today!

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I feel good

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But I didn't have the desire to recover

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Good

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, my God

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I feel so good because I'm the best in the world

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you sure you've never seen them?

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's the first time I've seen them

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
They look so good together

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So, they look like sweet potatoes and dongchimi

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Sweet potatoes are the best

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's eat sweet potatoes

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Did you sleep well?

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I couldn't sleep for a minute

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You couldn't sleep

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm so tired

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Be prepared

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll walk you from head to toe all night

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm looking forward to it

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's delicious

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Director?

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What are you doing here?

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm here for a meeting

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
A messenger

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No, I was here before

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Where are you two going?

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Where are you going?

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm going to work out

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But you and Sol were dating

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You look good together

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Of course, I'm the one who goes well with Sol

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Bong-won

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What?

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's talk

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes, yes

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's a secret

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
A secret?

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So, you're going to date or not?

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Why are you here?

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You're the head of the health department

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's weird to be here with your head on the ground

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're here

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You forgot everything

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're the only one who knows

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're the only one who knows

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Look at who you think you are

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Let's be honest

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You said you liked me

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But you're here to win

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And you like the fact that you only think about Hyun-joo

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh, Mr. Lee Bong-won

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You're here to work out?

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's a class for the midterm soon

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You must go

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, yes

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Rui

220
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Rui

221
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Rui

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You bastard

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You're so annoying

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm sorry

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I didn't sleep well

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You couldn't sleep

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm going to lose my mind

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What are you thinking about?

229
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Do you have plans after school?

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you want to have dinner with me?

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I have a lot of places to stay

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Dinner?

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What should I do?

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I already had dinner

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What? You didn't eat

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're avoiding me because you're scared

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Really?

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's only 4 o'clock

239
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're having dinner early

240
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Then, coffee

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't really like caffeine

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So I don't drink coffee often

243
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're so mean

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Then, tea or tea?

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Tea and caffeine

246
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Then, ice cream

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm on a diet

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Why are you avoiding me because you're scared?

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Are you running away because you're afraid that you'll be dating Mr. Kang?

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Then, what about tomorrow?

251
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Tomorrow...

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What's different about avoiding me?

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay, fine

254
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Just drink coffee now

255
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Ice cream is fine

256
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Mr. Milan

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Have you ever made a mistake by avoiding Mr. Milan?

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Is that why you're avoiding me?

259
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No, that's not it

260
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But he asked me to buy him a drink

261
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He suddenly said that he's a tea lover

262
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Mr. Milan, do you have someone you like?

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No

265
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No?

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What's that?

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Then, do you have someone you like?

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes, I do

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I do

270
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I have something I'm curious about

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What is it?

272
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You said that you don't like men who work out

273
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I really don't like it

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But I saw it

275
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Mr. Milan and Ms. Sol...

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
At the hotel

277
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh

278
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That...

279
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Mr. Milan and Ms. Sol...

280
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What are you talking about?

281
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You came all the way here to ask that

282
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I was curious

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I didn't know that Mr. Milan and Ms. Sol were so close

284
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Actually, I was in the hotel with Mr. Milan

285
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I was in the hotel

286
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What? What do you mean?

287
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Do you want to see it?

288
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No, no, no, no, no

289
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm not going to watch it

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Why? Mr. Milan will watch it and give you feedback

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No, I don't want to watch it

292
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
No!

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I think I'm going to die

294
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Just a little more

295
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Just a little more

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm so sick

297
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm going to die

298
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Mr. Milan, did you have a relationship with Ms. Sol?

299
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Wow, it's so hot

300
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Look at us. We're in a emergency

301
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Mr. Milan

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Come in

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm wearing what I've done

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Welcome, jacket

305
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can't give you

306
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What?

307
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
My body

308
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't take my body anywhere without my heart

309
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You don't have time. Take it off quickly

310
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
How far are you going to go?

311
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What?

312
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Is this what you really want?

313
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Then your stomach will feel better

314
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Look

315
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Are you satisfied now?

316
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But this is exactly what you can have

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's never going to happen again

318
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The camera lighting is ready

319
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Are you the guest?

320
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What?

321
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What are you thinking?

322
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Are we going to film a sports content today?

323
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll start

324
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
We're here

325
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Thank you

326
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Thank you

327
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Please go

328
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I mean, if it's a film, I should have told you

329
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I was going to tell you at first

330
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But I want to tease you because I see your face

331
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Honestly, I was curious

332
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If you would come here

333
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I came here

334
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I know that you don't want to know about me

335
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm not that kind of person anymore

336
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I really came here to work out with you

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm a little sick

338
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What?

339
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Other trainers say that I shouldn't be sick

340
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But you're different

341
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You were the worst boyfriend

342
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm the best trainer

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You're the best, but...

344
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You're still the same

345
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I always did my best

346
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Whether it's work or love

347
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I didn't regret it because I did my best

348
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But this time, I'm sure

349
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'll do my best to heal you

350
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No matter what you say

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll do my best

352
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I can do that

353
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But if you want to do that

354
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I need you

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Help me

356
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm sorry

357
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'll give you a protein

358
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Okay, I'm done with the protein

359
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Didn't you say you were going to work out?

360
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes, why?

361
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But you said you were going to do a mascara

362
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I haven't done it in a while

363
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Did you do eye shadow?

364
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I just applied it on my face

365
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Why?

366
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm going to throw it away

367
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Why?

368
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Didn't you say you gave up?

369
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You found out that you were a woman

370
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You were so surprised

371
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You even imagined that you were going to work out

372
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You died yesterday

373
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I was wrong

374
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I heard you filmed a video with Kang Sol at the hotel

375
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
This is the scene where you changed the hyperextension

376
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You have a long waist, round hips, and back

377
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And you have a strong spine

378
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's a very helpful exercise

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll pay you later, come to the premium

380
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So? You're going to like it?

381
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's not about your feelings

382
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's about your skin texture

383
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That kind of shiny skin

384
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm worried about that kind of thing

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That kind of shiny skin

386
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Hey!

387
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What?

388
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm going to apply lipstick again

389
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You're a warm tone, so it won't look good

390
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What's wrong with you?

391
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Then do it right

392
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So?

393
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay, let's go

394
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'll go and beat the boss

395
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'll beat the boss

396
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay

397
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Wait for me

398
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Let's go

399
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Huh?

400
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Where are you going?

401
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm so worried about you

402
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Eat the boiled egg

403
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Okay

404
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What's that?

405
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Where were you?

406
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You didn't answer my call for 40, 9, 20, or 3 seconds?

407
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
No, nothing

408
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You have a secret with me?

409
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Hey, I heard that you're a American

410
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You said you're a Cali

411
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So you're going to be with me

412
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And you're going to be on the street

413
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Home?

414
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'll wash up, too

415
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Is that the concept?

416
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's delicious

417
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll wash up

418
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, my God!

419
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Boss, just confess

420
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What do you mean?

421
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You said you're going to confess

422
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What did you eat yesterday?

423
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Are you the kind of person who eats secretly?

424
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yes, I'm the kind of person

425
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But don't worry

426
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm the one who makes you exercise more than you eat

427
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll start with the fried rice

428
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's time to eat the delicious fried rice

429
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
One!

430
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Look at that deep sports car

431
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I almost fell out

432
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Look at that sharp nose

433
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I almost fell out every day

434
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What's that moist mouth?

435
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I almost got it

436
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
If you like training, you can see people you want to see

437
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What's that face?

438
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Was I like this until now?

439
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No, you can't

440
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You're just like that

441
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Let's go to the next exercise

442
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But I really don't want to see myself

443
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
being close to you

444
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Here, three sets of 20

445
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You're going to do it right away

446
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Put strength on your back

447
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's morning

448
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Put your hands together

449
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Breathe in

450
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yes, it's very elegant

451
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You don't look tired, your hair is fine

452
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
If you're good at facial care, you'll be in trouble

453
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Put your head up to the top of your shoulder

454
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm screwed

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What?

456
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What are you doing? I got it right

457
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What's going on?

458
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Are you okay?

459
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Are you okay?

460
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm sorry

461
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Shut up!

462
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm sorry

463
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Don't go near me until I clean up

464
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You might get hurt if you see me

465
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You must have been surprised

466
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That's it for the exercise

467
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Don't forget to finish the stretching

468
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Let's go

469
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm sorry

470
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
My mirror broke

471
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
My image broke

472
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What's going on?

473
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh, my

474
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What's going on?

475
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The mirror broke

476
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I couldn't use it

477
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I almost got hurt

478
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You were close to the mirror

479
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I think you two are sure

480
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I can feel it

481
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You like the inflow-edge version 100%

482
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I've never seen you do that

483
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Stay still

484
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You're acting like a drama queen

485
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You're acting like a drama queen

486
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
How can we be so mean to you?

487
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I was just looking at the sweet thing

488
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I was craving for it

489
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I got a new Chinese restaurant in front of the tax

490
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's amazing

491
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
How can you hit me with a jjamppong?

492
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Jjamppong is good

493
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Then, should we go with the manager and the inflow-edge?

494
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
No!

495
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What?

496
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You can't do that?

497
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
The jjajangmyeon is good

498
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Thank you, Min-ah

499
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I almost got hurt

500
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Thank you, I'll eat the jjajangmyeon

501
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You eat the jjajangmyeon with side dishes, right?

502
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Min-ah, you're so...

503
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm not eating side dishes

504
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm eating the jjajangmyeon

505
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I need some time to clean up and get my health back

506
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What about the members' exercise?

507
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I have to rest

508
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Right?

509
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I have to rest

510
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Exercise?

511
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm sorry

512
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'll give you the award

513
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
No, it's not like that

514
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Ms. Hyo-yeon

515
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Can I ask you to give me an award?

516
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
An award?

517
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Where can I go to exercise on a Sunday?

518
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Who are you talking to?

519
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm sorry

520
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I didn't know you were here

521
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Didn't you go home?

522
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Why didn't you go home?

523
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I was going to go to the gym on a Sunday

524
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I planned it

525
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
The gym?

526
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I guess the gym atmosphere is really good

527
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You should exercise

528
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm a sportsman

529
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I have a physical strength and a good energy

530
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But you don't look like a good energy in exercise

531
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
What?

532
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Whatever it is, I'm happy just for you

533
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Thank you

534
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'll recommend the beach

535
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I have a lot of good memories with my wife

536
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Beach?

537
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Okay

538
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm here

539
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Good job

540
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Boss

541
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What are you doing?

542
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm learning to do broadcasting with my daughter

543
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm so happy

544
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Thank you

545
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Bye

546
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Where did she go?

547
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Oh, my

548
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's been 10 years

549
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You're learning now?

550
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
A health camp with nature

551
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
How is it?

552
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
As the director said,

553
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm going to focus on health and healing

554
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Wow, the beach

555
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's been a long time since I went to the beach

556
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Wow, the directors must really like it

557
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I really want to go there

558
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's a whole house

559
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
What's this?

560
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
A health camp with nature?

561
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
While the gym is being preserved,

562
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm going to leave the gym with the members

563
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Even if you stop the bike on the ground, you shouldn't stop exercising

564
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Leave the gym with the stuff

565
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
If you exercise with nature,

566
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
you'll be able to help your body and mental health

567
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But

568
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
you're only going to sweat for a few days?

569
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That's possible

570
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I planned it

571
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Oh, if you plan it,

572
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
you'll eat pork belly

573
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Pork belly has a lot of fat

574
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Prepare the beef with a lot of confidence

575
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Where do we get the beef?

576
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Then, with the neck

577
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm going to prepare pork belly, pork belly, and even the skin

578
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Jeju pork and pork

579
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I can't stand pork

580
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Let's have a meeting

581
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
What's this?

582
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Okay

583
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Is it good for your health?

584
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It's not love and passion?

585
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Shut up

586
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Did you put this on yourself?

587
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yes

588
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Hey

589
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
What the...

590
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Oh, no

591
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
What's with you?

592
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What are you all doing right now?

593
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's been a while since I've had a cold

594
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I can't believe it

595
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Let's take a picture

596
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Why do you exercise like that?

597
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,120
You're good at wearing clothes like this.

598
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,620
Honey, right?

599
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,460
I'll put it in my house first.

600
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Honey.

601
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,560
What's wrong with him? He's so fast.

602
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,260
Hello.

603
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
Yes.

604
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,460
You're here.

605
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,200
What? I told you I picked you.

606
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,280
You're a man, but you're a girl.

607
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,280
Are you going to be so hard on me?

608
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,840
You don't know anything.

609
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,580
That Hyeji is a girl who must wear this skillful training uniform.

610
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,580
What?

611
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Ms. Miran.

612
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Yes?

613
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,480
You're so cool today.

614
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,560
You look good in this outfit and you look good in sweat.

615
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,720
I think

616
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,960
the best dresser is Ms. Miran.

617
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,260
Really? Thank you.

618
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,960
Hey, did you see that?

619
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
Awesome.

620
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,640
You look so pretty.

621
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,840
No, I didn't.

622
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,940
I just bought a new one.

623
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,340
No, no.

624
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,840
Oh, my.

625
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,920
My god.

626
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,280
You look beautiful only when you're wearing a good one.

627
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,340
Look at that, he's still 24, don't you think so?

628
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,240
He's all choked up since I couldn't even see his feet.

629
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,220
Why do I look so hot wearing training uniform?

630
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Are you sure you're satisfied with the surgery?

631
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Isn't that a must-have for a surgeon?

632
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
What's so cool?

633
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
It's okay.

634
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
It's my functionality.

635
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Let's go.

636
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Hurry up and get the stuff.

637
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Okay.

638
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
No, no.

639
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
You're so annoying.

640
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
Did you get the stuff?

641
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Yes.

642
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Director, let's go together.

643
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
It's narrow.

644
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
Shall we sit down?

645
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
Over there?

646
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Yes.

647
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,480
So you're going to the hospital?

648
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
Let's go.

649
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Let's go.

650
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Let's go.

651
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Let's go.

652
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
Let's go.

653
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Don't look at me like that.

654
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
I can see you again.

655
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
You're so cute.

656
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Why are you doing this to me?

657
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
It's because of you.

658
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
I pushed Jeonghan away.

659
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
It's me.

660
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
It's me.

661
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
I warned you.

662
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,480
You're the worst at dating a guy who works out.

663
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,480
I know that, too.

664
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,480
But it's not as easy as it looks.

665
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
It's a secret.

666
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Okay?

667
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
But you don't know, do you?

668
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
I'll cheer for you

669
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,480
to see if you're different.

670
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
I'll cheer for you.

671
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
We're here.

672
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
Please come out.

673
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Thank you.

674
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
You're so cute.

675
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
What's going on?

676
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
What did you two talk about?

677
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
I mean...

678
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
I'm not sure what you like about me.

679
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
What do you mean?

680
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
You're doing well.

681
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Really?

682
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Is that so?

683
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,480
It's important to be so serious

684
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,480
about what you like about dating.

685
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Right, honey?

686
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
Yes.

687
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Keep asking for help.

688
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,480
It'll be easier than you think.

689
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Bye.

690
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,480
Kang Dan.

691
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,480
What's wrong?

692
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
What?

693
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
You keep thinking about others.

694
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,480
You keep saying you're against me.

695
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Have you changed?

696
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
Everybody's changing.

697
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Everyone's changing like the English band Kine.

698
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
What are you saying?

699
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,480
Stop using the word hard.

700
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Have you changed?

701
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
Let's go.

702
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
What's wrong with you?

703
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
You're so frustrating.

704
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
The first class of the gym with nature is

705
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
aerobic exercise.

706
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,480
It's called a beach date.

707
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
It's a very effective exercise

708
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,480
to increase your body strength.

709
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Let's enjoy the clean air

710
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
and run around.

711
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
The beach with the sparkling water

712
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,480
and the sparkling director.

713
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Oh, Chairman.

714
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,480
You did a great job

715
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
at the camp with the water.

716
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,480
When you run,

717
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
you need to put your arms and legs more firmly.

718
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,480
You need to get your strength to run faster.

719
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
Oh, my.

720
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Chairman, can you see my strength?

721
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
Oh, that's great.

722
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
You're good.

723
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
What's wrong with you?

724
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
Did you put your arms and legs up?

725
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,480
Oh, Miran, you're so naughty.

726
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
What should I do?

727
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Should I go for a break?

728
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Let's run.

729
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
Let's run.

730
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Look over there.

731
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
Hurry up and come here.

732
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
No, no.

733
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Let's run.

734
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
I love you.

735
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
Let's run.

736
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
No, go back.

737
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,480
It's a week.

738
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
You're not getting up.

739
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Chairman, come back to the end.

740
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,480
Don't forget your arms and legs.

741
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Chairman Kang.

742
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Are you okay?

743
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Yes.

744
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Don't forget your arms and legs.

745
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Your strength.

746
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
I'm sorry.

747
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
I'm so frustrated.

748
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Next, Lee Gyu is a muscle-weight athlete.

749
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,480
He works out and plays sand.

750
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,480
We can exercise anytime, anywhere,

751
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,480
even if we're not in the gym.

752
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
If you look around,

753
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,480
sand can be our weight.

754
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Where are the other members?

755
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,480
It's a three-level or five-level.

756
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
How can you do that?

757
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
Of course, I can.

758
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
What are you doing?

759
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
What are you doing?

760
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
I'm a gym instructor.

761
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
You're still a gym instructor.

762
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
You should exercise first.

763
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,480
Life doesn't always go according to plan.

764
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,480
Did you plan this?

765
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
I did.

766
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,480
Then, let's go.

767
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
Let's go.

768
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Don't film the fight.

769
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,480
Let's do some charming things.

770
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,480
It's so good.

771
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,480
Why are you filming meat?

772
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,480
You should talk to the director.

773
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,480
You don't know what my best plotting is.

774
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,480
I've never been a person who doesn't like grilled meat.

775
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I'm going to grill pork neck and beef in a big way.

776
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,480
Look.

777
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,480
I'm going to keep the meat and the director's heart.

778
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
I think I'm going to get it.

779
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
I'll do it.

780
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
No, no.

781
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Try this.

782
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
I think I grilled this.

783
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
Is this pork neck?

784
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
It looks like a piece of meat.

785
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
Right?

786
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
Eat a lot.

787
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
What?

788
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
It's really meat.

789
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,480
We're not done yet.

790
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Okay.

791
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
No, I'm fine.

792
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Eat.

793
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,480
What's wrong?

794
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,480
Wait a minute.

795
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Look at your face.

796
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
I can't see.

797
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Why are you looking at me?

798
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
Look at me.

799
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,480
I'll blow it for you.

800
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
Director Bong!

801
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
Yes?

802
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
Yes?

803
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,480
Director Kang, you must be feeling bad.

804
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
I think you should tap this.

805
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
You're eating soju.

806
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,480
No, I'm really fine.

807
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
I'm really fine.

808
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,480
You're not feeling well?

809
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
I'm fine.

810
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
I ate a lot this morning.

811
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
That's why I'm feeling that way.

812
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Director Bong!

813
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
Nice to meet you!

814
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,480
I'm so happy to see you!

815
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
I'm so happy to see you.

816
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
You're so pretty.

817
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
I'm so happy to see you.

818
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
I'm so happy to see you.

819
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
I'm so happy to see you.

820
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
The last class is...

821
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
walking.

822
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,480
I wanted to say

823
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,480
I'm on a walk and on a date.

824
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Now, everyone, get up.

825
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Stand up.

826
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
No, no.

827
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,480
I'm not the one who's the one.

828
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,480
I'm not the one who's the one.

829
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
I'm not the one who's the one.

830
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,480
I'm not the one.

831
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
I'm not the one.

832
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
I'm not the one.

833
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,480
I know a better blood sugar management exercise than walking.

834
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
What?

835
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,480
Well...

836
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
How about a real-time game?

837
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
What?

838
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,480
If you can't answer the real-time game,

839
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,480
you can do a squat.

840
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
I think that would be better for exercise.

841
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
Oh, that's right.

842
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,480
That's right.

843
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,480
That's right.

844
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,480
That's right.

845
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,480
It's a real-time game.

846
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
You're laughing at me.

847
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
Real-time games are so fun.

848
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
Let's do it.

849
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,480
Let's start with this.

850
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,480
Okay.

851
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,480
Me first?

852
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,480
Director.

853
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Yes!

854
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
What's your relationship with Hori?

855
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,480
Oh, yes, yes.

856
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,480
We were so curious about that.

857
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,480
I was going to ask that question.

858
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
What kind of relationship is a relationship?

859
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,480
We're not even that close to the director.

860
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,480
You can't lie.

861
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,480
Then, can you keep your muscles tight?

862
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,480
You two are not in a relationship?

863
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,480
Why are you keeping your muscles tight?

864
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,480
You're not the one who made it, director.

865
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,480
Director.

866
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,480
I told you two were in a good relationship.

867
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,480
You two are so good together.

868
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
I'm not lying.

869
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,480
Director!

870
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,480
If you're going to lie, do a squat!

871
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,480
That's not true!

872
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,480
Do a squat!

873
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,480
Do a squat!

874
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,480
We met.

875
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,480
We met a long time ago.

876
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,480
Oh, my God.

877
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,480
I didn't tell you because you were all uncomfortable.

878
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,480
We met a long time ago.

879
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,480
But we're not in a relationship now.

880
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
I have to exercise.

881
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,480
I came because I needed someone to do it with me.

882
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,480
Good job!

883
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,480
I'm not here to do it because I don't have anyone to exercise with.

884
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,480
I'm not here to do it because I don't have anyone to exercise with.

885
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,480
I'm not here to do it because I don't have anyone to exercise with.

886
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,480
Why are you so mean?

887
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,480
You two are good friends.

888
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,480
You two have a good relationship.

889
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,480
I mean, you said you'd meet each other after you did a squat.

890
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,480
Why are you so mean to me?

891
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
Stop.

892
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
Stop crying.

893
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,480
Let's stop.

894
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
What?

895
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,480
Honey, are you not going to break up with me?

896
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,480
I'm sorry.

897
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,480
Honey.

898
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,480
Honey.

899
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,480
Honey.

900
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,480
Honey.

901
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,480
Honey.

902
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,480
Honey.

903
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,480
Honey.

904
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,480
How about playing a song?

905
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,480
We were playing a song earlier.

906
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,480
Really?

907
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,480
There is no better place than a song.

908
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,480
You're right.

909
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,480
You're right.

910
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,480
Let's go.

911
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,480
What's wrong?

912
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,480
What's wrong?

913
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,480
Why are you crying?

914
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,480
Honey.

915
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,480
Honey.

916
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,480
Honey.

917
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,480
Honey.

918
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,480
Honey.

919
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,480
Honey.

920
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,480
Honey.

921
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,480
Honey.

922
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,480
Honey.

923
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,480
Honey.

924
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,480
Honey.

925
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,480
Honey.

926
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,480
Honey.

927
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,480
The captain doesn't know lies, so he's always like that.

928
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,480
I can't do this.

929
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,480
Leave me alone.

930
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,480
Let's go to the right.

931
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,480
I've been looking for you.

932
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,480
I've been looking for you.

933
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,480
I've been looking for you.

934
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,480
I've been looking for you.

935
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,480
I'm sorry.

936
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,480
Is your stomach uncomfortable?

937
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,480
Yes, a little.

938
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,480
Wait a minute. I'll give you a small piece.

939
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,480
Thank you.

940
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
You can have two.

941
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,480
I'll get you some water.

942
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,480
Thank you.

943
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,480
No.

944
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,480
What?

945
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,480
You can't eat this.

946
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,480
Why not?

947
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,480
It's mine.

948
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,480
You can give it to me, but not to me.

949
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,480
No, you can't.

950
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,480
Give it to me.

951
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,480
Can't you give me this much?

952
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,480
I can't.

953
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,480
Give it to me.

954
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,480
Give me this much.

955
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,480
No.

956
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,480
It's mine.

957
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,480
This is a drug-based painkiller.

958
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,480
Drug-based painkiller?

959
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,480
Hey!

960
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,480
Hi, Mr. Lee.

961
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
Hi, Mr. Lee.

962
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,480
Hey!

963
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,480
Hi, Mr. Lee.

964
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,480
Are you okay?

965
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,480
Hey.

966
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,480
What?

967
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,480
I don't need to go to Miran's hospital.

968
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,480
What are you talking about?

969
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,480
The medicine you took was not mine.

970
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,480
What?

971
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,480
It was a real digest.

972
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,480
The medicine was the same.

973
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
Okay.

974
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,480
Chairman, come down.

975
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,480
I know what happened.

976
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,480
What?

977
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,480
What?

978
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,480
Why did you fall down after taking the digest?

979
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,480
Well...

980
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,480
You said it was a drug-based painkiller,

981
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,480
so I'm dizzy and can't remember.

982
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,480
But why are you taking the drug-based painkiller?

983
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,480
I'll explain that to you.

984
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,480
Oh, my.

985
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,480
Oh, Mr. Lee!

986
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,480
The foot...

987
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,480
Oh, it's okay.

988
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,480
What's okay?

989
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,480
Huh?

990
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,480
Oh, my.

991
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,480
Oh, my.

992
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,480
Oh, my.

993
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,480
Oh, my.

994
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,480
What?

995
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,480
Oh, my.

996
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,480
How can you go down the mountain with your foot like that?

997
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,480
Oh, my.

998
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,480
I worked out until now to walk.

999
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,480
Oh, my.

1000
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,480
You know how much I weigh.

1001
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,480
I know you weigh 60kg.

1002
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,480
You weigh less than that.

1003
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,480
Oh, my.

1004
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,480
I caught a mosquito.

1005
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,480
I can do it.

1006
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,480
It's okay.

1007
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,480
I'm okay.

1008
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,480
Oh, my.

1009
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,480
Oh, my.

1010
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,480
Oh, my.

1011
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,480
Oh, my.

1012
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,480
I thought it was a big deal.

1013
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,480
Why did you faint after taking the digest?

1014
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,480
Oh, that...

1015
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,480
You said you ate too much.

1016
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,480
No, I don't think I ate much.

1017
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,480
I'm really sorry for making you worry.

1018
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,480
But I'm really okay now.

1019
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,480
Oh, my.

1020
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,480
Oh, my.

1021
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,480
Oh, my.

1022
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,480
I've never seen anyone faint after taking digest.

1023
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
Take a rest.

1024
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,480
I'm sorry.

1025
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,480
I'm sorry.

1026
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,480
Why did you eat a lot of digest?

1027
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,480
I'm sorry.

1028
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,480
I'm sorry.

1029
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,480
I'm sorry.

1030
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,480
I'm sorry.

1031
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,480
I'm sorry.

1032
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:29,480
Can you talk to me for a minute?

1033
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,480
Yes.

1034
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,480
Ms. Hori.

1035
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,480
Can I ask you something?

1036
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,480
Why do you eat digested digest?

1037
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,480
I'm a little sick.

1038
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,480
What?

1039
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,480
You were surprised, right?

1040
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,480
I'm always perfect on social media.

1041
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,480
Ms. Hori.

1042
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,480
Are you okay?

1043
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,480
Yes, I'm okay.

1044
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,480
I guess I ate a lot of lunch.

1045
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,480
People like me.

1046
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,480
But do you want me to like you too?

1047
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,480
I'm not confident.

1048
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,480
I'm confident that I'll be loved even if I show myself.

1049
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,480
Yes.

1050
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,480
Yes.

1051
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,480
I'm envious of you, Miran, who doesn't hide her.

1052
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,480
Am I envious?

1053
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,480
I asked if you liked me.

1054
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,480
Yes.

1055
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,480
Was that Miran?

1056
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,480
Yes.

1057
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,480
I've always thought of you.

1058
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,480
I want to be honest with you at least once.

1059
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,480
So I have something I want to do.

1060
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,480
What is it?

1061
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,480
I want to take a body profile.

1062
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,480
Body?

1063
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,480
Well, it's not perfect.

1064
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,480
A honest body profile that can show me what's there.

1065
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,480
Ms. Hori.

1066
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,480
Are you going to cheer me on?

1067
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,480
Of course.

1068
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,480
Let's work out together.

1069
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,480
I'll be the best fitness partner that I'll never give up.

1070
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,480
Why are you so cold?

1071
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,480
It's so pretty.

1072
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,480
What are you two doing?

1073
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,480
Stop it.

1074
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,480
Let's go to the flower shop.

1075
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,480
Go ahead.

1076
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,480
Go ahead.

1077
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,480
Go ahead.

1078
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,480
Go ahead.

1079
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,480
Go ahead.

1080
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,480
Go ahead.

1081
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,480
Go ahead.

1082
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,480
Go ahead.

1083
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,480
Go ahead.

1084
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,480
Go ahead.

1085
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,480
Go ahead.

1086
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,480
Go ahead.

1087
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,480
Go ahead.

1088
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,480
Go ahead.

1089
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,480
Go ahead.

1090
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,480
Go ahead.

1091
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,480
Go ahead.

1092
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,480
Okay, okay.

1093
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,480
Nice job!

1094
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,480
Build better!

1095
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,480
12.

1096
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,480
I caught you right away.

1097
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,480
We're going together.

1098
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:58,480
16.

1099
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,480
We're going to lift up the weight of the day every day.

1100
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,480
Do your best as much as you can.

1101
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,480
But you have to take a body profile.

1102
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,480
Can you eat something like this?

1103
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,480
Kang Sol-hye is important to eat well.

1104
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,480
Eating well is important.

1105
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,480
You should have told me earlier.

1106
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,480
You're the best.

1107
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,480
You can eat well if you're good at it.

1108
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,480
I'm really eating.

1109
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,480
Seol-hee, let's go eat tteokbokki after we're done.

1110
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,480
I'm going to eat tteokbokki with fried sundae.

1111
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,480
Wow, you're really good at it.

1112
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,480
Are you talking about eating while eating?

1113
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,480
You said you're good at it.

1114
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,480
I know.

1115
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
You said you're good at it.

1116
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,480
Yes.

1117
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,480
It's a trash.

1118
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,480
I look like tteokbokki.

1119
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,480
You look really like it.

1120
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,480
What did you just say?

1121
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,480
You look like tteokbokki.

1122
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,480
You look like an egg.

1123
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,480
It looks delicious.

1124
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,480
But do you know that?

1125
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,480
In the tteokbokki soup.

1126
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,480
I tried my best for a healthy tomorrow.

1127
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,480
Excuse me.

1128
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,480
Sign.

1129
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,480
But...

1130
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,480
Is there really no sad ending?

1131
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,480
I didn't answer the phone,

1132
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,480
but I'm going to increase my weight today.

1133
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,480
Don't worry.

1134
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,480
There's no sad ending.

1135
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,480
I waited for a healthy tomorrow.

1136
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,480
Thank you.

1137
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,480
Thank you.

1138
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,480
How's your condition?

1139
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,480
I'm good.

1140
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,480
I'm really good.

1141
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,480
I guess I'm a bad sportsman.

1142
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,480
No, it's the effect of exercise.

1143
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:02,480
I'm sorry that I asked you to break up with me in an important meeting.

1144
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,480
I just wanted to be someone who's more important than exercise to you.

1145
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,480
I thought you were the worst boyfriend back then,

1146
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,480
but when I think about it,

1147
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,480
I don't think I was that good to you.

1148
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,480
Do you know that you've changed a lot?

1149
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,480
Me?

1150
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,480
Yes.

1151
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:34,480
I think you've become more important to me than exercise.

1152
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,480
More important than exercise?

1153
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,480
I'm good.

1154
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,480
What's all this?

1155
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,480
I bought you something to eat after the body profile.

1156
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,480
After the meal, it's a soup to eat delicious food.

1157
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,480
Who told you to do that?

1158
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,480
You said you can eat whatever you want.

1159
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,480
Yes, you can eat whatever you want.

1160
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,480
Thank you.

1161
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,480
Director, Miran.

1162
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,480
I knew it would be a success if I worked out this time.

1163
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,480
What?

1164
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,480
I knew that I would win.

1165
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,480
I knew it too.

1166
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,480
You're a really cool person.

1167
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,480
Miran, too.

1168
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,480
No.

1169
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,480
You're cool enough and you can win.

1170
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,480
Come on.

1171
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,480
It's showtime.

1172
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,480
Thank you.

1173
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,480
Fighting!

1174
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,480
Director.

1175
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,480
I can see it.

1176
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,480
How much I've done.

1177
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,480
Our body has our own life.

1178
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,480
What kind of life you lived.

1179
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,480
What kind of life you wanted to live.

1180
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,480
What kind of life you wanted to live.

1181
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,480
Hello.

1182
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,480
Please come in.

1183
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,480
Thank you.

1184
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,480
Hello, please come in.

1185
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,480
Thank you.

1186
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,480
Thank you.

1187
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,480
Hello.

1188
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,480
Please come in.

1189
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,480
I'll take your seat.

1190
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,480
Okay.

1191
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,480
Hello, please come in.

1192
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,480
Thank you.

1193
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,480
Thank you.

1194
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,480
Director, where are you going?

1195
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,480
Director!

1196
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,480
But that day,

1197
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,480
our body lied to us.

1198
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,480
Director!

1199
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,480
Director!

1200
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,480
But that day,

1201
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,480
our body lied to us.

1202
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,480
Director!

1203
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,480
Why are you laughing?

1204
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,480
Why are you laughing?

1205
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,480
Please speed up.

1206
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,480
This person.

1207
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,480
Director!

1208
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,480
I'll tell you what to tell.

1209
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,480
What do you want to tell me?

1210
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,480
Director, you're such a bad guy.

1211
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,480
Director Kang made a mistake

1212
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,480
and put on a proper treatment.

1213
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,480
Director Kang pushed Director Kang

1214
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,480
into the water.

1215
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,480
I'm sorry.

1216
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,480
I'm sorry.

1217
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,480
I'm sorry.

1218
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,480
I should get the doctor here.

1219
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,480
What?

1220
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,480
Someone is going to give you two times the fine.

1221
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,480
Please stop.

1222
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,480
Director,

1223
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,480
please stop asking.

1224
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,480
I don't think I can do it anymore.

1225
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,480
Director!
