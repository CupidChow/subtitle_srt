1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to buy a new running machine.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to send an old running machine to you now.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What?

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Director.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What should I do at this time?

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What should I do?

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I dropped my high-end arrow.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I found a running machine for my baby.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I thought it was okay.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I thought it was stronger now.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, no, no.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Even if that person sends a text.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's Junseong.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The person recommended by Mira of the Hawhai PR team.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Even if the live market recommended me,

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not curious about Mira.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I heard that you recommended Mira to the PR team.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I thought it was really okay.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But the moment I saw him.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I was reacting first.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Run away.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I thought I could say hello to him cool even if I accidentally face him.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I ran away.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Still, it's a little bit dirty.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Chairman.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Shall we run?

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not thinking about it.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's on this leg.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't just think about it and move.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, I'm going to stop working out.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What?

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I want to stop working.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm still in my place no matter how I'm in.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm just a loser.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why are you in your place?

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The zombie-like body is now a power of gravity.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I heard it.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But I hid it from the power of gravity that I increased.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Chairman.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you change your body, your life will change, right?

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But I don't think so.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll go.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Chairman.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Chairman.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Chairman.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Look at this.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Why is this chicken breast?

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No, when the director said he should eat this when he works out.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
When did I ever say you can eat this kind of seasoning?

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's better to eat chicken breast as light as possible, or to eat it as a minimum.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Try it.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What?

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Try this.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Try it yourself.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Eat it.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Eat this.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes, eat it.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It tastes like seasoned chicken.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's moist, but it's full of protein.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I've looked it up and brought it.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Really?

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No way.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't believe I can fill up the protein in this chicken breast.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm so happy.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But why can't you see me?

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I brought you here.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I see.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can't see you for a few days.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think you're working hard with your sister.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Chairman.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You quit exercising.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I quit?

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why?

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Chairman, what are you doing?

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's not like that.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I think it's just Euntaek.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Euntaek?

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What's that?

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Is it Im Taek?

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, my.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're a doctor.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, my.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, it's not like that.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's a sports plus fitness.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's why it's Euntaek.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The person who worked out hard said that he suddenly got tired of exercising.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I think it's Euntaek.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Look, even though you work out hard, you don't lose weight and you're a politician for 20 years.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's not Euntaek.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Euntaek comes to the person who worked hard.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Then where does my weight come from?

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Here.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, my.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What's this?

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll let you know.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why?

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's help.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're Euntaek.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then you can't see Miraj now?

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I've heard a lot of things.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Me, too.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't worry.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Miraj will come back.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to make it like that.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The meeting that I left for the meeting is coming back so soon.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Euntaek.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I know that Do Hyunjung will come back.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When you do this exercise, you want to get tired and get used to it, but you think more when you don't.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hey, it's been a while, but let's go to the bottom.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's burn the passion with a squat so that Euntaek can go.

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm going to take my house away.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Director.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you like that director?

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What?

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Do you like the director?

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You like it?

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Our director doesn't like anything other than exercise.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You married an athlete.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Then what's this?

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Is it a stalker?

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Stalker.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Good morning, director.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you not come to exercise in the morning?

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Director, call me.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh, it's a really urgent matter.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Tup tup tup tup tup tup tup tup tup.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's hurry up.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sure the exercise is urgent.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Photo?

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh, that person is going to send the photo.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I found it well.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Lee Mi-ran's account has been saved for 1 million won.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Is it a good thing?

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I really can't believe it.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Director, come to exercise again.

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Are you okay?

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Director.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What's wrong with you?

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm really in a hurry.

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why didn't you write the letter?

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't you know that the most annoying thing in the world is the annoying thing?

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes, that's why I came today to avoid the investigation.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Director.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Director.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What is this?

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm a little drunk because I was afraid you'd take the luggage when I was not here.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You can just let it go.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Director, it's a life-threatening task for anyone.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is just a exercise that can overcome it.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Get out of the way.

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Director, are you already there?

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Are the two degrees, three degrees, and the light are so meaningless?

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, my God.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Romantic era.

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The big circle holding on so tightly.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Are you really going to throw it all away?

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't throw it away.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Director, there are memories of our BT in every place.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't worry.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's going to disappear soon.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's already gone a lot.

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Come out.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Just one day.

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Just one day, please tell me.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you don't want to exercise anymore after spending a day with me, I won't text you or call you anymore.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I won't say I can solve everything with exercise.

170
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Are you a snake?

171
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm a snake.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's go.

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
To the extreme to the end of the tunnel.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Put it down and look.

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Director, you have a strong will.

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm a man.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm a man.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's a lot.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Wait a minute.

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you go out now, don't you have a pizza today?

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, I don't.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Director, then who will be the winner today?

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Hey, let's go.

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's not a workout.

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Director, the director said he would be the winner today.

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Director Do, when did you think you'd be so short?

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Director, no one can stop you from exercising.

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Director, come this way.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's go eat.

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Director, let's go eat.

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Director, let's go eat.

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh, my, my, my, my.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Shall we start with the burpee?

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Burpee?

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a burpee.

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't feel like burping today.

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Then should we start with squats?

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I see.

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
One, one.

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
One.

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Come up.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Two.

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Two.

205
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, my God.

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh, my God.

207
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why are your feet so big?

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Are they bigger than when I was young?

209
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well.

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Well, your feet are big, so you're tall.

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
When I was young, my feet weren't that big.

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I think I did well when I was in my fourth grade.

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hey.

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Should I show you the pictures when I was young?

215
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, okay, okay.

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Director, exercise is important.

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You can't rest.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Now, again.

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh, okay, I'll exercise.

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yes.

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, my God.

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I ate too much breakfast.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh, I'll get some water.

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You've done two squats now.

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Hey, Director.

226
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I made a reservation at the dorm.

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I made a reservation.

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I made a reservation.

229
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll give you two eggs.

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Good job, good job.

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you know that?

232
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've completely stopped you from doing the face.

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I always have two minds in the company.

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What's that?

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
First, I want to do as little exercise as possible because I'm having a hard time right now.

236
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So I'll try to do some exercise.

237
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Take your time.

238
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Pretend you're calling.

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Turn the fire around and put it in the trainer's phone.

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, my God.

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh, my God.

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I love exercise.

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But it's almost time to finish the exercise.

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What if I lose the amount of exercise than I thought?

245
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh, my God.

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh, my God.

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Time's up.

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's already done.

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I've been doing the PT for an hour, but I'm not sweating.

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's why I'm losing weight.

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll be right back.

252
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Guys.

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's go.

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
All right.

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm almost out of words.

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I actually won the prize money.

257
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If I didn't do my best to practice, I'd have gone too far.

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If I didn't make a big money, things would be like building up.

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I think the real president is being...

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
He's protecting影 naj.

261
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He'll eventually know you have to stop his face and move you,

262
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
instead of letting him stop the face.

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay.

264
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay.

265
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Let's go.

266
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What are you doing? You're going to make me overdo it.

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You can get tired of the same moves every day

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
just like you get tired of eating meat every day.

269
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then you change the menu

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and eat the specialties.

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Don't pretend to be similar to meat and exercise.

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Ms. Lee,

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
like you,

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I sometimes have a lingering feeling in my heart.

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
In that case,

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll use this gun

277
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to get rid of the lingering feelings.

278
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Look.

279
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There are five out of ten.

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This is very difficult.

281
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Let's try it out.

282
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You can forget what made you feel bad.

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Make an appointment.

284
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I heard you'll be here.

285
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll go get the money.

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How could she...

287
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Ms. Lee!

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Ms. Lee!

289
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Ms. Lee!

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Ms. Lee!

291
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Ms. Lee!

292
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Ms. Lee!

293
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I had a mental disorder

294
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
that caused a mental disorder

295
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
in my head.

296
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It was a complete misjudgment.

297
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's a misjudgment.

298
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Then I'll go get the money.

299
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Ms. Lee!

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Aren't you going out?

301
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I know a good restaurant nearby,

302
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
but this is the perfect place for this weather.

303
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
How delicious would it be

304
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
to eat outside in this weather?

305
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You're lying again, right?

306
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Never trust me.

307
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Follow me.

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Is it meat?

309
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You said you'll eat outside.

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm a pumpkin seed that eats outside.

311
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Ms. Lee,

312
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
when you're not feeling well,

313
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
you should try to control this ball.

314
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Think of this as your own feeling.

315
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
When you're going to the end of the road,

316
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
you're going to be in trouble.

317
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
How could you?

318
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Would you like to take this ball?

319
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If I take that ball,

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
will you let me go?

321
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It won't be easy.

322
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll take it.

323
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll take it.

324
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll take it.

325
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll take it.

326
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'll take it.

327
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'll take it.

328
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'll take it.

329
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll take it.

330
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll take it.

331
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll just walk left.

332
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll just walk left.

333
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Can I go to take my stuff now?

334
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What's the point of being a politician?

335
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Ms. Lee!

336
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Eat up.

337
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Exercise and protein supplement is essential.

338
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

339
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm going to the protein room.

340
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

341
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Look at my shoulder.

342
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm not scared.

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Stop being so serious.

344
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's over for today.

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What are you talking about?

346
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
How many days have passed?

347
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
There are so many exercises to do besides the shooting basketball.

348
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Skate that can balance your body and balance your life.

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Or climbing that can overcome the importance of life.

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You're really good at everything.

351
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Didn't I tell you?

352
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
If you change your body,

353
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
your life will change.

354
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I did.

355
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I really did change my life.

356
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm so miserable.

357
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Do you know why I'm good at shooting basketball?

358
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I wanted to be loved.

359
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Where do you want to go?

360
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I had a senior I liked when I was a freshman.

361
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Are you okay?

362
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Hey, I really like that player.

363
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
He's a good shooter.

364
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He's a good shooter.

365
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You know, he's a good shooter these days.

366
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He's hot.

367
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I used to shoot 20,000 shots a week.

368
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I wanted to be a woman who likes shooting.

369
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What are you doing?

370
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Do you want to go to the shooting range with me?

371
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Shooting range?

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm a good shooter.

373
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I got this because I bought 10,000 shots.

374
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, okay.

375
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Take this.

376
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Me? No, no.

377
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm a man now.

378
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You're bleeding.

379
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh, from now on.

380
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm a man now.

381
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You're not a woman who can shoot.

382
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I just liked that woman in the poster.

383
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I didn't know.

384
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm a man now.

385
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Here, here, here.

386
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, and basketball.

387
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
There was a senior who played with the fusion study.

388
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, that's so nice.

389
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I wanted to be a man.

390
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Senior, can I play basketball?

391
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Then it's good.

392
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So I played basketball together.

393
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm really working hard.

394
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Okay.

395
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah.

396
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah.

397
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I only knew that love started at that time.

398
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm the most fun in the game with you these days.

399
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

400
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Finally, my effort comes to the end.

401
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Oppa.

402
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You're here.

403
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Hello.

404
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Hello.

405
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Have some of this.

406
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Thank you.

407
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I heard a lot about you.

408
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Can you shoot a dunk?

409
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh, a dunk?

410
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I think I can shoot a little more.

411
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm so strong.

412
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That sounds good.

413
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I didn't think so.

414
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Don't do that, Ki-ho.

415
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Get down.

416
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm so sad.

417
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I shouldn't have tried.

418
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I would have been less miserable.

419
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You always say that

420
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
people's bodies have traces of life.

421
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I knew it today.

422
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The traces of my body

423
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
are only traces of people's love.

424
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Excuse me.

425
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You started with health.

426
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I wanted to show you my face.

427
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I wanted to forget you.

428
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But I want to stop now.

429
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't want to be miserable anymore.

430
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'll go now.

431
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Thank you.

432
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Chief Manager

433
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,620
Who dare to offend you.

434
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:43,820
Ishikro So-mi

435
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,680
Do Hyun-suk

436
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,300
Director!

437
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,360
You can't get an서 a life a house with another woman!

438
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,160
Monitor!

439
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,680
Sorry, I was late to show memory.

440
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Give me one more chance, director.

441
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Director.

442
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,680
Director.

443
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Please.

444
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,680
Our body was more cruel than I thought.

445
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,680
I remember the past that was hurt.

446
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:36,680
The past that I wanted to forget.

447
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Director.

448
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Director, you abandoned me when you were the worst in my life.

449
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
I'm different.

450
00:22:52,680 --> 00:23:02,680
I won't give up on anyone.

451
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Hello.

452
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Oh, Min-ah is not here right now.

453
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
These days, it's a luck.

454
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
I'm not here to find you.

455
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
Hello.

456
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Hello.

457
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Nice to meet you.

458
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,680
You can do PT right now.

459
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Of course.

460
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
But I have a class right now.

461
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Then...

462
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,680
Then please take the counseling.

463
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Yes.

464
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Thank you.

465
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Honey, can I start the exercise tomorrow?

466
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
I'm so tired from walking all the way here.

467
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
You want to?

468
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Don't stop at the face of the chairman next time.

469
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Move as you please.

470
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Okay?

471
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,680
Okay. Don't drag me around.

472
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,680
As you please.

473
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Chairman.

474
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,680
The exercise starts when you feel like it.

475
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I'll help you.

476
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,680
Until the end.

477
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,680
First, I'll do a flexible test.

478
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
Yes.

479
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Spread your arms forward.

480
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
From now on, the front leg.

481
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Front leg.

482
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
More, more, more, more.

483
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Oh, my.

484
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:36,680
I think it's going to explode because I have a flexible diet.

485
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,680
He really does explode.

486
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,680
So how much longer do we have to kiss?

487
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,680
Yes. That's why I'm not trying to be too deep.

488
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
Deep, deep.

489
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
Deep, deep.

490
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
I'm going to die.

491
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
Chairman.

492
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,680
Next is a muscle-testing test.

493
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,680
Give me the arm.

494
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Yes.

495
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
You can raise the arm to the shoulder height.

496
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
One, one.

497
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,680
I think my arm is going to fall out.

498
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,680
Chairman.

499
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Chairman.

500
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,680
It's not easy to lose the arm of an adult man with this weight.

501
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,680
I'll raise it again to my count.

502
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,680
One more time.

503
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,680
I have that elasticity.

504
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,680
He really does lose his arm well.

505
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
I just put it on yesterday, right?

506
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:34,680
That's because our love was too much yesterday.

507
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,680
I don't know.

508
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Then be careful.

509
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Next is a muscle-testing test.

510
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,680
I think we should test the muscle-testing test with something else today.

511
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Honey, should we test it?

512
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,680
Chairman.

513
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Chairman.

514
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
You can't go in together.

515
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,680
You can't go in separately.

516
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:06,680
Oh.

517
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Have you finished your class?

518
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,680
The chairman said he's not feeling well.

519
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Are you still here?

520
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Yes.

521
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,680
I really want to stop now.

522
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Please give up on me.

523
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,680
This is the Civil Service Hospital.

524
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Mr. Dong Mancheol woke up.

525
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,680
Chairman.

526
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,680
Yes, you're here.

527
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Are you okay now?

528
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Oh, my.

529
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
You slept well and woke up.

530
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,680
We were worried about you because you were lying down for a long time.

531
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Yes, we cried so much.

532
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
Look where you're at.

533
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Hand.

534
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
You're so cool.

535
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,680
You're so cool.

536
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,680
You must be working out hard these days.

537
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Your hand is strong.

538
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,680
You're still here, Chairman.

539
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:38,680
But why are you all here?

540
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,680
You fell down and Chairman Do Hyunjung was kept here.

541
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,680
What? Hyunjung?

542
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Chairman Do was a baby.

543
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,680
Why are you here?

544
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,680
Are you okay?

545
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,680
How do you call a doctor?

546
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
It's okay.

547
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Hyunjung, go out right now.

548
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,680
Go out right now.

549
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Oh, I'm so cool.

550
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,680
You've been working out for so long.

551
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,680
You're getting weak.

552
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Go out.

553
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
I'm sorry.

554
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
You smell like a woman.

555
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
You slept well and woke up.

556
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:34,680
Wait a minute.

557
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,680
But why is Chairman Do so angry?

558
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:48,680
We did get into a fight with Chairman Do, but he was the one who ruined the market.

559
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:54,680
No, Chairman Do's hospital bill was also out.

560
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Then why is Chairman Do so angry?

561
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,680
Don't you want to go?

562
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Why would I go?

563
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,680
But Chairman Do, are you not curious?

564
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:24,680
I'm curious about how Miran will overcome the problem quickly.

565
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Chairman, I have a question, too.

566
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Can I ask you?

567
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,680
What's going on?

568
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:42,680
How can I be like you?

569
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,680
What?

570
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:52,680
I want to be a good trainer who has to work out no matter what happens to the members like you.

571
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,680
I don't know how.

572
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
There's no way.

573
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:04,680
I'm not giving up until I just give up.

574
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:10,680
I'm saying I'm giving up, so I'm never giving up.

575
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:18,680
Never.

576
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,680
Yeah.

577
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,680
I'll never leave the trainer's committee.

578
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:34,680
I'll never give up on the trainer's committee.

579
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,680
What should I eat today?

580
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,680
How about a hamburger today?

581
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
I heard you have a good restaurant nearby.

582
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,680
You ate that sushi, right?

583
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,680
It's really good there.

584
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,680
I really wanted to go there.

585
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
Wait a minute.

586
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm not going to care about that anymore. I'm going to eat everything.

587
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,680
I can eat all the tteokbokki, pizza, cake, and malatang.

588
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Oh, it's Miran's earring.

589
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,680
I'm here, everyone.

590
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Welcome.

591
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Do you know what the hamburger color is?

592
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Wait a minute.

593
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,680
I heard it.

594
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,680
I heard it.

595
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,680
I mean, I ate it here.

596
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Don't leave.

597
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Don't leave.

598
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
Oh, my.

599
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:34,680
Who doesn't care about anything?

600
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Director.

601
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
I can't give up on Miran.

602
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,680
It's good to be a stalker and it's good to have a man not to be a gangster.

603
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,680
I think he's a loser who doesn't even promise.

604
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:52,680
I'm going to keep you from giving up until the end.

605
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,680
You should eat lunch first today.

606
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,680
Yes, yes.

607
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Follow me.

608
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
What?

609
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,680
Then does that man love you?

610
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
No way.

611
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,680
You promised me you'd give up.

612
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Did you forget?

613
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
I did.

614
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
But I can't give up on that.

615
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Miran, do you really have sad memories?

616
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:28,680
The times we ran together, the times we ran together, and the times we breathed together.

617
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Please don't say that about exercise.

618
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,680
Just one more time.

619
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,680
Give me a chance.

620
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,680
One more time for the last time.

621
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Please accept it.

622
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
No, no, no.

623
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:56,680
Please accept it.

624
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,680
I get it.

625
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
I get it.

626
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
You said you get it.

627
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,680
I get it.

628
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
You promised me.

629
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,680
I promise.

630
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Everyone, please accept it.

631
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,680
See you soon.

632
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,680
Beautiful.

633
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,680
What are you doing?

634
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
What?

635
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,680
It's a mountain.

636
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,680
No, it's not a mountain. It's just a view.

637
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,680
I'll never go up.

638
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,680
According to the data, there were no men who liked hiking among the men you liked.

639
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Thank you so much.

640
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,680
Then this way.

641
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,680
Don't think about exercise today.

642
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
I'm just here to enjoy nature.

643
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Shall we go up?

644
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
No.

645
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,680
I don't want to go up.

646
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Who can drink it?

647
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
How was the PT after last time?

648
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,680
I knew the job well.

649
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
I've been here for a long time.

650
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,680
So I want to take a little test.

651
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,680
Giving up is throwing it away.

652
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
I'll never give up.

653
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Yeah, I won't give up on the membership.

654
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,680
I'm a trainer.

655
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:34,680
Boss, I won't give up on your body no matter what your excuse is.

656
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,680
So you'll give up on me.

657
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
What?

658
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,680
To give up on exercise.

659
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,680
If you enjoy nature like this, your head gets warm and your mind gets fresh.

660
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,680
Then your luck will be full.

661
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
What are you going to do when you get down?

662
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,680
Boss, this mountain is not necessarily going to go up.

663
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,680
It's all the process.

664
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,680
The process of going up.

665
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Oh, look over there.

666
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,680
Isn't that a stone tower?

667
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Let's try it.

668
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Isn't this all the fun of hiking?

669
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,680
I'll go first.

670
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:22,680
I'm going to ask the chairman to overcome the luck.

671
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,680
Let's try one, sir.

672
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,680
No, no, no, no.

673
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:36,680
No, no, no, no.

674
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:46,680
I guess I can't overcome the luck.

675
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
Where do you trust people like this?

676
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,680
One.

677
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,680
One.

678
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,680
Two.

679
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,680
Three.

680
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,680
I'm a little dizzy.

681
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,680
Don't get swayed by the chairman.

682
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:14,680
Oh, three.

683
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
I think that's really hot.

684
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,680
You have to trust your body as it is on my face.

685
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Five.

686
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Five.

687
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:30,680
Five.

688
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Six.

689
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,680
What is this?

690
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
It's a lunch box.

691
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
The core of the training of the chairman is the diet.

692
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,680
Oh, so you bought a lunch box?

693
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,680
I bought it myself.

694
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Oh, that...

695
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,680
That's the smelly protein shake.

696
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,680
No, I'm not.

697
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,680
I've changed a lot after working out with the chairman.

698
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Now I know how to eat delicious food.

699
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:06,680
Thanks to the chairman.

700
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,680
Here, try it.

701
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,680
I prepared a sweet and salty.

702
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,680
The chairman is sweet and salty?

703
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,680
Cheers.

704
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
Protein, cheers.

705
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Chicken breast kimbap, cheers.

706
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Tofu, cheers.

707
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,680
Cheers.

708
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,680
I'm going to drink it.

709
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:34,680
Let's see.

710
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,680
What's wrong?

711
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
Wait a minute.

712
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Chairman.

713
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,680
Chairman said there's no guy who likes to go to the top.

714
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,680
Is there a memory in the classroom?

715
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Honey, are you okay?

716
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,680
One, two, three.

717
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,680
Honey.

718
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Honey.

719
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,680
Honey.

720
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,680
Honey.

721
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,680
I thought I couldn't see you anymore.

722
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,680
No, I can't see you anymore.

723
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,680
You said you couldn't do it.

724
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,680
I said I couldn't, but why are you holding me alive?

725
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,680
If you don't give up on your body and trust the chairman, in the end...

726
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
What's the end?

727
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,680
Give up on giving up.

728
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,680
How do you give up?

729
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
What?

730
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,680
If you give up today, do it again tomorrow.

731
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,680
If you can't do it again tomorrow, give up and do it again.

732
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
Why are you holding me alive?

733
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,680
Why?

734
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
I'm sorry.

735
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,680
It's okay.

736
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,680
Honey, let's go.

737
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Let's go.

738
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:06,680
No, no, no.

739
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Why?

740
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,680
It's already late. Where did you go?

741
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Chairman!

742
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Chairman!

743
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,680
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you something.

744
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,680
Didn't you see a woman on top?

745
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,680
The shoulder and the shoulder are very developed women.

746
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,680
The mouth is very big when you smile.

747
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,680
Cool.

748
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:42,680
I don't know about the temperature, but I saw a woman with a bad expression going up that way.

749
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,680
Yeah, I didn't have a good expression.

750
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,680
Oh, thank you.

751
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,680
I'll talk to you.

752
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,680
Chairman!

753
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:08,680
Chairman!

754
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,680
Chairman!

755
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,680
Don't come near me.

756
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
What are you doing now?

757
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Don't come near me.

758
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Stop right now.

759
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,680
The boss is over.

760
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,680
So don't come near me. That's what I'm doing.

761
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,680
No.

762
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,680
What?

763
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:38,680
I'm not going to leave you alone like me.

764
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
I'm not going to give up on myself.

765
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,680
What do you want me to do?

766
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,680
I can help you, Chairman.

767
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
How can you help me?

768
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,680
I'll do everything.

769
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,680
Please, please.

770
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,680
What is it?

771
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:02,680
I'm going to get a stomachache.

772
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
What?

773
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,680
So please.

774
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,680
Don't come near me and get away.

775
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
That's what you're doing.

776
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Chairman!

777
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Thank you and give me money.

778
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,680
What the...

779
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:30,680
What did you eat?

780
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,680
I'm sorry.

781
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,680
I'm the medicine that I've been taking care of.

782
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,680
I'm going to stop the diarrhea and take out some cold.

783
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
I'll help you.

784
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,680
What's with the weight?

785
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,680
I'm born with 1.5kg.

786
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,680
I was very weak.

787
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,680
I worked hard to live.

788
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:12,680
I've always been like this before I started working out.

789
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,680
Do you know that you're a bit weird?

790
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,680
Why are you being so overreact?

791
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,680
I just said I'd quit working out.

792
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,680
I've been following you until now like you're ruining my life.

793
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,680
You're a bit weird.

794
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
I've been weird since before.

795
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,680
I've been like that since Cheol-am and Hyebin.

796
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:38,680
It's too sad to be abandoned.

797
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,680
I've been born with 1.5kg weaker than the dumbbells.

798
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,680
People gave up.

799
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,680
Even doctors and even parents.

800
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,680
I'm sure you've known it since then.

801
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:06,680
It's said that being weak is giving up.

802
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,680
I wanted to become strong.

803
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,680
To not be abandoned.

804
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,680
What should I do if you're like me?

805
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,680
21, 22, more.

806
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,680
So I really tried my best.

807
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,680
More, more.

808
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,680
60, 60.

809
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,680
More, more, more, more, more.

810
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,680
But...

811
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,680
Live alone forever with a wide heart.

812
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,680
At the moment when I thought I was the strongest.

813
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,680
I'm back on the ground again.

814
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,680
Director.

815
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,680
You're not going to leave me alone.

816
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,680
Director.

817
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,680
Director.

818
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:06,680
So I decided to become stronger.

819
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:16,680
Even if everyone leaves me, I want to show you that I can endure it alone.

820
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,680
It must have been hard.

821
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,680
No.

822
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,680
I'm getting stronger as a temporary overpower.

823
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Pardon?

824
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,680
The muscles are getting bigger.

825
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,680
The damaged muscle cells form more muscles in order to make you stronger.

826
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:44,680
So you can easily have bigger muscles if you forget your wounds and recover.

827
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,680
Director.

828
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,680
Are you stronger?

829
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680
Of course.

830
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,680
Are you sure you're all overcome?

831
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:02,680
I think the muscles are getting bigger and the wounds are the same.

832
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:14,680
You haven't given up on the people who gave up on you, right?

833
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,680
Director.

834
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,680
Please show me first.

835
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,680
If you don't give up, you can overcome it.

836
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,680
I'll believe you.

837
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,680
I can overcome it too.

838
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,680
You're the one who gave up on me.

839
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,680
Let's meet and ask why I gave up.

840
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:38,680
And you can apologize or apologize or do anything you want to do again.

841
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,680
Director.

842
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,680
You can't stand it until you're done.

843
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,680
Director.

844
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,680
Are you sure you're not going to give up?

845
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
You're so annoying.

846
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,680
Hey.

847
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,680
Hoshi.

848
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,680
Thank you.

849
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,680
What's this?

850
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,680
I'll stop giving up on you.

851
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,680
What?

852
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,680
I don't think I have the right to be a trainer.

853
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:28,680
Like you, I can't even control the membership properly and I can't get the membership.

854
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,680
Are you giving up on this because you failed training?

855
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,680
Teacher.

856
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,680
I don't have much to say because I'm so tired of this.

857
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,680
I'm disappointed.

858
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,680
I'm sorry.

859
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,680
I don't know what's different from hoping that I'll get a abs workout after a few tries.

860
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:56,680
Director, you're going to quit exercising because you're so tired of the membership.

861
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:04,680
You're so fast at giving up.

862
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:24,680
I'm sorry.

863
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:40,680
Number one.

864
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:46,680
Number three.

865
00:47:46,680 --> 00:48:02,680
The right pose.

866
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,680
Why are you here with that body?

867
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:12,680
I have a cramp.

868
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:18,680
I'm not weak anymore.

869
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:24,680
I've been proven to be the most beautiful and most beautiful body in the world.

870
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:30,680
Do you know what you're going to tell me?

871
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,680
I knew you'd be angry.

872
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:44,680
If I let you go.

873
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:14,680
I knew you'd be angry.

874
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:24,680
I knew you'd be angry.

875
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,680
Director.

876
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,680
Director.

877
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,680
I don't have any news.

878
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,680
Give me one more chance, director.

879
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,680
One more time.

880
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,680
Call the doctor.

881
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:46,680
Director.

882
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:58,680
Mr. David champion to our winner.

883
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:08,680
He swiftly took the trophy and fled.

884
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:18,680
Since he was the rightful winner, the organizers decided not to take any further action.

885
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:24,680
Director.

886
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,680
Director.

887
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:36,680
You should be careful.

888
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:46,680
So now go back to your seat.

889
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,680
This is the best seat.

890
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,680
I can't abandon you as you like.

891
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,680
24 o'clock health club is my seat.

892
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,680
Hyun Joong.

893
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,680
I'll go first.

894
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,680
I can't empty this year because it's a 24-hour operation.

895
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:10,680
Take a break.

896
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,680
Go.

897
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:20,680
I'm sorry.

898
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:30,680
I'm sorry.

899
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:40,680
I'm sorry.

900
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:50,680
I'm sorry.

901
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:58,680
I'm sorry.

902
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:08,680
You should work out with me for the rest of your life.

903
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:18,680
I'm going to start with cardio exercise.

904
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,680
What?

905
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:30,680
If you feel the power of life, you mean you're hot in life.

906
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:36,680
Oh, it's cool.

907
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,680
I have to work hard.

908
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,680
And even if you give up on that power, you challenge it again tomorrow.

909
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,680
I'm sorry.

910
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,680
Don't do it.

911
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,680
Let's do it again slowly.

912
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,680
Yes, that's good.

913
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,680
Then we can see the end of the test someday.

914
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:12,680
If you don't give up, even if it takes a little longer.

915
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,680
Director.

916
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,680
Chairman.

917
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,680
Chairman.

918
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,680
I met the president as you said.

919
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,680
So it's a little cooler?

920
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:30,680
I feel like I've been sweating for about 50 minutes on the cardio.

921
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,680
I think it's going to be a lot different from what I feel.

922
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,680
I did a good job.

923
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,680
Chairman.

924
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,680
What?

925
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,680
You're here to ride the cardio.

926
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,680
Director.

927
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:50,680
Even if it's not tomorrow right now, I want to come back even if it takes a little time.

928
00:54:50,680 --> 00:55:10,680
I'll be waiting.

929
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:20,680
I'm not going to wait.

930
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:28,680
How are you?

931
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:36,680
Junseok, what I wanted to see today is a message Junseok sent me.

932
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,680
Oh, that.

933
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:44,680
I know I sent it in the wrong way, but be careful from now on.

934
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,680
Honestly, I'm still a little tired.

935
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:56,680
So if Junseok sends that message, I can imagine it too much.

936
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,680
Ilhyeon.

937
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,680
You can be careful from now on.

938
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,680
I'll ask you.

939
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,680
I'll go.

940
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:10,680
I sent it because I was going to send it.

941
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,680
I'm regretting that I broke up with you.

942
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,680
I want to see you again.

943
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:22,680
I know I hurt you.

944
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,680
But I had some feelings for you.

945
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:30,680
Of course, I can't tell you everything right now, but if I ever get a chance...

946
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,680
No.

947
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,680
What?

948
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,680
Don't tell me why.

949
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:54,680
I don't want to know and I don't want to get hurt anymore.

950
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:08,680
I'm sorry, but if I still don't want to work out, I guess I'm still a child.

951
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:14,680
Let's go.

952
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:22,680
What is it?

953
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,680
Is that possible?

954
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,680
Is this possible?

955
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,680
Is this possible?

956
00:57:52,680 --> 00:58:02,680
What?

957
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:12,680
What?

958
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:16,680
The accuracy of the spine is very good.

959
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,680
The core is also good.

960
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,680
The spine.

961
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,680
Put it down. Hurry up.

962
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,680
What are you doing?

963
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:38,680
I've been waiting for you, Taeyeon.

964
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,680
Oh, Mr. Mi Rang. It's been a while.

965
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,680
Did you overcome the luck?

966
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,680
Of course. Who am I? I'm Do Hyunjoon.

967
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,680
I can't let you get into the luck.

968
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,680
It's a relief that you got out of the luck.

969
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,680
It's a big deal for our company.

970
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,680
What are you talking about?

971
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,680
Didn't you raise the fortune this month?

972
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,680
The company said they'll raise the fortune.

973
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,680
What the...

974
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:24,680
Hello.

975
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,680
Welcome.

976
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,680
Did you get the award?

977
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,680
Yes.

978
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,680
What are you trying to do with your goal?

979
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,680
You said you'd change your life.

980
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,680
You're the best trainer.

981
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,680
Has the rumor already come to an end?

982
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,680
That's right. You came in a good time.

983
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,680
Yes.

984
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,680
Your name is Kang...

985
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,680
Sol.

986
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,680
It's been a while, Taeyeon.

987
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,680
What a great girl.

988
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,680
Don't worry.

989
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,680
I'll protect you.

990
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,680
Just go away.

991
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,680
Don't be embarrassed.

992
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,680
I can't hear anything.

993
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,680
I think I ate it wrong.

994
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,680
Don't do that.

995
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,680
I'm serious.

996
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,680
Go away.

997
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,680
Hyojin.

998
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,680
Sounds like a great chance?

999
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,680
The manager of the fitnessbeat home is

1000
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,680
the hardest Office uniting the team!

1001
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,680
You can't keep the best footer free.

1002
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,680
How insomniac!

1003
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,680
You.

1004
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,840
You're going to tear my heart.

1005
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:47,280
I'll introduce you to him, but you can't fall in love.

1006
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,220
You're already in your senses.

1007
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,220
What?

1008
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,620
Why are you running?

1009
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,720
The first corner.

1010
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,220
The first corner?
