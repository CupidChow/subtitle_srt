Mi Ran!

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,500
Did you wait a long time? You must be cold.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,120
It's okay. Right.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,750
Here.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,220
What's this?

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,790
It's a warm protein shake.

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,910
With chicken breast.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,900
Sweet. It's good.

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,980
Thank you.

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,730
You must've been cold.

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,330
Why did you dress so nicely today?

18
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,780
Did I?

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,370
I started dating the fitness fanatic.

Go out and eat.

23
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,670
It's scary to lose muscles.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,970
It's okay.

25
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,220
There's something I'm more afraid of losing.

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,680
it's a bit extra special.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,990
Did I beat your pectoral muscles?

28
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,470
You beat the biceps, triceps, and glutes.

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,660
Don't open your eyes.

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,590
I want to surprise you.

31
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,780
Come on. What is it?

32
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,140
Okay. One, two, three.

33
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,770
Director, this is...

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,760
A perfect mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercise.

35
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,540
The stimulation you get from it is heavenly.

36
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,980
It's the Stairway to Heaven.

37
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,620
Didn't you overdo it?

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,490
This is really expensive stuff.

39
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,050
I didn't overdo it.

40
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,310
Just like how I was born weighing 1.5 kg

41
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,560
but became the David of Asia.

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,470
Our gym once missed rent payments,

43
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,260

Why are you laughing?

55
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,410
I used to find your fitness fanatic comments

56
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,100
off-putting, you know.

57
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,760
But now...

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,410
But now?

59
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,030
I find it so romantic.

60
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,160
It's so cute.

62
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,570
Be careful.

63
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,430
That's how our secretive

64
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,030
muscle-popping romance started.

65
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,420
Don't give up.

66
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,920
Don't give up until the end.

67
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,360
Until the end.

00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,710
Two.

74
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,100

Director Do, what are you smiling at?

77
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,210
I wasn't.

78
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,910
All I care about is your muscles.

79
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,800
Start over.

80
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,710
Three.

81
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,970
Four.

82
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,210
Five.

83
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,310
Mi Ran, let's eat sweet potatoes together.

84
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,240
Sweet potatoes sound good.

85
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,030
Can we meet outside?

86
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,480
How about the outdoor gym?

87
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,560
Sounds good. I'll be there in five minutes.

88
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,240
Goodness.

89
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,580
What's this?

90
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,480
Are you two going on a date?

91
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,180
No, w-what do you mean...

92
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,810
W-Why would I go on a date?

93
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,010
A couple can go on a date.

94
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,220
Why are you so shocked?

95
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,540
A couple?

96
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,430
Gosh, I know you're dating.

97
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,030
Does anyone not know about that?

98
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,400
Your secret relationship

99
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,180
is only a secret between you two.

100
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,690
If so...

101
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,600
What made you think we wouldn't know?

102
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,930
When you do squats,

103
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,280
we hear you laughing instead of screaming.

104
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,810
The gym is filled with a sweet smell

105
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,000
instead of a sweat smell.

106
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,250
I didn't know.

107
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,670
How strange. I only smell sweat.

108
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,080
Right?
Yes.

109
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,420
Anyway, just date openly. Go ahead.

110
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,380
It's even harder to play ignorant
about a secret relationship.

111
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,680
Okay, got it. We'll go public.

112
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,850
Oh, my gosh!

113
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,130
You guys look great.

114
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,940
Okay, then.

115
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,180
No way!

116
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,130
What's wrong?

117
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,860
Would it be okay?

118
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,390
What do you mean?

119
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,880
I'm a director, and you're a client.

120
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,320
I'm a director, and you're a client, I said.

121
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,780
There are three things that can't be hidden.

122
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,340
Muscle growth, muscle loss, and...

123
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,240
a fluttering heart.

124
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,340
Come on.

125
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,080
Wow, it's tastier than usual today.

126
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,920
What is? The tteokbokki or...

127
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,950
our thighs?

128
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,940
Gosh, my legs hurt.

129
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,410
It hurts too much. I can't do it anymore.

130
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,200
Get back in position now.

131
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,050
You need to exercise this much to eat tteokbokki.

132
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,230
What's the deal?

133
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,970
You used to say you couldn't let me do

134
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,180
hard workouts because you like me so much.

135
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,840
Did you lose your feelings for me already?

136
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,010
Don't get the wrong idea.

137
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,470
I want you to be rich.

138
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,110
According to a study result,

139
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,290
1 kg of muscle is worth way more
than four million won.

140
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,950
Seriously. Study result, my foot.

141
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,810
Okay.

142
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,450
I'll be rich quickly by being with you, right?

143
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,760
I'll make you a chaebol.

144
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,350
By staying close to you for the rest of my life.

145
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,320
Director.

146
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,000
Let's spend the night together.

147
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,900
I did all 100, right?

148
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,570
It's a new record.

149
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,940
Should we go since I set a new record?

150
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,350
Will you just leave?

151
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,740
There's something really important left.

152
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,640
What the leak?

153
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,530
Director.

154
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,510
The water flow must've been bad and

155
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,910
the boiler couldn't have worked well.
Didn't you notice?

156
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,150
I didn't think it was a plumbing issue.

157
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,930
I stopped the leak temporarily,

158
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,200
but it won't last long.

159
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,780
The building is so old

160
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,880
and so are the pipes.

161
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,180
If you want to stay here,

162
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,230
you need to rip out the ceiling and flooring

163
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,230
and redo everything.

164
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,170
Rip off everything?

165
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,980
This is why you should've managed things.

166
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,410
You're borrowing my building.

167
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,430
You can't use it without any care.

168
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,310
The plumbing in the ceiling and floor is old.

169
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,060
How are we supposed to manage it?

170
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,340
The landlord should-

171
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,760
Whatever, whatever, whatever.

172
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,140
Don't even ask me to repair it. I have no money.

173
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,010
Move out if you don't want to stay.
Oh, my gosh...

174
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,090
I can't believe these people.
Oh, my!

175
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,060
Think about it and let me know.

176
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,910
Thank you.

177
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,190
Goodness. We've been through this countless times.

178
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,030
You managed more difficult things than this.

179
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,980
I know. You were born weighing 1.5 kg

180
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,460
and became the David of Asia.

181
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,640
Yes, you're not alone here, Director.

182
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,530
You have your members, too.

183
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,840
Guys...

184
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,300
Don't worry.

185
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,410
No matter what happens,

186
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,630
I'll make sure you don't lose muscles.

187
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,980
The Director was so happy when he got that.

188
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,450
But it became the first thing we're selling.

189
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,920
I know.

190
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,460
It's brand new.

191
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,330
I'll buy it.

192
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,850
Here.

193
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,730
Take good care of Mi Cheon.

194
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,730
Mi Cheon?

195
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,990
Mi Cheon is...

196
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,350
a helpful fellow who lets you
burn calories quickly.

197
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,580
Use it for over 30 minutes daily.

198
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,200
So he doesn't feel lonely.

199
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,600
Don't forget to wipe it
with a dry towel after you're done.

200
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,590
It doesn't operate well if it gets corroded.

201
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,850
Okay. Just help me move it.

202
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,130
Goodbye, Mi Cheon.

203
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,940
Having a proper form is important when lifting.

204
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,050
You get injured easily otherwise.

205
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,370
Okay. Open up your chest.

206
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,310
Make sure not to relax your core.

207
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,120
We'll lift at a count to three.

208
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,080
One, two, three.

209
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,930
I can't do it.

210
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,630
Director!

211
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,000
Director, Director.

212
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,260
Director. Gosh!

213
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,270
Director!

214
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,440
What happened, Director?

215
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,660
You're all about your body.

216
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,860
I'm sorry. Does it hurt?

217
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,160
I-I'm okay.

218
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,870
It's just a light sprain. A light sprain.

219
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,840
You came, Ms. Lee.

220
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,860
What happened?

221
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,960
He fractured his ribs slightly
while moving a machine.

222
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,990
His wrist and ankle ligaments were stretched.

223
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,600
He needs to be hospitalized for a while.

224
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,340
H-How about exercising?

225
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,170
You can't, Director.

226
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,160
How about just lightly?

227
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,230
What the injury?

228
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,380
Selling the leg press machine

229
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,620
used by the David of Asia.

230
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,880
We have all sorts of stuff.

231
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,820
Come check it out.

232
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,530
Rosa,

233
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,670
let's sell all this, redo the plumbing,

234
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,260
and get really nice equipment.

235
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,880
Okay.

236
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,870
What's this?

237
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,080
We need to get new light bulbs, too.

238
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,360
What the outage?

239
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,850
Are you okay?

240
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,230
Of course.

241
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,160
I've always told you that

242
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,690
life supercompensates.

243
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,710
As long as I overcome this,

244
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,570
our gym will grow even bigger.

245
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,360
You're lying.

246
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,040
A body shows a person's soul.

247
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,520
Your shoulders are drooping

248
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,120
and so are your eyes.

249
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,660
To be honest,

250
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,810
I'm a bit scared.

251
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,290
24-Hour Health Club was my home.

252
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,800
I was abandoned by everyone,
but it accepted me first.

253
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,130
I'm afraid I might lose

254
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,380
a place like that.

255
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,420
You don't have to be afraid.

256
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,270
Everyone abandoned you when you

257
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,660
were weak and weighed 1.5 kg.

258
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,090
But right now, you have

259
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,750
the trainers, members, and me

260
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,900
who will stay by your side no matter

261
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,210
what state you're in.

262
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,800
So you can feel free to be vulnerable.

263
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,580
Come into my arms.

264
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,600
I worked on my biceps for this.

265
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,150
By the way,

266
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,460
it's better to use the triceps
than the biceps when hugging.

267
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,670
There.

268
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,850
Gosh, I'm sorry.

269
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,020
Good mor-

270
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,750
Is something going on? What's wrong, everyone?

271
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,810
Mi Ran, I'm sorry.

272
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,550
The company is letting you go.

273
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,550
What are you talking about?

274
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,350
To Hawaii.

275
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,370
Hawaii!

276
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,000
What do you mean? Hawaii?

277
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,960
You applied to the branch in Hawaii.

278
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,880
They decided to go with you.

279
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,240
Me?
Congrats, Mi Ran.

280
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,470
You wanted to go to Hawaii badly. Congrats.

281
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,290
Your dream came true, Mi Ran!

282
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,330
By the way, what's with this reaction?

283
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:59,050
By chance, are you speechless
because you're so happy?

284
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,240
Yes...

285
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,440
Yes, when something you wanted badly comes true,

286
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,890
it's hard to believe it.

287
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,830
But they will have an orientation
with the new team.

288
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,780
I'm sure it will feel real once you start.

289
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,690
Hold on. Where should we have a send-off party?

290
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,290
S-Send-off party?

291
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,640
Yes, we won't see you for a year if you leave.

292
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,850
Let's make it really grand
and impressive this time.

293
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,750
What would be the best place for a send-off party

294
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,600
for people to say it was amazing?

295
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,000
How about we...

296
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,790
go inside and have a meeting?

297
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,040
This is an important matter.

298
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,720
What do I do?

299
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,720
Mi Ran,

300
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,470
how does it feel to be sent to Hawaii?

301
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,100
Oh, well...

302
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,180
this is just so sudden.

303
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,080
I thought you really wanted to go to Hawaii.

304
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,510
Yes, I wanted to, but...

305
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,900
But?

306
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,630
I'm torn now that I'm actually told to go.

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,540
I'm worried.

308
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,130
What?
I'm worried.

309
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,090
Whenever I write lyrics, they're...

310
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,770
too good.

311
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,860
Babe, I wrote this much in a week already.

312
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,990
Wow.

313
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,990
Am I a genius songwriter?

314
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,630
You've always been a genius.

315
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,960
You're a genius in looks,

316
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,470
love,

317
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,020
and...

318
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,820
genius in...

319
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,410
Come on.

320
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,420
Should I prove how much of a genius I am?

321
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,020
Prove it. Go ahead.

322
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,400
Hang tight.

323
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,130
I'm home.

324
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,260
You're back, Sister-in-law.

325
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,280
At ease.
Oh, okay.

326
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,570
Guys,

327
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,870
I'd like to ask you something.

328
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,830
Is everything okay?

329
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,750
How would you feel

330
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,420
if your significant other says

331
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,200
they can't be with you
when you're having a tough time?

332
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,820
What's the reason they can't be together?

333
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,470
I know.

334
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,000
Is it death?

335
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,430
No, it's not like that.

336
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,420
There are unavoidable situations, you know.

337
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:43,090
Maybe they got a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

338
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,930
I think I'd break up with them.

339
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,520
Me, too.

340
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,800
What?

341
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,670
It means you love something more than me.

342
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,630
While I was away from Ji Ran
for six weeks, 1008 hours,

343
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,310
I learned a lot.

344
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,790
Love means you stay together

345
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,790
even through happiness or hardship.

346
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,660
Right. It's love when you're together.
Yes.

347
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,680
You stay together through struggles, especially.

348
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,750
If not, it'd be a betrayal.

349
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,830
But why would you suddenly ask that?

350
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,700
Will you betray the Director
because his business failed?

351
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,190
No. What do you mean, betray?

352
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,280
And his business hasn't failed yet.

353
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,790
Please don't do that.

354
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,790
You can't leave someone when they're down and out.

355
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,150
I'm not leaving him.

356
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,600
We're very happy right now.

357
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,690
You'd better not say you're breaking up again.

358
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,520
Go to bed early.

359
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,890
What's wrong with her?

360
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,490
Director.

361
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,010
Director.

362
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,220
Could he be...

363
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,280
Director.

364
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,460
Mi Ran.

365
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,220
Why are you here in your condition?

366
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,470
I heard we lost electricity,
and the leaks are getting worse.

367
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,940
What brings you here so late, Mi Ran?

368
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,460
I came to eat something tasty with you.

369
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,640
Mi Ran,

370
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,770
can I really...

371
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,510
count on you and be vulnerable?

372
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,330
I...

373
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,880
think I need to give up on the gym.

374
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,510
I think I should let go of this place.

375
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,110
Thank you...

376
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,300
for staying with me.

377
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,760
Where are you, Chief? I need
to tell you something.

378
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,730
I'm coming up now.

379
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll be waiting in the break room.

380
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,020
Mi Ran,

381
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,540
when is the Hawaii team meeting?

382
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,240
Well, the thing is...

383
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,260
You must have a ton to prepare.

384
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,100
I decided not to go to Hawaii.

385
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,120
You aren't going to Hawaii?

386
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,280
No.

387
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,000
There's something more important
than Hawaii to me right now.

388
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Whoa, I knew you were torn about it.

389
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,350
What?
What's more important?

390
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,830
You acted like you were Hawaii, and Hawaii was you.

391
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,960
You refused to let anyone else have it.

392
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,070
What's more important than Hawaii now?

393
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,300
Well, I...

394
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,190
You're so annoying.

395
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,340
What did you say?

396
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,320
Think about it.

397
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,170
You took opportunities that I didn't get

398
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,440
several times, but you're always weighing things.

399
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,400
But everyone always wants you.

400
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,870
The Chief, Joon Seok, and our entire team.

401
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,160
It's because I've worked harder than you.

402
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,110
Why are you refusing to go, then?

403
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,770
You've worked so hard,
but why are you refusing to go?

404
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,940
It's none of your business.

405
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,820
It's none of your business whether I go or not.

406
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,070
Why do you keep crossing the line?

407
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,730
Do I look that easy?
You're looking down on this job.

408
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,210
Mi Ran.

409
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,110
Joon Seok.

410
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,780
Chief.

411
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,360
Mi Ran, are you really not going to Hawaii?

412
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,600
No, that's why I wanted
to have a meeting with you.

413
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,470
Let's talk outside for a moment.

414
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,950
Okay.

415
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll leave the task force and

416
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,630
return to the team soon.

417
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,540
That much time passed already.

418
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,940
Why aren't you going? You wanted to go

419
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,620
to Hawaii.

420
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,650
I wanted to.

421
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,480
But I wanted to go because

422
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,640
I wanted to prove myself to the one I loved.

423
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,870
Hawaii is the island of love for me.

424
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,420
You get loved and love someone back

425
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,210
on the island of love.

426
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,910
It's because of him.

427
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,160
Mi Ran,

428
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,740
this is a very important opportunity for you.

429
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,720
He's an important opportunity to me, too.

430
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,950
He's the first one who loved me

431
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,460
exactly as I am.

432
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,470
That's why I want to stay with him.

433
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,510
He's not the first.

434
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,660
I liked you, too.

435
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,720
It's because...

436
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,520
I liked you too much that night.

437
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,260
Why won't you sleep with me?

438
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,590
Gosh. Stop, I said.

439
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,630
We stopped that night because...

440
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,350
It's because I can't do it with you.

441
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,140
What?

442
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,370
I can't do it with you, I said.

443
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,420
That's enough.

444
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,080
It's not your fault.

445
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,910
It's my fault.

446
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,330
What?

447
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,900
Joon Seok.

448
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,180
The hair growth pills can show side effects to

449
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,860
1% of men, apparently.

450
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,320
And I fell into that unfortunate 1%.

451
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,130
I was so afraid that

452
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,480
you'd be disappointed in me.

453
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,290
That's why...

454
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,570
I blamed you instead of myself.

455
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,740
Like a coward.

456
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,900
I'm sorry.

457
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,780
So, you were trying not to disappoint me?

458
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,910
Not because you didn't like me?

459
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,380
I really loved you.

460
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,030
I mean it.

461
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,590
My body wasn't the reason I wasn't loved.

462
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,270
Thank you, Joon Seok.

463
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,410
What for?

464
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,380
I realized how I really feel, thanks to you.

465
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,780
And...

466
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,300
it wouldn't have mattered even
if you had been honest with me that day.

467
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,960
You look great.

468
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,610
I'll go now.

469
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,860
I've wanted to be loved my whole life.

470
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,190
I've always wondered why

471
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,620
no one ever loved me.

472
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:23,960
I finally found out the answer to that mystery.

473
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,480
It wasn't other people who didn't love me.

474
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,450
It was me.

475
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,790
Mi Ran?

476
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,190
Director.

477
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,770
Mi Ran,

478
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,440
did something happen?

479
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,620
You were smaller than this dumbbell,

480
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,010
but you worked out and became the David of Asia.

481
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,950
While working out with you,

482
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,780
I realized what I really wanted.

483
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,100
I'm...

484
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,410
leaving for Hawaii.

485
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,250
Hawaii?

486
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,880
I kept telling myself countless
times that I need to stay

487
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,280
with you since you're struggling right now.

488
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,040
I'm afraid you'd be disappointed in me, too.

489
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,310
But this time,

490
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,100
I want to try doing what I want.

491
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,950
Since I love myself,

492
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,370
I want to show Hawaii to myself, too.

493
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,790
Can I ask you to wait for me?

494
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,630
The best girlfriend I could ask
for finally got to go to

495
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,480
Hawaii she so wanted to go.

496
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,690
Did you think I'd be disappointed?

497
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,760
Even after seeing my broad pectoral muscles?

498
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,410
Don't you hate me?

499
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,940
I hate you.

500
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,300
Because I almost lost

501
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,030
my precious muscles because of your silly worries.

502
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,020
Mi Ran,

503
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,620
you should let yourself enjoy Hawaii

504
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,060
all you want.

505
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,590
I'm sorry that I can't stay with you
through your hardship.

506
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,680
Don't say you're sorry anymore.

507
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,360
Okay.

508
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,410
Starting now,

509
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,810
you'll lower the shoulder joints,

510
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,690
straighten your back,

511
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,910
relax the trapezius muscles,

512
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,610
lift up your head, and...

513
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:03,600
♪ You are there in all the beautiful memories ♪

514
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,980
♪ In that beautiful season ♪

515
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:13,460
♪ You exist with the happy moments ♪

516
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:19,130
♪ It was always you for a long time ♪

517
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,800
♪ My heart ♪

518
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:29,240
♪ My heart is heading to you ♪

519
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,250
I need to tell you something.

520
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:49,570
Someone made great offers to you.

521
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't know how this might sound,

522
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,290
but if 24-Hour Health Club closes,

523
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,420
can I bring Alex and Rosa

524
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,820
to my gym?

525
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,670
What?

526
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,230
You know, too. It's hard to find

527
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,560
a reliable and talented trainer in this field.

528
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,030
That's up to them to decide.

529
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,560
I know you don't like me, but

530
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,280
if you try talking to them-

531
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,200
Bong Won.
Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy.

532
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,880
It's R.O.Y. R.O.Y.

533
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,790
I prefer your old name, Bong Won.

534
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,760
I like you.

535
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,870
I know you're a good person.

536
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,760
I'll try talking to them.

537
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,320
Thank you.

538
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,030
Bong Won is a great gym director.

539
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,830
If you go there, both of you

540
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,870
could work in a better condition.

541
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,270
Go somewhere bigger, guys.

542
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,320
Did you pack all of your stuff?

543
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,340
I didn't know you'd actually close.

544
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,840
I know. We've always said it'd close,

545
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,060
but you always overcame everything.

546
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,780
I thought you'd do the same again.

547
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:23,050
Can we not eat sweet potatoes at the gym anymore?

548
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,420
Don't worry.

549
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,170
This isn't the end of the 24-Hour Health Club.

550
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,140
Just wait six months.

551
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,950
In six months, I'll make sure to

552
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,190
create the best gym for you.

553
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,610

00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:19,500
Why do you struggle with even easy moves?

924
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,010
I needed to properly study...

925
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,960
your lives.

926
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,880
I tried living as an office worker.

927
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,870
From nine to six,

928
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,990
you're bound to your desks.

929
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,570
Hyeon Joong,

930
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:40,070
I asked you to do this a long time ago.
You're still doing it?

931
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,030
I'm doing it now.

932
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,820
What are you doing right now?

933
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,640
It takes some time to use both hands equally,

934
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,310
but switching from left to right is best.

935
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,230
Where did we get this psycho?

936
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,860
W-Who hired this assistant?

937
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,300
Who could it be?

938
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,950
You hired him yourself, Chief.

939
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,820
Yes, Chief.

940
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,120
Stretching.

941
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:11,970
I tried doing housework all day, too.

942
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,100
You don't even get to leave that work.

943
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,330
I kept finding more chores to do.

944
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:19,730
63.

945
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,520
Excuse me.

946
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,290
What are you doing right now?

947
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:25,600
I thought you came to clean.

948
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,000
I'm cleaning right now.

949
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,140
Aren't you exercising?

950
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,730
Gym member-

951
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:35,150
Customer, try using this method when you clean.

952
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,310
You can exercise and clean.

953
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,200
You catch two birds with one stone.

954
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,840
And when you clean the windows,

955
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,980
use the back deltoid and dorsal muscles like this.

956
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,690
One. Two. Three.

957
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,480
Four. Five. Six.

958
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,760
Seven. Eight.

959
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,680
So, did you learn...

960
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,500
why it was so hard for them?

961
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,070
Yes, I realized more clearly...

962
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,010
that we need to exercise

963
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,110
no matter what.

964
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:13,480
What?

965
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,550
I'm determined now.

966
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,810
