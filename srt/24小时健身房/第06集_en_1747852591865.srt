1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Let's get up and burn it up

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Show me all the money

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,600
Let's get up and burn it up

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,900
Let's get up and burn it up

5
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,200
Burn it up, burn it up

6
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,600
Show me all the money

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,240
stops

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,840
begins to sigh

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,400
amazing

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,780
and goes away

11
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,080
Здесь

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,500
Miran brother

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,100
I think it will be difficult.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
No!

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,100
Please let me go once more.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,100
Isn't it too early to give up?

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,700
I can't let you go like this.

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,500
Please do something!

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
I mean...

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,400
You're an old running machine.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,500
Why are you so slow? You should get on the right one.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,300
You're like a fool.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,800
The last one got on too aggressively.

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,700
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,000
Why are you sorry?

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,200
We should be the ones to apologize for the old running machine.

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
No, it's not.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
This model is discontinued, so it doesn't have parts.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
We can't fix it even if another repairman comes.

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Let's just change it for now.

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Then how much would it be to buy a new one?

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
Well...

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,200
If you ask me for cash,

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I can give you about $2,000.

35
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,800
$2,000?

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,000
Why don't you just change all of them?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
People nowadays look at the brand of the equipment

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
when they register at the gym.

39
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,000
But the equipment here are...

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
If you have any ideas, please call me.

41
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll call you later.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay.

43
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,500
Thank you.

44
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Okay.

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,800
What do we do?

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,200
We changed all of our uniforms last time,

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,700
so we don't have enough money to pay for it.

48
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,200
We should just operate it without a single problem.

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,000
That's not possible.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,400
Running machines need a warm-up and a cool-down.

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
We have to find a way.

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
You're not saying that

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,900
because you don't want to work out, are you?

54
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,600
That's right.

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
We need a solution.

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,900
All of you, to the counseling room.

58
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,300
If you all have any ideas, please feel free to talk.

59
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,900
But why did you have to...

60
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,700
Well...

61
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,500
I think I'm responsible for this situation,

62
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,700
so I want to help.

63
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,100
It's not because of you.

64
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,000
That's right.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,100
That's right.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,400
What?

67
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,600
I think your advice will help.

68
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,400
You made money and danced on TV a while ago.

69
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,400
Did you watch the show?

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,500
Yes.

71
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
I was really curious if it was twice as much.

72
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,300
But it wasn't that much.

73
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,800
About 1.5 times?

74
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,100
But no matter how much I think about it,

75
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,300
the only way to make money

76
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,000
is to increase the number of new members.

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,300
Well...

78
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,700
Please don't take my advice with a bad mood.

79
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
I already feel bad about that.

80
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,900
I think it's hard for our gym to...

81
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,600
Re-enter.

82
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,000
The facilities and location...

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,600
Compared to the gym next door...

84
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Compared to what?

85
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,100
You know that it's not enough.

86
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,500
What's not enough about our gym?

87
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,200
The gym is the only big one here.

88
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,800
The real big trainer is me, Do Hyeonjung!

89
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,200
That's right.

90
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
But you need to come here

91
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,300
to know that the big trainer is here.

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Then why don't we invite influencers?

93
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,400
Like what Yoon Seongbin did last time,

94
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I'll send a DM to gym YouTubers like Kim Kangmin and Kim Gye-ran.

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
I think...

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,200
Our gym at 2 p.m.

97
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,700
should start with the members' rooms.

98
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
The rooms?

99
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,700
Yes, the rooms.

100
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,300
There are a lot of fixed members here.

101
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,400
But I feel like they're not here for the gym.

102
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,300
They're not even here to chat.

103
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,500
They're here to relieve stress.

104
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,900
Oh, the love room.

105
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,000
Something like that.

106
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,500
Maybe that's why there aren't many members

107
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,800
who take PT classes.

108
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,700
Oh, so they want to sell the PT classes

109
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,600
to the existing members?

110
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
That's what they're doing.

111
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Right?

112
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,100
But they say 30,000 won a month is expensive.

113
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,900
That's what I thought at first.

114
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,000
I thought that the PT classes that cost

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
tens of thousands of won per session

116
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,300
were for rich people or celebrities.

117
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
But I realized that

118
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,800
that was the best amount of money I've spent in my life.

119
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,500
I'm getting a reliable teacher

120
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,600
who never gives up on me.

121
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,300
Ms. Kim.

122
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,200
Everyone needs a teacher like that.

123
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,300
Let's have an event right now.

124
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,500
What event?

125
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,400
We'll have a special 30% discount

126
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,900
for the PT classes.

127
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,300
What?

128
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,800
You'll do it yourself?

129
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,700
Yes.

130
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,600
I won't

131
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,900
take a discount either.

132
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,200
30% discount for the PT classes?

133
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,700
Do people here know

134
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,800
how blessed this is?

135
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,300
I'll have to move myself.

136
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,900
Oh, my.

137
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,600
Mr. Kim.

138
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,900
Your wrist is getting tired

139
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,400
from the position you're in.

140
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,800
You need to straighten your wrist

141
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,700
to reduce the risk of injury.

142
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,800
I know.

143
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,200
How much do I have to work?

144
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,000
It's important to work out

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
more accurately than you do for a long time.

146
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,200
If you apply for the PT classes,

147
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,400
I'll coach you myself

148
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,500
at a 30% discounted price.

149
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
What?

150
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,000
You want me to learn how to work out?

151
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,400
Who's learning how to work out?

152
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Me?

153
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm a marine who catches ghosts with my bare hands.

154
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,100
Get lost.

155
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,000
You'll catch me with your chest.

156
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,500
Excuse me, sir.

157
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,800
You're wearing a jacket because

158
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,700
you can't circulate your blood well?

159
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,900
What?

160
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,400
Oh, that...

161
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Light weight training will help with blood circulation.

162
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,900
If it's hard for you to work out alone,

163
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,500
we have a great price for PT classes

164
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
that we hold at our gym.

165
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
What?

166
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,400
P.T.

167
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,500
What?

168
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,000
P.T.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,800
What? Panties?

170
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,600
No, please stop.

171
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
What? You didn't wear panties?

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,900
No, I wore panties.

173
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,000
I did.

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,700
Don't worry. I wore them.

175
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Okay.

176
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,700
Hello.

177
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,700
Where's the coach?

178
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,700
No one has applied yet.

179
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,400
Darn it.

180
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,900
Two.

181
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Three.

182
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Four.

183
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Five.

184
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Six.

185
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,300
But why is your voice like that?

186
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,100
Is it because you can't run a treadmill?

187
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,700
That's not it.

188
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,700
What do you mean?

189
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,800
You don't have to cheer up your voice.

190
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
No talking during the workout.

191
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,100
One more set.

192
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
One.

193
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
That's so cute.

194
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Three.

195
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,800
I made the pollack I got as a gift.

196
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,700
Try it. It's amazing.

197
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,600
It looks so good.

198
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,300
We should sell it.

199
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,700
No, pollack is for people.

200
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
That's right.

201
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Seven.

202
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Don't worry, coach.

203
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,700
I'll make sure you get a good PT.

204
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Okay.

205
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Okay.

206
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,700
That's right.

207
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,200
You're so fit after working out.

208
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,700
You're so fit.

209
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
You're so fit.

210
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,700
What are you doing?

211
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,200
Stop eating and dusting off.

212
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Girls.

213
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,700
Do you want to lose weight?

214
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
I'm so fit these days.

215
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,200
I want to introduce you to some products.

216
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,700
What are you going to sell?

217
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
Don't be so stingy.

218
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
We've been through this before.

219
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Do you want to score?

220
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Or do you want to get a new one?

221
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,700
That's a whole different story.

222
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Don't be too surprised.

223
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,700
I used to be like this.

224
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,700
See?

225
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
This is what I used to be.

226
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
Oh, my.

227
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,700
This is what happens when I use an app.

228
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
Don't you know her?

229
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
Don't be so stingy.

230
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,700
We've reserved a place for her.

231
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Coach Cho's Total Life Care.

232
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,700
What? You want me to get a good PT.

233
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,700
It's a whole different story.

234
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
I'm in charge of the diet.

235
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
I'm going to work out to my full potential.

236
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
I'm going to think of myself as my own body.

237
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,700
And you three are going to take care of each other.

238
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,700
You're going to talk and laugh.

239
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,700
How nice would that be?

240
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,700
It's nice. It's expensive.

241
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Why are you working out so hard?

242
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
Are you eating a skewer?

243
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,700
No, it's not that. I'm just happy.

244
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
If I work out with you,

245
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,700
I can work out for 24 hours anytime.

246
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
Oh, my.

247
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,700
We're going to be late for the webfoot octopus.

248
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
Let's get ready.

249
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Webfoot octopus.

250
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Oh, my.

251
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,700
She's coming.

252
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,700
It's not easy. They're so picky.

253
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
It'd be nice if we could start.

254
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,700
I think you still have a sense of rejection for PT.

255
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

256
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
It's okay.

257
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,700
I just wanted to help.

258
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
What's going on?

259
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Are you sure you're really going to work out

260
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,700
for 24 hours?

261
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
Let's get started.

262
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
It's a discount.

263
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
30%.

264
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
A discount?

265
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,700
What?

266
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:36,700
Then let's start tomorrow.

267
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Thank you.

268
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,700
What's going on?

269
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
It's all thanks to you.

270
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:57,700
What's wrong?

271
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,700
What's wrong?

272
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Do you know?

273
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,700
What?

274
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,700
There's a hard flesh in here.

275
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
Hard flesh?

276
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Congratulations.

277
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,700
It's an honor to have a hard flesh in my hand.

278
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,700
It's a valuable soul-stuff only for people like us.

279
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
People like us?

280
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
People like us?

281
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
Yes.

282
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
She said it's us.

283
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,700
Oh, my.

284
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,700
You should put this on.

285
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,700
What?

286
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,700
People like us should put on hand cream

287
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
even without lotion.

288
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,700
It's hard to get a dumbbell if you get blood on your palm.

289
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
Thank you.

290
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
It smells really good.

291
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,700
Then you can have it.

292
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,700
I didn't mean to.

293
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,700
I have one more because I bought one plus one.

294
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,700
It's really okay.

295
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Hey, Lee Jinwoo, I'm here.

296
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Why are my hands so rough today?

297
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Hey, do you have hand cream?

298
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,700
Our PT teacher told us to pay attention to hand moisturization for people like us.

299
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
Oh, right.

300
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
I got a hand cream as a gift today.

301
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
I almost forgot.

302
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Take it off.

303
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,700
What?

304
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,700
What?

305
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
What's wrong with your face?

306
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Why is your face so rotten?

307
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Take it off.

308
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,700
What?

309
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
This?

310
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,700
Why?

311
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,700
Throw it away.

312
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Hurry up and take it off.

313
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Hey, why are you throwing away my clean clothes?

314
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,700
Dan was wearing it when he came to my house.

315
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
This?

316
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,700
I'm throwing away everything that Dan has left now.

317
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Take it off.

318
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
What's wrong with you?

319
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
What's wrong with you?

320
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Why are you making a fuss again?

321
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
It's really stuck.

322
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,700
What? Did you fight?

323
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
I broke up.

324
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
You're talking nonsense.

325
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,700
You're talking nonsense.

326
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,700
And then you're going to walk around in the middle of the night and walk around.

327
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,700
I don't believe you.

328
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
This time, it's real.

329
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,700
I'm so happy that I can't write a song.

330
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,700
He needs a fee.

331
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,700
Kang Dan was a bad girl.

332
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
I thought you were a shadow.

333
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Dan is a genius artist.

334
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
Take that off.

335
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
This is my clothes.

336
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Take it off.

337
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
What is this?

338
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Hey!

339
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
Are you okay?

340
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,700
Look at this.

341
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,700
Why are you pulling it?

342
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
This is my clothes.

343
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Take it off.

344
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,700
I told you to take it off.

345
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,700
I'm going to throw it away.

346
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,700
There's no meaning in a world without Dan.

347
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,700
I miss Dan.

348
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
Hey, don't cry.

349
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Why are you crying about that?

350
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
If you broke up, it's over anyway.

351
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Don't make it easy.

352
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
I'm not making it easy.

353
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,700
I thought I was ruined after breaking up with Junseok at first.

354
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
But look at me now.

355
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,700
I'm living well with everything on.

356
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,700
How do you know I forgot everything?

357
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,700
I'm so upset.

358
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,700
Hey, look.

359
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,700
What's this?

360
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,700
I got this text last night.

361
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,700
I always eat chicken breast as usual.

362
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
I read self-development books.

363
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,700
I've been to the gym like this.

364
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
What do you think? Can you believe it?

365
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,700
How can you be okay with this explosive message?

366
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,700
How is this possible?

367
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
I don't know.

368
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,700
I've gained some hard flesh through physical training.

369
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Do you really want to forget Kang Dan?

370
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
So, so, so.

371
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Do you want me to let you forget?

372
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Yeah.

373
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Trust me.

374
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,700
You can be like me.

375
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
Oh, my God.

376
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Is there no normal person in my family?

377
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Don't cry.

378
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
One more.

379
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,700
Thank you.

380
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
I was worried because it was your first time.

381
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
You're more fit than I thought.

382
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
You're good at following me.

383
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
Wasn't it hard?

384
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
It's not that hard.

385
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,700
I make 100 servings of kimchi by myself.

386
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,700
I'm as energetic as the director.

387
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,700
But you don't just work out with strength.

388
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,700
If you're not strong and flexible, you'll get hurt.

389
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,700
Your shoulders were very stiff today.

390
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,700
Do a lot of stretching at home.

391
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Okay, Director Do. I'll do my best.

392
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,700
Then that's all for today's class.

393
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Take care.

394
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
Okay.

395
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Finally.

396
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
What day is it today?

397
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Oh, it's the day I do all the upper and lower body

398
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
and cardio.

399
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,700
I'll eat well from the back.

400
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Director Do.

401
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Is the chairman still here?

402
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
Yes.

403
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,700
If I learn something, I'll do it right.

404
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Can you teach me the side stretching again?

405
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
I'm a PT member.

406
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Can you do that?

407
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Of course.

408
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Hold the band tightly on your shoulders

409
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
and lift it up.

410
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Then stretch it to the side.

411
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Then 15 to 30 seconds of pause.

412
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Then bring it up again.

413
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
Thank you.

414
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
I'm a PT member.

415
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
If I do well, the director will be happy, right?

416
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
Of course.

417
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,700
I'm more grateful for your passion.

418
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Really?

419
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Yes.

420
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
I'm so happy.

421
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Finally.

422
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,700
It's really my time now.

423
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
I'll eat well again.

424
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Director Do.

425
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,700
What's that drink you drink after exercise?

426
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,700
I'm the type to do it right.

427
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,700
Are you talking about protein powder?

428
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
This is webfoot octopus.

429
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
You always told me not to eat sikhye.

430
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Were you eating webfoot octopus?

431
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,700
It's protein.

432
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
It's protein.

433
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
That's good.

434
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,700
Finally.

435
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,700
It's really my time now.

436
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,700
I'll eat well again.

437
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
Director Do.

438
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Can I try this too?

439
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,700
I've been curious about it for a long time.

440
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,700
The power of the gym that captured this area

441
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,700
has been holding me for 24 hours.

442
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,700
Director Do.

443
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
What are you using this for?

444
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,700
This is a belt.

445
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
Director Do.

446
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,700
I think you should keep the air purifier.

447
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,700
And the female members' condition is very important.

448
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
There must be a lot of dust.

449
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
That's why the members cough a lot.

450
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,700
Should we go to the mart to buy it?

451
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
They're on sale there.

452
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
Director Do.

453
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,700
Director Do.

454
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Director Do.

455
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Director Do.

456
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,700
Director Do.

457
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Director Do.

458
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,700
Director Do.

459
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,700
He's eating it all.

460
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,700
Look at him.

461
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Look at him.

462
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
Director Do.

463
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,700
We're off.

464
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
Good night.

465
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Thank you.

466
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
Director Do.

467
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,700
Look. My muscles are growing.

468
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,700
My stomach is rumbling.

469
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
Aren't you going home?

470
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,700
Why? Are you tired of working out with me?

471
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,700
You asked me to ask you for 24 hours

472
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,700
whenever and whatever it is.

473
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
That's not true.

474
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,700
But this rest is part of the workout.

475
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Your muscles grow when you rest.

476
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
What do you mean?

477
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,700
I paid for the PT and I worked out for 24 hours.

478
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
I should have worked out.

479
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,700
I'm a bit hungry. I should order some jjajangmyeon.

480
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,700
There's a Chinese restaurant that serves 24 hours.

481
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
What the 24 hours?

482
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
Minah.

483
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,700
Yes?

484
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
What should I do?

485
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
I just met the CEO.

486
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,700
But he's asking me to film the next episode.

487
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,700
I got a lot of products from Hawaii.

488
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Really?

489
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,700
Congratulations.

490
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Thank you.

491
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,700
What if she really goes to Hawaii?

492
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,700
That's...

493
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,700
We should go to Hawaii.

494
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,700
Let's go to Hawaii.

495
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Hawaii. Hawaii. Hawaii.

496
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
What should I do?

497
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
Congratulations on your full-term.

498
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
Thank you.

499
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Minah, by the way...

500
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,700
It's nothing.

501
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,700
I think you'll be too complicated.

502
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
Don't say that.

503
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I don't want to be complicated.

504
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,700
Junseong recommended you to the Hawaii PR team.

505
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
What?

506
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,700
You were surprised, right?

507
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
I really don't understand.

508
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,700
I think Junseong was totally sick of you on my wedding day.

509
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,700
Why did he recommend you to the live market?

510
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,700
Did he want to send you to Hawaii?

511
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,700
So you won't be seen again?

512
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Or did he want to create a group chat

513
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
and ruin it?

514
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,700
Why do you always want to know the reason?

515
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Aren't you curious?

516
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Your ex-boyfriend recommended you to the PR team.

517
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,700
It's because I have a good plan.

518
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
I know that.

519
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,700
But I'm worried.

520
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
I'm thankful that you're worried.

521
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,700
Junseong isn't that twisted. I know that.

522
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,700
Okay.

523
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,700
I'll get going. I have an appointment.

524
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
The manager hasn't left yet.

525
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700
You should go home now.

526
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
You can go home now.

527
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
I'll get going. See you tomorrow.

528
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,700
Bye.

529
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Yejin, do you know what time it is in India?

530
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,700
India? Just a moment.

531
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,700
If you're a travel agency employee, you should come out right away.

532
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
It's 4 o'clock.

533
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,700
It's 4 o'clock in India.

534
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
I'm sorry.

535
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
I'm sorry. See you tomorrow.

536
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Have a good workout.

537
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,700
This place is like a different world.

538
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,700
You'll get used to it soon.

539
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,700
The gym is divided into

540
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,700
aerobic zone, equipment zone, and free weight zone.

541
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
First, aerobic zone.

542
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,700
It's where people like you stay.

543
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,700
Right. I quit after I registered at the gym.

544
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,700
That's because you're afraid of muscle exercise.

545
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
You have to break your fear

546
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
to get into the equipment zone.

547
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
Equipment zone?

548
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
It's a space for the intermediate students.

549
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,700
You know how to use more than three equipment?

550
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,700
Then you'll be given the right to go to the shop

551
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
and get a one-on-one session.

552
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,700
You actually succeeded even if you came all the way here.

553
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
Did you go in there too?

554
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,700
I went there.

555
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,700
I work out there.

556
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
I'm not sure if I can do it.

557
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,700
It's the place with the most advanced athletes.

558
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
Free weight zone.

559
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,700
It's a sacred space where only weight and me exist.

560
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Wow.

561
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
You're so cool.

562
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,700
Oh, sir.

563
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
It's a recent evening.

564
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,700
I can't do a recent evening.

565
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
What?

566
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,700
Thanks to your genius planning,

567
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
I don't have much time to rest.

568
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Is this a good place?

569
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
This is my younger brother.

570
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,700
I thought I should work out here, so I brought him.

571
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,700
What the...

572
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,700
But...

573
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
You have really broad shoulders.

574
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
But why do you look like that?

575
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
I'm usually like this.

576
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
Because I'm a smiley face.

577
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,700
Ms. Min, what are you having today?

578
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
Today?

579
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
Starting with the quadriceps,

580
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,700
we'll finish with the lower three quadriceps.

581
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
For the latissimus dorsi, we'll do the quadriceps

582
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
and finish with the upper three quadriceps.

583
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,700
What?

584
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Why is he so late?

585
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
Then let's get going.

586
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,700
Thank you.

587
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
Director Do!

588
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,700
If it's your first time, should I take a look?

589
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
No.

590
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,700
I'm just going to do a light orientation.

591
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,700
Where's Director Do?

592
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
He's over there.

593
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,700
Please.

594
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
I'll go with you.

595
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,700
It's okay.

596
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,700
People like us should take care of ourselves.

597
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
What?

598
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
Director Do!

599
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Hello.

600
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,700
Hi, Min, Hyeongi.

601
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,700
This is my personal training.

602
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,700
Congratulations.

603
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Come here, Director Do.

604
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
I'll write it down.

605
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,700
What?

606
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
What's with the speed?

607
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,700
It's nothing.

608
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,700
I usually ride faster than this.

609
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,700
But I'm riding really slowly today

610
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
to keep up with you.

611
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,700
Wow, you're amazing.

612
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,700
You're covered in sweat, right?

613
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
If you're covered in aerobic fat,

614
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,700
let's go to the weight training center.

615
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
Follow me.

616
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,700
I thought only the best can come here.

617
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Shouldn't I come too?

618
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
It's okay.

619
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,700
I'm here.

620
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
If I'm in the club,

621
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,700
you can join too.

622
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
That's what I'm talking about.

623
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,700
Are you happy?

624
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,700
I'm sorry.

625
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
I'm sorry.

626
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
I'm sorry.

627
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Now, we'll do shoulder exercises.

628
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Watch carefully.

629
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Isn't that heavy?

630
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,700
It's this heavy.

631
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,700
The exercise we'll do now

632
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
is called side lateral raise.

633
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
It's called saraere.

634
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
It's for your shoulders.

635
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Watch carefully.

636
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
Follow me.

637
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
Wow!

638
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
It's so good!

639
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
It's like a eagle.

640
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
You can do it if you practice.

641
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,700
Watch carefully.

642
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,700
Isn't that 10kg?

643
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,700
I think you're overdoing it.

644
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,700
This is going to be too hard for you.

645
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Let's go do the side lateral raise.

646
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
I'm dizzy.

647
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,700
This is...

648
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
It's an arm exercise.

649
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Arm.

650
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,700
Yes.

651
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
This is...

652
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,700
I'll try it.

653
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Okay.

654
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,700
Sir, it's dangerous!

655
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,700
Don't go.

656
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,700
That's not an arm exercise. It's a chest exercise.

657
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,700
Don't do it.

658
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,700
I've got a grip on it now.

659
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,700
It's because it's not the same weight I usually do.

660
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,700
Wait.

661
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,700
Miran is in a state of awakening

662
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
with the whole body under her control.

663
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,700
If you show your weakness in front of your sister,

664
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
you'll be in danger of injury.

665
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
Leave it.

666
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,700
Wow!

667
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,700
You're so cool!

668
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Try it.

669
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,700
I'll do a lot of experiments.

670
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,700
Okay.

671
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,700
Give it to me.

672
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Okay.

673
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,700
90 degrees.

674
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,700
90 degrees.

675
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
I'll do it like you.

676
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,700
Yes!

677
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Wait.

678
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Wait.

679
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Beginners can't do it like you.

680
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Let's start the experiment.

681
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
Okay.

682
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Here.

683
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
Put your head on the floor.

684
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
Okay.

685
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,700
Try it.

686
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,700
Good.

687
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
What the...

688
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,700
What the...

689
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,700
My...

690
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,700
Mr. Davids' trophy.

691
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,700
Is it important?

692
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,700
Oh, my!

693
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,700
As a member of the PT club,

694
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,700
I should be able to see the dust in the gym.

695
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,700
I'm always working out and breathing heavily.

696
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,700
But the dust is coming in through my nose.

697
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,700
Oh, my. The trophy.

698
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,700
If you had done it on your own,

699
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
you wouldn't have come here.

700
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,700
I pay a lot of money and go to the gym.

701
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,700
So I can see things I couldn't see when I was training.

702
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,700
I see.

703
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,700
Let's go out and talk.

704
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,700
Oh, really?

705
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,700
I wish I could clean up like this.

706
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,700
My big muscles are gone.

707
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,700
The air is clear and nice.

708
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
Of course.

709
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,700
You don't have any injuries, right?

710
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,700
But the only thing that's gone is my trophy.

711
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
What's going on, sir?

712
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,700
Nothing.

713
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,700
It's gone.

714
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Nothing? What do you mean?

715
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,700
Did you become a thief?

716
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,700
My triangular muscles.

717
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,700
Your triangular muscles are gone?

718
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,700
Your gym clothes are now loose.

719
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,700
I think they're still there.

720
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,700
I had no choice but to keep doing this from dawn to late at night.

721
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Sir!

722
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Sir!

723
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Sir!

724
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,700
I didn't even get a minute to exercise.

725
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,700
Even a 20-year-old girl didn't stop me.

726
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
No!

727
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:10,700
The fact that the boss's muscles are gone is more serious than the loss of sales.

728
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,700
I can't stand it like this.

729
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,700
Yes, sir.

730
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,700
I was going to call you in the morning.

731
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Yes.

732
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Then I'll see you there tomorrow.

733
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
You've gotten too thin.

734
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,700
Why? Are you embarrassed to come here with your wife?

735
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,700
No.

736
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,700
I'm embarrassed that my arms have become thinner.

737
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,700
You're so cool.

738
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,700
What a skinny.

739
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,700
I'm sorry for being rude.

740
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,700
I called you here to buy you a meal.

741
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,700
You said you had something to say to me.

742
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,700
Well...

743
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,700
Would you like to order?

744
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,700
I'd like two of the most expensive courses.

745
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,700
I'd like two of Levi's steak.

746
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,700
Wait.

747
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,700
What part of Levi's?

748
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,700
The rib eye.

749
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700
Why?

750
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,700
It's so pretty with a lot of marbling.

751
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Two of the tenderloin.

752
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,700
Why?

753
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,700
If you're going to eat beef, eat tenderloin.

754
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,700
There's no fat, and it's a protein rich in iron and iron.

755
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Eat tenderloin.

756
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,700
Then two of the tenderloin.

757
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,700
I'll get it ready.

758
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
What do you want to say to me?

759
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,700
I'll tell you after I eat protein in the tenderloin.

760
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,700
I have a friend, so I came here.

761
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
Pardon?

762
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,700
My best friend is the head of the department.

763
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
I see you every morning, lunch, and evening.

764
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Eat up, head of the department.

765
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
Thank you for the meal.

766
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,700
Thank you for the meal.

767
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
Sure.

768
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Get in!

769
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Water!

770
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,700
What's wrong?

771
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,700
Be quiet.

772
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,700
What's wrong?

773
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,700
Let's go.

774
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,700
I just had a bite.

775
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
It's art.

776
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
What's wrong?

777
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,700
Is someone there?

778
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,700
That's my husband.

779
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Husband?

780
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,700
Don't look!

781
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,700
Why? Why are you hiding?

782
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,700
It's an affair.

783
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,700
Affair?

784
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Affair?

785
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Do you think we're having an affair?

786
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,700
We're no longer the head of the department.

787
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,700
No, that's...

788
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,700
What?

789
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,700
What a mess.

790
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Don't ever see him again.

791
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,700
What?

792
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,700
This is a good time.

793
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,700
What?

794
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,700
What should we do?

795
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,700
What?

796
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,700
What should we do?

797
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,700
I'm done.

798
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,700
How can I cover it?

799
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,700
Sometimes.

800
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Run!

801
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,700
I guess that's how they fight these days.

802
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,700
It's funny.

803
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Men win.

804
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,700
I'm sorry.

805
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,700
Are you okay?

806
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,700
Did he...

807
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
go to sleep?

808
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
It's been a while since I put on makeup.

809
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
What a waste.

810
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
I'm sorry.

811
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,700
I'm not used to it.

812
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,700
It's okay.

813
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,700
You didn't get caught.

814
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,700
Why are you hiding?

815
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,700
Shouldn't we go and talk about what we're doing?

816
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
No.

817
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,700
Why not?

818
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,700
If I know he's cheating on me,

819
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,700
I have to get a divorce.

820
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,700
If I don't,

821
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,700
nothing will happen.

822
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,700
What?

823
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,700
I can't get a divorce yet.

824
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
My daughter has to get married.

825
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,700
But still...

826
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,700
Director Do.

827
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,700
I've been stuck in the gym all this time,

828
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
so it was hard.

829
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,700
But...

830
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,700
I really hate home.

831
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
When I see my husband,

832
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,700
I want to push him away

833
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,700
and get him back.

834
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,700
But I'm scared to let him go.

835
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,700
It's so unfair.

836
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,700
Get me some water.

837
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,700
I live in a house that I clean up.

838
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
You should've done it sooner.

839
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,700
You're late.

840
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,700
I'm sorry.

841
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,700
I'm wearing the clothes I dress you in.

842
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,700
I'm sorry.

843
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,700
Darn it.

844
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,700
I'm in a meeting with the whole US.

845
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
I'm sorry.

846
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,700
I hate home because I don't want to see

847
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,700
my husband who hasn't remembered my birthday

848
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,700
for 30 years.

849
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,700
I should have a place to go at this age.

850
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,700
You're early today.

851
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,700
It's almost 30 minutes.

852
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,700
Don't overdo it. Good luck.

853
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,700
But you're always...

854
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,700
How are you feeling?

855
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,700
What did you eat? What did you do?

856
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
You asked me if I slept well.

857
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,700
Did you eat today?

858
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
I've been asked such a question...

859
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,700
For 20 years.

860
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,700
And I really liked it.

861
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,700
I'm sorry.

862
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,700
I'm sorry.

863
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
I've been bothering you.

864
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,700
It's okay.

865
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,700
But you're still holding it in.

866
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,700
You're so mean.

867
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,700
I know everything.

868
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,700
Let's stop talking about this.

869
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
But...

870
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
I'll go first.

871
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
I don't think I can go to the gym today.

872
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Well...

873
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,700
Okay.

874
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,700
The trainer often faces the pain of the members.

875
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,700
I always told him to work out.

876
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,700
I told him that if he gets stronger,

877
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,700
he'll get stronger mentally.

878
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,700
But no exercise...

879
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,700
Can make him become a member of the group.

880
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,700
I'm trying to look young these days.

881
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,700
I'm so tired of being a kid.

882
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
Gosh.

883
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,700
Jihun! Jihun!

884
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Jihun! Jihun!

885
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
You're amazing.

886
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,700
What?

887
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,700
I couldn't think of going to the gym for a moment.

888
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,700
I used to think of going to the gym once a minute.

889
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:47,700
But I couldn't think of going to the gym for 10 minutes.

890
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,700
I thought I was going to get a thigh massage.

891
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,700
You must have a real workout effect.

892
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,700
I think you're right.

893
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,700
I know.

894
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,700
I think of it once every 10 minutes.

895
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,700
Then I forget it once a day, once a week.

896
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,700
Then I completely forget it.

897
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
That's why I only think about that these days.

898
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,700
What do you mean?

899
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,700
Is it a upper body or a lower body today?

900
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,700
Gosh, you're amazing.

901
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,700
Gosh.

902
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,700
You're a real workout queen.

903
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
How about a late-night snack today?

904
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
Late-night snack?

905
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,700
Here.

906
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,700
Today's late-night snack is tteokbokki.

907
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,700
It's chicken breast.

908
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,700
It's a special late-night snack for people like us.

909
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,700
Chicken breast tastes like tteokbokki?

910
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,700
Yes.

911
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,700
Try it.

912
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,700
Okay.

913
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,700
Wow.

914
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,700
Wow, it's really amazing.

915
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
It tastes like tteokbokki.

916
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,700
Right? The juice and sauce are crazy.

917
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,700
I don't think I can think of tteokbokki if I eat this.

918
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,700
I won't work out anymore if I eat something bad.

919
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,700
Eat it.

920
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,700
Late-night snacks are protein.

921
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,700
I'll add one more tteokbokki.

922
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,700
Okay.

923
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,700
It's delicious.

924
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,700
Hello.

925
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,700
Don't laugh.

926
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,700
Good morning.

927
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,700
Good morning.

928
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,700
Shall we get started?

929
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,700
Yes.

930
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,700
You should warm up while I work out.

931
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,700
You know what I told you, right?

932
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,700
Do it right away.

933
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,700
Go.

934
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,700
Your sister is working hard.

935
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,700
I broke up with my boyfriend.

936
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,700
So I told him to work out.

937
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,700
I forgot about it too.

938
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,700
I was working out with you.

939
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,700
Did working out really help?

940
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,700
Of course.

941
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,700
I think I'm doing something for my body when I work out.

942
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,700
So I feel like I'm overcoming it.

943
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,700
I feel like I'm getting better

944
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,700
by working out hard.

945
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,700
As you said, the only thing I can change right now

946
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,700
is my body.

947
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,700
I'm going to work out.

948
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,700
Okay.

949
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,700
I'll be back.

950
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,700
You should stretch yourself.

951
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,700
I'm looking for a housekeeper.

952
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,700
Ms. Kim.

953
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,700
Yes?

954
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,700
You're working out, right?

955
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,700
I told you.

956
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,700
This is a supplementary class.

957
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,700
This exercise helps your shoulders when you're stiff.

958
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,700
People only focus on the contraction

959
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,700
when they use their body.

960
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,700
But when you relax your muscles,

961
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,700
that is, when you let go,

962
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,700
it's more important.

963
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,700
When I let go?

964
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,700
If you contract your muscles while giving strength

965
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,700
and when you relax,

966
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,700
you let go of your strength,

967
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,700
our muscles will never get bigger.

968
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,700
Like this.

969
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
You have to let go slowly.

970
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,700
Let go slowly.

971
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,700
Are you asking me to let go of my husband

972
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,700
as you are now?

973
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,700
No.

974
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,700
I'm talking about working out right now.

975
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,700
Let's see if you can get the band.

976
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,700
Like this.

977
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,700
This is hard.

978
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,700
It's hard.

979
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,700
Relaxing is harder than contracting.

980
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,700
It's not just you who find it hard.

981
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,700
It's hard for me and others.

982
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,700
Don't worry.

983
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,700
I'll help you relax

984
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,700
until you're fully relaxed.

985
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,700
You're feeling pathetic, aren't you?

986
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,700
Pardon?

987
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,700
I mean,

988
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,700
you're holding onto your husband

989
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,700
without even asking him properly.

990
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,700
You must be feeling pathetic.

991
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,700
No, ma'am.

992
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,700
It's not that. I...

993
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,700
But, Director Do,

994
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,700
family

995
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,700
doesn't just let go so easily.

996
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,700
It's not that.

997
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,700
My husband is a bad bastard to me,

998
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,700
but he's a father to my kids

999
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,700
and a family that I've lived with

1000
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,700
for 30 years.

1001
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,700
It's not that easy.

1002
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,700
Letting go...

1003
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,700
Isn't that why you're not letting go of Director Do?

1004
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:21,700
I'm sorry.

1005
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,700
Oh, my.

1006
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,700
Oh, my.

1007
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,700
Oh, my.

1008
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,700
Let's stop working out

1009
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,700
and go eat.

1010
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,700
I'm hungry.

1011
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,700
Let's go eat.

1012
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,700
Yes, yes.

1013
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,700
We have to eat.

1014
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,700
Let's go.

1015
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,700
We've waited for so long.

1016
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,700
Yes, yes.

1017
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,700
Oh, my.

1018
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,700
Oh, my.

1019
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,700
Isn't that your husband?

1020
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,700
Yes, that's him.

1021
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,700
My husband!

1022
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,700
My husband!

1023
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,700
Hello.

1024
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,700
Hello.

1025
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,700
It's been a while.

1026
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,700
What brings you here?

1027
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,700
Did you come to see your sister?

1028
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,700
Oh, my.

1029
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,700
Hurry up.

1030
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,700
What brings you here?

1031
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,700
Oh, I was wondering why I'd come out

1032
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,700
and eat before I go in.

1033
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,700
This is Jungmi from my company.

1034
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,700
You know her, right?

1035
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,700
Hello, ma'am.

1036
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,700
Oh, yes.

1037
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,700
I enjoyed the pumpkin and chicken you sent me.

1038
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,700
Oh, yes, yes.

1039
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,700
Was that delicious, Jungmi?

1040
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,700
You should've told me sooner.

1041
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,700
That's what she does every day.

1042
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,700
I'll tell her to go.

1043
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,700
You're having a hard time.

1044
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,700
What's hard about it?

1045
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,700
I can do it by tomorrow, right?

1046
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,700
Wait, I need to get my bag.

1047
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,700
What's wrong?

1048
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,700
What's wrong?

1049
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,700
What are you doing?

1050
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,700
What's wrong?

1051
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,700
I don't think I can have steamed monkfish today.

1052
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,700
I thought I should do some exercise.

1053
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,700
I thought you were my family

1054
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,700
even if you weren't a man to me.

1055
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,700
But I was just a restaurant lady to you.

1056
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,700
What?

1057
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,700
What are you doing all of a sudden?

1058
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,700
What's wrong?

1059
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,700
Do you know that?

1060
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,700
When you exercise,

1061
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,700
it's harder to relax

1062
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:49,700
than to lift it up with strength.

1063
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,700
What are you talking about?

1064
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,700
I'm going to let you go today.

1065
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,700
What?

1066
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,700
I'm not crazy.

1067
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,700
Sir.

1068
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,700
He left his band.

1069
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,700
Let him go.

1070
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,700
What?

1071
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,700
What are you talking about?

1072
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,700
You won't let me go, will you?

1073
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,700
You won't let me go?

1074
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,700
You're talking nonsense.

1075
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,700
What's wrong with you?

1076
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,700
Are you crazy?

1077
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,700
You're the one who's crazy.

1078
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,700
Are you out of your mind?

1079
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,700
Where are you?

1080
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,700
Bring this woman to my neighborhood.

1081
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,700
Wait, wait.

1082
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,700
What's wrong?

1083
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,700
I have you and me.

1084
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,700
I can do it.

1085
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,700
Where are you?

1086
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,700
Wait, wait.

1087
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,700
Wait, wait.

1088
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,700
Jungwoo.

1089
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,700
I told you to exercise.

1090
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,700
The ending is important.

1091
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,700
Thank you.

1092
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,700
Don't do it.

1093
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,700
I'll give you a hanbok.

1094
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,700
I'll give you clothes.

1095
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,700
Where am I?

1096
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,700
Sir.

1097
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,700
If you make several bands,

1098
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,700
you can create more resistance and power.

1099
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,700
Who are you?

1100
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,700
I'm glad to meet you.

1101
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,700
I'm the gym manager of the gym manager.

1102
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,700
That's great.

1103
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,700
Put your hands down.

1104
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,700
One more time.

1105
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,700
Like this.

1106
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,700
What are you?

1107
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,700
I'm the gym manager.

1108
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,700
Are you crazy?

1109
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,700
I'm the one who's crazy.

1110
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,700
You guys are really...

1111
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,700
Do you have anything to say to Hye-won?

1112
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,700
No.

1113
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,700
Then go home safely.

1114
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,700
Cheers.

1115
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,700
What is it?

1116
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,700
Why aren't you drinking?

1117
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,700
Just drink.

1118
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,700
It's okay.

1119
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,700
It's okay.

1120
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,700
You drink it too.

1121
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,700
Should we drink?

1122
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,700
Let's just drink.

1123
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,700
If you drink this,

1124
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,700
you'll do 100 squats with me.

1125
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,700
If I don't drink it?

1126
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,700
You'll lose weight.

1127
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,700
You'll lose weight.

1128
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,700
It's good.

1129
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,700
What are you doing?

1130
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,700
Where did you go?

1131
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,700
I'm going to do 100 squats right now.

1132
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,700
One.

1133
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,700
What's wrong with you?

1134
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,700
You're in a good mood, aren't you?

1135
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,700
One.

1136
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,700
Two.

1137
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,700
You're a big person.

1138
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,700
One.

1139
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,700
Two.

1140
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,700
Cheers.

1141
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,700
Don't drink. Just drink.

1142
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,700
Cheers.

1143
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,700
Cheers.

1144
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,700
I think it's really nice

1145
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,700
to live in the sun.

1146
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,700
Right?

1147
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,700
If I work out like those ladies,

1148
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,700
I'll be able to work out like you

1149
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,700
and like Ms. Sung-ae.

1150
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,700
I'll be able to bring Daniel down.

1151
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,700
Of course.

1152
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,700
Look at this.

1153
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,700
Hey.

1154
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,700
Let go of me.

1155
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,700
Let's go.

1156
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,700
Where did you get that energy?

1157
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,700
What's wrong with her?

1158
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,700
She's so respectful.

1159
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,700
She's so gross.

1160
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,700
Grandpa, I'll help you.

1161
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,700
What are you going to do?

1162
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,700
Nothing.

1163
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,700
Of course I'll help you.

1164
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,700
What's wrong with her?

1165
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,700
What's wrong with her?

1166
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,700
What's wrong with you?

1167
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,700
What are you doing?

1168
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,700
What are you doing?

1169
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,700
Let go of me.

1170
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,700
Let go of me.

1171
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,700
What's wrong with you?

1172
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,700
Young people...

1173
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,700
Come out.

1174
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,700
I'm sorry.

1175
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,700
You can't do this kind of thing.

1176
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,700
I'm sorry.

1177
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,700
Hey.

1178
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,700
Let's go.

1179
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,700
Who said we could go?

1180
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,700
I asked you if you went.

1181
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,700
You were there earlier.

1182
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,700
Is that why you ran away?

1183
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,700
Go and check.

1184
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,700
Go and check.

1185
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,700
If you're not here yet,

1186
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,700
please ask me one more time.

1187
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,700
What did you text me?

1188
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,700
What did you text me to delete?

1189
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,700
Please ask me one more time.

1190
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,700
Hey.

1191
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,700
You said you forgot.

1192
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,700
Did you forget this?

1193
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,700
That wasn't Junseok.

1194
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,700
I'm not going to believe you

1195
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,700
if you're going to keep saying that.

1196
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,700
Honey, I can't break up with you.

1197
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,700
Let's meet right now.

1198
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,700
It wasn't Junseok?

1199
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,700
Dad.

1200
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,700
Dad.

1201
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,700
What?

1202
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,700
Why did you fall so easily?

1203
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,700
Why did you fall so easily?

1204
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,700
I pretended to believe that I had let him go,

1205
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,700
but I've never let him go.

1206
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,700
You said you didn't love me,

1207
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,700
but you're still sending me

1208
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,700
whether it's sympathy,

1209
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,700
or a crush,

1210
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,700
or just my delusion.

1211
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,700
I can't ask you even if you have a lot of questions.

1212
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,700
I don't want to get hurt again.

1213
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,700
Yes.

1214
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,700
I'm going to buy a new running machine.

1215
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,700
I'm going to send you the old running machine.

1216
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,700
Yes.

1217
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,700
Director.

1218
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,700
Why are you always...

1219
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,700
What should I do?

1220
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,700
I lost my high-pitched voice.

1221
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,700
I'm ruined.

1222
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,700
It's harder to relax than muscle contraction

1223
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,700
because we have injuries

1224
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,700
when we can't relax properly.

1225
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,700
We failed to relax.

1226
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,700
Junseok.

1227
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,700
You sick bastard!

1228
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,700
What?

1229
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,700
Why are you looking at a woman?

1230
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,700
I didn't steal her.

1231
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,700
If you didn't steal her, then...

1232
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,700
Do you know each other?

1233
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,700
No, no.

1234
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,700
Then you're a pervert.

1235
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,700
I said no.

1236
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,700
What a pervert.

1237
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,700
It's okay.

1238
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,700
I want to quit sports now.

1239
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,700
So please give up on me.

1240
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,700
We found our luckier side.

1241
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,700
I will never give up on anyone.

1242
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,700
I will never give up on my contract as a trainer!

1243
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,800
Miran, you only have sad memories.

1244
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,400
Do you like me, sir?

1245
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,040
Just give me one day.

1246
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,640
Please accept it! Please accept it!
