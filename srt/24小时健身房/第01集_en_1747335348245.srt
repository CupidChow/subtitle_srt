00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,640
Ryeo orbit

2
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,700
Let's break up.

3
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,700
What?

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,700
Live alone with that useless heart of yours

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,700
for the rest of your life!

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,700
You don't even cry, do you?

7
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,700
In case you lose your mind.

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,700
In case you lose your mind.

9
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,700
It's here.

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,700
The big loss.

11
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,700
It's here.

12
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,700
I'm going to help you.

13
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,700
I'm going to help you.

14
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,700
I'm going to help you.

15
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
We desire.

16
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,700
To become stronger.

17
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,700
We long for.

18
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
To have a more beautiful body.

19
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,700
Because the body is a story.

20
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,700
What kind of life we lived.

21
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,700
And what kind of life we wanted to live.

22
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,700
Ladies and gentlemen.

23
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Please welcome from South Korea.

24
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,700
Do Hyun Joon!

25
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,700
I stand here to honor my life.

26
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,700
I'm going to help you.

27
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
I'm going to help you.

I'm going to help you.

00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,700
I'm going to help you.

I'm going to help you.

37
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
I'm going to help you.

38
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,700
I'm going to help you.

00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
I'm going to help you.

40
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
I'm going to help you.

41
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,700
I'm going to help you.

42
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,700

I'm going to help you.

49
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,700
I'm going to help you.

50
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:29,700
Tonight, we have a startling update from the Mr.

51
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,700
Mr.

52
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,700
What the f**k?

53
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Let me hear you.

54
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
I'll do a good job.

55
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,700
Hello, let me hear you.

56
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
I'll do a good job.

57
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Hello.

58
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Let me hear you just once.

59
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,700
I'll do a good job.

60
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,700
That's why I'm so pretty.

62
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:24,700
Stop it.

63
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:34,700
Stop it.

64
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,700
I think you dropped it.

65
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,700
Oh, yes.

66
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Make sure you come.

67
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,700
I'll do a good job.

68
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,700
Yes, yes.

69
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,700
I'll make sure to come.

70
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
I'll make sure to come.

71
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
Thank you.

72
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,700
What are you doing?

73
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,700
Two people succeeded like this.

74
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,700
Then, we'll have new customers at our club today.

75
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
It would have been more effective if it wasn't for this clothes.

76
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,700
What?

77
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,700
It would have been more effective to show my body.

78
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Why are you doing this?

79
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
My teeth are more shiny than this glitter.

80
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
It's too shiny.

81
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,700
It's too shiny.

82
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,700
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,700
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,700
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,700
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,700
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,700
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,700
It's too shiny.

93
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
It's too shiny.

94
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Wait, wait.

95
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Then, it's not like that.

96
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,700
Then, why?

97
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,700
No, no.

98
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Why don't you sleep with me?

99
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
Why don't you sleep with me?

100
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,700
Please, let's talk next time.

101
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
No, no, no.

102
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,700
You said we should be together today.

103
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,700
That's what I'm saying.

104
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
But why don't we sleep?

105
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,700
We went to the hotel, kissed for our families, and almost went.

106
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
But why?

107
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Why?

108
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Please, just once.

109
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,700
Do you have another woman?

110
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
Are you married?

111
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,700
Or do you like men?

112
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
It's not like that.

113
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,700
It's not like that, then why?

114
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,700
Stop it.

115
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,700
Hey, where are you going?

116
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,700
Why don't you sleep with me?

117
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Take this, too.

118
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,700
Tell me, tell me.

119
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Nice catch.

120
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:22,700
What is it?

121
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
You look tired.

122
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
Be determined.

123
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:34,700
It's okay.

124
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,700
What's wrong with you?

125
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
Leave it.

126
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
You won't regret it.

127
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
Yes.

128
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Of course.

129
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,700
We're waiting for you 24 hours a day.

130
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,700
Yes.

131
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,700
The player wants you to enter.

132
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,700
Get out.

133
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:05,700
What the hell?

134
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:16,700
My life has always been full of mysteries.

135
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,700
Hey, it's a gift.

136
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Go out with me.

137
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
Biran.

138
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,700
Yes, Junsang.

139
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,700
Us.

140
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Us.

141
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,700
Even the goalkeeper of our team.

142
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
What?

143
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Goalkeeper?

144
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Why did Junsang ask me to be a goalkeeper?

145
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Hey, Miran.

146
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:04,700
Hey, Miran.

147
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:11,700
Wow.

148
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:21,700
That day, I wore a dress with ribbons.

149
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,700
What are those guys?

150
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,700
Aren't they the ones who were in the game?

151
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,700
I know.

152
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Where are you stealing the game?

153
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Those bad guys.

154
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Wait a minute.

155
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,700
From now on, kiss time.

156
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:46,700
Our cute young sister, young brother, kiss.

157
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Fire charisma, my sister, my brother, kiss.

158
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Now, kiss the lovers who just started.

159
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:12,700
We're really friends.

160
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Get up.

161
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Jun.

162
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
The perfume you give here.

163
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Can I have it?

164
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,700
I'm 100 days away from Sujeong and Noh Chul.

165
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:39,700
I'm going to like it. I'm going to love it.

166
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
My blood.

167
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Why was Jun so proud of stealing my first kiss?

168
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
Eat a lot.

169
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,700
You look so pretty eating.

170
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Miran, I want to see you for a long time.

171
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:09,700
I want to be next to you every step of your life where you have a child, that child is big, and that child is married and has a child.

172
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
What?

173
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Wait a minute.

174
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Yeah.

175
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,700
It's a insurance that will be with all companies from the first generation to the 99th generation.

176
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:32,700
You're going to give me your autograph, right?

177
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Why do men want to get insurance books rather than love books?

178
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
It's a guaranteed form.

179
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
It's a 10,000-year-old emergency.

180
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,700
It's a guaranteed form, but read the medical records here.

181
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Is it this difficult for others to be loved?

182
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
Just give it to me.

183
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
I'll just do it.

184
00:11:50,700 --> 00:12:00,700
I feel like I'm cursed and I can't be loved.

185
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Why the door?

186
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Hey, you're not going to close the door.

187
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,700
What is it?

188
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:29,700
What is it?

189
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,700
Ran, you were really angry earlier, right?

190
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:41,700
That's my premonition for our hot night.

191
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
What is it?

192
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
Was it all an event?

193
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,700
You don't even know that.

194
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
A surprise party for you.

195
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,700
You're the only one for me.

196
00:12:52,700 --> 00:13:02,700
Me too.

197
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Come to the room.

198
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:10,700
I prepared a gift for you.

199
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,700
So pretty.

200
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,700
You're my love.

201
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:28,700
What's with the blusher?

202
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:50,700
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:50,700 --> 00:14:00,700
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,700
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:15,700
But why is it so thin?

206
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:23,700
What is it?

207
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:33,700
What are you doing?

208
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Don't come near me.

209
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
What are you doing?

210
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
What are you doing?

211
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:56,700
What are you doing?

212
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:06,700
You punk.

213
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:15,700
What are you going to do?

214
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,700
What are you doing?

215
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:24,700
What are you doing?

216
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Come and take it from our house.

217
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,700
What are you going to do?

218
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,700
You punk.

219
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,700
Why are you doing this?

220
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
Why?

221
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Let go of me. Let go of me.

222
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
You're dead now.

223
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,700
You're a newbie.

224
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Here.

225
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Here.

226
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
Don't move.

227
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
No.

228
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
No.

229
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,700
No.

230
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
That bastard is the culprit.

231
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Hey.

232
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Are you laughing?

233
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Laugh.

234
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Laugh.

235
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,700
No, you're holding a weapon.

236
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
I had no choice but to misunderstand.

237
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Is your wrist okay?

238
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,700
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Excuse me.

241
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,700
Excuse me.

242
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
Excuse me.

243
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Are you okay?

244
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
I'm okay.

245
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,700
I'm hurt here.

246
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
I'm hurt here, too.

247
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,700
My pretty face is all hurt.

248
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
Hey, why are you hitting people?

249
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,700
Are you a gangster?

250
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Then the first guy I saw was wearing pants at my house.

251
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
Then you just let it go?

252
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
I was wearing a down jacket, but it came off.

253
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,700
You scared me.

254
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
You said you were going to stay out tonight.

255
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,700
But why are you coming home and making a fuss?

256
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Do you know who wanted to come home today?

257
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,700
And no matter what I say,

258
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,700
you're my house and you're a woman who lives in a house.

259
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,700
Just arrest these guys.

260
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,700
It's a crime of death.

261
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
Sir.

262
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,700
Arrest him first.

263
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,700
Arrest him.

264
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
What?

265
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,700
Honey.

266
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,700
You were armed and hurt.

267
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
This is called special punishment.

268
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,700
Right?

269
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
Yes.

270
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,700
Anyway, my baby is smart.

271
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
I quit the law school.

272
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,700
You're so sexy.

273
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,700
You're crazy.

274
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
What are you looking at?

275
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
What?

276
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
What?

277
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Calm down.

278
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Let's make up and get along well.

279
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
I don't want to arrest him.

280
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
I just want to arrest him.

281
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Please let me proceed.

282
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,700
What's wrong with my baby?

283
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,700
If you can't make up here,

284
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
you have to come to your mom.

285
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
You can call your mom.

286
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
No, sir.

287
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
If you call your mom, you die.

288
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,700
We really die.

289
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
If Jiran dies, I die too.

290
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
That's great.

291
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Please let them be used.

292
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
Used?

293
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Used by your sister?

294
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
You're a psychopath.

295
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
You?

296
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,700
You to your sister?

297
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
You?

298
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
You want to die today?

299
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Yes, I will.

300
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Let's go.

301
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
Let's go.

302
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
Let's go.

303
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
Let's go.

304
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Let's go.

305
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Let's go.

306
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Let's go.

307
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
Oh, my sister.

308
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,700
I think it's because your sister's couples

309
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
don't have money.

310
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
You should understand.

311
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,700
That's what love is.

312
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,700
It's not about the front and back.

313
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,700
It's not about the water and fire.

314
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,700
You just want to stick together like a firework.

315
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,700
What's wrong with someone who's worth living?

316
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Excuse me, sir.

317
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Are you teasing my sister?

318
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,700
What?

319
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
How do you know that she doesn't know

320
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
about the water and fire?

321
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
You know right away.

322
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,700
She doesn't have a man who doesn't measure

323
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
the front and back and runs.

324
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,700
No matter how much she turns the cycle

325
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
and follows the law,

326
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,700
the fire won't come.

327
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,700
It's okay, sister. Don't be discouraged.

328
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,700
People live their own lives.

329
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,700
Sian.

330
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Sister.

331
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
I'm going to kill you.

332
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
I'm going to kill you!

333
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Let's go!

334
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Let's go!

335
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Let's go!

336
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
Let's go!

337
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,700
Let's go!

338
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,700
Let's go!

339
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
Let's go!

340
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Let's go!

341
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Let's go!

342
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
What?

343
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Did it break again?

344
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,700
I should've done better this time.

345
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
I thought you were going to come here often.

346
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,700
Go home and clean up everything right now.

347
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I went home two hours later,

348
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,700
and that stupid girl was really ridiculous!

349
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
Why are you giving me an application

350
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
when you're the one who dumped her?

351
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Honey, let's go.

352
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Wait, honey.

353
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
I'm going to the bathroom.

354
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
I'm going to the bathroom.

355
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
I'm going to the bathroom.

356
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
I'm going to the bathroom.

357
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Honey, let's go.

358
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Wait, honey.

359
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,700
I really hate this.

360
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
You have to be polite.

361
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
Take care, Choyoung.

362
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Choyoung...

363
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Choyoung...

364
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,700
Choyoung...

365
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,700
Anyway, I'm going to make a good team.

366
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
I'm going crazy.

367
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Let's go, honey.

368
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,700
Okay.

369
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Choyoung, make sure you come home

370
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
two hours later this time.

371
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Oh, my.

372
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Oh, my.

373
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,700
Oh, my.

374
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
I'm going to die.

375
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,700
Honey, Choyoung seems to be very good at this.

376
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,700
Right? He's a monster.

377
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
I'm so scared.

378
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
You're surprised, right?

379
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Yes, I'm surprised.

380
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
I was going to give you a hug

381
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
and a toast after the game,

382
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,700
but Choyoung came out and hit me.

383
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Oh, my.

384
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
That humidifier...

385
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Why are you dating in front of me?

386
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Hey, go away.

387
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Go away.

388
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
I'm sorry.

389
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
I was too kind.

390
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,700
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,700
The whole world is in a relationship,

392
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,700
but why am I the only one alone?

393
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,700
I got my hair done today.

394
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,700
I scrubbed my elbows.

395
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
The underwear is a set, too.

396
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Why am I the only one alone?

397
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Oh, my.

398
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,700
Oh, my.

399
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm already sad without a sad ending.

400
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Your ending isn't here.

401
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Did I say too much?

402
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,700
You can change your life, too.

403
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,700
How?

404
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,700
How can I change my life?

405
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
The one you got earlier.

406
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,700
The one in your bag.

407
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,700
Not that one.

408
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
This one?

409
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
Oh, my.

410
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Love?

411
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Don't be ridiculous.

412
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,700
I'm going to buy it with money.

413
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
Have a nice day.

414
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Thank you.

415
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
What?

416
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
What's this?

417
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
There's a club?

418
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
Oh, my.

419
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
Where is it?

420
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Hey, your chest was delicious.

421
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
Really?

422
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Your butt was delicious.

423
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Oh, my.

424
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
Oh, my.

425
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
Wow, it's here.

426
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
It's here.

427
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,700
My club.

428
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I'm going to eat, too.

429
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Totally.

430
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
Here, eat.

431
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,700
I'm going to eat.

432
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,700
I'm going to eat.

433
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,700
I'm going to eat it all today.

434
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,700
Wow.

435
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
Miss, miss.

436
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
That's right.

437
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,700
I'm a lady.

438
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
Miss.

439
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
Don't touch me.

440
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
What?

441
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
What are you doing?

442
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,700
Is this new?

443
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,700
Miss, did you register?

444
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
Zumba?

445
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Oh, my.

446
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Oh, my.

447
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,700
Miss.

448
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
Zumba.

449
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,700
What?

450
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,700
That person is...

451
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
The transfer office.

452
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
Oh, my.

453
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
Hello.

454
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
Did you come for counseling?

455
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
No, it's not that.

456
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
I think I misunderstood something.

457
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
I'm sorry. I'll go.

458
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,700
162.7, 62.8kg.

459
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,700
Is 162.7 and 62.8kg?

460
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,700
It's night.

461
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,700
The empty weight is much...

462
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,700
How did you know it was 62.8kg?

463
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,700
I thought it would be 100% 65kg.

464
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,700
The fat is lighter than the muscles.

465
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,700
No matter how big the interview is, it's less important than you think.

466
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
What?

467
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
What? The interview?

468
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,700
Follow me. I'll give you advice.

469
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,700
No, I'm going to go.

470
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
Where is the counseling room?

471
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,700
I'll give you advice.

472
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
I'll do it.

473
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
If you talk to the new members again,

474
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
I'll report you for interference in sales.

475
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
Interference in sales?

476
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
You talked to the members and

477
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,700
kicked them out of the company.

478
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,700
That's called interference in sales.

479
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,700
The members who didn't follow my training

480
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,700
interfered with my sales.

481
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,700
Look.

482
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,700
This is also an interference in sales.

483
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,700
Teacher.

484
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
I'm sorry.

485
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,700
I'm just kidding.

486
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,700
Thank you.

487
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
What the...

488
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Yes?

489
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,700
How long have you been working in the office?

490
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
About five years.

491
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
Okay.

492
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,700
You seem to have some insomnia

493
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
under the irregular diet.

494
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
You've been under a lot of stress lately.

495
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,700
How did you...

496
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,700
There is a life engraved in a person's body.

497
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,700
Angle of the turtle neck,

498
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
the point where it's rolled on the shoulder,

499
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
the point where it's rolled on the shoulder,

500
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,700
the point where it's rolled on the shoulder,

501
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
the angle of the neck,

502
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,700
the point where it's rolled on the shoulder,

503
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
the angle of the neck,

504
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,700
and the left and right imbalance

505
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,700
that has been tied to the desk for a long time.

506
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Looking at the ramen and snacks you ate at this time,

507
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
it was a very stressful situation

508
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,700
that made me crave carbs.

509
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Looking at the stiff shoulder muscles,

510
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
it seems like

511
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
it was recently.

512
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,700
How did you know all that?

513
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
I was a little mistaken.

514
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
I shouldn't have seen it.

515
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
I thought it was a real club.

516
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,700
It is a club.

517
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,700
The club of the country's hell.

518
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Did you hear that?

519
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,700
The credit card was written as a health club,

520
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
not a health club.

521
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,700
You're amazing.

522
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Thank you.

523
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
I'll get going.

524
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,700
Didn't you come here to change your life?

525
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
I know.

526
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,700
How to change your life.

527
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
You know how to change your life?

528
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,700
1.5 kilograms.

529
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,700
There was a child born smaller than this child.

530
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Everyone said

531
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
that with that body,

532
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,700
you wouldn't be able to endure this rough world.

533
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Everyone gave up on this weak life.

534
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,700
But sports

535
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,700
made everyone's life stronger.

536
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,700
They gave up on giving up and eventually

537
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
won.

538
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,700
Did you just brag about yourself?

539
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
Pardon?

540
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,700
Is there anything we can change in life?

541
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
Dating, working, or anything else.

542
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,700
Is there anything I can change?

543
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,700
Dating, working, or anything else?

544
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,700
Is there anything I can change?

545
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,700
No.

546
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
There is one thing we can change for sure.

547
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
It's our body.

548
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,700
Our body gets stronger as we run and as we lift.

549
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Body.

550
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,700
Give me three months.

551
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
I'll change your life.

552
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Your life.

553
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,700
How?

554
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,700
With a total life care service?

555
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,700
You can change my life in three months with that?

556
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,700
How much is a total life care?

557
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,700
500.

558
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
500?

559
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,700
500?

560
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,700
Okay. I'll think about it.

561
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,700
You can't live with that body anymore.

562
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
What do you mean?

563
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
If you don't change it now...

564
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
So if you want to change my life,

565
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,700
you have to change this body first.

566
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,700
If you want to change this body, you have to pay 500.

567
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,700
That's right.

568
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
This isn't just about the interior.

569
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,700
It's about the way you think about your appearance.

570
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,700
I'm not talking about my appearance.

571
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,700
I'm talking about my body.

572
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
Our body is talking about our lives.

573
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Appearance or body?

574
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Why is that wrong?

575
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Our body is talking about our lives.

576
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,700
You're not a fraud.

577
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
What's wrong with your clothes?

578
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,700
Are you out of your mind?

579
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,700
How could you say that to a new member?

580
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,700
Did I say something wrong?

581
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
If you keep living with that body,

582
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,700
your stomach will only get worse.

583
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,700
If you keep doing that, you can get diabetes and high blood pressure.

584
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
If your body is damaged, your heart is damaged.

585
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,700
That's why I'm giving you advice as a trainer.

586
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,700
You're a real beggar.

587
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Advice?

588
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,700
Then what's the total life care?

589
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,700
If you want to change your life, you have to change your lifestyle.

590
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,700
I'll change everything from eating, walking, and sleeping.

591
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,700
That's 5 million won.

592
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,700
You won't give up on your life

593
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,700
because you'll use that money for your body.

594
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,700
And in the U.S., you'll get 10 times more.

595
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,700
You're a crazy conman.

596
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,700
What? A conman?

597
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,700
You'll get 10 times more in the U.S.

598
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
Then go to the U.S. right now!

599
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
Are you really going to ruin our gym?

600
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,700
This is where our trainer Dong Hwacheol risked his life to protect.

601
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,700
But you should go there and see the tail of our gym.

602
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,700
What's wrong with the tail of our gym?

603
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,700
It's cold!

604
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
What if it gets cold?

605
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,700
Why aren't you letting go?

606
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
What is it?

607
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,700
Stop it!

608
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,700
What is it?

609
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,700
What happened?

610
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,700
The water suddenly stopped.

611
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,700
What about the foam?

612
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,700
I can't even get in the rain!

613
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,700
Is the water going to stop? I'll find out.

614
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,700
I guess it's off.

615
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
I didn't fart.

616
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
It's actually working out.

617
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,700
What?

618
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Chris Bumstead takes a cold shower every morning.

619
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,700
After exercise, the cold shower strengthens the immune system

620
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,700
and improves blood circulation and increases the rate of progression.

621
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,700
And above all, it helps to recover tired muscles quickly.

622
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,700
What are you talking about?

623
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,700
My heart almost stopped.

624
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,700
But you don't have muscles here.

625
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,700
That's good, too.

626
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,700
What?

627
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,700
You just have to stretch your muscles from now on.

628
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Don't talk nonsense!

629
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Turn on the hot water.

630
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,700
If you heat up your body with exercise, the cold water won't be cold.

631
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,700
If the water is cold, heat up your body more!

632
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Director Dong!

633
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Director Dong!

634
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Are you laughing at me?

635
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,700
You didn't forget who I am, did you?

636
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,700
I've been here for 10 years.

637
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,700
I'm Lim Seongtae.

638
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,700
Director Dong!

639
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,700
I'll go get some water right away.

640
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,700
I'm so surprised that the cold water suddenly came out.

641
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,700
Oh, my.

642
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,700
Is it because I washed myself with cold water?

643
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,700
My skin feels so much better.

644
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,700
Really?

645
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,700
I'm so happy.

646
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
Director Do,

647
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,700
I'm here to see Director Dong.

648
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,700
If I leave, there will be a lot of people who will leave here.

649
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,700
You should stay alert.

650
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Oh, my.

651
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,700
I feel so relieved after getting some cold water.

652
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,700
I should eat something hot.

653
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,700
I'll make steamed monkfish.

654
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,700
That's so funny.

655
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,700
Oh, my.

656
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,700
I'm so happy.

657
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,700
Oh, my.

658
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
My face looks so much better now.

659
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,700
Did you hear what the ladies said?

660
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,700
Director Dong fainted because of Director Do.

661
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
He's going to eat the gym.

662
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Really?

663
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,700
What?

664
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Didn't Director Dong make him exercise

665
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,700
after taking out the soy sauce from the orphanage?

666
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,700
Oh, my.

667
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,700
That's why the black-headed beast doesn't take out the soy sauce.

668
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,700
He grew up so much and flew back to the States.

669
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,700
He's made a mess.

670
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Oh, my.

671
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,700
What is there to eat in the middle of the night?

672
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
I don't know anything.

673
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,700
It's the land of the yellow-eared people in Seoul.

674
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,700
If I sell my rights, I'll lose something.

675
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,700
Why wouldn't I lose anything?

676
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,700
It was a bit strange.

677
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,700
He always bragged about being successful in the States,

678
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,700
but he's always on a different track in the gym.

679
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
He's not even working.

680
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,700
He's doing it on purpose.

681
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,700
He's trying to get everything done.

682
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
He's trying to get everything done.

683
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,700
He's too noisy.

684
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Get ready.

685
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,700
I'm not going to go eat chili peppers.

686
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,700
Stop it.

687
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,700
I'm going.

688
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
I'm going.

689
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
I'm tired.

690
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Thank you for your hard work.

691
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
You too.

692
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,700
I don't understand the members.

693
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,700
It's an honor and I'd be grateful if I were Director Do.

694
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,700
Why do they all hate me?

695
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,700
Are you thankful?

696
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,700
The bodybuilder in the US

697
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,700
tried so hard to save the gym.

698
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,700
Do members of the gym try to do that?

699
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,700
They're probably still working hard.

700
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,700
They're probably still working hard.

701
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,700
They're probably still working hard.

702
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,700
They're keeping the gym open 24 hours a day.

703
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,700
You're worried too, aren't you?

704
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,700
I'm worried about you.

705
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,700
What?

706
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
I don't know.

707
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
I really don't know.

708
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,700
I don't know why it's getting better

709
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,700
the more I do the wet.

710
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,700
I don't know why it's getting better

711
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,700
the more I do the wet.

712
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,700
I don't know why it's getting better

713
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,700
the more I do the wet.

714
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,700
I can't give you a lecture like this.

715
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,700
One more!

716
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Hold on to your abs!

717
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
Don't stop!

718
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Hey, hey!

719
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Hold on to your abs!

720
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
One more!

721
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,700
You have more!

722
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
Hold on to your abs!

723
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
One more!

724
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,700
One more!

725
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,700
I can't do this.

726
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
Do more!

727
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,700
Come on!

728
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,700
One more!

729
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,700
Don't stop!

730
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,700
Come on!

731
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,700
One more!

732
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Why did you do that to me?

733
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,700
Why did you do that to me?

734
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,700
You insulted me.

735
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,700
You're right.

736
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,700
Who would want to spread the flyers

737
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,700
in our neighborhood?

738
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
What?

739
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,700
Sir, this isn't a club.

740
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,700
It's a gym.

741
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,700
Have you been to a gym?

742
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,700
No.

743
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,700
Is it right to open a gym at this hour?

744
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
Is it right?

745
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,700
It's me.

746
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,700
It is.

747
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,700
You're here.

748
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
At this late hour.

749
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,700
What are you doing, you punk?

750
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,700
You're not well-balanced.

751
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,700
You're not allowed to talk informally.

752
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,700
Sir!

753
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,700
I'm giving you a special leave.

754
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,700
This is not your turn.

755
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,700
One, two.

756
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,700
One, two.

757
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,700
What did you do?

758
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,700
One, two.

759
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,700
You're the worst at talking informally.

760
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,700
Anyway, you came in well, sirs.

761
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Strength is not used on others.

762
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,700
It's used to make yourself stronger.

763
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Sirs, one.

764
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,700
Stand straight and go down deep.

765
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,700
Two, two.

766
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,700
Two.

767
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,700
I don't know how it will be in your field,

768
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
but I won't give up in my field.

769
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
You can do it.

770
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
From the beginning, everyone...

771
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Darn it!

772
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,700
Stop being interested in others

773
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,700
and focus only on your body.

774
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,700
Do you understand my voice?

775
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Why aren't you sleeping with me?

776
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
Why aren't you sleeping with me?

777
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,700
Stop it.

778
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,700
My stomach.

779
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,700
Are you trying to eat bagels with cream cheese

780
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,700
or do you need a plate to eat cream cheese?

781
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,700
What?

782
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,700
It's delicious.

783
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,700
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

784
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,700
When you fight in a relationship,

785
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,700
do you mean to stop dating

786
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,700
or stop fighting instead of fighting?

787
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
You mean to stop fighting, right?

788
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,700
Why?

789
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,700
Junseok said to stop?

790
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,700
No, it's about my friend.

791
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,700
Usually, what he means to stop is

792
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,700
to quit dating.

793
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
Why? Why?

794
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,700
When you want to stop fighting,

795
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,700
you can say it next time or...

796
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,700
Or...

797
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,700
Or...

798
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,700
Don't you kiss?

799
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,700
Hey!

800
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,700
Why are you talking about kissing when you're eating bagels?

801
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Why?

802
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,700
Why did Junseok say to stop?

803
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,700
It's about my friend.

804
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,700
It's not about me.

805
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,700
Then go tell your friend.

806
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,700
Don't be a loser and just ask him.

807
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,700
What if he really breaks up with you?

808
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,700
Junseok, go ask Junseok.

809
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,700
Don't ask him and don't answer him.

810
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,700
If it's too hard, kiss him.

811
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,700
It's not here.

812
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,700
It's not here.

813
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
I'll send this house right away.

814
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,700
Why are you here? I've been looking for you.

815
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,700
What's going on?

816
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
I need to go to the bank.

817
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,700
The bank that the workers hate the most.

818
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,700
What?

819
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,700
The office.

820
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,700
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

821
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,700
What are you having for lunch today?

822
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,700
Oh, lunch?

823
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,700
For lunch today...

824
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,700
How about sweet potato soup with potatoes?

825
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,700
Potato soup sounds great.

826
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,700
I've been thinking about the menu for lunch since this morning.

827
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,700
I knew you'd know the answer.

828
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,700
I planned it since the weekend.

829
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,700
You're always so smart.

830
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,700
No, I'm not.

831
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,700
Potato soup!

832
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,700
Potato soup!

833
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,700
Let's go eat potato soup together.

834
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,700
I'll buy it today.

835
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,700
Why?

836
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,700
I'm joining the South American development TF.

837
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,700
I need to leave for a while.

838
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,700
I was going to tell you.

839
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,700
When did you start doing that?

840
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,700
Starting today.

841
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,700
Starting today?

842
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,700
Today?

843
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,700
So suddenly?

844
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,700
You didn't know either?

845
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,700
No, I didn't.

846
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,700
The sales team asked me to come because they were short of staff.

847
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,700
Hurry.

848
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,700
Hurry.

849
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,700
What are you doing?

850
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,700
I'm going to the bathroom.

851
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,700
What are you doing?

852
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,700
How can you not know your girlfriend is joining the TF?

853
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,700
It's a bit weird.

854
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,700
What should we do? Look at Mira's face.

855
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,700
Mira must really not know.

856
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,700
Isn't she moving because she wants to break up?

857
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,700
I'm the one who's sad.

858
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,700
What about Mira?

859
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,700
It's okay.

860
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,700
What are you going to do?

861
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,700
I know.

862
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,700
We'll see each other often.

863
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,700
Okay, I'll book a restaurant with my aunt.

864
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,700
Junseok, can we talk for a minute?

865
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,700
Just a minute.

866
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,700
It's been a while, right?

867
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,700
I used to come here often because the people at the company were watching.

868
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,700
Of course, I caught you quickly because of me.

869
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,700
Right.

870
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,700
When did you decide to go to the TF?

871
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,700
It hasn't been long.

872
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,700
You should've told me in advance.

873
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,700
Then I wouldn't have been so flustered.

874
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,700
Mira, actually...

875
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,700
We're...

876
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,700
fighting.

877
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,700
We didn't break up.

878
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,700
Mira.

879
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,700
I love you.

880
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,700
Thank you.

881
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,700
You're very considerate of me.

882
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,700
You've always made people happy.

883
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,700
You always care about what other people like

884
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,700
and what they need.

885
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,700
You always care about them.

886
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,700
That's why the travel packages you made are also satisfying.

887
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,700
You made that kind of mind.

888
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,700
Thank you.

889
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,700
So you're going to meet someone better than me.

890
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,700
What?

891
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,700
To me, you're...

892
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,700
I think you're too much.

893
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,700
What are you talking about?

894
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,700
I think we should stop here.

895
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,700
For you and for me.

896
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,700
I'm going to get up first.

897
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,700
Wait, Eunseok.

898
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,700
But you should answer me first.

899
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,700
Why didn't we sleep last night?

900
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,700
Please, Mira.

901
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,700
Don't give me excuses.

902
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,700
If you leave like this...

903
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,700
I'll have to wonder about it all my life.

904
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,700
I'll have to watch every moment we spent together...

905
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,700
And I'll have to reflect on myself...

906
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,700
without knowing what I did wrong.

907
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,700
What?

908
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,700
So tell me.

909
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,700
Why did we stop last night?

910
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,700
Huh?

911
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,700
Why did we stop?

912
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,700
What's so important about this?

913
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,700
It's important to me.

914
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,700
So tell me.

915
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,700
I'll go to you.

916
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,700
Oh...

917
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,700
Is that why we broke up?

918
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,700
My heart...

919
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,700
My heart...

920
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,700
I think it's going to rip.

921
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,700
It's going to rip. It's not going to rip.

922
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,700
Oh, no!

923
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,700
No more!

924
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,700
No more!

925
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,700
No!

926
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,700
Oh, no.

927
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,700
I always told you. What about chest exercises?

928
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,700
Chest exercises hurt more than breaking up with your lover.

929
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,700
Correct.

930
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,700
This is just pain.

931
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,700
It's not hard.

932
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,700
Lie down again.

933
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,700
What?

934
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,700
Director!

935
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,700
Director!

936
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,700
We're late again.

937
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,700
Why are we 3 days late for this month's rent?

938
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,700
Sir, we won't be late next month.

939
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,700
How can I believe that?

940
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,700
Director Dong was always late for his rent.

941
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,700
And now he's like this again.

942
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,700
I don't know.

943
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,700
Don't worry.

944
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,700
I'm different from Director Dong.

945
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,700
I had a relationship with Director Dong.

946
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,700
I kept an eye on him without paying him rent.

947
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,700
I can't do anything about it now.

948
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,700
Take the store out right now!

949
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,700
Trust me.

950
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,700
Why should I trust you?

951
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,700
You're a loser.

952
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,700
You're a loser.

953
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,700
Are you saying you can't trust me now?

954
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,700
Yes, I can't trust you.

955
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,700
Yes, I can't trust you. What are you going to do?

956
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,700
Why? I can't trust you.

957
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,700
I can't trust you.

958
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,700
What are you doing now?

959
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,700
The Last Supper

960
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,700
Why can't I take off my clothes at once?

961
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,700
Take them off and talk.

962
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,700
Sir.

963
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,700
Do you know what this chest is?

964
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,700
It's the chest that gave me Mr. Soul Grand Prix.

965
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,700
And with this chest and this,

966
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,700
I won the Asian Games gold medal.

967
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,700
And this is...

968
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,700
The best body that gave me the trophy.

969
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,700
So?

970
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,700
It means the body that the world has acknowledged.

971
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,700
This is the body that can be three times as big as the current rent.

972
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,700
If you can't trust our gym, then trust my body.

973
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,700
Trust this body!

974
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,700
Okay.

975
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,700
I'll trust you.

976
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,700
Okay.

977
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,700
I got it. So I'll keep an eye on you for a few more months.

978
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,700
I can't let you get away with this anymore.

979
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,700
You have to pay your rent well for the Grand Prix.

980
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,700
I can't let you get away with this!

981
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,700
Sir!

982
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,700
It hurts.

983
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,700
It hurts!

984
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,700
Put the chest down.

985
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,700
Put the chest down.

986
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,700
One, two...

987
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,700
What is this?

988
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,700
I'll stop.

989
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,700
What?

990
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,700
I can't stand seeing you getting hurt like this anymore.

991
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,700
Sir.

992
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,700
Super-recover.

993
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,700
To get better beyond maintaining your original condition,

994
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,700
you need to get over-recovered.

995
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,700
Our gym isn't getting hurt right now.

996
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,700
It's recovering.

997
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,700
Don't worry and trust me.

998
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,700
Kiss.

999
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,700
No.

1000
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,700
I can't trust you.

1001
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,700
You really...

1002
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,700
You can't trust me?

1003
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,700
You can't trust me?

1004
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,700
Let's get the lawsuit.

1005
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,700
I'm a traditional...

1006
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,700
Sir.

1007
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,700
I'm David Granpull from the US.

1008
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,700
He's telling me not to leave.

1009
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,700
He's called David in Asia.

1010
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,700
So he's asking me to help him out.

1011
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,700
I'll register for total life care.

1012
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,700
Here's $500.

1013
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,700
You were right.

1014
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,700
It's all about my body.

1015
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,700
I'm sorry.

1016
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,700
I'm sorry.

1017
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,700
I'm sorry.

1018
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,700
I'm sorry.

1019
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,700
I'm sorry.

1020
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,700
It's all about my body.

1021
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,700
So tell me.

1022
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,700
Why did we stop yesterday?

1023
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,700
What's so important?

1024
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,700
It's important to me.

1025
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,700
So tell me.

1026
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,700
I can't...

1027
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,700
What?

1028
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,700
I can't do this to you.

1029
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,700
No matter how hard I try,

1030
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,700
my body doesn't react.

1031
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,700
I can't do this to you.

1032
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,700
At that moment,

1033
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,700
I wanted to pretend I didn't know.

1034
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,700
But I ended up facing the mystery answer

1035
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,700
that I knew.

1036
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,700
It was me.

1037
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,700
It was me.

1038
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,700
It was me.

1039
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,700
It was me.

1040
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,700
It was me.

1041
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,700
My body.

1042
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:18,700
I'm sorry.

1043
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:26,220
Can total life care really change?

1044
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,980
Of course.

1045
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,180
I'll make it even if I die.

1046
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,660
Perfect body.

1047
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,980
I'll make it even if I die.

1048
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:36,940
I'll make you regret it.

1049
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,420
I'll change it.

1050
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:41,420
I won't care if others regret it or not.

1051
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:47,420
Your life will change completely.

1052
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:05,740
What are you doing?

1053
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:11,140
You'll lose a lot of muscle if you cry.

1054
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,380
Okay.

1055
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,020
I won't cry.

1056
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:21,260
Well, you don't have much muscle to lose yet.

1057
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:25,260
Let's start working out today.

1058
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:29,300
No, I don't feel like starting tomorrow.

1059
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:35,540
Good night.

1060
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,300
You officer!

1061
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,300
I said no!

1062
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:11,300
No matter how hard I try, my body doesn't react.

1063
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,300
It's not working for you.

1064
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,300
What are you doing?

1065
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,300
I'm sorry.

1066
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,300
You can't stand on your own.

1067
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,300
There's a problem.

1068
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,300
What?

1069
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,300
Look straight ahead.

1070
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,300
You better be straight with me.

1071
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,300
Don't give me an excuse.

1072
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,300
What is this?

1073
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,300
I'll stay with you

1074
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:36,300
Every time I see your stars light up the sky

1075
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,300
Anywhere

1076
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,300
Anywhere

1077
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,300
When I was lost you found my way

1078
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,300
And now I'll be your shining star

1079
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,300
Good morning. Did you not sleep in the morning?

1080
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,300
Did you find another man?

1081
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:59,300
I was worried that you might be uncomfortable with my wedding.

1082
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,300
Oh, right. Junseok will be coming to the wedding.

1083
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,300
You should cancel it right now.

1084
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,300
I'm the one who's going to take out the fat from the injection.

1085
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,300
No, I have to wear that uniform.

1086
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,300
I'm going to make you give up.

1087
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,300
You can do it.

1088
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,300
You can do it.

1089
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,300
I can't believe it.

1090
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,300
The condition of a living human body is this bad.

1091
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,300
Am I a mess?
