00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:18,300
lightning

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,560
Dad!

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,940
Dad?

5
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,400
Dad?

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,200
Dad?

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,500
Dad?

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,500
Did Director Do get married?

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,060
Director Do, does he have a child?

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,960
I thought so.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,860
We kind of look alike.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,340
That's right.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,340
She caused her own clicked nose!

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,060
No, I'm not.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,360
I was born smaller than her.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,360
I weigh about 15kg.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,460
She's different from Catwoman.

18
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,060
She's a completely new type of girl.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
You...

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,560
Jiho!

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,760
Oh, my.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,860
Jiho!

23
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,860
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,960
It's okay.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,460
I told you to hold my hand.

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,360
What if you lose me?

27
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,460
Let's go.

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,160
Oh, my.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,660
Oh, my.

30
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,960
Oh, my.

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,260
Be careful.

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,360
Oh, my.

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,460
Are you okay?

34
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,960
Yes, I'm okay.

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,460
I was just a little surprised.

36
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,160
What's okay about being okay?

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,660
Wait, put her down.

38
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,860
No, no.

39
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,760
Put her down.

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,260
Let her rest.

41
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,460
She'll really fall down when she wakes up.

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,260
Oh, my.

43
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,360
Dad.

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,560
That's right.

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,660
This excessive tension will surprise the muscles.

46
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,360
Let's take a break.

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,660
Alex!

48
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,960
Yes, this way.

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,860
That way.

50
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,860
Hurry up.

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,460
This way.

52
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,260
Where are you going?

53
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,860
What should we do?

54
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,160
Oh, my.

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,860
I'm so nervous.

56
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,460
I must be a really bad mom.

57
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,560
I didn't know my baby was going to disappear.

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,760
What do you mean, a bad mom?

59
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,160
Everyone is like that at that age.

60
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,560
They disappear before they even blink.

61
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
Ari!

62
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,760
That's right.

63
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
I'm a bad mom.

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,860
What are you saying?

65
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,060
Director!

66
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,560
What's wrong with you?

67
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,160
I'm a bad mom with a bad stamina.

68
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,560
You never worked out properly after giving birth, right?

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,160
You must be having a headache and dizziness.

70
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,060
Yes, how can I...

71
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,160
It's because of the tension in the neck

72
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,560
that rises from the back, shoulders, and shoulder blades.

73
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,460
When you hold a child,

74
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,760
the strength in the back and the strength in the back

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,360
and the strength in the forearm must be evenly distributed.

76
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,260
But now, you're taking care of the child

77
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,960
with all your might.

78
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,060
The most important thing is stamina!

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,360
It's only 30 meters from the market to here.

80
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,660
This small child is a short distance

81
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,960
that can be walked enough.

82
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,460
No matter how much you've been wandering around

83
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,460
and running back and forth, your mother's breathing is too short.

84
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,760
Your stamina is worse than that of a 2-year-old Jiho.

85
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,160
If you want to be a good mother,

86
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,060
you must have stamina first.

87
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,960
There's only one thing you need to have stamina.

88
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,160
It must be exercise.

89
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,260
I know!

90
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,860
Why do you always exercise before you go to the gym?

91
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,060
The answer is always in our bodies.

92
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,060
Body.

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,560
I want to exercise too.

94
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,760
But I don't have anywhere to leave my child.

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,860
My baby's dad is busy all weekend

96
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,360
and everyone in my family is in the countryside.

97
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,860
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,760
I'll come back to the gym

99
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,760
when I have a bigger child and a baby.

100
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,760
No.

101
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,260
You can't even raise a child.

102
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,960
What?

103
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,860
You think you'll have time when you have a baby.

104
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
Try raising a child.

105
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,660
You can't do it because you're too busy studying.

106
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,460
I'm busy.

107
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,860
You can't do it because you're too busy

108
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,960
preparing to get a job after you finish studying.

109
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,060
I'm busy.

110
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,160
You're busy?

111
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,860
You think you'll be done when you get a job and get married.

112
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,560
You can't have time when you have a baby

113
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,560
and you have to look after your grandchild.

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,160
You can't do it because you're too old

115
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,060
and you can't take care of your grandchild.

116
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,360
My baby is so happy.

117
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,960
My baby!

118
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,060
My baby!

119
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,460
How can you be so old?

120
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,560
I know, but I don't have time.

121
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,360
It's okay if you don't have time.

122
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,560
If you want to do something,

123
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,260
you have to do it right now.

124
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,960
You only have time before you get pregnant.

125
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,060
If I go back to that time,

126
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,460
I won't be able to make sikhye or anything.

127
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,160
But I have nowhere to leave my child.

128
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,360
Don't worry if it's about Jiho.

129
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
Our 24-hour gym is always open

130
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,060
to those who want to work out.

131
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,060
24 hours!

132
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,760
24 hours!

133
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,960
24 hours!

134
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,660
Don't lie!

135
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
I'm back!

136
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,960
I'm your fan!

137
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,660
Welcome.

138
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,760
Did you bring me here?

139
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,160
Yes.

140
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,060
Thank you.

141
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,360
Mira, why did you pay me twice?

142
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,760
Mira, twice?

143
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
I'm sorry.

144
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,960
I caused a trouble that day.

145
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,560
I'm so sorry.

146
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,760
It's okay. It's okay.

147
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,360
It's okay.

148
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,160
Did you visit all the restaurants and spots I recommended?

149
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,460
I told the local guide that I was looking forward to it.

150
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,760
Of course.

151
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,460
It's different to just seeing it in pictures

152
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,060
and seeing it in person.

153
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,560
Why? Where?

154
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,460
Which one was your favorite?

155
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,760
Wow, you're so cute.

156
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,960
You're so lovely.

157
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,560
Wow, I'm so jealous.

158
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,760
Oh, I bought you a present.

159
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,160
Wow!

160
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,960
First, our manager will buy

161
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,560
traditional Hawaiian honey, Manoa Honey.

162
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
This is the most famous in Hawaii.

163
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,060
Oh, Manoa Honey.

164
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,660
Wait, wait.

165
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,960
Manoa Honey!

166
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,660
Our boss will buy

167
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,060
macadamia chocolate only in Hawaii.

168
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,360
Macadamia is really famous in Hawaii.

169
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,060
Thank you.

170
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,260
And Sia will buy

171
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,760
the most famous handmade cookie in Hawaii.

172
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,260
Share it with your family.

173
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
Wow!

174
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,860
You can buy it in a line.

175
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,060
Really?

176
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,160
We'll buy it all. Thank you.

177
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,460
And Miran will buy...

178
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,860
I'm so sorry. I couldn't watch it.

179
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,760
I even bought mine.

180
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,460
I thought of Miran as soon as I saw this.

181
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,560
You thought of me?

182
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,160
Ta-da! Isn't it so cute?

183
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,360
Miran shouldn't eat sweets.

184
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,060
They look so much alike.

185
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,860
Yes, they do look alike.

186
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,460
They look alike.

187
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,360
Do they look alike?

188
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,860
Do they look alike?

189
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,060
Miran has something in common with Hawaii.

190
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,060
What is it?

191
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,360
The PR team suggested a great opportunity for Miran.

192
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,760
What did the PR team suggest?

193
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,060
They're planning to release a package in the live market.

194
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,760
They asked what Miran would do if she introduced it.

195
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,460
Live market?

196
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,960
Miran?

197
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,460
Why are you all so shocked?

198
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,560
Miran has been in Hawaii for a while.

199
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
But she has a manager.

200
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,160
Exactly. She has a manager like me.

201
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,360
The PR team said that Miran should be on the show.

202
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,960
I heard that Miran recommended Hawaii as the best.

203
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,060
Who?

204
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,260
I don't know.

205
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,360
But Miran has never been to Hawaii.

206
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,660
Oh, my.

207
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,460
Maybe Yeji will be there when she goes.

208
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,860
She just came back.

209
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,760
Oh, my.

210
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,660
Oh, that's possible.

211
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,860
But that's what the company decided.

212
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,760
If Miran is okay with it,

213
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
then let's do this.

214
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,960
Okay.

215
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,560
We have a meeting with the show host.

216
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,460
Get ready.

217
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,460
Yes, I'll do my best.

218
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,160
Here.

219
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,560
Thank you.

220
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,060
Okay.

221
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,860
Thank you.

222
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,660
Have a good day.

223
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,060
Thank you.

224
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,860
Miran is good at planning.

225
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,660
You know that, right?

226
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,060
Oh, my.

227
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,760
But Miran, you'll be so worried.

228
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,060
She's going on TV.

229
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,260
If she goes on TV,

230
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,460
she'll look twice as bad.

231
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,360
Twice as bad?

232
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,760
She looks so bad on TV.

233
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,860
But she's actually very small.

234
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,360
That's because she looks so big on camera.

235
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,860
But Miran...

236
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,460
Don't worry about it.

237
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,260
No one will see that.

238
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,560
No one will see that.

239
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,060
Will all her friends, relatives, and ex-boyfriends find out?

240
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,160
Friends, relatives...

241
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,360
Ex-boyfriends?

242
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,660
What?

243
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,460
You're going to quit drugs?

244
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,660
I said I'm going to quit flour.

245
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,860
Shut up.

246
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,660
Yes, flour.

247
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,860
Flour is a drug for people who work out.

248
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,560
It's a white-white drug with sugar and white rice.

249
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,160
What?

250
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,460
These are the pictures of the diet that the host sent me.

251
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,460
Flour was Miran's joy and motivation

252
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,160
and best friend to Miran.

253
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,360
In your case, if you're too strict with your diet,

254
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,260
you might not be able to work out

255
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,160
and you might not be able to live a good life

256
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,760
with flour.

257
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,960
Hold on.

258
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,960
So, you're saying that

259
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,760
I'm being very loyal to my will, my drugs, and my pig.

260
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
What?

261
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,660
But I have to go on TV.

262
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,960
I'm going to introduce the travel products I planned.

263
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,360
I heard that the camera has twice the face.

264
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,160
If the face is twice as big as this,

265
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,560
it'll look like a big mouth.

266
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
What? A big mouth?

267
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,760
But I can't.

268
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,160
You can quit eating and quit flour.

269
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,560
You can quit. I'll quit.

270
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,460
I can't quit.

271
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,260
Do you want to bet?

272
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,160
If I can't quit flour, as you said,

273
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,360
I'll dance at the live market.

274
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,860
Dance?

275
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,560
Dance?

276
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,660
What if I succeed?

277
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,960
If you succeed, I'll add you to my personal training.

278
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,760
Let's eat tteokbokki together.

279
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,360
The tteokbokki that you always said was useless

280
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
and had no nutrition.

281
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,960
I will never put that kind of trash in my mouth.

282
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,360
Let's not talk about tteokbokki even if we do.

283
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,560
It's already too late.

284
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,660
I'm going to eat tteokbokki.

285
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,360
Do whatever you want.

286
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,360
I won't eat that trash anyway.

287
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
You're going to eat tteokbokki this time.

288
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,560
Welcome to tteokbokki world.

289
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,060
Tteokbokki is terrible.

290
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,760
Oh, Ms. Lee.

291
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,260
Hello, Ms. Lee.

292
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,560
Hello.

293
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,860
I'm sorry to come without a reason.

294
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,960
My child is full of energy.

295
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,960
If I don't show up, you'll be looking for me.

296
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,760
Jiho will always be where you see her.

297
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,560
Like this.

298
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,660
I can't do this because I'm tired.

299
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,460
Ms. Lee, I was born with 1.5kg.

300
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,260
My muscles are only 3 to 500.

301
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,260
I've gained 500kg

302
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,160
from squat bench press and deadlifts.

303
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,260
Adding 15kg to my weight

304
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,660
is like putting on a heavy jumper.

305
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,360
I'm still sorry.

306
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,260
I'll check that it's not a sorry thing

307
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,960
with my own body.

308
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,060
Shall we begin?

309
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,860
Should I start?

310
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,960
Mom.

311
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,260
Mom, I'm not going to do it.

312
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,760
Let's warm up first.

313
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Okay.

314
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Mom, I'm not going to do it.

315
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,260
For lunges,

316
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,860
you push one leg out

317
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,260
and your knee goes down and up.

318
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,560
Let's do it together.

319
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,260
Your knee goes down and up.

320
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,060
You feel the stimulus as you come up.

321
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,960
Jiho, is it fun?

322
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,460
Let's do three sets of 10 each.

323
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,960
Mom, mom.

324
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,260
Six.

325
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,960
Mom, mom.

326
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,460
Mom.

327
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,460
I'm not going to...

328
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,260
Don't stop. Seven.

329
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,260
Mom.

330
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,460
Mom.

331
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,760
But still...

332
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,960
Let's do it together.

333
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,260
Nine.

334
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Nine.

335
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,660
You can do it.

336
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,860
Last 10.

337
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,960
10.

338
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,560
10.

339
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,160
Jiho, it's fun, isn't it?

340
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,260
I'll learn a lot from you and do it for you.

341
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,260
Okay.

342
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,260
Teacher.

343
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,060
Wait.

344
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,960
I finished running.

345
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,060
Good job.

346
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
Oh, my.

347
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,860
You worked so hard.

348
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,360
I worked hard.

349
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,560
Thanks to you, I was able to work hard

350
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,760
and train my back muscles.

351
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,760
See you next time.

352
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,260
Excuse me.

353
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,060
Yes?

354
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,460
Can I come again next time?

355
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,160
What are you talking about?

356
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,460
I'm sorry.

357
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,460
Oh, my.

358
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,660
What are you sorry about?

359
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,660
You can make money.

360
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,160
I'm here to work out.

361
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
I'll come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,

362
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,960
and every day.

363
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Yes, you'll be fine

364
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,960
if you come twice a day because you're fit.

365
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,460
Right?

366
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,460
Of course.

367
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,460
It's my duty and it's worth it

368
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,560
to make you work out at your best.

369
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,860
If you can't believe it, would you like to try again?

370
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,760
I'm totally fine.

371
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,760
No, I'm fine.

372
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,860
I'll see you next time.

373
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,760
Thank you.

374
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,060
Thank you.

375
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,560
Oh, my.

376
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,460
I'm going crazy.

377
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,860
It's really really hot.

378
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,760
A white cold relationships,

379
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:24,180
where

380
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,640
bad things happen.

381
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,260
I'm a buddy to you.

382
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:35,260
I decided to record myself being liberated from flour from today.

383
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:42,260
Namely, my flour liberation diary.

384
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,260
The first day of liberation from flour.

385
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:54,260
I had a special sense of separation from the flour that surrounded me.

386
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,260
Goodbye.

387
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:09,260
I had a lot of good memories with you.

388
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Why are you crying?

389
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,260
Did you ruin your memory?

390
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:20,260
When I think my life is ruined, I think of my family.

391
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:37,260
I know that you were the first one to comfort me when I thought my life was ruined.

392
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:46,260
You were the one who congratulated me the closest to the party.

393
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,260
And the moment I was loved the most.

394
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,260
Is it good?

395
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:02,260
I bought it myself.

396
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,260
I've been living a life of love.

397
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,260
I'm going to give up my life.

398
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,260
Let's not see each other again.

399
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:20,260
I'm going to give you all ten pieces of rice.

400
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,260
Goodbye.

401
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,260
What?

402
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,260
What?

403
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,260
What?

404
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,260
What?

405
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,260
Don't come to me again.

406
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
Don't come to me again.

407
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,260
Don't come to me again.

408
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,260
What are you doing at this hour?

409
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,260
Hello, Choyoung.

410
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,260
Choyoung, that's right. It's Choyoung's wedding.

411
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,260
Flour Choyoung's wedding.

412
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,260
Flour Choyoung's wedding?

413
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
I'm going to stop eating flour from today.

414
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,260
What are you going to stop?

415
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,260
How can you stop flour when she's pooping?

416
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,260
Do you want to die?

417
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
Just eat it.

418
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,260
Don't pick people out again because you're on a diet.

419
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,260
That's enough.

420
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,260
Flour is not allowed in my house from today.

421
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,260
Okay?

422
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,260
Okay?

423
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,260
Okay.

424
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,260
Yes.

425
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,260
What are you doing?

426
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,260
What are you doing?

427
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,260
No flour is allowed in my house.

428
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
Okay, then.

429
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,260
Honey.

430
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,260
Honey.

431
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,260
Stop it.

432
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,260
Stop it.

433
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,260
What are you doing?

434
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,260
You made all of that with flour.

435
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,260
With jjajangmyeon, you made pancakes,

436
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,260
with donuts, you made rice cakes,

437
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,260
and with tteokbokki, you made this butt.

438
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
You're a genius.

439
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,260
My sister made flour too.

440
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,260
Stop it.

441
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,260
Stop it.

442
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,260
Stop it.

443
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,260
Flour, I'm so excited.

444
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,260
If God helps you, you'll get the right amount.

445
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,260
If God helps me, you'll get the right amount.

446
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,260
What?

447
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,260
You stopped flour?

448
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
Because of the live market?

449
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,260
It's not that serious.

450
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,260
I heard flour is really bad for you.

451
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,260
It causes blood sugar spikes.

452
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Why don't you try it too?

453
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,260
I'm fine.

454
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,260
I don't gain weight.

455
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,260
But is there anything to eat if you stop flour?

456
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,260
Why not?

457
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
There are so many.

458
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,260
There isn't.

459
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,260
There isn't.

460
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,260
What should we do, Mira?

461
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,260
Just eat, Mira.

462
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
You're not selling your face.

463
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,260
You're selling your body, right?

464
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
Let's go.

465
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,260
Hurry.

466
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,260
I think I'll eat tteokbokki later.

467
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,260
I don't feel like anything today.

468
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Eat a lot, Yejin.

469
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,260
What?

470
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,260
Mira.

471
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,260
Mira.

472
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,260
You're not taking care of the health of the employees at work.

473
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,260
You're not taking care of the health of the employees at work.

474
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,260
You're not taking care of the health of the employees at work.

475
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:11,260
Why are you eating my bread?

476
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,260
Garlic bread.

477
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
You scared me.

478
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Did you hide the bread?

479
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
I didn't hide the bread.

480
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
Who hid it?

481
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,260
I didn't see it.

482
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,260
I told you.

483
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,260
You can't find the bread even if you try it once.

484
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,260
Don't hold back and just eat it.

485
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Who can't hold back?

486
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,260
I'm not going to eat it.

487
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,260
No, you're going to eat this delicious flour.

488
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,260
You should eat the flour.

489
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
Eat it.

490
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,260
Why are you bothering me?

491
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,260
I told you I was going to stop eating flour.

492
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,260
You said it was a white magic.

493
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
You said it was a three-dimensional magic.

494
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,260
I'm not going to eat it.

495
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,260
I'm dizzy.

496
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,260
No, I'm not dizzy.

497
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
I'm not dizzy.

498
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
No, I'm not dizzy.

499
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,260
Did you catch it?

500
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,260
Did you catch it?

501
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
When did you catch it?

502
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
What's wrong with you?

503
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,260
I started dieting because I was going to go to the live market this time.

504
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,260
I guess it's hard.

505
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,260
It must be hard.

506
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,260
8

507
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,260
9

508
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,260
9

509
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
Last

510
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
Last

511
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,260
10

512
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
10

513
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,260
Thank you for your hard work.

514
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,260
What should I do because of me?

515
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,260
It must be hard.

516
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,260
It's not hard at all.

517
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,260
I was born with 1.5kg.

518
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,260
I'm a person who can do 3 to 500kg.

519
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
That's right.

520
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,260
How is your health after working out?

521
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:45,260
My mom said that I gained energy.

522
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,260
She said it's all thanks to the gym director.

523
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,260
I'll help you with the stretching.

524
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,260
Okay.

525
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,260
Look at the front.

526
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,260
Look at your arms.

527
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,260
Wait a minute.

528
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,260
Wait a minute.

529
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,260
Okay.

530
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,260
Alex!

531
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
Yes.

532
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,260
Can you hold Jiho for a second?

533
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,260
Here.

534
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,260
Mom.

535
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,260
Mom.

536
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,260
Mom.

537
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,260
Alex, give her a lunge.

538
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,260
Jiho likes lunge.

539
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,260
I mean, I...

540
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,260
You should do it in the right posture.

541
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,260
You haven't done a lunge properly in years.

542
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
I'm sorry.

543
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,260
I'm sorry, Jiho.

544
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
Are you crying?

545
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,260
I'm sorry.

546
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,260
I didn't see you properly.

547
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,260
I didn't do a lunge properly.

548
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,260
Don't say that.

549
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,260
I'm sorry.

550
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
I'm sorry.

551
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,260
I'm sorry.

552
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,260
What's going on?

553
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,260
My goodness.

554
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,260
Jiho.

555
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,260
Director Do.

556
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
Why are you making the kids cry?

557
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,260
I'm sorry, Jiho.

558
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,260
Jiho, come here.

559
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,260
Let me take care of Jiho.

560
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,260
I'll help you with the lower body stretching.

561
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,260
Don't cry, Jiho.

562
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,260
I'll show you a proper lunge.

563
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,260
Jiho.

564
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,260
You're a genius who can lead the fitness industry.

565
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,260
You can distinguish the exact and rhythmical lunge.

566
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,260
Ouch.

567
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,260
What's wrong with her?

568
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,260
Jiho, close your eyes.

569
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,260
You should focus on the good things.

570
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,260
You said it was hard to get into the fitness industry.

571
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,260
Did you change your job to a yoga class?

572
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,260
You've become a genius.

573
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,260
Just go.

574
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,260
Jiho hates it when the rhythm breaks.

575
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
You look tired.

576
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
Do you want to wash your hands?

577
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,260
I don't have time to deal with you. Just go.

578
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,260
You scared me.

579
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,260
You scared me.

580
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,260
Do Hyunjoong is so weak.

581
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,260
He's one of the two.

582
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,260
He's weak.

583
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,260
You're a human being, so you're sick of him.

584
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,260
I'm sorry.

585
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
Captain?

586
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
Me!

587
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,260
Baby!

588
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,260
I beat Do Hyunjoong this time.

589
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,260
See? Baby, look at this.

590
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,260
Come to our house anytime you want.

591
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
I'll give you a free locker for three months.

592
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,260
A free membership suit for three months.

593
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,260
A box of red ginseng, okay?

594
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,260
Did something happen?

595
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,260
No.

596
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,260
Wait.

597
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
What?

598
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,260
Don't you smell something?

599
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,260
Something smells good.

600
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,260
It smells like bread.

601
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,260
What the hell?

602
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,260
The third day of the flour liberation.

603
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,260
I want to be liberated from flour,

604
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
and have honey skin,

605
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:09,260
and V-line.

606
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,260
Captain.

607
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,260
Yes?

608
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,260
Are you okay?

609
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,260
Me?

610
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,260
You're okay, right?

611
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
Yes.

612
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,260
What do you mean by okay?

613
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
What am I?

614
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
What are humans?

615
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,260
What is life?

616
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
How did I, a small being,

617
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,260
come here from this vast universe?

618
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,260
Do you know me?

619
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,260
Can you tell me?

620
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,260
Please.

621
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,260
What is that?

622
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,260
Is that a rice cake?

623
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,260
It's not a rice cake from the gym.

624
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,260
What is this?

625
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,260
It's still warm.

626
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,260
Rice cake.

627
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
Flour and oil.

628
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,260
They're both delicious.

629
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,260
I'm sorry.

630
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,260
I'm sorry.

631
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
I'm sorry.

632
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,260
I'm sorry.

633
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
I'm sorry.

634
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
I'm sorry.

635
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,260
I'm sorry.

636
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
I'm sorry.

637
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
I can't help but think that

638
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,260
they're both delicious.

639
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
Please eat.

640
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,260
I almost ate it all at once.

641
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,260
What's wrong with that?

642
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
Eating what you always eat

643
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
isn't a big deal.

644
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Miran, you've been doing well.

645
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,260
You're in great shape.

646
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
You have a good face.

647
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,260
You should be on TV.

648
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,260
You shouldn't have a blood sugar spike

649
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,260
and have a TV accident.

650
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,260
Look at this hot rice cake.

651
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,260
Not eating this is a bigger problem.

652
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,260
Miran, you had a bowel movement this morning.

653
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,260
It's because you stopped eating flour.

654
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,260
It's the same bowel movement I always do.

655
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,260
Miran, we're almost there.

656
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,260
The flour liberation is just around the corner.

657
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,260
That's right.

658
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,260
The only problem is that you're eating rice cake.

659
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
I'm sorry.

660
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,260
No, Miran is qualified to eat that.

661
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,260
Please eat.

662
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,260
Don't eat it.

663
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,260
Please eat.

664
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,260
Don't eat it.

665
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,260
I'm scared.

666
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,260
Wait.

667
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,260
Honey.

668
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,260
What are you doing?

669
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,260
You're mumbling to yourself.

670
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,260
Is it because you want to eat rice cake?

671
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,260
Then let's eat together.

672
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,260
It's not like that.

673
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,260
But

674
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,260
is it possible to eat rice cake in the gym?

675
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,260
Does the director know about this?

676
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,260
How would he know about this?

677
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,260
Flour is the devil's powder.

678
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,260
It's one of the three drugs.

679
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,260
If the director finds out about this,

680
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,260
he won't just sit there and do nothing.

681
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,260
You must be hungry after seeing Miran being so sensitive.

682
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,260
Try this.

683
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,260
Try it.

684
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,260
When people are sensitive,

685
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,260
they eat rice cake that makes them sensitive.

686
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,260
I'm not eating it.

687
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,260
Why not? Try it.

688
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
I can't eat that.

689
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,260
Why not? Try it.

690
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,260
I'm not eating it.

691
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,260
Just eat it.

692
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,260
I'm not eating it.

693
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,260
What are you doing?

694
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,260
I told you I'm not eating it.

695
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
I'm not eating it.

696
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,260
I'm going to tell the director everything.

697
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,260
The members are

698
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
going to be evil in the women's room.

699
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,260
Honey.

700
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,260
Director.

701
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,260
Director.

702
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,260
How do you know about the gym?

703
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,260
What are you talking about?

704
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,260
The members ate the rice cake

705
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,260
that was made of flour in this gym.

706
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,260
How could this happen?

707
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,260
Director Do, it's not that.

708
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,260
I did it.

709
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,260
I told them to eat it.

710
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,260
No.

711
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,260
You guys are not at fault.

712
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,260
I did it.

713
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,260
I did it.

714
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,260
Be careful next time.

715
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,260
You can't just let it slide.

716
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,260
It's written right here.

717
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,260
Only muscles eat it in the gym.

718
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,260
Why do you eat the rice cake

719
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,260
when you can only eat muscles?

720
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,260
One, two, three.

721
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,260
Didn't I tell you to stop eating?

722
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,260
It's just rice cake.

723
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,260
Just rice cake?

724
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,260
You're very sensitive right now.

725
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,260
Then just eat the flour.

726
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
Are you telling me to stop the flour liberation ceremony?

727
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,260
I think you're tired of watching the baby

728
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,260
and your judgment has become blurry.

729
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
You said it.

730
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
Flour is the powder of the devil.

731
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,260
Flour is the medicine of the devil.

732
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,260
Did you say you're tired of watching the baby?

733
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,260
I'm a man who was born with 1.5kg and weighs 3.570kg.

734
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:17,260
I don't lose weight with only 15kg.

735
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
Then what are you doing?

736
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,260
You don't even know that the members are falling into the baby's belly.

737
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Because of the baby.

738
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,260
Did you just curse Ji-ho?

739
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,260
Apologize.

740
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,260
Who says it's because of the baby?

741
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,260
It's because of the flour.

742
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,260
Apologize to Ji-ho.

743
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,260
Let go of me.

744
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,260
You're telling me to stop eating flour.

745
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,260
Is that so difficult?

746
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,260
Who eats flour in the gym?

747
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,260
Don't talk to me.

748
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,260
Are they fighting?

749
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,260
I think they're exercising.

750
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,260
I think they're fighting.

751
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,260
They seem to be getting along well.

752
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
They're close.

753
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
You always care about me and your partner.

754
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
Don't talk to me.

755
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
Stop it.

756
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,260
You'll hurt yourself.

757
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
Don't talk to me when you're exercising.

758
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,260
I'm exercising. Why do you talk to me?

759
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,260
Did you cut your personality while cutting flour?

760
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,260
You're not a baby, but a mental illness.

761
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,260
Don't talk to me.

762
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,260
If you have to do that, pull one more.

763
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,260
No, I'm going to cut the flour and eat it.

764
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,260
Even if it's hard, how can you fight with the member?

765
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,260
Who's having a hard time?

766
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,260
Aren't you tired?

767
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,260
Why?

768
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
What?

769
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
You're a monster!

770
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
Ms. Kim!

771
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,260
Ms. Kim!

772
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,260
You've become half-face.

773
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,260
I'm only half-face.

774
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,260
I cut flour.

775
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,260
Honey, can we eat jjajangmyeon?

776
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,260
Choyoung banned flour from this house.

777
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,260
I don't know.

778
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,260
I told you not to eat flour.

779
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,260
I've been craving for flour since then.

780
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,260
Honey.

781
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,260
There's something else I told you not to do at home.

782
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
Do you want me to tell you?

783
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,260
I don't know. What is it?

784
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Honey, it's so sweet.

785
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
What is it?

786
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,260
Honey!

787
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Honey!

788
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
Wait!

789
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,260
Honey!

790
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
You're here already?

791
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,260
It hasn't been long since I went to the gym.

792
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,260
Do you think I'm sensitive because I can't eat flour?

793
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,260
No way.

794
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,260
Right?

795
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,260
It doesn't make sense that I'm sensitive because I can't eat flour.

796
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,260
It's a crime to eat the devil's flour in the gym.

797
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
Of course.

798
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,260
Of course.

799
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
Honey.

800
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
What's that smell?

801
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,260
Did you eat jjajangmyeon here?

802
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,260
No way.

803
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
I didn't eat jjajangmyeon.

804
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,260
I didn't eat flour.

805
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
What the jjajangmyeon?

806
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,260
I told you not to eat flour.

807
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
Honey.

808
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
Flour is a crime.

809
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
It's a crime to eat the devil's flour.

810
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
It's a crime.

811
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,260
I'm stressed.

812
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
It's your fault?

813
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,260
It's your fault?

814
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,260
It's your fault?

815
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,260
It's your fault?

816
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
Get rid of the jjajangmyeon.

817
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,260
Honey, please get rid of the jjajangmyeon.

818
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Get rid of it.

819
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
I'm not eating it.

820
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
I'm not eating it.

821
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
It's hot.

822
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,260
Honey.

823
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,260
Jiho, how did you...

824
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,260
Do Yeonjong, are you tired?

825
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Director Dong.

826
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,260
You must have seen it with a smile.

827
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,260
But you're missing something.

828
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,260
Childhood is not physical strength, but mental strength.

829
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,260
Yeonji, Yeonji.

830
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,260
Jiho.

831
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,260
But you're just tired and whining?

832
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,260
Director Dong.

833
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,260
Yeonji.

834
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,260
How can you keep your mental strength?

835
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
Director Dong.

836
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,260
Yeonji.

837
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,260
You must have seen it with a smile.

838
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,260
It's mental strength.

839
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
Yeonji.

840
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,260
Yeonji.

841
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,260
No.

842
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,260
It's too much.

843
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,260
I can't do it.

844
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,260
It's too much.

845
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,260
No.

846
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,260
I can't do it.

847
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
I can't do it.

848
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,260
Yes, sir.

849
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,260
Sir, are you free at 2 o'clock?

850
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,260
2 o'clock?

851
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,260
2 o'clock?

852
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,260
Do Yeonjong, you said you'd come to the gym.

853
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
Why are you hesitating?

854
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,260
Are you busy today?

855
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,260
What's with your cough?

856
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
Are you pretending to be sick?

857
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Are you okay?

858
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
Yes.

859
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,260
I have a cold.

860
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,260
I don't think I can do it today.

861
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,260
I'm fine, but I can't cry to Jiho.

862
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,260
Oh, no.

863
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,260
I think you overreacted because of us.

864
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,260
I'm sorry.

865
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,260
Oh, no.

866
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
It's not that.

867
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,260
Oh, yes.

868
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,260
Then take a good rest, sir.

869
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
Yes, sir.

870
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,260
Yes.

871
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,260
Sir.

872
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,260
Did you cancel your PT?

873
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,260
What?

874
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,260
Oh, no.

875
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
No, that's...

876
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
Sir!

877
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,260
You're having a hard time.

878
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,260
I'm so tired.

879
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,260
How did you know?

880
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,260
I'm so tired and sick right now.

881
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,260
I think I should go to the hospital.

882
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,260
Hurry up.

883
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,260
Don't worry.

884
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
Ms. Mi-ra,

885
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,260
I heard you're the most popular show host today.

886
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,260
Since we met on a good opportunity,

887
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
let's go big this time.

888
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,260
Yes, I'll do my best.

889
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
Oh, you're here.

890
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,260
Oh, my.

891
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,260
Hello.

892
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,260
Hello.

893
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,260
Hello.

894
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,260
I'm Director Park Jun-bae.

895
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
I'm Assistant Manager Im Mi-ran.

896
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,260
Nice to meet you.

897
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,260
I'm Im Se-young, the show host.

898
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,260
I've never seen such a famous show host.

899
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,260
Oh, that's...

900
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,260
London High Bagel, which boasts extreme chewyness?

901
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,260
I'm fine because I haven't eaten yet, right?

902
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,260
Oh, yes.

903
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,260
I think the features of this product should be explained well.

904
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,260
Yes, so...

905
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,260
I think it would be good to emphasize

906
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,260
the tour of restaurants in Hawaii.

907
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:53,260
Who eats bagels so quickly?

908
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,260
And are you going to leave some cream cheese and basil pesto

909
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,260
and eat it right away?

910
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,260
Eat it right away.

911
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,260
Eat it right away.

912
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,260
Hurry up and eat it.

913
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,260
Yes.

914
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,260
Oh, well...

915
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,260
There are a lot of people from other provinces in Hawaii,

916
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
so the food culture is very unique.

917
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
You're even more unique.

918
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,260
You only eat bagels with your hands.

919
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,260
What?

920
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
Director, I'm sorry.

921
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,260
Yes, so...

922
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,260
Before introducing the unique food culture of the people from Hawaii,

923
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,260
why don't you eat cream cheese and basil pesto?

924
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,260
You eat bagels to eat this.

925
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,260
What?

926
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,260
This?

927
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,260
What are you doing?

928
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,260
I'm sorry.

929
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,260
I thought you were imagining it.

930
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,260
I'm sorry. I was imagining it.

931
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,260
I'm sorry. I really said it.

932
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,260
I'm sorry. I thought it was an imagination.

933
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

934
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,260
Please eat it.

935
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,260
I'm screwed.

936
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,260
Even if you're a bread lover,

937
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,260
how can you make a meeting

938
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,260
with a bread story at such an important place?

939
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,260
Where did all the products from the show go?

940
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,260
Can you do a live market with this?

941
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,260
I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

942
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Don't do that again. I'm upset.

943
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,260
Okay.

944
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,260
See you later.

945
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,260
Thank you.

946
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,260
I'm home.

947
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,260
Ms. Mira.

948
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,260
You must be having a hard time breaking the flour.

949
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,260
You made all those mistakes.

950
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,260
It's not that.

951
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,260
Is it because you broke the flour?

952
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,260
You look like you've lost some weight.

953
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,260
Really?

954
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
If it was a big dumpling back then,

955
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
now it's...

956
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,260
Like a bread?

957
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,260
What?

958
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,260
That's...

959
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,260
Is it a bread?

960
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,260
Is it real? Is it fake?

961
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,260
It's a vegetable bread.

962
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,260
What did I say?

963
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,260
It's a bread, right?

964
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,260
No, you have to eat both.

965
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,260
It's been seven days since I broke the flour.

966
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,260
I'm facing a more cruel truth.

967
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,120
Flour is a powerful and scary

968
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,260
and scary ruler.

969
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:24,260
I'm a weaker slave to flour than you think.

970
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,260
This is a sweet potato.

971
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,260
The hospital that cures me...

972
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,260
is right here.

973
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,260
There's nothing to be afraid of.

974
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,260
This is the time to improve

975
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,260
your physical strength to train your members better.

976
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,260
I feel great.

977
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,260
It's been a while since I've exercised outside.

978
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,260
I feel like I'm having a meal.

979
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,260
Dad!

980
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,260
Jiho, where is your dad?

981
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,260
Dad!

982
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,260
Where is he?

983
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,260
Dad!

984
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,260
Oh, it's a teacher.

985
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,260
Teacher!

986
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,260
Teacher! Teacher!

987
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,260
Teacher!

988
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,260
Teacher!

989
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,260
Oh, my goodness!

990
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,260
I'm sorry.

991
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,260
Oh, my goodness!

992
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,260
Oh, my goodness!

993
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,260
Teacher!

994
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,260
Oh, Mr. Chairman!

995
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,260
What brings you here?

996
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,260
I have a cold right now.

997
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,260
It's so bad.

998
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,260
My friends told me to come out.

999
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,260
So I came here.

1000
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,260
Excuse me.

1001
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,260
Are you crazy?

1002
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,260
Why are you suddenly getting involved in Namyeon's life?

1003
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,260
Wait a minute. I'll tell you.

1004
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,260
Stay still.

1005
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,260
Okay.

1006
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,260
We ruined all our pictures because of you.

1007
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,260
What are you going to do about it?

1008
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,260
I'm sorry.

1009
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,260
Give it to me.

1010
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,260
5,000 won. Give it to me.

1011
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,260
What?

1012
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,260
Please tell me my account number.

1013
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,260
Excuse me.

1014
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,260
This.

1015
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,260
Mr. Chairman.

1016
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,260
Mr. Chairman.

1017
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,260
You know that I didn't report you.

1018
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,260
I'm sorry.

1019
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,260
Honey, you looked so sexy when you were angry.

1020
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,260
Let's take another picture with that look.

1021
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,260
Let's go.

1022
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,260
Teacher.

1023
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,260
I'm sorry.

1024
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,260
I was so careless.

1025
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,260
No, it's okay.

1026
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,260
Mom.

1027
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,260
Mom.

1028
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,260
Mom.

1029
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,260
Mom.

1030
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,260
Mom.

1031
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,260
Mom.

1032
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,260
Jiho, come here.

1033
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,260
I'll be done soon.

1034
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,260
No, no, no.

1035
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,260
It's okay.

1036
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,260
Let's go.

1037
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,260
Teacher.

1038
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,260
This is porridge.

1039
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,260
I bought it to give you.

1040
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,260
And I don't think I can go to the gym anymore.

1041
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,260
I'm sorry for everything.

1042
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,260
Jiho.

1043
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,260
Good girl.

1044
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,260
I'm sorry.

1045
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,260
Jiho.

1046
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,260
Why did I learn this?

1047
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,260
Mirami.

1048
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,260
Yes?

1049
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,260
Tomorrow is the last day of school, right?

1050
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,260
Yes.

1051
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,260
Good luck.

1052
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,260
Good luck.

1053
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,260
I'm tired.

1054
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,260
No, no.

1055
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,260
Everyone, look at this.

1056
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,260
It's a London bagel.

1057
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,260
What is this?

1058
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,260
It's a bagel.

1059
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,260
It's a bagel.

1060
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,260
It's a bagel.

1061
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:39,260
My husband bought it for me to eat while working.

1062
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,260
It looks delicious, right?

1063
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,260
It's very famous.

1064
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,260
I really wanted to eat this.

1065
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,260
Here you go.

1066
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,260
Thank you.

1067
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,260
Thank you for the food.

1068
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,260
And this is for you, Jaesik.

1069
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,260
Thank you.

1070
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,260
Thank you.

1071
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,260
Thank you.

1072
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,260
Thank you.

1073
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,260
What?

1074
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,260
What about me?

1075
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,260
You stopped eating flour.

1076
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,260
You have to go on TV tomorrow.

1077
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,260
It's all for you.

1078
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,260
Is that okay?

1079
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,260
No.

1080
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,260
What?

1081
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,260
Okay, then.

1082
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,260
I'm going to work.

1083
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,260
It's been 8 days since I started working.

1084
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,260
I think I really need to work.

1085
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,260
Are you okay, sir?

1086
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,260
You should rest for today.

1087
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,260
I'm fine.

1088
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,260
Dad!

1089
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,260
Jihun.

1090
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,260
Jihun?

1091
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,260
Dad!

1092
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,260
Jihun.

1093
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,260
Yes?

1094
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,260
You were sick, but you're still waiting for Jihun?

1095
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,260
I heard Jihun's mom was sick for a while.

1096
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,260
I think it's not just because of you.

1097
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,260
Jihun?

1098
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,260
Jihun!

1099
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,260
I'm sorry I'm late.

1100
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,260
I'm sorry.

1101
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,260
If you want to see Jihun, go to the supermarket.

1102
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,260
Jihun's mom was there.

1103
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,260
What?

1104
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,260
Jihun!

1105
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,260
Jihun.

1106
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,260
Jihun.

1107
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,260
Jihun.

1108
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,260
Jihun.

1109
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,260
Dad.

1110
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,260
Jihun.

1111
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,260
I'm so sorry.

1112
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,260
Dad.

1113
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,260
Mom gave you lunch, too.

1114
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,260
I'm sorry.

1115
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,260
It's because your knees are not in the right angle.

1116
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,260
Sir?

1117
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,260
Our sports genius, Jiho,

1118
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,260
doesn't stop crying unless he has a correct lunge.

1119
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:29,260
Now, give me the T-oil.

1120
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,260
Make sure your knees don't come together.

1121
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,260
90 degrees of angle.

1122
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,260
I'm sorry.

1123
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,260
Sir, let's get going.

1124
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,260
Let's learn how to do a correct lunge.

1125
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,260
No, I...

1126
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,260
Are you going to keep crying like this?

1127
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,260
Jiho.

1128
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,260
Jiho.

1129
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,260
I'm sorry, sir.

1130
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,260
Why do you keep saying you're sorry?

1131
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,260
I'm the one who's at fault.

1132
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,260
I don't know.

1133
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,260
I think it's my fault after I gave birth to the baby.

1134
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:37,260
Even if the baby cries, hurts, or leaves food,

1135
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,260
it's all because of me.

1136
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,260
I'm sorry.

1137
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,260
I'm the one who takes the baby wherever he goes.

1138
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,260
I'm such a bad mom.

1139
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,260
Sir.

1140
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,260
I knew you were having a hard time.

1141
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,260
But I just pretended not to know.

1142
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:03,260
I wanted to be released from the baby for a moment.

1143
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,260
I can't believe a mother wants to be released from her child.

1144
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,260
I'm such a bad mom.

1145
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,260
No.

1146
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,260
I didn't take the baby. It's my fault.

1147
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,260
I'm sorry?

1148
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:27,260
I thought I could solve it if I grew your body.

1149
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,260
But I was wrong.

1150
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,260
You weren't the one who needed training.

1151
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,260
The one who needs my training is...

1152
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,260
That woman.

1153
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,260
Are you talking about Jiho?

1154
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,260
I thought it was a problem that your body was weak.

1155
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,260
But the real problem is that

1156
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,260
your body was too strong.

1157
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,260
You were able to do lunges 200 times,

1158
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,260
but you were able to do jumps 500 times.

1159
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,260
You were able to do jumps 500 times,

1160
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,260
but you were unable to do jumps 500 times.

1161
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,260
You can't handle it even if you say you're working out.

1162
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,260
Then what should I do?

1163
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,260
You need to get a special training.

1164
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,260
One, two, three.

1165
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,260
Last one.

1166
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,260
Two more.

1167
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,260
Sit straight.

1168
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,260
We're not done yet.

1169
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,260
Straighten your back.

1170
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,260
You can do it.

1171
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,260
I'm not talking to you with a loud voice.

1172
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,260
Please keep your fitness manners.

1173
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,260
Straighten your back.

1174
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,260
One, two, three, four.

1175
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,260
Nice. Is it fun?

1176
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,260
Last one.

1177
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,260
Hello.

1178
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,260
Welcome.

1179
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,260
Hello.

1180
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,260
Oh, my.

1181
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,260
You're all here.

1182
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,260
You're the one who recommended me.

1183
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,260
Thank you so much.

1184
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,260
I think we should change the main theme to U-Hop Pt.

1185
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,260
It's simple and fits our level.

1186
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,260
What did you do?

1187
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,260
It's been a while since you've been released.

1188
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,260
I had coffee.

1189
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,260
It was refreshing.

1190
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,260
Why?

1191
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,260
You should have gone to a more fun place.

1192
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,260
You should have gone shopping and met your friends.

1193
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,260
That's what I wanted to do the most.

1194
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,260
Before the ice melts,

1195
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:26,260
I want to have a cup of cold coffee.

1196
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,260
Is this the plan?

1197
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,260
Yes.

1198
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,260
Thank you.

1199
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,260
I'll go check on the bank.

1200
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,260
You want some bagels, right?

1201
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,260
Yes, please.

1202
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,260
You've been working hard.

1203
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,260
You should have some.

1204
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,260
Director.

1205
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,260
Come on.

1206
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,260
I said it's okay.

1207
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,260
Can I really do that?

1208
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,260
Of course.

1209
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,260
Come on.

1210
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,260
Oh, my bagel.

1211
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,260
I succeeded in liberation.

1212
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:06,260
Liberation from the flour liberation.

1213
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,260
Director!

1214
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,260
Director!

1215
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,260
Oh, my.

1216
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,260
I don't want anything!

1217
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,260
Director?

1218
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,260
Director!

1219
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,260
Hey!

1220
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,260
Director!

1221
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,260
Are you okay?

1222
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,260
Please count if it's a liquid.

1223
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,260
Director.

1224
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,260
I'm done.

1225
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,260
The cream cheese is fine.

1226
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,260
Cream cheese?

1227
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,260
Yes.

1228
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,260
I'm a flour addict and a slave to flour.

1229
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,260
But I can't forget the flour.

1230
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,260
What should I do?

1231
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,260
What is it?

1232
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,260
Eat.

1233
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,260
You ran because you wanted to eat.

1234
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,260
I almost caught a thief.

1235
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,260
You have the right to eat.

1236
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,260
Really?

1237
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,260
I didn't eat because I wanted to eat.

1238
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,260
You told me to eat.

1239
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,260
I'm sorry.

1240
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,260
I didn't eat.

1241
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,260
I didn't eat.

1242
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:42,260
Then can I look forward to tomorrow's dance?

1243
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,260
What are you talking about?

1244
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,260
I don't know.

1245
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,260
Miran will dance tomorrow.

1246
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,260
I'll eat a lot today.

1247
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,260
I want to give it to you, but I can't.

1248
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,260
It's so delicious.

1249
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,260
Hello.

1250
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,260
The product we're preparing today is

1251
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:25,260
a Hawaiian travel package.

1252
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:28,260
I heard that this product is different from other products.

1253
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,260
Yes, that's right.

1254
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,260
Hawaii has a beautiful sea and beautiful scenery.

1255
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,260
It's a paradise.

1256
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,260
So if you've been to this package,

1257
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,260
you'll remember Hawaii as a taste of happiness.

1258
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,260
Is it because of the mood?

1259
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,260
You look excited today.

1260
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,260
You ate it.

1261
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,260
You ate this flour.

1262
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,260
Okay, I'm glad you were happy.

1263
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:57,260
I remember it as a taste of happiness.

1264
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,260
The taste of the food I ate with someone.

1265
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:03,260
Do you have any other good memories?

1266
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,260
You said you remember it as a taste.

1267
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,260
What was the happiest taste recently?

1268
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,260
It's not Hawaiian food.

1269
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,260
I like bagels.

1270
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,260
Bagels?

1271
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,260
Yes, I love bagels.

1272
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,260
I love bagels.

1273
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,260
You look happy.

1274
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,260
Would you like to travel with me?

1275
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,260
If I leave for Hawaii,

1276
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,260
I'll be able to learn hula dance.

1277
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,260
That's right. You'll be able to learn hula dance.

1278
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,260
Okay.

1279
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:39,260
You have a lot of muscles.

1280
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,260
I'll add 30 minutes of cardio tomorrow.

1281
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:45,260
The devil's flour that controls the mood.

1282
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,260
Cute.

1283
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,260
You're crying.

1284
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,260
Is your mom accepted?

1285
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,260
Yes.

1286
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,260
The child who controls all time.

1287
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,260
What are all these?

1288
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,260
You registered your mother's name,

1289
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:08,260
so you changed your old membership.

1290
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:13,260
We thought that getting away from them was liberation.

1291
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:17,260
But true liberation is...

1292
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,260
You look very tired.

1293
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,260
Leave the night shift to us.

1294
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,260
Go home and rest today.

1295
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,260
What are you talking about?

1296
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,260
The word tired before the director is never...

1297
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,260
I'm grateful if you do that.

1298
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,260
Goodbye, everyone.

1299
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:36,260
Take care of yourself for a moment.

1300
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,260
I'm so tired today.

1301
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,260
It's okay. It was a very valuable embarrassment.

1302
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,260
It was delicious.

1303
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,260
It was delicious.

1304
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,260
No, no, no.

1305
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,260
No.

1306
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,260
But...

1307
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,260
The unexpected moment...

1308
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,260
Our bodies betray us cruelly.

1309
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,260
Our bodies betray us cruelly.

1310
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,260
Personality and physical strength are proportional.

1311
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,260
I was worried about the director of Miran.

1312
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:45,260
It's clear that my physical strength has fallen.

1313
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,260
Yeah.

1314
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,260
Let's admit it and apologize.

1315
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,260
Director, I'm sorry.

1316
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,260
Director, I'm sorry.

1317
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,260
Director, I'm sorry.

1318
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,260
It's Junseong.

1319
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,260
He's the one who recommended Miran to the Hawaii PR team.

1320
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,260
It's gone. It's gone.

1321
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:51,260
What's wrong?

1322
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,260
What's wrong?

1323
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,260
Junseok was there earlier.

1324
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:59,260
Director, did you know?
