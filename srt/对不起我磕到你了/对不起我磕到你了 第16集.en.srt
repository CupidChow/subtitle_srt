1
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,120
Okay.

2
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,420
It looks great.

3
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,920
Xiaoxue, take a photo of me here.

4
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,840
Coming.

5
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,640
Change your pose.

6
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,920
This pose doesn't look good.

7
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,280
No, Chacha used this exact pose.

8
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,320
Don't you know her?

9
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,520
She copies everything Chacha does.

10
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,440
Come on.

11
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,720
Hey, look at your fans.

12
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,200
I won't be recognized, right?

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,600
Hey, since we've been spotted, let's take a photo with them

14
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,060
and say hello cheerfully.

15
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,720
Coming!

16
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,920
Oh my!

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,120
Hi there!

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,920
Hi, are you a Chacha fan too?

19
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,720
Yes, I'm also a Chacha fan.

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,800
A baking fan.

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,720
Then you must be a level 10 baking fan.

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,759
That's right.

23
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,760
You seem to like her more than I do.

24
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,970
Because you look more like her.

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,160
I'm trying my best too.

26
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,360
Why do you need to look more like Chacha?

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,240
It's because the guy she likes

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,600
just liked Chacha's post last week.

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,079
Yes, if she looks more like Chacha,

30
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,410
then she'll have a better chance with him.

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,840
But I don't think so.

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,640
For two people to be together,

33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,500
they need to like the most authentic version of you.

34
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,480
I think so too.

35
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,740
So you're going to meet your sweetheart?

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,720
Yes, he'll be here tomorrow too.

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,120
How about letting me help you?

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,160
I'm a stylist.

39
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,040
I can give you a makeover.

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,079
Hmm.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,260
Sure, that would be great.

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,760
But let's skip today.

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,490
There's not enough time today.

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,720
Tomorrow morning, we'll go to town and find a photo studio.

45
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
I'll do your makeup then.

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
It's a deal then.

47
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,440
Okay.

48
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,800
Mr. Lu, our company's new sea island cotton manufacturer

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,160
is located on Zhizhi Island.

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,600
You came here in such a hurry.

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,530
Are you eager to sign the contract?

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,800
You're really efficient when it comes to work.

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
I'll contact the manufacturer's representative

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,800
to be on standby tonight.

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,400
No need.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,400
I just want to simply experience the atmosphere there.

57
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,360
Then I'll ask the manufacturer's representative

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,160
to send someone to give us a tour.

59
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,480
No need.

60
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,920
Just drop me off and go back.

61
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,280
Don't worry about me.

62
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,440
You'll need accommodation tonight, right?

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,920
I'll have the manufacturer arrange a hotel for you.

64
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,160
I said no need.

65
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,440
I just want to experience it myself.

66
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,440
No reception necessary.

67
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,220
Don't tell anyone about this.

68
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,290
How's your vacation going?

69
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,440
Who's texting you so late?

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,680
It's Lu Chen.

71
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,600
He's checking up on you.

72
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,120
He's just asking.

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,280
Tell me, did he come to see you?

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,720
No way.

75
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,960
I bet he did.

76
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,200
You two chat.

77
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,520
I'm going to bed.

78
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,040
It's pretty good. This place is beautiful.

79
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,080
It helps calm the mind.

80
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,240
Hehe.

81
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,810
This is a nice place.

82
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,360
I've made some new discoveries too.

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,360
Where's Chacha?

84
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,000
She just fell asleep next to me.

85
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,520
Good night.

86
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,880
Hello.

87
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,040
Could I have another drink, please?

88
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,840
Sure.

89
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,520
Hello?

90
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,400
Anyone here? If not, we'll just...

91
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,120
Is anyone here? Hello?

92
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,800
We're here for a photo shoot.

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,880
Where's the manager?

94
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,960
Anyone here?

95
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,360
Where's the boss?

96
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,160
Someone's here!

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,720
Photo package is 350 yuan with makeup and hair.

98
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,260
You can shoot at the beach.

99
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,520
Scan the code to pay if you want photos.

100
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,600
Boss, can we use our own makeup artist?

101
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,640
No discount.

102
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,040
Then can I at least do my own makeup?

103
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,960
That's fine.

104
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,960
Great, then we can begin.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,800
Mr. Lu, what brings you here?

106
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,040
I was just passing by.

107
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,640
So you just happened to pass by this town

108
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,500
and then just happened to pass by this photo studio?

109
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,170
What are you doing here?

110
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,570
We're helping my sister with her styling.

111
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,240
You're Lu Chen from NS.

112
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,880
I've seen you in magazines.

113
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,160
It's really him.

114
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,720
So she must be Chacha.

115
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,400
So you're Chacha.

116
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,480
Really? So are the rumors about you two true?

117
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,140
Didn't you just clarify that?

118
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,720
We're just colleagues.

119
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,890
There's no romance.

120
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,800
So who's getting styled today?

121
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,860
She's going to confess her feelings.

122
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,120
Shall we go together, Teacher Zhaocai?

123
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,180
Don't call me Zhaocai.

124
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,120
Her sister's goal

125
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,200
is to make herself just like Chacha.

126
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,799
The way she looks now,

127
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,000
it's probably hard to make her like Chacha,

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,130
but she could look like you did before.

129
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,360
Would it kill you to speak nicely?

130
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,160
Boss, can this outfit be altered?

131
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,160
Why don't you buy a new one?

132
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,840
How much is this outfit?

133
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,760
After alterations, we'll charge you the original price.

134
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,560
We can alter anything if you pay.

135
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,160
Let me.

136
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,200
This French vintage corset skirt

137
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,400
suits her lively and cute style better.

138
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,160
What do you think?

139
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't want to wear this outfit.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,640
This isn't Chacha's style.

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,800
I want clothes that match Chacha's style.

142
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,000
It looks really nice.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,040
Alright.

144
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
We get it.

145
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,720
Her request now is to transform herself

146
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,180
to look like someone else?

147
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,920
She wants to be exactly like Chacha now.

148
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,000
But isn't the premise of two people falling in love

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,160
allowing each other to be themselves?

150
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,730
But shouldn't we try our best to meet the client's requests?

151
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,440
Like this.

152
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,040
Yes, it does look good.

153
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,890
What about this one?

154
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,330
The top looks great.

155
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,170
And this for the bottom.

156
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
What do you think?

157
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,560
Perfect.

158
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,700
We've decided on this outfit.

159
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,720
This works.

160
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,440
This matches Chacha's style.

161
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,280
Chaoxu.

162
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,010
Yes. The makeup is up to you now.

163
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,280
Understood, Mr. Lu.

164
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,240
Leave it to me.

165
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm so excited.

166
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,480
I'll leave Sister Chacha to you.

167
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,800
Honestly, do you like Yi Feng?

168
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,860
That's none of your business.

169
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,120
Then why did you tell her?

170
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
When you like someone, you should let them be themselves.

171
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,840
Beautiful.

172
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,400
Thank you, sis.

173
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,680
You're welcome.

174
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,360
By the way, does that Lu Chen like you?

175
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,320
No, we're just former colleagues.

176
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,080
But he's been staring at you since he arrived.

177
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,280
He's styling me but keeps asking for your opinion.

178
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,880
Really? Yeah.

179
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,040
Have you noticed?

180
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,320
When he talks to Chaoxu, it's always instructions.

181
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,540
But with you, he's asking for advice.

182
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,840
I'm an expert at spotting secret crushes.

183
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,320
Trust me, I'm never wrong.

184
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,240
Here I am! Look at me!

185
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
You look great!

186
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
Do I look like Chacha?

187
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,960
Cover your features.

188
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,240
You are Chacha.

189
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
I'm just a Chacha lookalike.

190
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,560
Hurry up and call Xiao Li.

191
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,520
Oh, right.

192
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,280
Call Xiao Li.

193
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,880
Yes.

194
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,160
Call Xiao Li now.

195
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,960
Really.

196
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Call him now!

197
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,800
Okay, I'll call.

198
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,400
Hurry up and call Xiao Li!

199
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,920
Go ahead, do it!

200
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,880
Call now!

201
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,720
Hurry up!

202
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,640
Hello? Xiao Li? It's me.

203
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,840
Are you still on the island?

204
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
Yes. How about you?

205
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,360
I'm here too.

206
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,200
Ask him to come out.

207
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,880
Quickly, yes!

208
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,010
Tell him to come out!

209
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,520
Tonight,

210
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,400
Manman, want to take a walk by the river?

211
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,840
It's been a while since we've seen each other.

212
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,640
Sure!

213
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,560
It's settled then.

214
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,420
It's a promise.

215
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,240
Do I look like Chacha now?

216
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,520
Do you? Yes, very much.

217
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,600
Calm down.

218
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,600
Since he's going to confess,

219
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,600
shouldn't we go out and prepare properly?

220
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,800
Let's go!

221
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,600
Let's go.

222
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,800
Who's paying?

223
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,720
Him.

224
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,480
Okay.

225
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,120
Xiao Li.

226
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,920
Manman.

227
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,080
I guess only someone like Zhaoxu could come up with

228
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,040
using three camera positions to film a confession video.

229
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,880
Does he think this is a movie production?

230
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,240
But it's so romantic this way.

231
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,840
Just be patient for a moment.

232
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Look at me.

233
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,960
Li, do I look good today?

234
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,560
Yes, you look good.

235
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,640
Here it comes.

236
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,130
The crucial moment.

237
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,440
Come on, say it.

238
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,360
It's getting cold and windy.

239
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,280
Are you cold?

240
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,680
Not at all. My blood runs hot.

241
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,960
Have you ever thought about

242
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,760
what it would be like when someone confesses to you?

243
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,320
No.

244
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,640
I actually came to confess my feelings to you today.

245
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,720
But I don't even recognize you anymore.

246
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,680
What do you mean?

247
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,080
Li.

248
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,800
I dressed up the way you like.

249
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,680
Do you like how you look now?
