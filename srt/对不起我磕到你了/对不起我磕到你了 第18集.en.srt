1
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,400
Come on, have a seat.

2
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,920
I've already ordered the food.

3
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,120
It'll be served soon.

4
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,400
But before the food arrives,

5
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,120
I want to announce a decision.

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,680
I have an idea I'd like to discuss with you all.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,320
Where are we going next?

8
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,520
Stop fooling around. Go ahead, Chaoxu.

9
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,680
Now that Yi Feng has resigned,

10
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,780
Chacha's work has been affected too.

11
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,000
But think about it carefully.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,259
How did you get your social media account

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,259
up and running in the first place?

14
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,440
We're in a slump now,

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,450
but hitting bottom also means we can bounce back.

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,479
You mean we should continue with our fashion media account?

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,120
You're only one-third right.

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,560
What about the other one-third?

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,720
It's two-thirds.

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,280
We're not just doing social media.

21
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,200
We're also going to open an image design studio.

22
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,280
It will be a physical store.

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,680
We'll combine online and offline operations

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,560
and collaborate with my studio.

25
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,120
Great! I want to join.

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,880
Wait, I'm not finished yet.

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,560
I've already thought of a theme for this studio.

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,160
It's called 'One-Day Idol.'

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,650
I understand what you mean now.

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,480
We're basically helping ordinary people with their image,

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,280
and based on the idols they like,

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
we create a one-day experience for them.

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,240
Right. 'One-Day Dreamer,' 'Personal Tailor,'

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,000
you've seen these movies, right?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,660
Yes, I have.

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,720
I think this idea is great.

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
So,

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,880
our target customers are all women?

39
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,960
That's right.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,079
After meeting Lu Manman and others on Zhizhi Island,

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,960
I realized

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,520
everyone seems to only learn fashion

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,480
and makeup styles from celebrities.

44
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,320
Online,

45
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,760
although there are many key opinion leaders

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,640
who can provide beauty tips,

47
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,160
but in reality, only when you try it do you realize

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,360
it's actually very difficult to find the right solution.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,560
Didn't you reject me?

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,360
I...

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,200
When did I reject you?

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,600
I confessed to you and you didn't accept.

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,760
Isn't that rejecting me?

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,600
You even made excuses asking if I like you the way you are.

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,160
I like you just the way you were.

56
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,400
What about now?

57
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,040
I can barely recognize you now.

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,160
Are you crazy?

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,960
I can change back to how I was before.

60
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,880
It's okay.

61
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,079
Don't cry.

62
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,360
That guy told me not to make someone I care about cry.

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,300
Please stop crying, okay?

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
I actually think that being a one-day idol

65
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
isn't about completely imitating idols.

66
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,600
It's about finding the best version of yourself.

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,720
That's what makes it a superior aesthetic,

68
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,180
a higher level of fashion.

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,520
As expected from President Lu.

70
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,370
This project sounds very meaningful.

71
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
I'm honored to have President Lu's approval.

72
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,440
I happen to have an empty shop space available.

73
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,160
We can use it as our physical store.

74
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,880
After opening, I'll be responsible for bringing in customers,

75
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,480
and you'll handle the operations.

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
What do you think?

77
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,520
Looks like all your shareholders have already unanimously approved.

78
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,050
I'd like to start tomorrow.

79
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,980
After this trip to Zhizhi Island,

80
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,920
I also have an important decision to announce.

81
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,620
I'll keep you in suspense for now.

82
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,920
After all, our Ding Jin Xiu project's big show

83
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,080
is about to begin.

84
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,840
This is also crucial for us,

85
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
and we still have a lot of work to complete.

86
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,380
I'll make my announcement after everything is successfully completed.

87
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:49,840
President Lu,

88
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,970
you're really keeping us in suspense.

89
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,650
But don't worry,

90
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,720
I'll give my all to the Ding Jin Xiu project.

91
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,040
Then I must thank you, President Zhao.

92
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,800
You're a smart person.

93
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,200
You're the clever one.

94
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,960
Stop talking like aliens, you two.

95
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,200
I really don't understand.

96
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,480
You were arguing when you first met,

97
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
and now you're praising each other.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,720
Mr. Lu and I aren't praising each other.

99
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,040
We're still competitors.

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,040
True rivals always appreciate each other's talents.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,160
I don't understand you people.

102
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,400
Hurry up and eat.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I haven't taken on many fashion events recently.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,560
Right now,

105
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,360
we're standing in front of the One-Day Idol Styling Studio,

106
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,320
created by famous fashion stylist Chao Xu

107
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,280
and model Cha Cha

108
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,560
together.

109
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,920
The One-Day Idol Studio

110
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,360
has generated quite a buzz

111
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,520
nationwide.

112
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,360
Isn't this my best state right now?

113
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,840
Right?

114
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,540
Hello, Ms. Cha Cha.

115
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,200
Hello.

116
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you have anything

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,560
you'd like to say to our viewers?

118
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,200
Unlike other creative styling studios,

119
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,760
we approach styling from our clients' work, social life,

120
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,920
personality, and emotional aspects.

121
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,960
We aim to create unique

122
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,890
beauty solutions for every woman.

123
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,520
It seems

124
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,320
your team has mastered exclusive beauty secrets.

125
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,880
Media came today.

126
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,880
How's it going?

127
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,160
Pretty good.

128
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,480
Cha Cha is being interviewed.

129
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
The reporters' questions are good.

130
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,930
That's good. Call me if you need anything.

131
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,080
Sure.

132
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,159
By the way,

133
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
today's client is quite special.

134
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,360
You need to take extra care of her.

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,720
Got it, don't worry.

136
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,240
Has Lu Chen been here?

137
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Any news from him?

138
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,280
No.

139
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,280
But he did message me when we opened,

140
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,720
nothing since then.

141
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,760
He's probably busy. Why?

142
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,680
Nothing.

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,560
Just asking.

144
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,080
What a strange guy.

145
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,200
I'll let you get back to work. Bye.

146
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,440
Bye.

147
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,040
Congratulations on opening your studio.

148
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,300
Don't limit yourself.

149
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,760
You can do anything.

150
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,760
Have you always believed in me this much?

151
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,140
Hello, I found another style that complements your skin tone.

152
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,100
Try this necklace as well.

153
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,040
Hello, can we film the customer's reveal?

154
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,960
I'm sorry,

155
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,760
but no.

156
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,000
You can ask before filming,

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,400
but our staff

158
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,120
can't make decisions for our clients.

159
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,360
This is a live broadcast.

160
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
It's a great exposure opportunity.

161
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,040
Still not allowed.

162
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm really sorry.

163
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,040
Alright then.

164
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,080
You can come out now.

165
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,610
All the reporters are gone.

166
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Wow, that looks great!

167
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,090
Come take a look.

168
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,360
I've never dressed like this before.

169
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
This dress

170
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,620
really brings out your elegance.

171
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,040
I specifically chose a more formal style for you,

172
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,440
not a casual one.

173
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,520
Because I know

174
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,159
today must be

175
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,360
a special day for you.

176
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,320
Come over here,

177
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,340
look in the mirror and see how beautiful you are.

178
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,960
Thank you, young lady,

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,600
for not looking down on this strange old woman.

180
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,760
Everyone has the right to pursue beauty

181
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,210
and the freedom to decide their own style.

182
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,320
I heard you didn't care about your appearance before either.

183
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,520
Did you see what I wrote

184
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,200
on my profile about meeting my partner?

185
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,530
So was everything you said before untrue?

186
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,400
Let me show you.

187
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,360
That was the old me.

188
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,440
Your transformation is so dramatic,

189
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,970
I can hardly recognize you.

190
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,960
In the past,

191
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
I didn't care about appearances

192
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,040
and thought being sloppy was being authentic.

193
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,280
I'm not as brave as you,

194
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,140
willing to try different styles.

195
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,920
Thank you for establishing this studio

196
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,520
and making me look so elegant to see my husband.

197
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,160
But he can't see me anymore.

198
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,720
Excuse me.

199
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,560
Hello?

200
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,120
Hello, is this Miss Yi Feng?

201
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,840
Yes, that's me. And you are?

202
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,760
I'm an investment manager from Taihe Fund.

203
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,960
You can call me Alex.

204
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,160
Investment manager?

205
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm very interested in your studio's business model.

206
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,120
Our company mainly invests in boutique studios like yours.

207
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,080
Really?

208
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,320
Can we really get investment?

209
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,280
If you're interested, you can come to our office to discuss details.

210
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,960
Young lady, are you alright?

211
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,200
Young lady?

212
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,480
It's you again?

213
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,340
What did you see this time?

214
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,320
Doctor,

215
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,640
is there something wrong with her?

216
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,720
Just like last time,

217
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,960
she's perfectly healthy.

218
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,420
Don't come for head examinations when there's nothing wrong.

219
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,920
I...

220
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,340
I can't see anything anymore.

221
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,240
What? You can't see me?

222
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
How many fingers?

223
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
No, I mean the number.

224
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,160
Enough, enough.

225
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,840
Don't cause trouble here if there's nothing wrong with you.

226
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,920
Go on, next patient.

227
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,340
What's wrong with you?

228
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm fine, but...

229
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,160
But what?

230
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,440
Don't scare me.

231
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,080
My rating ability is gone.

232
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,320
But last time you got it because you hit your head,

233
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,000
and this time you hit your head again.

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,800
Could it have disappeared?

235
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,120
Aren't you worried?

236
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,730
Worried about what?

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,320
Our studio has just started,

238
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,880
but without my rating ability, we...

239
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
That is indeed a problem.

240
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Chao Xu doesn't know yet.

241
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,640
Let's see what he says.

242
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,440
I...

243
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,280
I'm afraid to tell him.

244
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,960
This is terrifying.

245
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,720
Forget about the score.

246
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,080
Don't think about it anymore.

247
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,610
Yi Feng, you're back to normal, you know that?

248
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,360
I'll tell Chaoxu.

249
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,240
Hello?

250
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,440
Miss Yi Feng,

251
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,640
it's me, Alex.

252
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,520
Regarding the investment,

253
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,280
I suggest you look into it more thoroughly.

254
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,120
If it's convenient for you, we should meet and talk in person.

255
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,320
I'm sorry, Alex,

256
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,720
I'm still busy right now.

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,200
Let's get in touch another time. I'm sorry.

258
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,560
What is it?

259
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,050
Why do you need to tell me in person so late?

260
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,760
Have you seen Yi Feng recently?

261
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,600
I haven't seen him these days.

262
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,520
I've been busy with the big show.

263
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,560
I thought since your studio just opened.

264
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,480
And Yi Feng has lost his abilities.
