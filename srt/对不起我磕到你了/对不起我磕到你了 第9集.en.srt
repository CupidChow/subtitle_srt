1
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,080
Thank you both for your hospitality today.

2
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,539
You're welcome, Mr. Zhou.

3
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,080
Well then,

4
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
I'll be going now.

5
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,690
I won't see you out then.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,560
Goodbye.

7
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,360
Bye.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
He insisted on sharing our table.

9
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,860
What's his agenda?

10
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,520
I just noticed you're close with Mr. Zhou,

11
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,450
so I used that connection to secure our cooperation.

12
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,330
Mr. Lu, you really trust me.

13
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,660
Aren't you afraid I'll sabotage you?

14
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,120
We're not that close, are we?

15
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,759
What do I have to fear?

16
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,000
I know you're a person who knows boundaries.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
Well, I have boundaries for certain things,

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,000
but not for everything.

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
You shouldn't have messed with Yi Feng.

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,480
Messed with her? Which eye of yours saw me messing with Yi Feng?

21
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,080
When Mr. Zhou said Yi Feng was your girlfriend just now,

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,479
why didn't you correct him?

23
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,759
Yi Feng will misunderstand.

24
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,360
Yi Feng will misunderstand.

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,880
How do you know Yi Feng will misunderstand?

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,810
Did she tell you?

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,160
Actually, Mr. Lu,

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,240
why do I feel you're so concerned about Yi Feng?

29
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,600
Besides,

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,120
how do you know Yi Feng isn't my girlfriend?

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Sorry about that,

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,860
there was a long line at the restroom.

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,640
We'll be going now, Mr. Lu.

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,130
Goodbye, Mr. Lu.

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's go.

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,520
Grandma, you're up so early.

37
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,800
Yes, Chen Chen went to buy breakfast.

38
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,120
Come quickly and do this with me.

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,600
I

40
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,880
like you so much.

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,560
Unlike my grandson,

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,160
who always has such a stern face,

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
as if someone owes him a lot of money.

44
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,600
But he wasn't like this when he was little.

45
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,600
People's personalities change over time.

46
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,680
When he was a child,

47
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,640
he loved wearing flamboyant clothes.

48
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,520
He was very sensitive to clothing and colors.

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,360
He liked to dress up nicely when going out.

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,640
Later,

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,400
after he started school,

52
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,680
his classmates thought he was weird

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,090
and always bullied him.

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,960
Then Chenchen's parents got divorced.

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,490
That's when his personality changed.

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,800
So he's actually very fragile inside.

57
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,120
Sometimes he says harsh things,

58
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,160
but it's not directed at you.

59
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,400
Grandma, actually I'm planning to...

60
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
planning to...

61
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,720
get married.

62
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,800
No, no, no.

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,240
I mean I'm planning to...

64
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,800
move out.

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,760
Move out.

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,920
Did Lu Chen upset you again?

67
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,159
Don't move out, please don't.

68
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,560
Don't move out.

69
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,880
Xiaofeng's grandma will miss you.

70
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,000
Please don't leave.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,260
Grandma, Xiaofeng, breakfast is ready.

72
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,480
Oh, you naughty boy!

73
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,040
Making that sour face and bullying Xiaofeng.

74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,840
You should move out!

75
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,280
Grandma, stop hitting him.

76
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,920
He didn't bully me.

77
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,760
You get out of here!

78
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,920
You troublemaker!

79
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,880
You're driving me crazy!

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,160
Don't be upset with him.

81
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,680
Let Grandma scold him.

82
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,640
He didn't bully me. Have some water.

83
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,720
Don't pay any attention to him.

84
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
What's going on?

85
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,600
I just told my grandmother I want to move out

86
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,840
and she got upset.

87
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,960
Why do you want to move out?

88
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,000
My work and personal life are all mixed up now.

89
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,360
I find it hard to analyze problems objectively.

90
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,920
You want to move out just because of some minor work issues?

91
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,159
Is that really necessary?

92
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,000
Are you someone who

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,260
can't separate work from personal life?

94
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,800
Are you the kind of person who lets

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
such small setbacks defeat you?

96
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,320
I've already made up my mind.

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,580
I'm moving to Chacha's place.

98
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,840
Xiaofeng, phone call!

99
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,880
Coming!

100
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,120
Hello? The S Magazine with Yi Feng has been confirmed.

101
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,600
Chacha will be walking the runway at the convention center next Friday.

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,080
You'll be in charge of the spokesperson coordination event.

103
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,240
I'll email you the procedure later.

104
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,440
Remember to check it.

105
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,680
Got it.

106
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,480
Also,

107
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,520
collect the important content from previous S Magazine issues

108
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,080
and have Chacha memorize them.

109
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,840
In case reporters try to trip her up,

110
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,360
we don't want her to be caught off guard.

111
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,220
One more thing,

112
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,680
Designer Shen Ke is available early next week.

113
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,080
When Chacha has time,

114
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,600
she should come try on the runway outfits

115
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,730
to see how they look.

116
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,200
Okay, got it. Thanks.

117
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,360
Did you hear that,

118
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,680
Chacha? You'd better cooperate.

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
I'm researching information for you now.

120
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,600
You should use that prime time before sleep to strengthen your memory

121
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,460
and memorize everything. Got it?

122
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,880
You're really crazy,

123
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,450
working this late at night.

124
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
Since you moved in,

125
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,240
I feel like I'm working 24 hours a day.

126
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,440
Miss, you're the one who invited me here.

127
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,520
Well, I broke up with Han Dong

128
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,000
and needed company.

129
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,720
Darling, you two break up four times a month.

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,380
That's once a week on average.

131
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,930
When are you planning to make up this time?

132
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,760
It's up to him. I'm tired of coaxing him.

133
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,120
A grown man over 6 feet tall always needs me to comfort him.

134
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,400
I think

135
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,920
since I moved in,

136
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,720
life has been really great.

137
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,640
Whatever the company needs,

138
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,480
I can notify you directly.

139
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,480
You crazy workaholic!

140
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,040
Only someone like you

141
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,080
would keep a printer at home.

142
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,210
Lu Chen has one at his place too.

143
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,240
It's strange though.

144
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,160
When I was living at Lu Chen's place,

145
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,240
work and life were also blended together.

146
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,200
Why did I feel so much pressure back then?

147
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,120
Miss Yi,

148
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,240
is exploiting others the same as being exploited?

149
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,860
You're absolutely right!

150
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,200
Good girl.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
Here you go.

152
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,320
Chenchen.

153
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,679
Morning, Mr. Lu.

154
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,600
Something on your mind?

155
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,159
Mr. Lu.

156
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,760
Mr. Lu.

157
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,840
Youth S Magazine planned two major themes last quarter.

158
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,160
One was 'Living with Setbacks.'

159
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,520
The other was 'Highly Sensitive People.'

160
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,250
The sales figures for 'Living with Setbacks'...

161
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
Where's Yi Feng? Has she arrived?

162
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,200
She went to see Chacha.

163
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,210
Alright.

164
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,680
Mr. Lu.

165
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,360
The Flower of Imperial Lake

166
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,960
Grandma!

167
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,760
It looks so tacky.

168
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,400
Xiaofeng.

169
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,040
Did you buy this online?

170
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,840
Yes.

171
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,560
This lamp obviously looks so tacky, right?

172
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,520
It clearly looks tacky.

173
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,200
Xiaobai.

174
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,440
I need Teacher Chacha's address.

175
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,680
Could you look it up for me?

176
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,040
I have a fashion sample from a partner brand.

177
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,600
I want to send it to her.

178
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,010
You can just give it to me tomorrow.

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,360
Let me do it. I'm in a hurry.

180
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,760
No.

181
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,620
Just look it up for me quickly.

182
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,040
Don't tell Shen Ke.

183
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,280
Yi Feng, there's a package for you.

184
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,960
Chacha's delivery address is correct.

185
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,800
Your clothes were sent to the wrong address.

186
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,040
This outfit belongs to Grandma, right?

187
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,180
Why would you think it's mine?

188
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,000
This outfit is completely your style.

189
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,130
I'm so thirsty. Is there any water?

190
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,810
If you're thirsty, come in for a drink, Mr. Lu.

191
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,050
What are you doing here?

192
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Well, the girls needed me, so I came.

193
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,720
What's he doing here?

194
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,280
He came to fix my faucet.

195
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,320
It's late and property management has gone home.

196
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,040
Chacha will need to remove her makeup when she gets back.

197
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,080
Couldn't you have contacted me

198
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,200
to arrange a maintenance worker for you?

199
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,240
Chacha is my employee.

200
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,040
Is there a problem with me coming to fix her faucet?

201
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,880
You're dressed like this to fix a faucet?

202
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,360
Did you find it inspiring?

203
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,520
What's wrong with this?

204
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,400
I got wet fixing the faucet.

205
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,560
Can't I take it off?

206
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,400
Sure, sure.

207
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,200
Dry it quickly.

208
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,600
I'll go get some clothes.

209
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,260
A grown man dressed like this in a girl's home

210
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,620
it's hard not to think you're a creep.

211
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,840
I am a creep.

212
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,560
It burst again! Someone help!

213
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,460
Your repair job isn't that great either.

214
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,280
Done.

215
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,280
Alright, fixed it.

216
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,400
Thank you, Teacher Shen.

217
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll be going now.

218
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,200
You're welcome. I'm looking forward to your brilliant performance today.

219
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,480
I'm getting old.

220
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,680
Can't stay up late drinking anymore.

221
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,240
Do you have time now,

222
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,560
Teacher Shen Ke?

223
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,840
Yes, what is it, student?

224
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,000
Could you give me some guidance?

225
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,800
Shh. No problem.

226
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,120
Come sit down and take a look.

227
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,880
Shen Ke.

228
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,120
Has your model finished her makeup?

229
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,640
Chenchen.

230
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,360
What do you think of Yi Feng's work?

231
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,320
Did you do it yourself?

232
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,120
I taught her step by step.

233
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,080
I think it's pretty good overall.

234
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,920
It's just that this outfit is a bit...

235
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,680
I'm planning to get another set of clothes.

236
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,520
Okay.
