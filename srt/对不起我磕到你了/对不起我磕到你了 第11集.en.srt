1
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,090
She really can't handle it.

2
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,400
Painting is not called a skill,

3
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,480
but a way of life.

4
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,920
I understand now.

5
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
Hello, I'm Qilu.

6
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,000
Hello, Teacher Qi.

7
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,000
It wasn't our scheduled time yet.

8
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,200
I was still reading. Sorry.

9
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,600
I apologize.

10
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,060
Teacher Qi, I didn't check the time clearly.

11
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,450
Why didn't Lu Chen from your company come?

12
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,800
He's still on his way.

13
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,700
You've come from far away.

14
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,490
What do you want to interview me about?

15
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,160
We'd like to talk with you about...

16
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,840
The topics are always the same.

17
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
There's nothing worth discussing.

18
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,520
How long will your interview take?

19
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,800
The painting is good.

20
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,079
The colors are so rich.

21
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,120
Mr. Lu,

22
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes, look at this one.

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,120
This Yi Feng is really impressive.

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,040
It was getting awkward,

25
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,760
but then she suddenly took out

26
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
a stack of children's drawings from her bag.

27
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,079
These are all her collection,

28
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,320
and some are copies of Teacher Qi's paintings.

29
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,880
You know Teacher Qi too,

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,940
he loves children,

31
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
so he became interested right away.

32
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,120
The structure is excellent.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
The use of color is very bold.

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,060
These children are so clever.

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,340
The proportions, structure,

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,700
they all have such a good feel.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,660
Teacher Qi, let me show you these two paintings.

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,600
These two paintings were done by children with autism.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,080
I've heard that

40
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,840
painting

41
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,840
is one of the best therapies for children with autism.

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,560
Your paintings are their favorite to copy,

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,620
especially this one, 'Seaside.'

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,480
Children are truly like angels.

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,840
It's my honor to be able to help them.

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
I'm particularly fond of children.

47
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,480
My son also had autism when he was little.

48
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,440
That 'Seaside' painting

49
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,370
was painted the first time I took him to see the ocean.

50
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,920
I never imagined it could help so many children.

51
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,480
Teacher Qi, I only knew you loved children,

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,920
I had no idea you had such an experience.

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,800
You're very thoughtful.

54
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,000
Miss Yi,

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,930
it must not be easy collecting these paintings from children with autism.

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,720
My friend's child,

57
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,280
since learning I was coming to interview Teacher Qi,

58
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,040
insisted I show his paintings to Teacher Qi.

59
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,440
That's what gave me this inspiration.

60
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,000
Why are you here too?

61
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,880
I thought you sent Miss Yi alone.

62
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,720
I'm really sorry, Professor Qi.

63
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,520
I'm late.

64
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
I had something to take care of outside.

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,520
It delayed me for a while.

66
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,250
I didn't want to interrupt when I saw you talking.

67
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
Let me introduce you.

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,480
This is Yi Feng, our new employee at NS.

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,159
We've already met.

70
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,060
This is my art collection.

71
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,280
For you.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,440
No, no, Professor Qi.

73
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,400
I don't really understand painting.

74
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,360
I don't deserve this gift.

75
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,720
Learning art isn't about how many books you've read.

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,159
How many paintings you've seen.

77
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,760
Or how much music you've listened to.

78
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,640
It's about a person's sensitivity and empathy.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,080
I think you're quite good.

80
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,440
This book is for you.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,160
This is Professor Qi's art book given to you personally.

82
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,600
It's definitely worth collecting.

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,400
Just take it if it's given to you.

84
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,120
Thank you, Professor Qi.

85
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,490
You're welcome.

86
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,160
Miss Yi is very thoughtful.

87
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,080
The paintings Miss Yi brought have given me a lot of inspiration.

88
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,540
I want to add a children's section to the biennial exhibition.

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,520
To display all the children's artwork.

90
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,520
Of course, no problem, Professor Qi.

91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,560
It's our honor that NS can provide you

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,159
with new creative inspiration.

93
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:46,040
About your new book, perhaps...

94
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,780
You've got quite the ambition, haven't you?

95
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,690
Already eyeing my new book.

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Let's go.

97
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,520
Let's talk outside. Come on.

98
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,720
Miss Yi has provided such a meaningful

99
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,760
theme this time.

100
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,040
I want to use this opportunity to find someone.

101
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,120
Help me find her.

102
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,200
Show her these paintings collected by Miss Yi.

103
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,760
And explain Miss Yi's theme to her.

104
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,700
Can you do that?

105
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,560
Good. Sure.

106
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,320
No problem. Let's go.

107
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,240
Professor Qi isn't as serious as you said.

108
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,920
Our purpose in meeting Professor Qi this time

109
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,600
is to get the rights to his new book.

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,200
So why are we coming here?

111
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Mingyue lives here.

112
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,960
Mingyue?

113
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,440
Mingyue is someone Professor Qi likes.

114
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,000
She's a teacher who researches rehabilitation for autistic children.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Professor Qi likes her

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,960
but doesn't dare to approach her himself.

117
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,620
So we're helping him find her.

118
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,760
So Professor Qi has his own ideal love too.

119
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,280
Why doesn't he dare to find her himself?

120
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,120
Professor Qi says Mingyue once lit up his life.

121
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,040
So she seems like a very lively person.

122
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,580
He also said her determined profile is very beautiful.

123
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,090
I guess her temper might not be so good.

124
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
You're truly a master interpreter.

125
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,360
Mingyue.

126
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,080
Try the braised pork I made.

127
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,260
It's my first time cooking it.

128
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,620
Don't be too critical.

129
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,220
That's thoughtful of you.

130
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,520
Yes, all these dishes.

131
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,120
Teacher Qi made them especially for you.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,260
After all these years.

133
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,640
I've always hoped

134
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,330
to sit down and have a meal with Mingyue again.

135
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,480
We have Miss Yi Feng to thank for this.

136
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,720
Yi Feng has a gift for you.

137
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,140
Wishing you'll find your true love soon.

138
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,440
Sister Mingyue, this is too expensive.

139
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
I can't accept it.

140
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,480
The embroidery on this handbag

141
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,400
is a gold-thread technique from Cantonese embroidery.

142
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,360
In the past, when girls in Guangzhou got married,

143
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,720
they would wear clothes with gold-thread embroidery.

144
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,520
Some mothers would make these for their children,

145
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,880
representing parents' blessings to their children.

146
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,480
Today I'm giving you this pouch.

147
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,880
As your elders,

148
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,960
we're also sending you our best wishes.

149
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,720
Yes, we both really like you, young lady.

150
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,039
If you're planning to get married,

151
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,200
I'll give you a gold-embroidered dress.

152
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,120
But since you're still single now,

153
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
I'll give you this handbag first.

154
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,740
Yi Feng.

155
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,170
Can I take a look?

156
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,400
Why didn't I think of this before?

157
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,200
What's wrong?

158
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,120
Thank you, Teacher Mingyue.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,800
Keep it safe.

160
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,760
Thank you.

161
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm glad you like it.

162
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,280
That night, a well-known executive entered a hotel with a woman.

163
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,520
They stayed until dawn.

164
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Who would have thought this woman was actually his female subordinate?

165
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,520
Isn't this workplace exploitation?

166
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,720
Surveillance footage reveals the truth.

167
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,480
No way, does the boss like Yi Feng's type?

168
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
I couldn't tell.

169
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,240
I thought he preferred strong, independent women.

170
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,560
I don't know, but after what's being said online,

171
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,120
I also feel Mr. Lu gives Yi Feng special treatment at work.

172
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,000
Stop talking.

173
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,200
Let's go.

174
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,280
I heard Mr. Lu has been suspended pending investigation.

175
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,640
Is it that serious?

176
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Lu Chen really got suspended?

177
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,800
Yi Feng,

178
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
come here please.

179
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,200
Miss Yi Feng,

180
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
we asked you to come here

181
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,280
to verify your previous resume.

182
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,040
It shows you weren't in the fashion industry.

183
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,720
Mr. Lu recommended you for this job, correct?

184
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,320
Sort of.

185
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,440
Mr. Lu was also the one who interviewed you, right?

186
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
Yes.

187
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,960
So I understand you suddenly changed careers.

188
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,890
NS is completely different from your previous work.

189
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,320
That's true.

190
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,240
After I left my previous company,

191
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,570
I started doing fashion styling work with my friend Chacha.

192
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,600
Later, Chacha became NS's spokesperson,

193
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
and I also applied and passed NS's interview.

194
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,520
So you're saying Chacha became the spokesperson

195
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,480
because Mr. Lu knew she was your friend?

196
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,000
Is that right?

197
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,520
Mr. Lu did know we were friends.

198
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,520
But before Chacha became NS's spokesperson,

199
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,380
we were already very successful.

200
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,720
You can check our video account.

201
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,160
Also, we worked on the Zhenzhen brand.

202
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,640
Fine, we'll investigate what you've said.

203
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,640
How can you prove

204
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,600
that you did all of Chacha's previous styling work?

205
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,280
And do you think with your previous experience,

206
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,880
without Mr. Lu's recommendation,

207
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,760
could you have gotten a job at NS?

208
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,600
Asking me out for coffee?

209
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Are you that free?

210
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,370
Aren't you well-informed?

211
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,600
I guess you already know about my situation.

212
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,440
It's not that I'm well-informed,

213
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,920
but my friend is involved in this matter too.

214
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,240
Regarding Yi Feng's situation,

215
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,760
I can't just ignore it.

216
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,480
So are you here to laugh at me?

217
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,760
Not at all.

218
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,040
We talk almost every day.

219
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,280
Her emotions are stable.

220
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
I'm not worried.

221
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,410
So you're saying you weren't wrong about Yi Feng?

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
Did I hear that right?

223
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,370
What do you mean?

224
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,040
Yi Feng was already having a hard time.

225
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,760
Now you're in trouble yourself.

226
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,560
I really don't know how you'll get out of this mess.

227
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,200
That's why

228
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm asking for your help to solve this problem.

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,640
I need you to help me find someone.

230
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,400
It shouldn't be difficult for you.

231
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,730
Then I have a condition.

232
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,080
I want you to gather everyone from the company

233
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,280
for a pool party.

234
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,760
It depends if everyone is willing to cooperate.

235
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,960
Your terms are really terrible.

236
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Just tell me who you're looking for.

237
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,480
What are you doing?

238
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,940
Mr. Lu hasn't arrived yet?

239
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,120
I'll go check.

240
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,520
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,040
Let me get you some water.

242
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,480
I apologize.

243
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,240
You're sneaking cake?

244
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,160
That's hilarious.

245
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,600
NS's coldest director secretly eating strawberry cake.

246
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,280
I now reasonably suspect you're planning to murder me.

247
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

248
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,760
I just have to laugh.

249
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Before you laugh at me,

250
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,120
look at what you're holding.

251
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,680
Aren't you here to sneak food too?

252
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,960
At least I'm sneaking a hamburger.

253
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,520
But you? You're sneaking an entire box of strawberry cake.

254
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,080
Still better than you sneaking that Double Big Mac.

255
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,480
What I mean is

256
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,880
I never expected a fashion company's team building

257
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,360
would actually involve swimming

258
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,080
and all this exercise.

259
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,040
Do you all have some kind of masochistic tendency?

260
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,640
I've been dizzy from hunger all day.

261
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,880
Thankfully I could order takeout,

262
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,520
otherwise I doubt I'd make it back alive.

263
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,080
What's wrong?

264
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,740
Actually, before,

265
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,500
I was afraid of others finding out I like sweets.

266
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,940
But now that you've discovered it, I'm actually happy.

267
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,970
It feels like my secret is being shared with someone.

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,200
Why are you guys here?

269
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,440
Why did you come?

270
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,720
Mr. Lu asked me to come.

271
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,080
He even said we'd wear pink shorts together.

272
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,120
Really?

273
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,960
Mr. Lu is here.

274
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,840
Mr. Lu! Hey, Mr. Lu!

275
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,520
Mr. Lu!

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,800
Mr. Lu!

277
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,720
Come on, Mr. Lu.

278
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,040
Join us!

279
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,120
Yeah!

280
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,160
Mr. Lu!

281
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Are you coming over, Mr. Lu?

282
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,080
Are you coming?

283
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,680
If you don't come, I'm leaving.

284
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,010
I'm coming, I'm coming.

285
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,720
My dear Chen.

286
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,680
Have some fruit.

287
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,720
Chaoxu.

288
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,320
Don't push your luck.

289
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm helping you solve your problem.

290
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,040
What are you doing?

291
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,840
Wait, wait.

292
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,640
Mr. Lu.

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,160
Why are your pants the same as mine?

294
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,120
Couple style! Wow!

295
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,180
Showing off your relationship, huh?

296
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,400
Hurry up and give me

297
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,480
the contact information of the 25th generation heir of Ding Jin embroidery.
