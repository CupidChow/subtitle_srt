1
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,240
The last time I had instant noodles was when I was studying abroad.

2
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,600
I didn't have much money back then.

3
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,240
I often went to convenience stores like this.

4
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,640
Just eating some instant noodles to get by.

5
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,160
I invited you for a meal.

6
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,180
Didn't expect you'd choose this.

7
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,600
I haven't had it for a long time.

8
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,130
Makes me crave it even more.

9
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,080
HR called me in for questioning again.

10
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,570
Just answer whatever they ask you.

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,520
When I get home tonight,

12
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,450
I'll discuss with Chacha about possible solutions.

13
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,520
She got home too late last night.

14
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,400
We'll meet up again today.

15
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,240
What can you possibly solve?

16
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,800
We can't let you remain suspended like this.

17
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,880
Especially when you've done nothing wrong.

18
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,410
I'll go and clear things up.

19
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,199
Yi Feng, does any of this matter?

20
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,480
Rumors

21
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,400
and gossip will disappear on their own in a few days.

22
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,079
As long as it doesn't drag on too long,

23
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,740
so it won't affect the gold embroidery project.

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,200
I feel like I've caused you trouble.

25
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,360
Can I ask you to do something for me?

26
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,000
Sure.

27
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,440
Could you get me a strawberry cake?

28
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,970
It looks really delicious.

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,400
I'll buy two for you.

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,200
Great.

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,720
In this world,

32
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,600
there's nothing a strawberry cake can't fix.

33
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,200
Looks like you really love cake.

34
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,680
You turn into a child when eating cake.

35
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,840
Hey everyone!

36
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,240
I personally guarantee

37
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,800
that Yi Feng is my good friend and partner.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,480
Director Lu from NS has been our benefactor.

39
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,400
But I can confirm they're just colleagues.

40
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,880
They actually don't get along well.

41
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,410
They're like oil and water.

42
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't believe rumors and ask for the truth.

43
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,200
There's video evidence and you're still making excuses for them.

44
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,240
Who are you trying to fool?

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,800
Isn't your ex-boyfriend just...

46
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
Chacha is being cyberbullied.

47
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,520
Confirmed two-faced girl.

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
Chacha was trying to clear my name on her livestream.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,240
But the viewers didn't believe her.

50
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,770
Now they're attacking her.

51
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,200
She's not answering her phone.

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,720
I'm worried about her.

53
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,960
I'm going to find her now.

54
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,920
I'll go with you.

55
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,680
No need. She must be upset right now.

56
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,810
I'll just go back and keep her company.

57
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,160
I told you so.

58
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,800
Really?

59
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,200
Exactly!

60
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,040
You didn't believe me when I told you last time.

61
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,800
Isn't that right?

62
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,260
I didn't expect it either.

63
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,320
What are you looking at?

64
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,120
What a weird person.

65
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,400
Ignore her.

66
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's just enjoy our drinks.

67
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,000
Hey, why aren't you answering any of my calls?

68
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,520
Xiaofeng.

69
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,840
How did you know I was here?

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,280
Didn't you bring me here before?

71
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,409
You don't remember?

72
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, right!

73
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,840
That's my Fengfeng, always on point.

74
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,880
Look at how many times I called you.

75
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,200
What were you doing?

76
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Who's that?

77
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,480
Who else could it be?

78
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,320
That jerk.

79
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,800
Why is Han Dong contacting you again?

80
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,240
That jerk just won't leave me alone.

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,600
He got me trending online again today.

82
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680
Give me that. I'll answer it.

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,080
Let it go. Don't answer it either.

84
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,000
Disgusting.

85
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,160
Didn't my brother tell you to stop filming?

86
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,760
Why are you still recording?

87
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,200
Stop filming!

88
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,280
You're crazy!

89
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,680
Stop filming, all of you!

90
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,040
Crazy!

91
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,000
Aren't they annoying?

92
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:45,240
Oh, you don't need to argue with them.

93
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,280
Xiaofeng.

94
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,840
Did I cause trouble for you?

95
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,200
Not at all.

96
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
I'm talking about the livestream.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,960
I just wanted to prove something for you and Lu Chen.

98
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,080
Alright, alright.

99
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,240
You've already proven it.

100
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,040
You're my best friend.

101
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,370
No one else comes close.

102
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,680
All those 'darlings' and 'sweeties' are fake.

103
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,820
They're just keyboard warriors.

104
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,600
I feel safest in your arms.

105
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,360
You're the lucky one.

106
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,040
With two handsome guys protecting you.

107
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Stop talking nonsense.

108
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
You're annoying.

109
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,080
Is Chacha okay?

110
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,200
She's fine. She's with me.

111
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Who is it?

112
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,080
So late at night.

113
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,960
It's Lu Chen. He's really concerned about you.

114
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Pretending to care about me,

115
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,280
when he's actually worried about you.

116
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,240
Are you crazy?

117
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,200
Okay, bye.

118
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,760
Why are you saying goodbye?

119
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Acting like he's at my place.

120
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,560
These are all the reports

121
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,720
Miss Yi Feng has submitted since she started working.

122
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,050
Have all department heads reviewed them?

123
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,760
We've reviewed them and her abilities are satisfactory.

124
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,680
And the annual

125
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,720
gold embroidery fashion show project

126
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,320
that Yi Feng is managing is progressing well.

127
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,880
Although Director Lu is leading it,

128
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,920
Yi Feng has been completing everything independently so far.

129
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Everyone has some issues

130
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,280
when they join a new company.

131
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,540
As long as they're not serious problems.

132
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,960
Alright, I understand.

133
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,440
They're just colleagues

134
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,800
who don't get along

135
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,260
and are like oil and water.

136
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,280
I'm still in the learning phase,

137
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,240
so I try a bit of everything.

138
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,200
My main responsibility now is

139
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
coordinating clothing and accessories.

140
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,840
I've seen what you looked like before.

141
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,360
How am I supposed to believe

142
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,080
that in just three months

143
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,240
you can handle our stylist position?

144
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,600
Do you think this job is easy?

145
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
If you'd asked me a few months ago,

146
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,440
I would have thought it was simple.

147
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,400
But I don't think that way anymore.

148
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,500
I think it's challenging.

149
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,770
What do you mean?

150
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,160
When we first met,

151
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,120
I was a complete slob.

152
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,530
It's normal not to be taken seriously.

153
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
After all, I used to think

154
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,720
caring about appearance was shallow.

155
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,720
But since I entered this industry,

156
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
I've realized

157
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,340
fashion is actually a profound discipline.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,240
Many styles and elements

159
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,880
are closely connected to social changes

160
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,080
and the progress of civilization.

161
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,680
I later discovered

162
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,680
that I was the shallow one.

163
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,890
When you think about it,

164
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,120
not being able to balance work and appearance

165
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
is actually a matter of capability.

166
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,890
Since this is an interview,

167
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,520
shouldn't I get a chance to prove myself

168
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,980
and show how I've changed?

169
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,680
Let me go!

170
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,440
What are you doing?

171
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,240
Who are you? What do you want?

172
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,040
Let me go!

173
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,880
Let go! I'll call the police!

174
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,400
Go ahead! Call them!

175
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,440
Get lost! I dare anyone to touch him again.

176
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,000
Try to move one more time.

177
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,330
Why are you here?

178
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,520
Put this on.

179
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,040
What do you mean?

180
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,920
Why aren't you at work?

181
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,960
I am going. With you.

182
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,920
Hurry up and change.

183
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,760
Hurry up!

184
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,480
You picked out these clothes for me.

185
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,880
Yes, they look good, and also...

186
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,200
And what?

187
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,880
And I didn't use any superpowers.

188
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,770
You have good taste.

189
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,160
You bought them online, right?

190
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,160
No need to thank me.

191
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,560
Since I got my driver's license,

192
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,400
I haven't driven for a long time.

193
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,010
I came specially to drive Mr. Lu to work today.

194
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,680
After you return to the company,

195
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,640
you'll continue working with Chaoxu on the gold nail embroidery project.

196
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,370
Let's hope to see results soon.

197
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,500
But I still don't understand.

198
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,000
I've been suspended.

199
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,170
Why are you taking me to the office?

200
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,700
The investigation team wants to see you.

201
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,280
What do they want with me?

202
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,540
You'll find out when we get there.

203
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,370
Aren't you getting out?

204
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,770
I'll go park the car.

205
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Welcome back to the company, Mr. Lu.

206
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,360
Did you give Yi Feng a hard time or not?

207
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,480
Miss Yi Feng said

208
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,760
she would prove that she entered NS Company on her own merit.

209
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,560
And of course, she did.

210
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,560
Her abilities are not in question.

211
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,640
It's just that her relationship with Mr. Lu is now quite sensitive.

212
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,600
Considering public opinion and company image,

213
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm afraid only one of them can stay.

214
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,680
Alright, I understand.

215
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,360
What good is understanding?

216
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,890
Miss Yi Feng has already submitted her resignation letter.

217
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,920
She resigned.

218
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,280
She said NS no longer meets her career expectations.

219
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,320
While you were away,

220
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Yi Feng has been covering your work.

221
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,720
The gold embroidery project is progressing well.

222
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,480
Xiaobai is now coordinating with Chaoxu.

223
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,480
Xiaobai has been your contact with Chaoxu lately.

224
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,440
Why didn't you tell me?

225
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,240
You never asked me to.

226
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,800
Why did Yi Feng resign?

227
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,120
If you want to know something, you need to ask yourself.

228
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,380
What you should be asking now is yourself

229
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,920
why you're so upset.

230
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,060
Calling you is pointless anyway.

231
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,040
She's probably at Chacha's place now.

232
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,890
Want me to send you the address?

233
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,360
You think I have nothing better to do?

234
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,160
I need to work.

235
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,320
She probably resigned because of someone,

236
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,720
and returned the gold embroidery project to that person too.
