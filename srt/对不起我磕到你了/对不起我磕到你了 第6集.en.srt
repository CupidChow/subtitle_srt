1
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,160
The celebrity is here.

2
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,720
I'm counting on you today.

3
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,960
The proposal is ready.

4
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,480
Let's start the meeting.

5
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,560
I did an overnight background check on the Juanbai brand.

6
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,850
The Juanbai brand was established 3 years ago

7
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,050
when the founder was still in college.

8
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,560
It started as just a handcraft business.

9
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
The small shop was called Junbai at that time.

10
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,160
The founder posted craft videos on streaming platforms.

11
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,400
When the followers reached 400,000,

12
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,400
an investor took interest in it.

13
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,039
Then they developed product lines,

14
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,080
started building the brand,

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,410
and renamed it Juanbai.

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,200
However,

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,880
Juanbai suddenly changed its market positioning a year ago,

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,039
shifting from niche to more mainstream appeal.

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,240
So I contacted the brand's founder,

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,160
and he told me

21
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,520
that Juanbai is no longer under his control.

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,280
He also feels that his connection with Juanbai

23
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,920
has grown increasingly distant.

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,580
Everyone, take a look at this.

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520
These are the new designs the founder gave me.

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,360
He's preparing to create a completely new brand. I was thinking...

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,490
So you're thinking about making this new brand go viral?

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
It's all a gamble anyway.

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,160
Why not take a bigger risk?

30
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Surprise!

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
I'm guessing the important part is what you're about to say next.

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
But isn't this too risky?

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
Yes, it is indeed risky.

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
But when the founder was creating Juanbai,

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,200
they already had a stable audience

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,680
with highly loyal fans.

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
It will definitely go viral.

38
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,800
Did you discuss it with Chacha?

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,600
Yes, I did.

40
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,320
What's the new brand called?

41
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,180
The new brand is called Zhenzhen,

42
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,000
from the phrase 'luxuriant leaves.'

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Zhenzhen.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,040
Great, then let's select products and hire models right away.

45
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,840
Let's go.

46
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,600
Mr. Lu, Mr. Lu.

47
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,839
Did you see?

48
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,410
Chacha is trending online.

49
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,040
It's late at night and you're not sleeping.

50
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,170
You came to my room just to tell me this?

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,560
I just wanted to let you know

52
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,890
that we're not such an amateur operation.

53
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,120
Okay.

54
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,040
This is chicken soup I made specially.

55
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,360
I brought you a bowl.

56
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,080
Don't forget to drink it.

57
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,040
Thanks.

58
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,320
Anything else?

59
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,160
I wanted to ask about Chacha's spokesperson candidacy.

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,580
What's the situation with NS now?

61
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,680
The past month was our NS spokesperson selection phase.

62
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,760
Our project and marketing departments

63
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,640
have conducted in-depth evaluations

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,360
and effective screening based on brand positioning and commercial value.

65
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,760
From 10 candidates,

66
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,800
we've selected the final three.

67
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,800
Did Chaoxu send you to get information?

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,760
No, no,

69
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
it was my own idea.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,560
It's fine if you can't talk about it.

71
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,020
What about Chacha?

72
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,420
She made it to the candidate list.

73
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,980
Don't get excited yet.

74
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,730
We have three candidates in total,

75
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,960
but according to the data,

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,810
Chacha is at the bottom.

77
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,520
It's okay.

78
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,400
NS surely has its own standards.

79
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,090
Drink your soup while it's hot.

80
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,320
But among the three candidates,

81
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,760
one of them recently had personal moral issues exposed

82
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
and will no longer be considered.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
For the remaining two,

84
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,560
Chacha is a recently popular model,

85
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,960
and Gu Silan is a third-tier actress.

86
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,560
It's worth mentioning that

87
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,000
Chacha successfully promoted

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,330
a brand-new clothing brand last quarter.

89
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,240
Mr. Lu, please make your final decision

90
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,170
on who will become NS's new annual spokesperson.

91
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,440
Chacha.

92
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,880
About Chacha becoming a spokesperson

93
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,580
it might be difficult.

94
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,840
Chacha, regarding the NS spokesperson position,

95
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,260
you might have a hard time getting it.

96
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,760
But it's okay.

97
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,680
We've already become regulars on the trending topics.

98
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,320
Feng, check the trending topics quickly!

99
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,120
We did it!

100
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,320
NS has chosen me as their spokesperson.

101
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Chacha has become NS's new spokesperson.

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,760
Thank you.

103
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,920
You've chosen Chacha.

104
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,800
I'm here to get some soup.

105
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,680
This tastes pretty good.

106
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,220
Let me help you.

107
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,680
It's fine, I can serve myself.

108
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,320
I'm going back to my room first.

109
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,600
Ah.

110
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,080
Zhenzhen, who they've made popular.

111
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,280
The brand value has risen by 15 positions.

112
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,680
I must congratulate you on choosing the right spokesperson.

113
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,560
Are you complimenting me?

114
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
I'm just being objective and fair.

115
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,760
This Chao Xu behind the scenes is really skilled.

116
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,160
A formidable character.

117
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,320
He handles Yi Feng perfectly.

118
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,840
They're inseparable now.

119
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,920
I bet you're scheming something again.

120
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,600
Yes, scheming about you.

121
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,320
I can't handle everything alone.

122
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,200
If Chao Xu could join NS...

123
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,000
Come to NS, work under you.

124
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,600
Mr. Lu.

125
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,680
You should like whiskey sour.

126
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,880
Actually, I don't know much about alcohol.

127
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,720
But I trust Mr. Chao's taste.

128
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,210
What brings you here today, Mr. Lu?

129
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,940
I'm here to invite you.

130
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,640
Invite me to NS?

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,800
Yes.

132
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,840
Actually, I've always been interested in NS.

133
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,160
But I'm interested in your position.

134
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,560
I've always thought we were like-minded people.

135
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,400
I sincerely want to invite you to work with me.

136
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,080
Mr. Lu is just joking.

137
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,520
Don't be so serious.

138
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,780
It's not impossible for me to join NS.

139
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,160
I just have one requirement.

140
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,440
Salary, position, equity.

141
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,680
As long as it's within my power,

142
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,920
I'll try my best to meet your demands.

143
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,720
I want Yi Feng to come with me.

144
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm seriously inviting you now.

145
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,840
You don't need to use Yi Feng to test me.

146
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,770
I think you misunderstood, Mr. Lu.

147
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,140
I'm sincere about this proposal.

148
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,400
Although at the beginning,

149
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,480
I couldn't really see clearly what your relationship was.

150
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,840
But we've been working together almost every day for three months.

151
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,160
I noticed she never mentions you.

152
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,200
Even when topics about you come up,

153
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,010
she deliberately avoids them.

154
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,360
So I think I must have misunderstood.

155
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,280
Her feelings toward you aren't affection,

156
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
but probably aversion.

157
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,760
You're overthinking.

158
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,040
I simply believe

159
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,300
Yi Feng isn't suitable for our industry.

160
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,860
I hope that's the case.

161
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,800
I also hope Mr. Lu won't let personal reasons

162
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,040
lead to unnecessary doubts

163
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,080
about Yi Feng's professional abilities.

164
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,640
Mr. Chao,

165
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,960
you're being too serious.

166
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,480
Now your

167
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
contracted model

168
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,560
is NS Group's brand ambassador for this year.

169
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,680
And this precisely represents

170
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,680
my recognition and respect for your entire team.

171
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
Yi Feng is not your bargaining chip.

172
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,480
Grandma, I'm home!

173
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm so hungry.

174
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,200
Come, dear granddaughter, sit down and eat.

175
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,960
I made your favorite Chinese broccoli today.

176
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,640
Come out for a moment.

177
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,900
Wash your hands first.

178
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,440
Why are you just standing there?

179
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,520
We're eating now.

180
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,480
Yi Feng.

181
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,650
I need to talk to you.

182
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,240
Wait a moment.

183
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,200
Young people these days.

184
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,560
Romance is important.

185
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,760
Go ahead, go.

186
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,880
Can't it wait until after dinner?

187
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,800
It's so beautiful to see young people together.

188
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,240
Brother, can you please get to the point?

189
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,480
I'm starving.

190
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,480
Do you

191
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,440
have something to tell me?

192
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,560
Do you dislike me?

193
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,840
I invited Chaoxu to NS,

194
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,840
but we couldn't reach an agreement.

195
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
What does that have to do with whether I like you or not?

196
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,920
You want me to persuade him?

197
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,520
No.

198
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,920
Chaoxu wanted to bring you into NS,

199
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,040
but I refused.

200
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,400
Shouldn't I be the one asking you

201
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,360
if you dislike me?

202
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,450
I just wanted to explain things to you.

203
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,850
So you think I'm not qualified?

204
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,980
I had some misunderstandings about you before.

205
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,880
I thought you deliberately did something

206
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,810
to make Grandma match us together.

207
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,960
That used to trouble me.

208
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,010
But after spending time together,

209
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,240
I realized Grandma values your character.

210
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,000
Wow.

211
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,760
It's rare to hear you say something nice about me.

212
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,520
You're

213
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
hardworking and reliable,

214
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,080
more determined than you appear.

215
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,680
But effort alone isn't enough.

216
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,680
You don't think much of my work abilities either,

217
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,520
is that what you're trying to say?

218
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,080
No, that's not what I meant.

219
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,760
You're persuading me to give up,

220
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,160
and then make Chaoxu give up on me.

221
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,180
Is that what you're thinking?

222
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,170
I don't really care. I'm mainly concerned about you.

223
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,520
You're really arrogant to a certain degree,

224
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,280
dismissing everyone's abilities with just a few words.

225
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,080
Do you

226
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,440
want to know what I'm thinking now?

227
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,840
After hearing you talk like this,

228
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm even more interested in working at NS.

229
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,160
But don't worry,

230
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,400
I'll pass NS's interview

231
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,840
and enter NS fair and square.

232
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,240
Staying up late for years.
