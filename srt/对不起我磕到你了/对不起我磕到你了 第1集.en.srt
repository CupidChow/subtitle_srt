1
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,360
Yi Feng

2
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,090
These are the product materials from the client.

3
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,640
Study them thoroughly right away.

4
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,080
I need the proposal tomorrow.

5
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,480
Get to work. You can do it.

6
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
I've completed my probation period at the company.

7
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,450
I should be made permanent now.

8
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,240
Well.

9
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,340
Take a look at yourself first.

10
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,400
Face full of freckles, chapped lips,

11
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,320
frizzy hair with split ends.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,800
And your childish fashion sense

13
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,560
is absolutely terrible.

14
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,920
With this appearance,

15
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,120
do you think you fit in

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,640
at a PR and creative company like ours?

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,920
I'd like to apply for

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,840
my performance bonus.

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Are you trying to negotiate with me?

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,759
You may have submitted the Flower cosmetics packaging design,

21
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,800
but the final payment hasn't been settled yet.

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,690
Congratulations, Ava.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,360
Didn't the client already approve

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,440
the Flower cosmetics packaging design?

25
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,160
Just now, the final payment was successfully settled.

26
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,960
The final payment has been made.

27
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,520
It has?

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,680
I was just assigning some work to my junior colleague.

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,810
Alright then, carry on. I'll get back to work.

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,600
The client approved it and the payment is settled.

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,060
According to the rules, can I now become permanent and get my performance bonus?

32
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,600
Is this the one-point student from your team?

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,720
Yes, Yi Feng. Still on probation.

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,520
Mr. White.

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,340
Call me White. Verdant Realm.

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,960
Mr. White.

37
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,400
You all need to focus on the process.

38
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,900
This Flower client is notoriously difficult to deal with.

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,760
I heard the proposal and design drafts

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,520
were revised over and over again,

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
taking more than two months, right?

42
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,440
Ava.

43
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,400
You've worked hard, Verdant Realm.

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,200
You've worked hard.

45
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,400
Thank you, Mr. White. Although I had to do all this myself.

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,620
What do you mean by doing it yourself?

47
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,160
I'm clearly the only one doing all the work.

48
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,210
Always the same boring mind games.

49
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,880
This time...

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,120
Then let's throw you a celebration party tomorrow night.

51
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,640
I really can't take this anymore.

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,960
Stop.

53
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,079
For the Flower project,

54
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,160
after you handed over the materials to me,

55
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,240
you never participated in any related work again.

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
It was just me alone,

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,280
doing research, writing proposals,

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,600
revising designs, monitoring processes,

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,400
all the way until client acceptance and payment.

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
Shut up.

61
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,170
You never cared about the client's actual needs.

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,280
When clients complain, you just pass the blame.

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,640
I've been grinding on this project for over two months.

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,960
From 9-9-6 to 0-0-7.

65
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,170
I worked so hard that

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,240
I even missed my period.

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,680
Flower chose me.

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Get out of my face.

69
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,160
If they chose you, why am I working for free?

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,720
You're still on probation. Talk less and work more.

71
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,040
You said 'more work, more pay.' Why haven't I seen any extra money?

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,440
Your image is so poor. No amount of effort will help.

73
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,840
If effort is useless, then stop making me work overtime.

74
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,280
The economy is bad. You should be grateful to have a job.

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,760
I've done everything I should.

76
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,800
The company hasn't gone bankrupt yet. Maybe you should be the grateful ones.

77
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,079
Hey! Can you hear me?

78
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
Boss Wai is awesome!

79
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,920
Boss Wai, look.

80
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,120
This is the public figure I contacted.

81
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
We're currently discussing cooperation with his company.

82
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,200
I know him.

83
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,040
He's the director of NS Fashion Agency,

84
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,570
a famous blogger and video content director.

85
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,970
He's quite a big deal in the fashion world.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
Can he work with us?

87
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,640
First we'll leverage his traffic, then copy his video channel and livestream format.

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Lu Chen.

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,200
You should follow his video channel too.

90
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,930
He might be our future partner.

91
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,400
What? Do you know him?

92
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,200
No, I don't.

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,160
Humans,

94
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,800
as social animals,

95
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,880
spend their entire lives seeking self-worth

96
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,340
and validation within their social groups.

97
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,520
But,

98
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,040
how is a person's value truly determined?

99
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,120
Two people.

100
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,200
He and I are

101
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,720
so close

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,760
yet so distant.

103
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,159
Living under the same roof,

104
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,080
yet feeling like strangers.

105
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,600
Or maybe

106
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,560
it's just awkward.

107
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,650
We travel for work so often. Thank you so much.

108
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,720
Leave Xiaofeng with me. Don't worry about a thing.

109
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,320
Xiaochen, this is Xiaofeng. Come and meet her.

110
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,960
From now on, Xiaofeng will have dinner at our house after school.

111
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,290
You two can do homework and play together.

112
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,980
She's like your little sister. Don't bully her.

113
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,970
Grandma Lu, I'm really sorry for the trouble.

114
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,920
Hello, my name is Yi Feng.

115
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,320
You must be Lu Chen.

116
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,560
Why aren't you saying anything?

117
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,159
Look, this is my good friend,

118
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,100
Little Turtle.

119
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,060
You think you're so superior, don't you?

120
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,160
Do we really have to act out such a dramatic scene?

121
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,290
I can't believe I have to work with you.

122
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,880
Whatever. Let's get to work.

123
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,000
Attention all staff on set.

124
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
The livestream will begin shortly.

125
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,400
Host is getting ready.

126
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,290
Livestream countdown initiated.

127
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,210
Still some work needed on hair and makeup.

128
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,220
Pay attention.

129
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,400
9.

130
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,320
7.

131
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,159
5.

132
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,320
Good morning to all my friends watching this livestream.

133
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,800
This is NS Fashion Salon.

134
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,800
I'm Lu Chen.

135
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,240
Regarding Tom Ford perfumes,

136
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,920
I've been wanting to talk about them for a while.

137
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,960
The sharp-tongued critic is online.

138
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
A Single Man and Nocturnal Animals,

139
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,480
regardless of their cinematic expression.

140
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,560
Over 100,000.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,600
So many die-hard fans.

142
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,080
So, regardless of my opinion on his perfumes.

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,160
I don't get it.

144
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,540
You could say that.

145
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,280
In my opinion, Mr. Tom Ford

146
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,280
is far superior to those

147
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,640
artists who merely dabble with perfumes.

148
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,040
He focuses his lens on the aesthetics of the human body

149
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,600
and its various dimensions.

150
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,400
Audiences who have seen Mr. Tom Ford's works

151
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,880
can hardly resist being drawn to the uniquely crafted character designs

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,800
in his films.

153
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,680
If you think my ideas are too hardcore.

154
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Then I can only say

155
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,520
I'm sorry I bumped into you.

156
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,250
Like a ghost that won't go away.

157
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,320
Yi Feng,

158
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,799
did you hit your head or something?

159
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,919
Have you finished the proposal I asked for yesterday?

160
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,480
It's been 12 hours already.

161
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,679
Is making a presentation that difficult?

162
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,440
The packaging design for Flower cosmetics.

163
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,360
Which version did the client finally approve?

164
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,490
How many versions were there in total?

165
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,000
Send them to me again later.

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
Let me know when you've sent it.

167
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,160
Where are you? It's already past nine.

168
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,520
Why aren't you at the office yet?

169
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,200
You're still on probation, you know.

170
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,160
Listen.

171
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,160
I was working on the presentation until 5 a.m.

172
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,360
Tonight is the celebration party for the Flower project.

173
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,080
Have you written my performance report yet?

174
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,050
Do I deserve to have this document?

175
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,280
Of course you do. Haven't you checked your phone?

176
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,680
It's probably overdue by now.

177
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,880
Haven't I mentored you?

178
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
Haven't I given you opportunities?

179
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,400
Haven't I taken care of you?

180
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,720
You want to become a permanent employee, right?

181
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,600
You need to show some gratitude.

182
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,480
I do all the dirty work.

183
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,240
While you take all the credit.

184
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,360
So you know what?

185
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,520
The boss says I have the potential to become an influencer.

186
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,760
So your new assignment is

187
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,840
to figure out how to shoot beautiful, unique

188
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,760
short videos for me. I want to create a video account,

189
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,240
start livestreaming,

190
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,920
and the livestream channel will be called 'Fashion Creates Me.'

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,840
So as I always say,

192
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,560
you are the one creating fashion,

193
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
not fashion creating you.

194
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,490
Goodbye.

195
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,970
The livestream is over.

196
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Staff please come in to change the set.

197
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,520
Set change!

198
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,480
Hurry up!

199
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,000
Mr. Lu,

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,660
today's online viewers have exceeded 200,000.

201
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,280
We're about to start the video recording.

202
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,440
The haute couture dress.

203
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,880
Be careful.

204
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,440
Yes, I'm ready.

205
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,120
The shooting plan

206
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
is all clear.

207
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,800
The models

208
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,800
are getting their makeup done.

209
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,440
Coffee

210
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,560
has been ordered.

211
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,160
Check out NS's livestream.

212
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
They're filming a short video.

213
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,200
Find a way to get me in there.

214
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,480
Take some footage secretly.

215
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,800
And learn something while you're at it.

216
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
You need to meet my expectations.

217
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,760
You want me to find that sharp-tongued monster?

218
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,160
Are you kidding me?

219
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,360
If you can't do it, don't bother coming to the celebration tonight.

220
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,800
He stole my spoon again.

221
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,440
Damn it.

222
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,720
Eye bags.

223
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,900
Can't you put it on?

224
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,640
Mr. Lu.

225
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,880
I just drank a bit more water this morning.

226
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,640
I don't want to hear your explanation.

227
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,900
Deal with her quickly.

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
The task Yi Feng gave you,

229
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,420
do you understand?

230
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,760
Why aren't you responding to messages?

231
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,360
Don't you want to become a permanent employee?

232
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,360
Little turtle, don't run around.

233
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,840
I've found the film set address.

234
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,720
I'll try my best to sneak in.

235
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,120
I'll rush back for the celebration after I'm done.

236
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,760
The celebration isn't important.

237
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,320
Getting the permanent position is what matters.

238
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,880
You still don't understand me.

239
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,760
Go complete your task. Good luck.

240
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,920
It's lagging.

241
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,400
More wind.

242
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,160
Turn up the fan.

243
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,200
Okay.

244
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,480
Very nice.

245
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,200
Grandma, remember to take your ID card when you go out.

246
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,160
My phone number is on it.

247
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,080
I'm heading to work now.

248
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,020
Breakfast is on the table.

249
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,320
Come to the wardrobe department.

250
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,580
Yes, iron the clothes.

251
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,320
Mr. Lu,

252
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,160
your coffee.

253
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,290
You got the order wrong.

254
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Mr. Lu only drinks triple espresso.

255
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

256
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,160
Thank you.

257
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,360
Hello.

258
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,960
The lighting over there,

259
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,000
turn it on.
