1
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,480
Ava looks so beautiful today.

2
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,210
Congratulations, Ava.

3
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,720
The new packaging you made for Flower cosmetics

4
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,380
has received great feedback.

5
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,160
Your work report was brilliant.

6
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,920
Everyone can see Ava's capabilities.

7
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,400
She takes good care of her subordinates too.

8
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,660
She handles all these tasks personally.

9
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,400
All the executives are here today.

10
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,240
Isn't that Yi Feng?

11
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,120
No way! How did she become so beautiful?

12
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,920
I barely recognize her.

13
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,720
Yes, indeed.

14
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,400
Oh no.

15
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,759
They recognized me.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,259
Miss, would you like something to drink?

17
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,520
Certainly.

18
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,720
She's here.

19
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,960
She must have just finished reading the script I wrote.

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,320
If Ava started livestreaming, she'd definitely become popular.

21
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,120
Yes.

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,400
With Teacher Zhaoyu doing the image packaging, it would be even more impressive.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,200
No, no.

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,259
I'm really not prepared to design your styling.

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
Teacher Zhaoyu is being too modest.

26
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Ava.

27
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,040
I have another question.

28
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,120
How did you come up with the idea

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,960
of combining yoga culture with a makeup brand?

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,120
I have some thoughts on this point.

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,720
Because makeup is a high-demand product for women.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,160
So is yoga.

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
That's not right.

34
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,360
Actually, what I want to express is...

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,120
That's Yi Feng, isn't it?

36
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,079
No way.

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,160
It's the zen element that both Flower and yoga share.

38
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,480
Flower, as a makeup brand,

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,280
has always been known for being eco-friendly.

40
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,560
As for yoga itself,

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,720
it also focuses on self-improvement and inner peace.

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,520
These are elements that resonate with young people today.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,560
So the reclining figure on Flower's new packaging is

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,660
the yoga relaxation pose.

45
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,920
That makes a lot of sense. Yes, it does.

46
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,250
Welcome Chairman Ken of Flower Cosmetics

47
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,000
to our celebration party.

48
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,480
Chairman Ken.

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,720
Hello, Chairman Ken.

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,320
Hello, Chairman Ken.

51
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,520
Why aren't you going over there?

52
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,079
If I'm not mistaken,

53
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,840
I think that executive

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,240
must be the client for your project, right?

55
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,480
I just need to do my job well.

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,520
I can already see that

57
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,160
you're doing a great job.

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,840
How about we go out for a drink?

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,200
Oh, I can't.

60
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,079
I... I should be going.

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,920
Would you mind adding me on WeChat then?

62
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,440
Add WeChat.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,000
WeChat.

64
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
I'll scan your code then.

65
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,880
Done.

66
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,480
Done.

67
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,640
Yi Feng.

68
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,520
I'm Zhaoyu.

69
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,680
What are you doing?

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,640
Hurry up.

71
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,440
Play your cards quickly. What are you looking at?

72
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,170
Come on. What's taking so long?

73
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,280
Here you go.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,920
Oh no.

75
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,240
Strange, I can't find my glasses.

76
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,680
Grandma, have you seen my glasses?

77
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,010
You don't need to shout.

78
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,760
Grandma went to take out the trash.

79
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,960
I threw your glasses in the trash.

80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,260
Why did you throw away my glasses?

81
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,720
What about your things from before the makeover?

82
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,650
They've already been disposed of.

83
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,760
I can't stand seeing you wear those ugly things in front of me.

84
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,560
You're the one who's crazy.

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,420
How am I supposed to go to work now?

86
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,960
Here are your contact lenses.

87
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,360
These are the clothes I prepared for you.

88
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,600
Wear these to work.

89
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,040
Why?

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,440
I just don't want Teacher Shenke's makeover efforts

91
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,560
to be ruined by you.

92
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,000
I stole Ava's spotlight yesterday.

93
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,720
Will she kill me today?

94
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,440
Why isn't Yi Feng going in yet?

95
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,920
Let me tie my shoelace.

96
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,130
Your laces aren't even undone.

97
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,680
Let's go inside. Come on.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,720
This outfit doesn't even have sleeves. It's so cold.

99
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,080
There's nothing on my face.

100
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,480
Can they see those stupid numbers above my head too?

101
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,640
Who bought breakfast?

102
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,040
I did.

103
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,360
Me.

104
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,440
Why is everyone treating me differently? It's weird.

105
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,720
Yi Feng.

106
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes?

107
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,880
I've arranged for Zhao Xu to discuss image packaging.

108
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,400
It was still six yesterday.

109
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,000
How did it become five today?

110
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,960
What five?

111
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,640
Nothing, nothing.

112
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,720
They'll be here soon.

113
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,480
Order five coffees. Okay.

114
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Strange, it's still six above my head.

115
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,360
Can't you even

116
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,120
order coffee when asked?

117
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,840
Fine, I'll order right away.

118
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
Coffee.

119
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,440
Order five coffees.

120
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,160
I changed from one to six.

121
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,440
Ava was six yesterday.

122
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,480
Today she's five.

123
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,679
Five, six, six, five.

124
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,679
What does it mean?

125
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,799
55 coffees?

126
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,299
Sorry to keep you waiting.

127
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,919
Yi Feng, you're still on probation.

128
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,039
This is your personal responsibility.

129
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,500
The department won't take the blame for you.

130
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,440
You can't do your job properly.

131
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,880
And now you're showing off.

132
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,920
Look at your colleagues.

133
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,520
You've got everyone on edge.

134
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,000
What do you mean?

135
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,080
I'm officially informing you.

136
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,160
You're fired.

137
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,320
You can take these coffees with you too.

138
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,610
Did you all see that?

139
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,840
This is what happens when you don't work properly.

140
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,960
It's trending now.

141
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,560
Hello.

142
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,610
Teacher Zhao Xu.

143
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,680
This way, please.

144
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
Fengfeng, I'm back from my performance.

145
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,200
Where are you?

146
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,600
I just got fired.

147
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,920
Fengfeng, don't worry.

148
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,800
I'll be there soon. Wait for me.

149
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,600
Driver, please go faster.

150
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,480
I'm in a hurry.

151
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,880
Sure thing. This is already quite fast.

152
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,880
Hello?

153
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,760
Hey, my dear daughter.

154
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,840
What are you doing?

155
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,600
Mom, I'm at work.

156
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,080
I just bought a coffee downstairs.

157
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,520
See?

158
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,480
Don't drink so much coffee.

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,320
How are you feeling?

160
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,600
I'm fine.

161
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,880
How about you and Dad?

162
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,200
We're both doing well.

163
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,120
How are you getting along with your colleagues and boss?

164
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,720
Your probation period is almost over, right?

165
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,250
My boss and colleagues are all very nice to me.

166
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,840
But,

167
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,160
several other companies want to hire me now.

168
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,440
I might switch jobs.

169
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,760
My daughter is wanted everywhere.

170
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,080
But I need to tell you something.

171
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,520
You should be steady with your work.

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
Focus on doing your current job well first.

173
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,040
Don't you agree?

174
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,840
I know.

175
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,600
Good girl.

176
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,840
Mom misses you.

177
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,160
This year, once your dad finishes his retirement paperwork,

178
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,720
we'll come stay with you.

179
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,360
I understand.

180
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,120
Take good care of yourself.

181
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,520
I need to get back to work.

182
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,480
Bye-bye.

183
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,440
Baby?

184
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
What's wrong?

185
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,440
Nothing.

186
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,800
It's nothing.

187
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,000
Hello.

188
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,680
I'm Lu Chen.

189
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Hello, Mr. Lu. I'm Ava from Qidian PR.

190
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,800
I've been in contact with your assistant before.

191
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,000
You have an employee named Yi Feng at your company, right?

192
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,680
Yes, he was a junior assistant. He's already left the company.

193
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,480
Hello?

194
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,400
Hello? Mr. Lu? Can you hear me?

195
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,720
Hello? Mr. Lu?

196
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,520
Can you hear-

197
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,400
Yi Feng knows Mr. Lu.

198
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
They don't know each other, do they?

199
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,880
I could tell that day. They have connections.

200
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,960
Look at you. You still want to work on image packaging?

201
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,200
Foolish.

202
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,280
So how many fingers do you see above my head?

203
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,160
You're not trying to rate me, are you?

204
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,560
My eyes aren't measuring tools.

205
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,160
It's okay.

206
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,210
You'll get better sooner or later.

207
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,160
It's all because of that damn Lu Chen.

208
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,520
I'll never forgive him as long as I live.

209
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,040
Then I'll stay with you for a few days.

210
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,000
Neither of us has anything else to do anyway.

211
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,930
I'll back you up.

212
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,800
Take it easy.

213
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,120
Mr. Lu.

214
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,160
Hello, I'm Chacha, a model.

215
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Hope we can work together sometime.

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,520
He's so aloof.

217
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,440
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

218
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,600
Thank you for giving me those 5 minutes.

219
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,330
Thank you for transforming me.

220
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,700
Thank you for the weapons you gave me.

221
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,880
Now I've lost my damn job too.

222
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,580
He's had too much to drink.

223
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,720
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,200
Slow down.
