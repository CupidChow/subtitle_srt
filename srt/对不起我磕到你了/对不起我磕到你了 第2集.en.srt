1
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,160
Hello.

2
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,039
The lights over there.

3
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,120
Surprised?

4
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,760
You didn't expect me to come.

5
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,560
Mr. Lu,

6
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,800
is this your...

7
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm Mr. Lu's

8
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,120
neighbor.

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,880
Just neighbors. Nothing more.

10
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,720
Why are you here?

11
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,360
I'm here

12
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,759
because I need your help.

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,800
What is it?

14
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,240
Since we're roommates,

15
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,500
could you do me a favor?

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,960
What favor?

17
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,220
Listen,

18
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,280
you know,

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,200
our job

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,280
can be quite annoying.

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Our boss

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,640
wants to start livestreaming

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,840
and sent me here to learn from you,

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,680
to pick up some skills.

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,800
You're here to steal my techniques, aren't you?

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,639
That's a harsh way to put it, don't you think?

27
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,280
I'm just here to learn from an expert.

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,010
How can you call that stealing?

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,050
You can't just show up at my set whenever you want.

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,640
Then I'll have to tell Grandma.

31
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,040
I'll tell her

32
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,880
you survive on coffee during the day,

33
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,960
and melatonin to sleep at night.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
Working like this,

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,160
your health will eventually collapse.

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,360
5 minutes.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,040
Just 5 minutes.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,720
After 5 minutes, you leave.

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,400
And no photos.

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,440
Salute!

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,800
Stay on track.

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,800
Come on, change positions.

43
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,400
Miss, please step aside.

44
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,200
Me?

45
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,720
Yes, move quickly!

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,520
You're in the shot.

47
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,960
Sorry, sorry.

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,480
Be careful!

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,000
Yi Feng, watch out!

50
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,600
Yi Feng!

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,440
Lu Chen!

52
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,880
Open your eyes! Don't fall asleep!

53
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,320
Please don't!

54
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,640
Little girl.

55
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,880
No! No!

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,760
You are a little girl.

57
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,640
I'm not a little girl. Let me go!

58
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,880
You are a little girl.

59
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,760
Little girl! Little girl! That's what you are.

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,560
Let me go!

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,440
You are! Only little girls wear colorful clothes.

62
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,240
Let him go! Little girl! That's what you are!

63
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,880
Go away! Stop bullying! Go away!

64
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,920
Yi Feng!

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,130
Yi Feng, we're at the hospital.

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,040
Hang in there. Don't fall asleep.

67
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,960
Yi Feng, stay awake.

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,920
There's really nothing wrong at all.

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,720
We've examined everything that needed to be checked.

70
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,440
No bleeding, no fluid buildup, no external injuries.

71
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,000
No dizziness or nausea.

72
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,360
No sensory impairment or memory issues.

73
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
No cognitive dysfunction either.

74
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,200
The scans only show minor indigestion.

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
No medication needed.

76
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,680
Just get some rest.

77
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,200
Keep her steady!

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,600
The hallucination the patient mentioned is back, isn't it?

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,960
Since it's a hallucination, it's only temporary.

80
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,640
It should disappear soon.

81
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,400
Don't move.

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,490
Yi Feng, stop it.

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,280
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
This is extremely strange.

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,920
It doesn't look like a physical issue to me.

86
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,320
I suggest that you

87
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,400
transfer to another department.

88
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Doctor, what should we do next?

89
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,840
Go see the psychology department,

90
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,080
which is psychiatry.

91
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,800
Given her current condition,

92
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,159
there seems to be some mental issues.

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,960
Psychiatry.

94
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,720
Schizophrenia.

95
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,880
She's probably under a lot of stress at work lately.

96
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,000
It's caused by overwork.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,960
Mental strain.

98
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,760
She should get better with plenty of rest.

99
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,080
The family needs to be aware.

100
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,040
Try to keep her in good spirits.

101
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,370
Don't let her experience any more stress.

102
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
It's not real, it's not real.

103
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,320
It's all hallucinations, it's all hallucinations.

104
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,450
What do these numbers really mean?

105
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,980
Why are they different for everyone?

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,840
Why am I number 1

107
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,320
and he's 10?

108
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,200
Let's go home.

109
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,159
No, I haven't finished my task yet.

110
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,720
Let's go home. Grandma is still worried about you.

111
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,760
I won't allow you to go to the film set anymore.

112
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
You need to rest.

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,760
The doctors say you have schizophrenia.

114
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,040
Just let me go one more time.

115
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,520
Even if I have schizophrenia,

116
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,850
you're the one who pushed me to this point.

117
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,810
My dear granddaughter,

118
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,880
you've scared me to death.

119
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,320
Why am I so unlucky?

120
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,400
You again?

121
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,000
You're bullying my granddaughter again!

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,520
Get out!

123
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Get out! It's me, Grandma! Let's go.

124
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,280
Grandma, this is our home. It's okay.

125
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,160
She's the one staying here temporarily.

126
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,120
I was just joking. He didn't bully me.

127
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,960
Go back to your room and rest.

128
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,560
Go rest in your room.

129
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,360
If you bully my granddaughter, I won't let you off.

130
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Her condition is acting up again.

131
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,560
Yeah.

132
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,620
Grandma doesn't remember me, her own grandson, again.

133
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,280
Yi Feng, your lucky turtle.

134
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,600
My little turtle.

135
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,080
You have no idea

136
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,960
what I've been through today.

137
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,960
Use your superpower

138
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,840
to give me strength when I'm at my lowest.

139
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Don't be sad.

140
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,440
They're all bullying me

141
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,680
calling me a little girl.

142
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,480
Don't be afraid. I've chased them all away for you.

143
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,200
Thank you, heroine.

144
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,290
You're welcome.

145
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,720
Blow on it.

146
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,520
Why?

147
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,840
My turtle is a lucky turtle.

148
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,120
It was abandoned by its peers right after birth.

149
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,240
But it still survived bravely.

150
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,720
If you blow on it,

151
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,880
you'll receive its lucky energy.

152
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,560
Hello?

153
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,560
So you finally answer your phone.

154
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,960
Do you know how many messages I sent you?

155
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,400
Where the hell have you been?

156
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,120
I

157
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,080
told you to go to the NS set.

158
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,000
Did you go?

159
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,530
Don't tell me you didn't get in.

160
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,240
I did get in.

161
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,280
Then where's the footage?

162
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,560
Send it to me!

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,960
I

164
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,680
didn't get the shot.

165
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,160
I hit my head.

166
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,610
Can't you come up with a better excuse?

167
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,320
You can't even handle such a simple task.

168
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,120
Is the company paying you for nothing?

169
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,980
I just got back from the hospital.

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,960
I'll go to the celebration venue right away to explain.

171
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,640
Don't you dare come.

172
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,080
You want to embarrass yourself?

173
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,920
Let the clients see how bad our employees look.

174
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,360
Not only do you look sloppy,

175
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
you can't even do your job properly.

176
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,560
Forget about becoming permanent.

177
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Your probation period is extended.

178
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,980
You won't even listen to my explanation.

179
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,140
You won't let me attend the celebration.

180
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,520
Why can't I become a permanent employee?

181
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,760
Don't you want to attend that celebration?

182
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,240
What's it to you?

183
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,320
Are you just giving up like this?

184
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,890
Come with me somewhere.

185
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,000
Teacher Shen Ke, help me figure this out.

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,200
No problem.

187
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,480
Usually in comics, the female protagonist

188
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,080
takes off her glasses

189
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,280
and becomes a great beauty.

190
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,600
It seems

191
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,880
she isn't one.

192
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,240
So what's going on?

193
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,580
Mr. Lu is going to a lot of trouble.

194
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,160
I spent two months overseeing the design and process,

195
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,040
dealing with clients,

196
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,200
and independently completed a cosmetic repackaging project.

197
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,560
My boss controlled me

198
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,600
and stole all my achievements.

199
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,600
Today is the celebration party for this project.

200
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,080
My boss thinks I look too sloppy

201
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,400
and excluded me.

202
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,080
This kind of makeover revenge scene

203
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,480
gets my blood pumping just thinking about it!

204
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,160
The workplace is the battlefield of modern people.

205
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,360
Appearance can also be used as a weapon.

206
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,090
Let's start with the eyebrows.

207
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,240
If you want to look pretty, cooperate a little.

208
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,600
Right now I'm a six.

209
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,480
Whether you want to fight her or expose her,

210
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,560
it's all up to you from now on.

211
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,840
This loser.

212
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,640
I put all my energy into the Flower project.

213
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,380
Doing research, writing proposals, revising designs, monitoring processes.

214
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,170
I worked through more than 60 days and nights,

215
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,400
from 9am-9pm, 6 days a week to working around the clock,

216
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,330
to the point that

217
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,480
even my period stopped coming.

218
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,840
Thank you Flower for recognizing my efforts.

219
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,280
I'll work even harder.

220
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,280
Thank you.
