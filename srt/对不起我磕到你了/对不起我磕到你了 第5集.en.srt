1
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,000
What tea sister?

2
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
Looking like that

3
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,000
and she still cares about critiquing others' outfits.

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,440
Love this look!

5
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,240
Chacha, you're my human template.

6
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,570
Tea sis, you're my idol.

7
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,280
Ava.

8
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,970
Is the presentation ready?

9
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Am I worthy of having this document?

10
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,200
In the recent quarter,

11
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Teacher Chaoxu still remains on the stylist ranking list,

12
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
firmly in the top three.

13
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,800
But the revenue has declined.

14
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,480
The models and artists we develop,

15
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,940
once they become popular,

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,960
they go solo.

17
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,560
So should we

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,600
continue to develop new talents?

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,840
I don't see any promising prospects right now.

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,400
And there's been no news about Ava's case lately.

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,760
The budget is quite attractive though.

22
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,880
I've submitted those new models.

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,340
I'll schedule interviews for you this week.

24
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,370
Teacher Chaoxu.

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,210
Teacher Chaoxu.

26
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:41,840
It's the zen elements shared by both Flower and yoga.

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,130
I prefer to recruit a good outfit stylist.

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,480
I think she will help us find suitable models.

29
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,080
I.

30
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,960
This one.

31
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,800
Need any help?

32
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,760
Xiaofeng.

33
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,490
Is this what you bought online?

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,079
It's so beautiful.

35
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Look, it's covered with seashells.

36
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,200
It's even more beautiful when lit up.

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,480
This lamp obviously looks so tacky.

38
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,560
If you think it's tacky, don't use it.

39
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Fine, I won't use it.

40
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,690
It's so tacky I wouldn't use it anyway.

41
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,440
Ignore him. We'll use it ourselves.

42
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,600
Grandma, don't these look like little waves?

43
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,800
It's so beautiful.

44
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,160
Professor Zhaoxu,

45
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,840
I've contacted Ava's team,

46
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,680
got the information you wanted,

47
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,080
and sent it to your phone.

48
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,080
You're making Chacha look more beautiful every day.

49
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,010
Where did she go?

50
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,080
Chacha got invited to a roadshow today.

51
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,210
She's gone to model.

52
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,760
How's that account of yours doing lately?

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,159
Still no sponsorships?

54
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,360
Maybe it's because we're a new account.

55
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Not many brands have noticed us yet.

56
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,960
Keep at it, things will improve.

57
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,680
I've checked out your account,

58
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,000
the outfits are really good,

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,280
but the content isn't diverse enough.

60
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,420
Are you specifically keeping tabs on Fengfeng?

61
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,580
You're even analyzing it for her?

62
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,240
Fengfeng, see how good my grandson is to you.

63
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,160
A man like him is hard to find!

64
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,800
Alright.

65
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,900
I'll go get some fruit for you two.

66
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
Although your account focuses on fashion,

67
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,800
the traffic investment needs

68
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,920
aren't just about supporting

69
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,720
accounts that seem more active,

70
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,130
but making each account feel more like a real person.

71
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,240
Not just a simple garden stage setup.

72
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,960
So?

73
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,520
I suggest you use more diverse settings.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,120
With more shooting locations,

75
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,000
it'll feel more like a genuine ecosystem,

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,840
as if you're living right alongside your audience,

77
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,100
more authentic and three-dimensional.

78
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,720
Xiaofeng,

79
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,700
someone's here to see you!

80
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,980
There's Xiaofeng.

81
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,170
Thank you, Grandma.

82
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, it's you, Teacher Zhaoxu.

83
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,640
How did you find me here?

84
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,160
I saw you resign that day.

85
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,240
I didn't take Ava's case afterward.

86
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,760
But I did ask around.

87
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,200
So what brings you here?

88
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,240
I just feel that

89
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
it's been too long since I've met someone like you,

90
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,300
someone who truly stands out.

91
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,840
You're very special,

92
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,240
so I'd like to offer you a job.

93
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,000
Since you're already here.

94
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,880
Please have a seat.

95
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,960
Don't just stand there.

96
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Have some fruit. Get up and let our guests sit.

97
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,080
This is Xiaofeng's boyfriend.

98
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,400
No, no.

99
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,560
He's my landlord.

100
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,680
Hello, I'm Lu Chen.

101
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,160
I'm Chao Xu.

102
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
Dear Xiaofeng.

103
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,000
Guess how much we made today?

104
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,520
Teacher Zhaoxu,

105
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,480
it really is you.

106
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,440
Hello, I'm Chacha.

107
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,170
We've worked together before.

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,680
Hello, I'm Yi Feng's friend.

109
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
I'm here to invite her to join my team as a stylist,

110
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,960
and I'd also like to invite you to be Yi Feng's modeling partner.

111
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,920
I can't do it.

112
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,720
Teacher Zhaoxu,

113
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,050
the fashion world is too unfamiliar to me.

114
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
But Chacha is an excellent model.

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,680
You two should talk.

116
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,540
A monthly salary of 30,000

117
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,240
plus performance bonuses and year-end bonus.

118
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,120
Higher pay means more responsibility.

119
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,640
I didn't know Mr. Lu had a habit of mocking others.

120
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,600
I just don't want

121
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,280
Miss Yi Feng to go there full of confidence

122
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,480
only to be disappointed in herself because she can't handle it.

123
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,120
Well.

124
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,680
You may not fully understand Miss Yi Feng's capabilities.

125
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,320
Besides, you still have me.

126
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,200
Actually, you can continue operating your account.

127
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,930
I think it has great potential.

128
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,420
Our working hours are very flexible.

129
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,300
It won't affect employees' side businesses at all.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,120
I'm willing to work for you.

131
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,050
I'm willing too.

132
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,120
I hope you won't regret it.

133
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,770
Then welcome, both of you, to our team.

134
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,120
Our first task

135
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,120
is directly related to Mr. Lu.

136
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,679
What task has to do with him?

137
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,760
NS is changing their spokesperson, right?

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,090
Have you been keeping tabs on our company?

139
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,250
How do you know this insider information in advance?

140
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,890
What does NS changing their spokesperson have to do with us?

141
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,840
You're not thinking of promoting me, are you?

142
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,040
Fengfeng.

143
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,600
I wouldn't dare dream of this.

144
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
Pinch me quick.

145
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,920
Is my dream coming true?

146
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,000
Mr. Lu, what do you think of Chacha?

147
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,480
Could you give her a chance?

148
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,600
She'll work very hard.

149
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,400
First,

150
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
our company has high standards for signing spokespersons.

151
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,880
Second, our company is preparing for transformation.

152
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,650
We have capital backing us.

153
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,840
And third,

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,530
I'm looking forward to how Teacher Zhaoxu will develop Chacha.

155
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Stay tuned.

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,240
Mr. Lu, there's a rumor saying

157
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,900
that once there was a very skilled makeup artist

158
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,880
who told you your face was too dry while doing your makeup,

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,210
and that made you upset.

160
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,920
Since then,

161
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,280
no one has ever seen that makeup artist again.

162
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,880
There's an even more outrageous rumor.

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,400
They say that afterward, to vent your anger,

164
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,730
you simply had that makeup artist killed.

165
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,960
So now everyone's saying you killed me.

166
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,340
Yeah, they sound so certain about it.

167
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,920
It's making me wonder

168
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,600
if I'm talking to a ghost right now.

169
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,080
Come on, I just finished that job and then

170
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,760
went to Korea for plastic surgery.

171
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,880
I was going through a breakup at the time,

172
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,210
so I changed my name too.

173
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,280
How did such a ridiculous story get started?

174
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,080
It doesn't matter. Who cares about the truth when it comes to gossip?

175
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,960
It's making you so unhappy.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,800
My dear Chen.

177
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,650
Something's off about you.

178
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,840
What's wrong?

179
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,880
You must be mistaken.

180
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,840
Usually when people gossip about you,

181
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,040
you don't care at all.

182
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,220
You're acting strange this time.

183
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,880
Let me guess, do you like Chacha?

184
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,440
Right.

185
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,720
I'm interested in all women who are an 8 out of 10

186
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,520
Happy now?

187
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,620
Well, that's clearly not her.

188
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,820
Look me in the eyes.

189
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,520
Is it that neighbor of yours?

190
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,010
That poor little thing?

191
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,480
Someone stole her right from under your nose

192
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,740
and moved your cheese.

193
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,290
That's why you're feeling so down, right?

194
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
You're crazy.

195
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,120
Stop guessing.

196
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,040
She's just staying at my place.

197
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,100
We have absolutely nothing going on.

198
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,090
Who would like such an ordinary woman?

199
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,840
So you do have feelings for her!

200
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,840
Grandma, I'm home.

201
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,120
How's it going with Chenchen?

202
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,300
Did you deal with that boy who's trying to steal her?

203
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,220
Grandma, nobody's stealing anyone.

204
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,120
I think you're the only one

205
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,050
who treats Yi Feng like a treasure.

206
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,640
How could that be?

207
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,800
When it comes to matters between men and women,

208
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,480
Grandma, I

209
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,120
can see through it at a glance.

210
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,480
He definitely has feelings for Xiaofeng.

211
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,160
I don't want to talk about this anymore, Grandma.

212
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,620
I'm going upstairs to bed.

213
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,040
You should get some rest too.

214
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,840
Go to bed early.

215
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,640
Don't take this lightly.

216
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,280
You must trust my intuition.

217
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,000
You're such a worry.

218
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,280
I want to ask about NS's spokesperson selection.

219
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,090
So you're now in the habit of barging into other people's bedrooms?

220
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,660
Or do you just want to see me without clothes?

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,600
I just wanted to ask

222
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,800
if NS could give Chacha

223
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,420
a chance when selecting a spokesperson.

224
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,680
NS spokesperson.

225
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,290
In what capacity are you asking me?

226
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,320
Her fan?

227
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,800
Her friend?

228
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,320
Or what?

229
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,880
I'll be working with Chaoxu

230
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
to help Chacha compete for the NS spokesperson position.

231
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,400
Being an NS spokesperson is no joke.

232
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,220
With your limited skills,

233
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,760
how could you help an ordinary female model

234
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,720
secure such a prestigious endorsement?

235
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,680
Besides, she was created by you guys.

236
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,810
I think that makes it even less likely.

237
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,560
How can you be so rude?

238
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,000
Judging by appearances

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,320
and having so little faith in my abilities.

240
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,120
Don't you know your own limitations?

241
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,800
Chenchen, Grandma is still worried about you.

242
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,320
Go on.

243
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,360
You two are always so secretive,

244
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,600
but now I see...

245
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,520
Good, very good.

246
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,480
Now go explain to Grandma

247
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,410
that nothing happened between us.

248
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,440
Fine.

249
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,960
Then tell me what standards NS uses to select spokespersons.

250
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,360
If you don't tell me,

251
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,480
I'll go complain to Grandma

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,930
and tell her you were harassing me.

253
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,090
Are you threatening me?

254
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,040
More than just threatening.

255
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,120
I'll make a full complaint about you to Grandma.

256
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,480
You... you...

257
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,580
You wouldn't dare!

258
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
Grandma!

259
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,040
Don't test my patience.

260
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,740
We live so close to each other.

261
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,320
If we start fighting,

262
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,440
it won't end well for either of us.

263
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,920
You dare?

264
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,600
Grand-

265
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,520
Back off!

266
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,080
Good. Now you can tell me

267
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,850
what standards NS uses to select spokespersons.

268
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,040
I want to help Chacha become NS's spokesperson,

269
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,560
but I'm not asking you to pull strings.

270
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,880
I just want you to tell me the rules.

271
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,650
There are so many niche brands in the country.

272
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,560
If she can make a niche brand popular

273
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,400
and turn it into a national brand,

274
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,480
while maintaining a clean reputation,

275
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,320
NS will naturally consider Chacha.

276
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,200
After all, no brand

277
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,930
would reject a valuable model.

278
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,240
That makes sense.

279
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,800
Thank you.

280
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,760
The big star is here.

281
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,090
I'll count on you today.

282
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,080
The plan is ready,

283
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,960
meeting starts soon.
