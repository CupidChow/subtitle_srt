1
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,120
Let's cut the cake then.

2
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,920
This design is quite unique.

3
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,400
It's called the beauty of imperfection.

4
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,000
You're saying things we don't understand again.

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,560
This is Xiao Chen's heartfelt gift.

6
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,440
Yes, of course.

7
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,920
I'm so clumsy, uncle.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,120
Sorry I damaged the corner of the cake.

9
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,080
Let me go get some candles.

10
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,600
Go ahead.

11
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,080
Kid.

12
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,400
What happened to your leg?

13
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,840
I'm fine. I just bumped it accidentally.

14
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,640
Have a seat.

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,259
How did you bump it?

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,840
Uncle, I was too embarrassed to tell you.

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,479
I was riding your bicycle.

18
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,280
And accidentally bumped into something.

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,680
You fell off the bicycle?

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,200
Let me see if your leg is injured.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,000
Let me take a look at it.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,600
Stand up, please.

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,000
Auntie, please stand up.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,520
Let me check it.

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,960
It's fine. Please sit down.

26
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,040
Are you sure you're okay?

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,600
Yes, it's just a minor bump.

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,360
Oh dear, I hope you didn't hurt yourself badly.

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,240
Don't worry.

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,680
Alright then. No problem.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,760
Young man, right.

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,720
Good.

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,960
Why are you in such a hurry?

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,920
We haven't finished lighting all the candles yet.

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,120
And you're turning off the lights.

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,320
Can't you see?

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,360
The power is out.

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,400
Uncle, let me check the electric meter for you.

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,320
Sit down, sit down.

40
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,280
Your aunt and I will go.

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,680
We must have missed the payment.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,200
Let's go add some money to the account.

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,060
I'm not going. You go by yourself.

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,800
Come with me.

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't have any money on me, honestly.

46
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,040
Let's go. You have money for art supplies.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,840
But none for electricity.

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,010
Lu Chen, Yi Feng.

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,960
You go first.

50
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
You first.

51
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,970
I want to ask you something.

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,579
Actually, last night I...

53
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,800
Look, you have a call.

54
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,320
Yes, indeed there's a call.

55
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,079
Hello, Yi Feng.

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,600
Thank you, Lu Chen.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,880
Your parents seemed happy, right?

58
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,440
Yes, they're happy. They're leaving tomorrow.

59
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,840
They're not staying longer?

60
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,440
No, this is good enough.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,640
Then I'll go with you to see them off tomorrow.

62
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,899
Actually, I wanted to ask you a favor.

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,160
Could you see them off for me tomorrow?

64
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,360
You're not going?

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,680
I really hate to see them leave, but...

66
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,160
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,159
Chacha is coming back tomorrow and asked me to wait for her.

68
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,560
Who knows what trouble she's gotten into now.

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,360
You told me today...

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,720
Don't look back, I'll be right behind you.

71
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,930
I'll remember that.

72
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,780
What about you?

73
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Lu Chen, thank you.

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,440
Why is everyone in such a rush?

75
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,810
Where did all these busybodies come from?

76
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,300
Is Chacha going to be okay?

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,360
They're all her fans.

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
Don't worry about it.

79
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,920
Slow down.

80
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,600
I'm watching.

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,760
Watch your step.

82
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,500
Come get in the car.

83
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,840
It's fine.

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,480
Let me do it.

85
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,400
Okay, okay.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,800
Drive!

87
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,280
Hurry!

88
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,520
Yi Feng, let's take a taxi instead.

89
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,800
Xiao Chen can stay with you.

90
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,600
That's right.

91
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
You all go first.

92
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,240
Their target is Chacha. I'll be fine.

93
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,920
Okay, Yi Feng.

94
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,600
You drive.

95
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,400
I'll stay here.

96
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,560
No, that would make us a bigger target.

97
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,360
Please take my parents home. I'll be fine.

98
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,560
Okay.

99
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,920
Is that...?

100
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,960
Hurry up! Be careful, Xiaofeng!

101
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,280
Miss,

102
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,640
are you Chacha's friend?

103
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,880
Can we interview you?

104
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,920
You're the female lead in NS Lu Chen's world, right?

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,960
No, no, no.

106
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,360
I don't know.

107
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,480
Would you accept our interview?

108
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,080
Come on, just talk to us.

109
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,040
No, no.

110
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Yes, would you please accept our interview?

111
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,760
What are you doing? Help!

112
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,520
Miss! Help me!

113
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Let me out!

114
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,760
Someone help!

115
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,280
Sit tight.

116
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,440
It's me.

117
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,320
It's me, Fengfeng. Open the door!

118
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,480
You scared me to death.

119
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,760
Let's go, hurry!

120
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,690
What's going on?

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,040
What happened?

122
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,600
Wait a second.

123
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,920
Why are there so many paparazzi downstairs?

124
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,160
What happened?

125
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
See for yourself.

126
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,800
Unknown actor Han Dong

127
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,159
pursued NS spokesperson Chacha during livestream, got rejected

128
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,420
attempted suicide by taking melatonin.

129
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,640
I've been walking and eating with my parents these days.

130
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,440
Haven't checked my phone at all.

131
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,640
What's going on?

132
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,640
It's just a publicity stunt.

133
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
An insider already told me about it.

134
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,440
This scumbag

135
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,720
exposed the fact that we dated before,

136
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,480
and now wants to get back together,

137
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,060
threatening suicide because I refused.

138
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,400
I'm innocent.

139
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,730
Both of us are innocent.

140
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,040
Let's go on vacation!

141
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,520
Yes, let's go.

142
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,480
Where are we going?

143
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,040
To a secluded place to lay low for a while.

144
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,920
You've already quit your job anyway.

145
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,680
We can go wherever we want now.

146
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:38,520
Yue|·78878

147
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,180
Yue1·78878

148
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Yi Feng and your parents

149
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,840
I've already dropped them off at the airport.

150
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,300
They should be on their way now. Don't worry.

151
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,040
Yes, my mom texted me too.

152
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,570
Thank you for your help.

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,840
How are things on your end?

154
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,880
It's fine. Zhaoxu is taking me and Chacha on vacation.

155
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,520
Where are you going?

156
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,799
I don't know either.

157
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,360
Seems quite far away.

158
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
We're here.

159
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,480
This is so comfortable.

160
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,240
The air is so fresh.

161
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,640
Let's go.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
Let's go.

163
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,000
Let's go.

164
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,760
What a beautiful sunset.

165
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,080
The sunset here

166
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,680
has a way of bringing peace to your soul.

167
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,720
I've been overwhelmed by recent events.

168
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,290
I need some peace and quiet.

169
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,080
Let's not think about anything.

170
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,680
Just chill out here

171
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
and relax.

172
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,320
This place is really nice.

173
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,040
The only issue here is transportation isn't convenient.

174
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,720
You can only get around by car.

175
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,640
And

176
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,160
there's only one long-distance bus at noon each day.

177
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,120
You should just relax here and enjoy the peace.

178
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,080
Vacation mode on.

179
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,340
Please leave a message if needed.

180
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,280
Zhizhi Island.

181
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,760
Ridiculous.

182
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,460
How's it going?

183
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,120
No more work for you.

184
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Are you happy about it?

185
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,240
I'm happy, but it can't last forever.

186
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,170
I still need to find a job after all.

187
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,280
Workaholic.

188
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,090
Why don't you come back and work with me again?

189
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,880
Actually, I don't even know what I really want to do.

190
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,480
Besides, I have no reason

191
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,920
to always live in my friend's shadow.

192
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:55,890
Here.

193
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,130
Chacha, Yifeng.

194
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,720
I have an idea I'd like to discuss with you.

195
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,880
Slacker-style vacation.

196
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,080
Zhizhi Island Holiday Resort.

197
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,560
That's shameless.

198
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,280
Absolutely shameless.

199
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,720
Hey, Xiaobai.

200
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,080
Mr. Lu.

201
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Are you at the office?

202
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,880
Yes, I am.

203
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,240
Bring the company car and pick me up.

204
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
My car broke down.

205
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,010
I need to go to Zhizhi Island right now.

206
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,160
Take me there.

207
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Okay, sure.

208
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,000
That's it. Also, call a tow truck for me.
