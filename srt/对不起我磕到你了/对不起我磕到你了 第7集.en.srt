1
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,760
I think

2
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,840
this outfit

3
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,800
would be perfect for tomorrow's magazine shoot.

4
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,880
Okay. Should I put it over there?

5
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,760
Just give it to me.

6
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,640
Hi, Chaoxu.

7
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,120
These past three months,

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,960
thank you for opening the door to a new world for me.

9
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,720
Although I'm happy now,

10
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,900
I shouldn't become a burden that holds you back.

11
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,680
I'm going to apply for a position at NS

12
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,460
to challenge myself further.

13
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,280
I apologize for this.

14
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,479
I hope we can reunite at NS.

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,450
Looking forward to seeing you again, Yi Feng.

16
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,240
You don't need to apologize.

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,640
I support your decision.

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,360
But I won't consider going to NS.

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,850
It's a more advanced platform,

20
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,280
but it's not right for me.

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,280
However, remember

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,280
we'll always be on the same team.

23
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,800
My studio will always be open to you.

24
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,199
If you're not happy there, just come back.

25
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,120
Miss Yi Feng,

26
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,400
hello.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
Please follow me.

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,890
Mr. Lu, this is Yi Feng, the intern here for an interview.

29
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,720
Her appearance is quite presentable.

30
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,520
Seems she's made some progress.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Why is she here for the interview?

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,000
Is she here to torture me?

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,720
Lu Chen, are you some kind of sadist?

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
Miss Yi Feng.

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,000
You don't have a relevant educational background.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,320
And you only have three months of work experience.

37
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,040
So what kind of work have you been responsible for?

38
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,480
I'm still in the learning phase,

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,760
so I'm getting a little experience with everything.

40
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,480
Currently, my most important job

41
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,880
is coordinating clothes and accessories.

42
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,320
I've seen what you looked like before.

43
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,980
So how am I supposed to believe

44
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,800
that in just three months

45
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,860
you can handle our stylist position?

46
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,480
Do you think this job is easy?

47
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,040
If it were me a few months ago,

48
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,860
I would indeed have thought this job was simple.

49
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,320
But I don't think that way anymore.

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,010
I think it's difficult.

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,490
What do you mean?

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,200
When we first met,

53
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,440
I was a complete slob with no sense of style.

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,500
It's normal that I'm not recognized.

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,640
After all, I used to think

56
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
that caring about appearance was shallow.

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
But since I entered this industry,

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,920
I've come to understand

59
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,650
that fashion is actually a profound discipline.

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,120
Many styles and elements

61
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,970
are closely connected to social change and cultural progress.

62
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,279
I later realized

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,600
that I was the shallow one.

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,010
When you think about it,

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,250
not being able to balance work and appearance

66
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,320
is actually a matter of capability.

67
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,090
Since this is an interview,

68
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,720
shouldn't you give me a chance to prove myself

69
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,780
that I've changed?

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,160
Let's say on a workday...

71
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,760
You have a business lunch in the afternoon.

72
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,560
And a college reunion at night.

73
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,820
And your ex-boyfriend will be there too.

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,080
Choose your outfit for tomorrow from these clothes.

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,000
And this

76
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
is your interview test for today.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,960
Yi Feng, Chacha, you're really here!

78
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,800
Why are you here?

79
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,760
We were invited to see the product selection.

80
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,720
What are you doing?

81
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,580
I'm here for an interview.

82
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,000
Director Lu is giving me a test.

83
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,330
An interview? Looks like we came at the perfect time.

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,570
You invited outside help for your interview?

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,520
It's fine.

86
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,440
Go wait outside.

87
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,200
Stop pacing around like that.

88
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,120
She's just having an interview.

89
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,480
Not undergoing surgery.

90
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,810
No need to be so nervous.

91
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,400
Well, I personally mentored Yi Feng after all.

92
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,160
If I'm not nervous, who would be?

93
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,000
Really? That's right.

94
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,040
It feels like parents waiting for their child to finish college entrance exams.

95
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,840
Exactly.

96
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,320
My daughter has grown up.

97
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,450
She's coming of age.

98
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,820
So much to worry about.

99
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,600
I've put together the outfit,

100
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,280
Yi Feng.

101
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,159
Help me with this.

102
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,730
Since there's no dress code requirement,

103
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
and it's a business occasion,

104
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,000
a blazer is definitely a safe choice.

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,000
This leather long blazer,

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,080
paired with this unique metal belt,

107
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,400
also has a slimming effect.

108
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,200
And here we were worrying about you,

109
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,660
but you've put together such a great outfit.

110
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,680
When you get to the reunion,

111
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,080
take off this jacket,

112
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,860
and this dress will accentuate your waistline.

113
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,840
The red is eye-catching

114
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,880
and will grab everyone's attention.

115
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,160
This distinctive metal belt,

116
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,160
wrapped like this,

117
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,640
can be worn around your neck,

118
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,970
serving dual purposes,

119
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,800
both sexy and cool.

120
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,160
It will make your ex-boyfriend immediately notice

121
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,360
how much more radiant you've become.

122
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,560
Not bad.

123
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,690
You've thought of everything.

124
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,420
Just hearing about it feels satisfying.

125
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,300
Good performance.

126
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,530
We'll notify you of the interview results within a week.

127
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,159
That's all for today.

128
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,480
I've done my best.

129
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,360
Come on, that light.

130
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,720
Move it up a bit more. How's that?

131
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,600
Looks good.

132
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,800
Try this one.

133
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,120
Okay.

134
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,720
Professor Zhao Xu,

135
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,920
since signing with NS,

136
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,720
Chacha seems to be in better and better form.

137
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,320
It's not because she signed with NS.

138
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,000
It's because she found herself.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's why she naturally keeps getting better.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,060
Professor Zhao Xu.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,440
Hello.

142
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,040
That's not it.

143
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,400
Do you really dislike our NS that much?

144
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Not at all.

145
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,440
NS is our big supporter.

146
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
President Lu is our major investor.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,520
You say one thing but mean another.

148
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,940
Such a typical player.

149
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,280
I don't deserve that title.

150
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,440
Just look at Chacha.

151
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,280
She's really glowing now.

152
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,240
I've put all my effort into your spokesperson.

153
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,440
How can you call me a player?

154
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,080
But I'm curious,

155
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,400
why are you so fixated on me,

156
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,260
a mere stylist?

157
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,970
You're not just some small-time stylist.

158
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,680
You're a stylist who's exceptionally good at rejecting people.

159
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,520
Let's put aside the fact that Yi Feng has applied to NS now.

160
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,800
What do you think?

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
Tell me your opinion.

162
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,920
Considering

163
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
the internal situation of a big company like NS,

164
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,380
I guess you won't hire her.

165
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,280
Just as you said last time,

166
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,800
her qualifications seem too basic in your eyes.

167
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,530
But I can tell you responsibly,

168
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
Yi Feng is definitely not an ordinary girl.

169
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,180
I wanted to keep her talent to myself,

170
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,360
but she has her own ambitions,

171
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,760
so I chose to support her.

172
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,440
So what I want to tell you is

173
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,300
she can see scores for everyone's image.

174
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,960
It's a superpower.

175
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,680
She will become a fashion master in the future.

176
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,840
You might think I'm making up

177
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,000
some fantasy story.

178
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
But I hope you believe me.

179
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,800
If you hire her,

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,240
remember, don't waste the potential she has.

181
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,960
I know it's just an illusion.

182
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,760
Right, I knew you would say that.

183
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,240
Being an invisible cog in a big company

184
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,160
is all too common at NS.

185
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,610
But I don't think so.

186
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,880
She will make everyone remember her name.

187
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,720
So it's not that NS isn't good.

188
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,980
I understand if you don't believe in Yi Feng.

189
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,560
But you see,

190
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,820
Chacha has found herself.

191
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,800
It was all created by her.

192
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,240
That's her best state right now.

193
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,260
Do you understand?

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,520
Let's have dinner together tonight.

195
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,440
It's my treat.

196
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,480
That's great.

197
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,050
Thank you for your generosity, Mr. Lu.

198
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,120
Wait a moment.

199
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,960
This wine needs to breathe first.

200
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,160
We'll drink it later.

201
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm happy today.

202
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,200
Thank you, Mr. Lu, for giving me this job.

203
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,260
So you do have a conscience after all.

204
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,800
The first glass is for my dear Chacha.

205
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,440
I will always love you, baby.

206
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,600
I will always love you too, baby.

207
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,280
That's quite straightforward.

208
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,920
The second glass is for Chaoxu.

209
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,640
Thank you for not blaming me for changing jobs and still supporting me.

210
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,160
I even paid you such a high salary.

211
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,820
But I still couldn't keep you.

212
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,000
Drink slowly.

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,840
Take it easy.

214
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
This isn't water.

215
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,080
The third glass is for Mr. Lu.

216
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,320
Lu Chen, thank you.

217
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,960
I know you've helped me a lot.

218
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,840
We'll drink this later.

219
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,120
Since you're now an NS employee,

220
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,600
I have some requirements for you.

221
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,560
While at the company,

222
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,020
you are not allowed to use your superpowers.

223
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,480
Fine, I'll do as the boss says.

224
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,840
I'm so happy today.

225
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,760
Chacha, let's have another drink.

226
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
No more drinking. Give it to me.

227
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,640
Give it to me.

228
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
Yi Feng, listen to me. No more drinking.

229
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,280
Look at me.

230
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,760
Look at me and stop drinking.

231
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,200
Stop drinking.

232
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,360
Get out.

233
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,640
Get out, did you hear me? Get out!

234
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,600
I don't want to enter your bedroom.

235
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,720
I don't want to see you without clothes.

236
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,450
What nonsense are you talking?

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,240
Little Feng, are you okay?

238
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,840
Do you feel like throwing up?

239
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,000
He'll try to steal a kiss.

240
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,360
I need to cover up

241
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,420
because I'm afraid he'll kiss me.

242
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,360
Hey.

243
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,840
We're here.

244
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,680
Wake up, we're home.

245
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,460
We've arrived.

246
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,200
Hey.

247
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,400
Your phone is ringing.

248
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,600
You.

249
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Xiaofeng.

250
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,770
Why aren't you home yet so late?

251
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,320
Grandma, it's me.

252
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,440
Chenchen, you two are together?

253
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,720
Don't move, let me lean on you.

254
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,680
Carry on, you two.

255
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
Don't come home tonight, Grandma.

256
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,040
No, that's not it.

257
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,440
Are you getting out of the car or not?

258
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,120
Sorry about that.

259
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,040
We're leaving right now.

260
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,100
Thank you, driver.

261
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm thirsty. I need some water.

262
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,000
We're home.

263
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,360
Wait for me here.

264
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Grandma!

265
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,050
Thank you, driver. Sorry for the trouble.

266
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,920
Grandma, it's me!

267
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,440
Grandma, open the door! It's me!

268
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,520
Hey, buddy!

269
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,360
Stop shouting. You're disturbing everyone.

270
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,220
You're the one disturbing the peace.

271
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,560
Sister will take you to bed. Come on.
