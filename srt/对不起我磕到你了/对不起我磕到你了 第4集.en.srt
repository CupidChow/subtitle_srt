1
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm sorry. Let me try again.

2
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,360
I can do this.

3
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,400
Thank you.

4
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,680
Don't replace me.

5
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,640
Don't replace me.

6
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,740
Are you asleep?

7
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,970
Why are you in such a hurry to find a job?

8
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,320
I need to survive.

9
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,120
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,700
I'm sorry. I shouldn't blame you.

11
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,260
It's actually my own problem.

12
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,720
Those changes I made for you...

13
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,520
I just hoped they would help you.

14
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,920
But actually, I put on makeup...

15
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,090
Wore beautiful clothes...

16
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,080
Do these changes...

17
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,960
Really make me beautiful?

18
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,760
Yi Feng.

19
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,040
Do you remember what I told you?

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,920
Appearance can also be used as a weapon.

21
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,880
After all these changes you made for me...

22
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't know if I'm still myself.

23
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,890
Looking back at these years...

24
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,000
I studied hard in school.

25
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,760
After graduation...

26
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,840
I came to work in Guangzhou.

27
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,680
Every day was just about work.

28
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,200
I never dared to slack off.

29
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,600
This kind of ordinary life we have...

30
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,400
You probably don't understand.

31
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,480
Actually, before I returned to China...

32
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,280
I was studying and creating social media content.

33
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,760
But at that time...

34
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,720
Everyone around me said I was too eager for quick success.

35
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,120
But when I shared what I thought was beautiful...

36
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,360
With others...

37
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,400
I felt extremely happy.

38
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,160
Later, I returned to China and joined NS...

39
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,560
Step by step, I became a director.

40
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
I seemed to have more opportunities...

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
To explain my understanding of aesthetics to people.

42
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,890
I gradually discovered...

43
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,760
That beauty shouldn't have just one standard.

44
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,720
It's more like something growing from deep within...

45
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,520
A kind of power.

46
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
A kind of belief.

47
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,060
It can make you more confident...

48
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,200
More composed.

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
It's that simple.

50
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
Why are you telling me all this?

51
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,080
I don't want others to ignore your work abilities...

52
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,680
Because of your appearance.

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,280
I remember Grandma once said...

54
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,520
You were a very brave little girl when you were young...

55
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,580
You even protected little boys who were being bullied.

56
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,920
Now you've grown up.

57
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,000
Back then, you left Grandma's house...

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,680
To go back home for school.

59
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,960
I actually...

60
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,570
Do you need me to help you find a job?

61
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,240
No, thanks.

62
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,520
I need to think about...

63
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,680
What kind of job would suit me.

64
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,640
But thank you.

65
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,520
Grandma Lu, thank you for taking care of Xiaofeng.

66
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,280
I'll miss Xiaofeng very much too.

67
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,560
Although you're being transferred back home to work far away...

68
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,840
Xiaochen and I will always think of Xiaofeng.

69
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Please consider this your own home.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,920
Xiaofeng.

71
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,880
Xiaofeng.

72
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Come here and say goodbye to Grandma Lu.

73
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
Come here quickly.

74
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,240
Xiaofeng.

75
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,280
You must come back to visit when you can.

76
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,120
If Xiaofeng comes back to Guangzhou in the future...

77
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,680
She must stay here.

78
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Take care, Grandma Lu.

79
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,840
Xiaofeng, you're something else.

80
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,000
Come on, let's go.

81
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,400
Keep going!

82
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,420
Cheer up! You can do it!

83
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,680
Wait for me!

84
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,840
Beauty shouldn't have just one standard.

85
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,159
It's more like something that grows from deep within,

86
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:58,920
a kind of strength,

87
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,280
a kind of belief.

88
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,400
It makes you more confident

89
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,780
and more composed.

90
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
It's that simple.

91
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,360
Hello, Mr. Lu. It's me again,

92
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,220
Ava from Starting Point Company.

93
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,800
About Yi Feng you asked me yesterday, I made a mistake.

94
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,760
She didn't resign. She's on paid leave.

95
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,280
Just fire her.

96
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,960
She's doing fine now.

97
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,640
No, no. We'll contact her to come back to work in a few days.

98
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,440
That won't be necessary.

99
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,520
I believe she'll find a more suitable job for herself.

100
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
So, about our cooperation...

101
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,520
That won't be necessary either. Thank you.

102
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,880
Mr. Lu, I was wrong. I'm sorry.

103
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,040
Grandma, you look good today.

104
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,160
Let me test you a bit.

105
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,840
Test what?

106
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,280
Who is your grandson?

107
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,320
My grandson is Lu Chen.

108
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,600
What about me?

109
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,480
You. But first tell me

110
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,080
who brought you bedtime milk last night?

111
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,420
There wasn't any. If you want some, I'll make it for you.

112
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,600
Xiao Feng, this grandson of mine

113
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,560
is very handsome.

114
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,800
You should go win him over.

115
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,040
Grandma, yes, it's Xiao Fengfeng.

116
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,160
The early bird catches the worm.

117
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
Oh, that's right!

118
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,890
We're thinking the same thing.

119
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,000
Do any of our downstream suppliers need planners?

120
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,960
Planners?

121
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,100
What kind of planners are you talking about?

122
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,960
The kind that makes presentation slides.

123
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,290
I don't know about that.

124
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,690
I'll go ask their HR department right now.

125
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,880
Wait.

126
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,000
Tell me first, what are you trying to do?

127
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,300
Nothing, just asking.

128
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,440
Why do you always bring such a big suitcase on business trips?

129
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,680
I need to bring lots of clothes.

130
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,000
I need to take photos.

131
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
You never brought this much before.

132
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
Things are different now.

133
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,800
I have much less work.

134
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,160
So every time I go out,

135
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,840
I have to get as many photos as possible

136
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,560
to pretend I got lots of jobs.

137
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,520
Poor thing.

138
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,120
I'll clear some closet space for your clothes.

139
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,840
Chacha, Grandma cut some fruit.

140
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,970
Would you like some?

141
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,640
There's fruit to eat.

142
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,240
Mmm, delicious.

143
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,260
Have a bite too.

144
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,840
Why did the number above your head change?

145
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,600
Number?

146
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,320
You mean this?

147
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,400
I don't know.

148
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,440
I just changed my clothes inside.

149
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,420
Go back and change again quickly.

150
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,440
Hurry up. Okay.

151
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,480
How about this? I changed into a different style.

152
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,410
How does it look?

153
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,080
Now it's 6.

154
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,220
It was 8 before.

155
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,900
So this outfit doesn't look as good as the previous one.

156
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,440
Stand still.

157
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,360
What's wrong?

158
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,780
What are you doing?

159
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,840
What are you up to?

160
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,920
Stay right where you are.

161
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,240
What's going on?

162
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,560
What is it?

163
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,400
What on earth are you trying to do?

164
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,160
The number changes every time you change your outfit.

165
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,360
You're hacking.

166
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,000
You've got superpowers.

167
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,960
You've developed a sense for fashion.

168
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,690
I don't feel anything special.

169
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,040
But these numbers are guiding me.

170
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,040
My goodness, Yi Feng, if that's not a superpower, what is?

171
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,040
Actually, before I returned to China,

172
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,400
I was studying and creating social media content at the same time.

173
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,080
People around me said I was too eager for quick success.

174
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,080
But when I share the things

175
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,520
I find beautiful with others,

176
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,840
I feel extremely happy.

177
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,160
I know what we should do now.

178
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,320
Do you think this will work?

179
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,930
Whether it works or not, we've already come this far.

180
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,610
Let's upload one photo and see.

181
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,720
You never used to be this hesitant.

182
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,650
It's just that since becoming a model,

183
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,280
I'm constantly being judged on my appearance.

184
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,010
I'm afraid I won't get the rewards I'm hoping for.

185
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,880
What's our situation right now?

186
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't have a job,

187
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,040
nothing to do.

188
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,560
And you're just a mediocre model.

189
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,480
Out of 30 days in a month,

190
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,640
you have no work for 28 of them.

191
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,520
But really, stop hesitating.

192
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,400
Who does this Tea Sister think she is?

193
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,280
Looking like that,

194
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,320
yet she dares to critique other people's outfits.

195
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,040
I love this look!

196
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm counting on you for these outfits.

197
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,520
Tea Sister, you're my idol!
