1
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,120
How about this one for Yi Feng?

2
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,240
Yi Feng still needs to check her own clothes.

3
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,300
Pick one yourself.

4
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,680
Okay.

5
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,200
Do you like it?

6
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,520
Maggie, could you try on this outfit?

7
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,479
Sure.

8
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,640
Try it on.

9
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
This way, please.

10
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,440
Yi Feng learns makeup so quickly.

11
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,920
She's also quite good at picking clothes.

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,160
Chen Chen, you've got skills.

13
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,680
You've discovered such a hidden gem.

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,800
Actually, I'm not the one who discovered her.

15
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,400
In fact, I was the one who trusted her the least.

16
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
An invitation letter.

17
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,000
It's for Yi Feng.

18
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,050
What does it have to do with you?

19
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,800
I'm ready.

20
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,690
How do I look?

21
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,520
It looks good.

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,600
But isn't it a bit too flashy for work?

23
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,130
Don't worry. There will be a suitable occasion for this outfit.

24
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,760
I didn't choose it for work.

25
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,090
It's for a fashion show.

26
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
Fashion show?

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,840
Yes. Chao Xu invited me to a show this weekend.

28
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,160
I have some matters to attend to at the company.

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,960
I'll go first.

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,660
Put this outfit on my account. NS Lu Chen.

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,320
Chenchen's taste

32
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,520
is really good.

33
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,640
This scarf really matches well.

34
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
This season's clothes are really nice.

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,640
Yes.

36
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,280
Hi Kelly! Wow, Fiona!

37
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,810
Can you please sit down?

38
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,720
You're really noisy next to me.

39
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,520
Do you know

40
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,400
I kindly came with you because I didn't want you to be alone.

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,840
Don't hurt the innocent, Chenchen.

42
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,720
Is this your first time at a fashion show?

43
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,520
Yes, it is.

44
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,920
Hi, hello!

45
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,380
They're all so beautiful.

46
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,060
You're beautiful too.

47
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,399
Looking pretty good.

48
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,440
They seem quite close.

49
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,440
Are they really that close?

50
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,920
Isn't that normal?

51
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
If you think it's normal, then fine.

52
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,680
Dinner might be delayed.

53
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,760
Have a candy.

54
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,920
He's offering her candy.

55
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,850
Is this what they call fan service?

56
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,200
Many female celebrities.

57
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,680
Before runway shows, they avoid carbs

58
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,900
and rely on candy to stave off hunger.

59
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,080
So you're getting celebrity treatment now.

60
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
Thanks.

61
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
He's saying hello to you.

62
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,160
Mr. Lu doesn't seem very happy.

63
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,620
Is he as nervous as you are?

64
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,240
I doubt it. He must be used to watching shows.

65
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,410
It's about to start.

66
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,040
Did she choose that ribbon herself?

67
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,560
It's starting.

68
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,440
Your scarf is so unique.

69
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,920
Did you choose it yourself?

70
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,800
This one?

71
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
Yes.

72
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,200
Mr. Lu gave it to me.

73
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,120
Mr. Lu gave it to you?

74
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,080
Let me take it off and have a look.

75
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,920
This scarf seems to be designed by Lu Chen

76
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
when he was in school.

77
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,400
Really?

78
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,320
Yes. Didn't he tell you?

79
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,000
He didn't tell me.

80
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,040
Mr. Lu is so talented.

81
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,320
Of course he is.

82
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,760
Phone.

83
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,159
Excuse me.

84
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,320
I just remembered I have unfinished work.

85
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,850
You need to go back to the office for overtime.

86
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,080
What?

87
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,080
Overtime.

88
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,880
Zhaoxu, I'm really sorry.

89
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,080
It's okay.

90
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,560
I didn't expect my boss would suddenly ask me to come back to file receipts.

91
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,360
I can't go for late-night snacks with you anymore.

92
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,920
When does your company usually process reimbursements?

93
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,520
On the 15th of each month.

94
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,000
Today is only the 3rd.

95
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,409
His boss is mentally unstable.

96
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,000
Yi Feng.

97
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,600
Why don't you quit working at NS?

98
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,240
You can come back to my company just like before.

99
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,680
I'll personally mentor you.

100
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,120
No, I can't. I've persevered until now.

101
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,960
Then I'll help you file them.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,530
The sooner we finish, the sooner we can go eat.

103
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,680
Glue.

104
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,480
Great.

105
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,440
Here.

106
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,679
Why is he here?

107
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,000
You're not asking for help?

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,400
Does Mr. Lu expect me to keep posting until tomorrow morning?

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,440
Teacher Chaoxu has confiscated our wages.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,560
Why should he work for free?

111
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
No problem. I'll do it myself.

112
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,920
Don't worry about him. He won't know whether I put them up or not.

113
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,960
Here. Thanks.

114
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,160
Okay. I understand.

115
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,960
Hmm. Goodbye.

116
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,930
Why are you guys still putting up posters?

117
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,640
These are put up wrong.

118
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,480
I'm helping Yi Feng put them up again.

119
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm just helping out here.

120
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,680
She put them up wrong.

121
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,120
Let her put them up again herself.

122
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,920
Why are you hanging around here?

123
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,480
It's so late.

124
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,940
I can't possibly leave a girl here alone.

125
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,080
It's not safe.

126
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,740
You being here is what's not safe.

127
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,720
I'll do it.

128
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,840
Manager Lu is so nice.

129
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,840
Let's go, Yi Feng.

130
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,400
Let's leave.

131
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Alright, you should go home and rest too.

132
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,520
It's getting late.

133
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,280
I'm so hungry I'm getting dizzy.

134
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,240
Yi Feng.

135
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,720
I know a really good porridge place nearby.

136
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
I'll take you there.

137
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,380
Have something warm to drink.

138
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,660
Sounds good. Let's go.

139
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,880
Yi Feng.

140
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,040
You should go home and rest early.

141
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,300
It's going to be busy soon.

142
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,360
Busy with what?

143
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,300
Going to Shenzhen.

144
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,040
To Shenzhen?

145
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,720
With whom?

146
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,880
With me.

147
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,320
Then I wish you good luck, Manager Lu.

148
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,800
We're going to eat now.

149
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,160
Let's go. Come on.

150
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,080
Hello.

151
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,210
I have an appointment with Teacher Qi.

152
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
Teacher Qi.

153
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,720
Hello, Teacher Qi.

154
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,440
I'm Yi Feng from NS.

155
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,040
We scheduled an interview for this afternoon.

156
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,880
Hello, Teacher Qi.

157
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,240
I'm delighted to interview you today.

158
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,640
I'm a fan of yours.

159
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,160
This interview

160
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,320
is mainly about your biennial exhibition at the end of the year.

161
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,080
We mainly want to create

162
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,940
a special feature on the dialogue between Chinese style and fashion.

163
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,600
There are two people here ignoring me.

164
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,880
What's going on?

165
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,880
Ink and blank space,

166
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,080
reality and emptiness coexist.

167
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,720
Cherish ink as gold.

168
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,020
White serves as black.

169
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,680
With just a few brushstrokes,

170
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,760
in a small space,

171
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,000
the universe takes shape.
