1
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,640
Give me

2
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,080
the contact information of the 25th generation inheritor of gold embroidery.

3
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,539
I'll do whatever you want.

4
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,880
Oh my, today

5
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,400
my shoulders and back are really sore.

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Chenchen, could you give me a massage?

7
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Oh, Chenchen.

8
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,160
What's going on?

9
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,440
These two look pretty strange.

10
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,360
Chaoxu, let me do it.

11
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,520
With so many colleagues around,

12
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,180
it's not appropriate, Mr. Lu.

13
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,650
You sit down. I'll massage you.

14
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,960
Okay.

15
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,850
Yi Feng, let me tell you.

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,160
Even if Mr. Lu wants to have rumors with me,

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,440
he wouldn't let me be with you.

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,320
Hey, be gentle.

19
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,320
Why so hard?

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,240
Gentler, it hurts like hell.

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,440
Xiaofeng, Chacha.

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,200
Easy there.

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,720
That's good.

24
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,580
Just like that.

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,000
Two handsome guys

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,400
being so intimate with each other.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,920
It's a bit hard to watch.

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,280
Right? Juice?

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,760
Thanks.

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,920
Yi Feng, that person is Chao Xu, right?

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,720
Yes.

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,760
Something seems off.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,640
Look how intimate they are.

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,600
Your technique is pretty good.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,560
Mr. Lu and Chao Xu?

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Yes. Shut up.

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,360
Mr. Lu is wearing pink swim trunks today.

38
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,160
Is it because he's here?

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Hey, look!

40
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:34,680
The way he looks at Mr. Lu is different from how he looks at others.

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,880
That makes sense.

42
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,360
The way he looks at me is quite impressive.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,040
Look at him with Mr. Lu.

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Push harder! A little more!

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,720
Come on!

46
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,680
Good! Awesome!

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,880
I never realized you were this weird before.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,920
Really? I think I'm perfectly normal.

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,840
Normal.

50
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,760
You're normal. You like being served by men.

51
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,960
Well, I also like being served by women.

52
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,360
I'm a person who loves all.

53
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,160
I love everything in this world.

54
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,980
What about Yi Feng?

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,120
Are you asking if I like Yi Feng?

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,280
Yes.

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,800
If you don't like her,

58
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,440
please don't flutter around

59
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,480
like a butterfly in front of her.

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,780
She's a simple person.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,920
Maybe you should ask yourself that question.

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,720
Mr. Lu.

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,560
Whether I like her or not

64
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,960
is none of your business.

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,410
It has nothing to do with me,

66
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,680
but if you don't like her,

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,960
what right do you have to ask me to stay away from her?

68
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,920
Tell me first,

69
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,410
why are you so determined to find this gold nail embroidery inheritor?

70
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,579
I want to use it for this season's NS haute couture dresses.

71
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,360
I know gold nail embroidery is typically used on bridal gowns,

72
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,290
representing a blessing for love.

73
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,050
And for those unmarried girls,

74
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,720
if we use it on our haute couture dresses,

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
any girl who dreams of love

76
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,700
will receive the blessing of the gold nail embroidery.

77
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,079
What makes you think

78
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,820
I can find this gold nail embroidery inheritor?

79
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,200
I think you have extensive connections

80
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,400
and you've done a decent job blending tradition with fashion.

81
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,540
Your compliment doesn't sound sincere, Mr. Lu.

82
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,570
It's hard for me to believe you.

83
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,400
Alright, here's the thing.

84
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,960
The other day when dining with President Zhou,

85
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,520
I saw

86
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
you gave Yi Feng a gold nail embroidered bracelet.

87
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,040
The craftsmanship was exquisite.

88
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,320
From what I can tell,

89
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,159
it must be the work of the 25th generation inheritor of gold nail embroidery.

90
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,680
You've been beating around the bush,

91
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,320
Mr. Lu. You're quite calculating.

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,600
I see.

93
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,500
How about this?

94
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,040
Just admit to me that you like Yi Feng.

95
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,040
Then I'll

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,700
tell you the address of the gold embroidery inheritor right away.

97
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
You can go now.

98
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,010
I'll find a way to contact them myself.

99
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,880
You're quite stubborn.

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,520
Let me tell you.

101
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,480
My relationship with Yi Feng

102
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,410
won't be corrupted by any benefits

103
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,160
or threatened by anyone.

104
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,840
Go to this address tomorrow to find him.

105
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm done eating.

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,800
Go early.

107
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,450
I'll wait for you to solve this.

108
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,240
Please.

109
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,520
This way, Mr. Lu.

110
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,440
Hello, I'm Lu Chen from NS.

111
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,400
I contacted you yesterday.

112
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,040
I've come specially to visit you today.

113
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,760
Hello.

114
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,760
Hello, Mr. Lu.

115
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,690
I am the 25th generation inheritor of gold nail embroidery.

116
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,880
How is it you?

117
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,260
You're the first visitor Master Zhao Si has seen in five years.

118
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,280
Is Zhaocai your real name?

119
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,240
Zhao Si. Si means quick-witted.

120
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,880
Alright, Master Zhao Si.

121
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,520
It's Si, brother. Si.

122
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,920
I never imagined you were the inheritor of gold nail embroidery.

123
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,880
I was sent to my master when I was very young.

124
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,520
Since childhood, I had to study over 60 types of stitching techniques every day.

125
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,380
These gold and silver threads have left my hands covered in calluses.

126
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,120
Did you make these?

127
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,640
This is the last ceremonial dress

128
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,970
I helped my master make.

129
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,760
Gold embroidery is a craft that requires dedication.

130
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
Did you change careers because it was too exhausting?

131
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,200
Of course not.

132
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,880
People nowadays prefer Western wedding dresses.

133
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,180
The demand for gold embroidery in weddings is decreasing.

134
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,520
I don't want this craft to end with me.

135
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,160
That's why I changed careers to make money.

136
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,280
But I still spend one month here every year.

137
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,720
I shut myself in to create.

138
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,280
I don't go anywhere else.

139
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,480
In that case,

140
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,010
Mr. Chaoxu might consider my invitation.

141
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,640
I want to use gold embroidery

142
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,600
in our haute couture dresses this year

143
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,400
and hold an annual fashion show.

144
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Would this solve your predicament?

145
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,160
If I say it will, then it will.

146
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,680
It depends on how sincere Mr. Lu is.

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,480
What would you consider sincere?

148
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,540
I'll designate the project liaison from your company.

149
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,480
Why don't you agree?

150
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,480
I've already designated the contact person.

151
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,800
Yi Feng will be the client-side project manager

152
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,280
and work with you to fully manage the gold nail embroidery project.

153
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,200
I believe she can use this project to

154
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,440
prove her worth

155
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,200
and demonstrate her value to NS.

156
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,520
The three proposals from Teacher Chaoxu

157
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,240
have been reviewed internally.

158
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,360
We really like them

159
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,490
and they far exceed our expectations.

160
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,200
But now,

161
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,960
based on feasibility,

162
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,160
I'd like to point out some minor issues to Teacher Chaoxu.

163
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,960
Teacher Yi Feng, please go ahead.

164
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Teacher Chaoxu,

165
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,480
we've noticed that your first proposal

166
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,680
and third proposal both use rather complex patterns.

167
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
We've done some research

168
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,720
and found that versions one and three would take time

169
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,780
that might exceed our expectations.

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,560
So,

171
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
I'd like to ask everyone and Teacher Chaoxu

172
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,000
if we could replace some patterns

173
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,280
or perhaps merge them.

174
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,840
Well, Teacher Yi Feng, let's do this.

175
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
You can circle the patterns

176
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,200
that you want for me.

177
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,960
Then I'll discuss it with my designer.

178
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,360
After all, this is just the first version.

179
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
We still need to work together more.

180
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,680
Alright, thank you for your hard work, Teacher Chaoxu.

181
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,920
It's no trouble.

182
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,640
I'm leaving.

183
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,440
Bye.

184
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,680
Grandma is joining a rehabilitation group tomorrow.

185
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,140
Are you coming over today?

186
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,080
Grandma is asleep.

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,400
I've packed her luggage.

188
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,840
Two big suitcases.

189
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,100
Remember to personally see her onto the rehabilitation center's bus tomorrow.

190
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,000
I know.

191
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,400
The first draft of the gold nail embroidery project

192
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,840
went very well today. Don't worry.

193
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,400
Good.

194
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,000
You haven't eaten, have you?

195
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,900
I don't want to eat.

196
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,440
I've told you not to drink milk on an empty stomach.

197
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,920
You should get some rest.

198
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,000
What else?

199
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,160
Grandma will be at rehabilitation for a long time this time.

200
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,520
But she's been in good spirits lately.

201
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,000
I hope she improves this time.

202
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,640
You're her real granddaughter.

203
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,040
I'm more like just a roommate.

204
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,120
Stop being sour. Let's go.

205
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,600
I'll treat you to dinner.

206
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,040
What, you don't want to go?

207
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,880
Don't you need to change clothes for dinner?
