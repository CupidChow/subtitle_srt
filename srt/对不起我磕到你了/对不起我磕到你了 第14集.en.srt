1
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,160
You scared me to death!

2
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,760
I thought you were paparazzi.

3
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,200
What are you doing?

4
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,880
So I'm trending online?

5
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,000
All those reporters outside

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,130
want me to talk about

7
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,720
the messy story with my ex-boyfriend.

8
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,440
Why aren't you at work?

9
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
I quit.

10
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Quit? Why?

11
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,080
I don't think I'm suitable for that job anymore.

12
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,160
You worked so hard just to quit?

13
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,480
Because Lu Chen is innocent.

14
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,220
He shouldn't be dragged into this because of me.

15
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,840
Do you have feelings for Lu Chen?

16
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,320
What are you talking about?

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,690
Your actions have already given you away.

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,280
Don't move. I'll go.

19
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Uncle and Auntie,

20
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,440
Chacha,

21
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,600
Yifeng, look who's here.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,360
Xiaofeng, my dear daughter.

23
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,010
Did you miss Mom?

24
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,200
Xiaofeng.

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
Why are you all here?

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,880
Chacha called us saying you were feeling down.

27
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,000
We were worried about you.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
So we came to see you.

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,720
Yes.

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,600
You should have called ahead.

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,840
I could have booked a hotel for you.

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,720
No need.

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,480
I happen to be going out for a shoot these days.

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,280
Uncle and Auntie, you can stay in my room.

35
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,680
Make yourselves at home.

36
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,960
What are you shooting?

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,400
Why haven't I heard about this?

38
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,880
You should stay home for now.

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,560
It was a last-minute job.

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,800
It's also a good chance for me to clear my head.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,920
Just spend some time with your parents.

42
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,160
Thank you, Xiaofeng.

43
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,800
It's nothing, Uncle.

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,680
My precious.

45
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,880
Here, take this.

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,920
Dad, why did you come over suddenly?

47
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,780
I was planning to visit home soon.

48
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,170
Your mother wanted to celebrate my birthday.

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,440
So we decided to come see you.

50
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,930
Consider it a vacation.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,680
You could at least come help.

52
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,800
Always fiddling with that junk of yours.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,040
I'm almost done with this.

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,920
Really.

55
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,040
Mom, if he enjoys it, just let him do it.

56
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,440
And you.

57
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,040
Look at yourself.

58
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,000
What are you wearing?

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,200
It looks terrible.

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
So ugly and you're still wearing makeup.

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,840
You look prettier without makeup.

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,440
Dad, is it ugly?

63
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,360
Don't mind her, she's just trying to get attention.

64
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
I like this tone.

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,200
It's from an Italian painter.

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,440
Morandi's style.

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
Very sophisticated.

68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,920
You have good taste.

69
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,960
I support you.

70
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,480
Xiaofeng,

71
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,399
mom bought you a new one.

72
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,209
Look how beautiful this is.

73
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,560
Come try it on.

74
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,680
Dad, come here.

75
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
Make her happy.

76
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,540
Show it to your dad.

77
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,560
Isn't this beautiful?

78
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,200
Don't you think so?

79
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
I need a red one.

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,660
I should go buy one.

81
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,250
Who are you looking for?

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,480
Hello.

83
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,720
Does Yi Feng live here?

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,920
I'm his father.

85
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,960
Hello, sir.

86
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,960
I'm sorry,

87
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,159
I came in a hurry

88
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,560
and didn't bring any gifts for you.

89
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,800
Hello.

90
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,040
Who are you?

91
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,159
My name is Lu Chen.

92
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,520
You can call me Xiao Lu or Xiao Chen.

93
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,040
Lu Chen.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,840
Xiao Chen.

95
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,360
Look how fast time flies.

96
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
Xiao Chen is all grown up now.

97
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,000
How is your grandmother doing now?

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,840
Auntie, my grandmother is doing quite well.

99
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,680
I signed her up for a health retreat group.

100
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,800
They have professional doctors there.

101
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,440
So she can travel and recover at the same time.

102
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,040
That's good, that's great.

103
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,520
While she's still in good health,

104
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,080
it's nice for her to travel around and see things.

105
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,440
Yes.

106
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,760
What bad timing.

107
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,840
We actually wanted to visit your grandmother.

108
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,720
Indeed.

109
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,920
I miss her so much.

110
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,320
Actually, Uncle and Auntie,

111
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,920
you both could stay at my place.

112
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,159
I have plenty of rooms.

113
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,960
Sounds good.

114
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,520
No, no.

115
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,860
We appreciate your offer, Xiao Chen.

116
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,159
Isn't Chacha away from home?

117
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,440
We'll just stay here instead of moving around.

118
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,720
We mainly want to spend time with Xiao Feng.

119
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,980
We'll be heading back in a couple of days.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,840
Xiao Chen.

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,730
Has anyone ever asked you to model before?

122
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,280
Model?

123
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,200
Have you noticed your face is perfect for painting?

124
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,920
The lines of your face are clear and strong.

125
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,640
You could definitely model for me.

126
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,680
Dad, he's our guest.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,880
He's not here to be your model.

128
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,440
Xiao Chen, have dinner with us tonight.

129
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,440
I'll show you my cooking skills.

130
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,400
And after dinner, you can model for me.

131
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,440
I'm so sorry.

132
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,480
My dad really loves painting.

133
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,960
He gets excited when he sees someone with good features for painting.

134
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,200
Just ignore him, it's fine.

135
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,120
No problem, Uncle.

136
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,080
I'd be happy to model for you.

137
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,120
Great, it's a deal.

138
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,040
No taking it back now.

139
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,840
I'll go make dinner.

140
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,760
Alright!

141
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,000
Xiao Chen, dinner's ready!

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
Alright!

143
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,040
Eat up!

144
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,120
Come on, start eating!

145
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,720
Try uncle's cooking!

146
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,520
Sure thing!

147
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,600
You eat too!

148
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,360
Okay.

149
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,280
I will.

150
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,640
Look at dad failing to cook

151
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,440
Try this one.

152
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,560
and ordering takeout instead.

153
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,440
Hmph, that man

154
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,720
is so unreliable.

155
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,040
Just eat your food.

156
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,720
Fine.

157
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,560
Eat.

158
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,520
All his life he's just loved drinking and painting.

159
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,200
At his age, he still doesn't act like an adult.

160
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,330
That's just my fate.

161
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,480
It's so late, it's inappropriate.

162
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,640
Can you control them?

163
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,400
Make them finish early.

164
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,200
Control him? He doesn't listen to me.

165
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,040
Let them drink.

166
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,000
Fine.

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
They can drink themselves to death.

168
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,060
Please do something about it.

169
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,440
I heard you're Xiaofeng's boss.

170
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,760
I was his former supervisor.

171
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,560
Yes,

172
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
he's my boss now.

173
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,680
An elite!

174
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Not really. Bottoms up!

175
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,160
Wow!

176
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,200
Easy now, be careful.

177
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Okay.

178
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,200
He drank so much.

179
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,280
Help him lie down.

180
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,600
Lie down quickly.

181
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,720
I'd love to be your model. Lie down.

182
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,160
Good! I like hearing that.

183
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
Why did he drink so much? Really!

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,320
Come on, cover him with the blanket.

185
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,720
Wake up,

186
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,160
sober up.

187
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,400
Look at this kid, so tall,

188
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,040
but a few drinks and he's like this.

189
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,920
Seriously, you kept pouring him drinks.

190
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,400
This young man is really handsome.

191
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,000
Handsome? Really?

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,080
Yes, very handsome.

193
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,210
Not as handsome as when he was younger.

194
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,200
If this isn't handsome, what is?

195
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,400
Look at him, so fair-skinned,

196
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,400
looking like a delicate young actor.

197
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,040
A real man

198
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,200
should have a crew cut and square face,

199
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,760
standing tall like a true hero.

200
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,620
You must be talking about me then.

201
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,480
Don't be so vain.

202
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,240
You've had too much to drink too.

203
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,840
Go to bed now.

204
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,440
Let him sleep here tonight.

205
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,400
Keep an eye on him.

206
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,040
You all go to bed.

207
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,920
Okay, let's go.

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
Let's go.

209
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,960
Yi Feng.

210
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,880
I'm sorry,

211
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,760
wrong room.

212
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't go.

213
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,090
I'm sleeping in the living room today.

214
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,160
Why did you resign?

215
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,560
Why did you leave?

216
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,720
This job is no longer suitable for me.

217
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,920
But I don't want you to go.

218
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,400
I can't bear it.

219
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,200
We're all adults.

220
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,840
Don't say such childish things.

221
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,200
I don't want to lose you.

222
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,520
I can't bear

223
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,480
to see you leave.

224
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,960
Please come back.

225
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,840
Morning.

226
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,360
Lu Chen.

227
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,400
Auntie,

228
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,920
breakfast is ready.

229
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,760
I'm not hungry, I'll skip it.

230
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,520
My goodness, you still reek of alcohol.

231
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,560
Let me tell you,

232
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,680
an empty stomach will damage your health.

233
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
I have some business at the company.

234
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,520
I need to go there first.

235
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,320
By the way,

236
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,600
did you drive here?

237
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,080
Well, you can't drive now.

238
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,480
Xiaofeng, call him a taxi.

239
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,200
No need,

240
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,330
what a coincidence.

241
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
This morning I went to buy breakfast

242
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,040
and picked up a second-hand bicycle.

243
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
What did you buy that for?

244
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,600
I was thinking about going out to sketch today.

245
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,640
It's convenient to have it.

246
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,080
See? It's already coming in handy.

247
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,480
Is this appropriate, Uncle?

248
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,920
Why wouldn't it be?

249
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,160
Today is my birthday.

250
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,040
Come over for birthday noodles tonight.

251
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,400
Remember, we'll do some painting after dinner.

252
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,800
Let's go.

253
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Yes, yes, yes.

254
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
I'll go first, uncle.

255
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,760
Ah, okay, okay.

256
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,520
Goodbye, uncle and auntie.

257
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,560
Be careful.

258
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,440
Bye-bye.

259
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,080
Let's eat, let's eat.

260
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,050
Where are you going?

261
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,620
Isn't this the car?

262
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,260
How are you sure it's this car?

263
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,080
Isn't this the only car here?

264
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,080
Car keys.

265
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,840
Oh, I don't want to ride anymore.

266
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,040
I'll just take a taxi home.

267
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,560
Mr. Lu, are you trying to tell me you don't know how to ride?

268
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,880
I just forgot.

269
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,940
It's been a long time since I rode one.

270
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,560
You didn't say anything earlier.

271
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,680
So what do we do now?

272
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,920
That's it, start pedaling.

273
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Look ahead.

274
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,000
Slowly move forward.

275
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,320
Very good.

276
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,120
Look forward, don't look back.

277
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,560
Hey, where are you?

278
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Don't look back.

279
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,680
I'm right behind you.

280
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,320
I've been here all along.

281
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,200
Look ahead and stay strong.

282
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't overthink.

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
Everything will get better.

284
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,340
I'll wait for you to come back.

285
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,920
Hey, we're filming here.

286
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,480
But Teacher Zhaoxu should get a chance.

287
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,400
Where are you?

288
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,460
I found a place to isolate myself for a while.

289
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,180
You're not at home?

290
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,200
Yi Feng's parents came to visit.

291
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,440
I'm keeping her company for a couple of days.

292
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,370
I just cleared out the space to make them feel at home.

293
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,360
What a good friend you are, I'm jealous.

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,600
Well, her parents are only staying for two days.

295
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,920
I'll be back tomorrow.

296
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,160
Has Mr. Lu gone to see Yi Feng?

297
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,400
I don't know about Lu Chen.

298
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,280
By the way, Yi Feng resigned from NS.

299
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,760
This Lu Chen has hurt Xiao Fengfeng terribly.

300
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Not necessarily.

301
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,340
I think none of us can really understand what's going on between them.

302
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,720
I also think there's something between them.

303
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,880
Even you noticed it.

304
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,720
That's surprising.

305
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,760
Of course.

306
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,160
Hey, what are you trying to say?
