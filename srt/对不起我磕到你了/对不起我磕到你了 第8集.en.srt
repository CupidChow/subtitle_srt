1
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,360
Let me take you to bed.

2
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,520
Let's go.

3
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,120
What's that?

4
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,920
It's a room key card. Are you stupid?

5
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,640
I used to stay here when I worked late.

6
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,760
This isn't a room key card.

7
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,960
It's a discount card.

8
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,090
You're still drunk.

9
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,650
What are you talking about?

10
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,800
Fine, suit yourself.

11
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,039
I'll go by myself.

12
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,960
This small hotel isn't safe.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,240
I'll take you to a better one.

14
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,400
I just need to sleep. Let's hurry up.

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,960
Good.

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,600
Smart move.

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,440
I'm thirsty.

18
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
Where can I buy water?

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,680
So long.

20
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,120
No,

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,080
look at this trouble again.

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
A bit later, okay?

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,400
Alright,

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,330
I'll hang up now.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,200
Hello.

26
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,050
Beautiful lady.

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,800
Are you alone?

28
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,860
Do you know what time it is?

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,720
Are you by yourself?

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,280
Don't touch me.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,960
Miss, miss.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,930
I don't mean anything by it.

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,880
Don't be afraid. I'm just concerned about you.

34
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,160
Why don't you get a hotel room to rest?

35
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,360
Watch out! Creep!

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,160
Don't fall.

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,320
Let me go, that's enough!

38
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,280
We're almost there.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,920
Let's go.

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,000
Let me go!

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
What are you doing? What do you want?

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,720
Let go! Let go!

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,920
I'll call the police!

44
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,880
Go ahead.

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,320
Call them!

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,920
Get away! Let's see who dares to touch him.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,480
Try to move one more time.

48
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,880
I was just worried.

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,280
It's okay, it's okay.

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,010
Why are you so silly?

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,760
Why did you stand in front of me?

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,890
What if you got hurt?

53
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,240
I was afraid you'd hurt him

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,040
and get taken away by the police.

55
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,960
There's only one room left.

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,000
What? Only one room left?

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,600
It's a standard room, right?

58
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,240
I'm not afraid.

59
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,200
Only bad people are afraid.

60
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,240
Right?

61
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,560
Oh magical God of Beauty,

62
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,600
the gap between him and me is too vast.

63
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,040
If you can help me,

64
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,480
please reduce his score to zero.

65
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,880
What are you doing?

66
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,800
I'm sleepwalking right now.

67
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
I'm in a dream.

68
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,520
I fell asleep.

69
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,000
Good night.

70
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,760
Was she trying to kiss me just now?

71
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,000
Why did I suddenly wake up?

72
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,600
If we weren't colleagues...

73
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,840
Oh my God.

74
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,760
We've become colleagues.

75
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,960
How am I going to face him?

76
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,440
This is too much for me.

77
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,100
This is too much for me.

78
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,770
He must have forgotten.

79
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,690
She probably still remembers.

80
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,520
Chacha.

81
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,960
Yifeng, you're here.

82
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,730
I was just about to look for you.

83
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,460
How does this outfit look?

84
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,640
Please give me your opinion.

85
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,100
I've been waiting for you.

86
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,480
It's impossible not to look at the scores.

87
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,840
Sister Cha.

88
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,370
This one looks good, right?

89
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,160
Yifeng.

90
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
What do you think?

91
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,840
The overall look is very harmonious.

92
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,160
The bag really enhances it.

93
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,320
No other comments?

94
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,480
This bag...

95
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,000
This bag won't work.

96
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
This bag is covered in rhinestones.

97
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,440
The dress is made of silk.

98
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,340
The rhinestones could easily scratch the silk.

99
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,900
Do you have any alternatives?

100
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,800
Try this one.

101
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,360
Look, it perfectly balances Chacha's style.

102
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,740
Makes her look softer.

103
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,640
That makes sense. If this issue happened during the show,

104
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,960
it would be devastating for the brand.

105
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,360
Where did you learn that?

106
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,600
At the dry cleaner's.

107
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,000
Great.

108
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,580
Let's go with this outfit.

109
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,000
Yifeng.

110
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,920
You did well today.

111
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,760
I can give you a little reward.

112
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,680
What is it?

113
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,400
How about I treat you to a nice dinner?

114
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,880
I can't make it.

115
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Do you have plans?

116
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,760
Chaoxu asked me to have dinner.

117
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,170
Go ahead without me.

118
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,600
Lu Chen doesn't allow me to use my superpowers at work.

119
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,240
I don't know what to do anymore.

120
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,360
Today he asked me to choose accessories and bags for Chacha.

121
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,160
Surprisingly, I managed without using my powers.

122
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,640
Lu Chen is a bit strange.

123
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,880
But as a boss,

124
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,040
he has his own temperament.

125
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
It's okay. You just need to get more familiar with him.

126
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,600
How could I possibly get used to him?

127
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,260
With that weird temper of his.

128
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,240
Look at this bracelet. Isn't it beautiful?

129
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,400
It's gorgeous.

130
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,800
The embroidery is so intricate.

131
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,240
This pattern

132
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,360
is actually just several gold threads.

133
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,220
They're woven together, one thread after another.

134
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,040
What you need to do now

135
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,840
is just like these gold threads.

136
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,480
Find the pattern

137
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,400
and sort it out.

138
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,360
Step by step, stitch by stitch,

139
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,880
and the beautiful pattern will emerge.

140
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,360
Do you like it?

141
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,880
If you do, it's yours.

142
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,840
Really?

143
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,570
Yes, really.

144
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,480
Thank you.

145
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,920
This is the best restaurant I've been to since returning to China.

146
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,160
I wonder if Mr. Zhou will like it.

147
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
Thank you for your thoughtfulness, Mr. Lu.

148
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,480
I really like this craftsmanship.

149
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
It suits you well.

150
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,800
Professor Chaoxu.

151
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,600
Mr. Zhou.

152
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,840
Long time no see.

153
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,090
What a coincidence.

154
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,380
Are you dining with your girlfriend?

155
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,800
What a coincidence!

156
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,600
Mr. Lu.

157
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Mr. Zhou, this is my reserved table.

158
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,400
Let's sit down.

159
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,720
Bring us a bottle of your Patius wine.

160
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,680
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu,

161
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,040
the wine you ordered is sold out.

162
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,840
I apologize.

163
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,760
Seems I won't have the pleasure today.

164
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,890
The wine Mr. Lu mentioned has me quite intrigued.

165
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,840
Professor Chaoxu, would you mind sharing a glass with me?

166
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,520
Of course.

167
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,520
Mr. Lu and Mr. Zhou.

168
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,920
I wonder if Yi Feng and I being here

169
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,650
would be interrupting you two.

170
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,240
It's fine.

171
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,490
Mr. Zhou and I are just having a friendly drink today.

172
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,730
Let's all relax and chat casually.

173
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,200
Actually,

174
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,680
I've known Professor Zhao Xu

175
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,880
since two years ago.

176
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,680
Back then, our factory

177
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,840
was still manufacturing for small brands.

178
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,680
Thanks to Professor Zhao Xu's help,

179
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
he introduced us to many partnerships

180
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,320
which led to what our small factory has become today.

181
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,800
Of course, I'd like to thank Mr. Lu for honoring us with his presence today.

182
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,200
We're still hoping to collaborate with NS.

183
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,120
Mr. Zhou is a renowned cosmetics manufacturer.

184
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,840
All the major first-tier cosmetic brands in China

185
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,720
are manufactured by Mr. Zhou.

186
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,400
Mr. Zhou's production lines are now very well-established.

187
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,480
So,

188
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,840
he now has the idea of creating his own brand.

189
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,720
And coincidentally,

190
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,250
we at NS also have the idea of collaborating on a cosmetics line.

191
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,570
The fact that we can sit down and talk today

192
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,280
is all based on Mr. Zhou's outstanding work capabilities.

193
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,480
So I believe if we can reach an agreement,

194
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,640
we'll be very compatible partners.

195
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,900
Looking forward to it.

196
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,920
Here.

197
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,440
Have some of this. Thank you.

198
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,120
Miss Yi Feng, what's your skin type?

199
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
She has dry skin,

200
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,280
but with some sensitivity as well.

201
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,440
So I'd say it's combination skin.

202
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,920
Looks like you two have a good relationship.

203
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,780
You know your girlfriend so well.

204
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,920
Miss Yi Feng,

205
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm with you every day

206
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,200
and I had no idea

207
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,320
when you became Zhao Xu's girlfriend.

208
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,120
Oh, right,

209
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,560
do you remember

210
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
when Shen Ke did your makeup last time,

211
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,080
she said you had oily skin?

212
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,440
She spent forever covering your acne with concealer.

213
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,440
So what is your skin type, really?

214
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,440
I actually don't use cosmetics normally.

215
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,120
The lighting in Shen Ke's makeup room is way too bright.

216
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,000
Anyone would look like they have oily skin there.

217
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,360
But every morning when she wakes up,

218
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,290
I see her face is all shiny with oil.

219
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,520
I understand.

220
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,840
Please give me your address,

221
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,400
and I'll send you a complete set of our cosmetics.

222
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,600
No problem. Just use whichever works for you.

223
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,960
Thank you both for your hospitality today.

224
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,420
You're welcome, Mr. Zhou.

225
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,960
So that's settled.

226
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,880
I'll go first.

227
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,570
I won't see you out then.

228
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,440
Goodbye.

229
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,240
Bye.

230
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,680
Insisting on sharing our table.

231
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,600
What's their intention?
