=Lost You Forever S2=

2
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,816
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,696
(Xiaoliu, come again!)

4
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,208
(I'm off.)

5
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:36,770
(Take care.)

6
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,649
(I'm leaving.)

7
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:38,689
Xiaoliu, take care.

8
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,929
Whoever can't have a baby

9
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:41,689
can come to the Rejuvenation Hall.

10
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:47,250
Are you alright?

11
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:48,450
Sorry.

12
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,049
I had been praying

13
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,649
that I could find you in Qingshui Town,

14
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,009
but I was blind.

15
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:57,770
I met you right after I arrived

16
00:01:58,609 --> 00:01:59,929
in Qingshui Town,

17
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:02,329
but I didn't recognize you.

18
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:03,170
Instead...

19
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,049
We were reunited, anyway.

20
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,769
Are you worried about the residents?

21
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,729
I've lived here for decades, after all.

22
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:24,369
I used to see them every day.

23
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:27,410
Miss, rest assured.

24
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,610
His Majesty repeatedly

25
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:30,729
emphasized that we must
settle them properly.

26
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,129
The residents

27
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,569
received compensation

28
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:34,890
and moved away willingly.

29
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,530
When the war is over,

30
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:39,009
they can return if they want.

31
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,090
Mr. Stone

32
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,289
can't leave his main body.

33
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,530
How did he move away?

34
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,129
A few demons

35
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,170
who were on good terms with him

36
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,569
carried his main body

37
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:50,769
as they left.

38
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,729
That's good.

39
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:54,810
That's good.

40
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,090
Not far ahead

41
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,450
was a jeweler's residence,

42
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,330
which was the best house in town.

43
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,690
Now, it's a resting place

44
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,649
for generals in turn.

45
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,090
Your Majesty, please stay there.

46
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,769
Once you've rested a bit,

47
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,330
allow me to show you around.

48
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,330
The Yu Mansion?

49
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:13,849
You know Qingshui Town well,

50
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:14,769
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,970
Find another place.

52
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:19,610
No.

53
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:22,090
Let's stay there.

54
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,496
Okay.

55
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:30,530
We'll stay there.

56
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:38,384
(Yu Mansion)

57
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,250
Xiaoyao.

58
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:55,369
(Although...)

59
00:04:57,609 --> 00:04:59,250
Although it's very unlikely,

60
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,010
I'm still scared

61
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,449
that I might

62
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,130
accidentally let you into my dreams.

63
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,929
You are in no way

64
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:19,410
the type to be in a girl's dream.

65
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,209
This is probably more terrifying

66
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,169
than death.

67
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:32,530
You are absolutely right.

68
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,090
In real combat,

69
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:49,609
have you found

70
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,290
any flaws in the initial strategy?

71
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:55,169
Your strategy is very solid.

72
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:57,369
But I was reckless

73
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,329
and let you down.

74
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,730
We're so acquainted.

75
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,570
How can you possibly
let me down with one defeat?

76
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:05,690
I'm just curious about the reasons.

77
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,209
When battling against Haoling back then,

78
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,769
Ru Shou won again and again,

79
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,369
yet you stayed calm.

80
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,250
Why did you
rush after the enemy this time?

81
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,929
We know each other well

82
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:23,369
through life and death.

83
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,489
You know you can
tell me anything, right?

84
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:28,010
No rush.

85
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:30,329
Tell me when you want to.

86
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,609
Xiang Liu.

87
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,530
I swear I will take your life!

88
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,209
Miss.

89
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:11,850
Miss.

90
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,010
General Chishui is badly injured.

91
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,209
His Majesty is asking for you.

92
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:17,328
Medicine.

93
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,329
Bear with it.

94
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,649
It's nothing serious.

95
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,410
I just bled a bit.

96
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,929
It didn't hit any vital parts.

97
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:34,009
Xiaoyao.

98
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,050
How is he?

99
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,329
Rest assured.

100
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,889
It didn't hit any vital parts.

101
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:41,569
He has stopped bleeding.

102
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,209
He'll be fine after a few days of rest.

103
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:53,610
Fenglong.

104
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:55,050
Thank you.

105
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,090
If you hadn't blocked this arrow for me,

106
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,329
I would have died.

107
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,809
Please don't say that.

108
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:06,930
Xiang Liu must have been
lying in ambush nearby,

109
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:08,569
waiting to assassinate you.

110
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,490
But Your Majesty only arrived this noon.

111
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,410
Merely two hours passed,

112
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:16,129
and Xiang Liu got the news.

113
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,090
It was my negligence.

114
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,970
I will get to the bottom of it.

115
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,009
His heart meridian!

116
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,290
Hurry, protect the heart meridian!

117
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,170
The wound has been attended to.

118
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,249
He stopped bleeding.

119
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,370
With his spirit power,

120
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,290
it shouldn't be happening.

121
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,209
The arrow is poisoned.

122
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,249
Medicine.

123
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:33,889
Medicine.

124
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,610
Not this one.

125
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,930
Fenglong, open your mouth.

126
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,129
Xiang Liu was determined

127
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,449
to kill His Majesty this time.

128
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:06,370
He used his blood as the poison.

129
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,449
How to detoxify it?

130
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,809
Xiang Liu consumes all kinds of poisons.

131
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:12,649
No poison in this world

132
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:13,769
can kill him now.

133
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:15,689
His blood

134
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,809
is the deadliest poison.

135
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,290
Even you can't detoxify it?

136
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,689
I made poison from all sorts

137
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:23,610
of spirit herbs

138
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,170
but nothing could poison him.

139
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:27,090
I can't detoxify

140
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,809
Xiang Liu's poison.

141
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:43,090
This poison is overbearing.

142
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:45,809
Even if you know what to do,

143
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:48,290
you have no time to make the pills.

144
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,530
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:53,170
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,530
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,850
Fenglong, I'm sorry.

148
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,050
Don't be like this.

149
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,170
Everybody dies.

150
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,370
It's much sooner than I expected.

151
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:14,410
But I've done

152
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,370
everything I wanted to do.

153
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,610
I have no regrets.

154
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:22,649
But I'm still worried about one person.

155
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:27,769
Fenglong, tell me.

156
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,129
I will do whatever you tell me to do.

157
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,410
Your Majesty, please spare Xinyue.

158
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:43,930
Xinyue

159
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,569
colluded with Tushan Hou

160
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,090
to kill Jing and Xiaoyao.

161
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:54,410
I guessed as much back at Qingshui Town

162
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:57,649
but I kept it to myself
for personal reasons.

163
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:00,329
I was too ashamed
to ask you for forgiveness.

164
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:05,050
But I'm really worried about Xinyue.

165
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,569
She seems to be clever,

166
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,490
but she's a silly girl.

167
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,009
Your Majesty, please.

168
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,329
Please.

169
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,410
You have my word.

170
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,129
I promise

171
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,530
I'll keep Chenrong Xinyue safe
her entire life.

172
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:43,569
Inside the Zijin Palace,

173
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,249
all the consorts will

174
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:49,410
hold her in high esteem.

175
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:54,610
Thank you, Your Majesty.

176
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,769
Thank you, Your Majesty.

177
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:02,129
In my lifetime,

178
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:06,610
only two people

179
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,410
offered me trust when I was

180
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,889
most vulnerable.

181
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,809
One was Xiaoyao.

182
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:15,329
The other was you.

183
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,050
Back at that moment,

184
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,649
what you offered
wasn't just your support,

185
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,090
but also your recognition
and trust in me.

186
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,090
I have never told you

187
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,530
how important you are to me.

188
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,170
An army is easy to obtain.

189
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,809
But a confidant is hard to find.

190
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,329
The journey of an emperor

191
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:45,449
is destined to be lonely.

192
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,209
I'm destined
to have no friends in my lifetime.

193
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:00,329
But deep down,

194
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:02,809
I've always regarded you

195
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,410
as a close friend.

196
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,689
Give up on Xiyan Mountain.

197
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,009
Go for Chenrong Mountain.

198
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,769
It wasn't me.

199
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,689
It was Jing.

200
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,290
Jing saw Your Majesty's talent

201
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,649
and convinced me to support you.

202
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,569
Jing united the Central Plains clans.

203
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:37,850
I...

204
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,930
I took all the credit.

205
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,449
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,610
Your Majesty.

207
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,370
Jing.

208
00:14:57,569 --> 00:14:59,009
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:22,850
Report.

210
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,249
General,

211
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,209
Hong Jiang

212
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,730
is launching a fierce attack.

213
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,050
They were shouting

214
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:32,850
that our general had died

215
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,850
to undermine our morale.

216
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:35,970
The front line...

217
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,569
The front line...

218
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:17,290
What about the front line?

219
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,129
The front line is almost lost.

220
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:23,889
They're requesting reinforcement.

221
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,769
You are our king.

222
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,209
How can you put yourself at risk?

223
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,490
That's right.

224
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:45,930
You can't put yourself at risk.

225
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,689
Prioritize the welfare of the kingdom.

226
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,569
Your Majesty.

227
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,970
Allow me to fight.

228
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,209
I will do my best

229
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,809
to stop Hong Jiang at all costs.

230
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:54,449
Our general died

231
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:56,649
and people lost morale.

232
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,290
If I do not lead the battle

233
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,170
and boost their morale,

234
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:02,290
our troops will
lose the battle in no time.

235
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,569
Isn't that what Xiang Liu wants?

236
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:05,770
Yu Jiang.

237
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,289
It's not that
you are less capable than me.

238
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,049
At this moment, only I can

239
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:14,049
keep our troops calm

240
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:15,569
and boost their morale.

241
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,850
Allow me to join you in battle.

242
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,130
Of course,

243
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:22,090
you will be of great help to me.

244
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,809
But Fenglong just passed away.

245
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,049
There are many affairs to be dealt with.

246
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:30,689
Your Majesty.

247
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,209
Please take General Yu Jiang

248
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,730
to the front line.

249
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,610
I'll be in charge here.

250
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:44,529
Yu Jiang.

251
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,250
Join me in battle.

252
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:47,809
Understood.

253
00:17:57,488 --> 00:17:58,130
Xiaoxiao.

254
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:00,409
Protect His Majesty.

255
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:01,648
Understood.

256
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,610
Miss.

257
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:31,809
You have been busy all day.

258
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:33,449
Get some rest.

259
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,809
You heard what Fenglong said today.

260
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,689
Yes, I did.

261
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,650
Chenrong Xinyue

262
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,169
deserves to die.

263
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:48,329
His Majesty promised Chief Chishui

264
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,250
to spare the Queen of Chenrong.

265
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,209
His Majesty had no choice.

266
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,289
If it hadn't been for Chief Chishui...

267
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,850
If it hadn't been for Fenglong,

268
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:02,970
the person lying in this coffin
would be Cang Xuan.

269
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:07,529
Miss Xiling.

270
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,850
We must find the mole.

271
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:10,970
If nobody leaked

272
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,049
His Majesty's whereabouts,

273
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:13,090
Xiang Liu wouldn't

274
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,370
have been so precise in timing.

275
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:15,610
Forgive me.

276
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,689
I can't kill Xiang Liu
to avenge Chief Chishui.

277
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:18,730
But we can't let

278
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,850
the mole escape.

279
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,289
If we don't find him before he

280
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,569
leaks more information,

281
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,010
His Majesty and Lord Yu Jiang

282
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:26,329
might be in danger.

283
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,049
Xiaoyao.

284
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,850
I won't let

285
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:43,090
this mole have another chance

286
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,169
to leak any information.

287
00:19:56,689 --> 00:19:57,490
Xiang Liu!

288
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,010
I know you can feel me.

289
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:01,890
Come out and see me.

290
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:17,890
Do you know?

291
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:20,010
If you kill Cang Xuan,

292
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,650
you don't just kill him.

293
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:24,209
You kill countless people

294
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,689
in the whole world.

295
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:30,490
So what?

296
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,890
Hong Jiang refuses to surrender

297
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,929
due to his loyalty,

298
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,329
which is admirable.

299
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:44,490
But man can't fight against

300
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,569
the tide of the era.

301
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:47,169
Now Chenrong,

302
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:49,929
Xiyan, and Haoling have been unified.

303
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,490
If you kill Cang Xuan,

304
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,529
Dahuang will surely fall apart

305
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,970
and there will be wars again.

306
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,209
Prioritize loyalty

307
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,289
over the greater good.

308
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,809
Is this how Hong Jiang

309
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,370
defines loyalty and righteousness?

310
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:07,409
If I manage to kill Cang Xuan,

311
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:11,569
then the unification
is not the real tide of the era.

312
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,730
How am I fighting against the tide?

313
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:17,970
You know very well

314
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,449
whether my argument makes sense.

315
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,130
You'll shoot me
with the archery skills I taught you?

316
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:31,890
Stop there.

317
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,730
I never thought
you'd seek revenge for Chishui Fenglong.

318
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:39,130
Why not marry him?

319
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:42,209
After all, Tushan Jing is dead.

320
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,289
Don't forget that

321
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:03,250
I am Xiang Liu with Nine Lives.

322
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,650
To kill me,

323
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:08,730
you must shoot a few more arrows

324
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,610
and aim better.

325
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,850
Aim right here.

326
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:21,250
Do you think I don't dare?

327
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,090
If you dare to
come after Cang Xuan again,

328
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,490
I swear I'll kill Hong Jiang.

329
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:01,850
You taught me the archery skill.

330
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,409
You taught me to kill.

331
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,130
You have tried my poison.

332
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,850
Many times.

333
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:11,090
It didn't do anything to you.

334
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:14,209
But it was enough for me

335
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:17,010
to kill Hong Jiang.

336
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,490
Did I say you could leave?

337
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:25,650
What else do you want?

338
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:28,490
Over the years,

339
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,730
you have received many favors from me.

340
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,010
Have you ever truly repaid me?

341
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:40,090
What do you want?

342
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,010
Your blood.

343
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,289
Your blood is a healing material.

344
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:06,610
There will be battles.

345
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,090
It does no harm

346
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:10,929
to make some pills.

347
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:11,809
Fine.

348
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,209
You can have it.

349
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:23,090
How much do you want?

350
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,770
As long as you're alive,

351
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,850
the more the better.

352
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:39,209
Do you think of everyone

353
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,689
as a pawn,

354
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,529
except for Hong Jiang?

355
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:50,770
They're either usable or useless,

356
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,650
nothing else.

357
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:58,370
I always heard people say that

358
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:02,289
Xiang Liu with Nine Lives
was cold-hearted and ruthless.

359
00:25:03,449 --> 00:25:04,250
I didn't believe it.

360
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:06,970
But now,

361
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:09,329
I do.

362
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,010
I am born as a cold-blooded demon.

363
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:22,770
It's not that I'm heartless.

364
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:26,809
It's just you being foolish.

365
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:30,090
I am the fool here.

366
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,529
Stand upright.

367
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,569
Is that enough?

368
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,449
I repaid your favors

369
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,850
with my blood.

370
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,689
After tonight,

371
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:34,970
we will be strangers.

372
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:38,809
In this lifetime,

373
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,850
I do not wish to see you again.

395

Xiaoyao.

396
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:15,090
Are you better?

397
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,289
How come you are here?

398
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:22,890
His Majesty summoned
Ru Shou and Qin Mang

399
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:24,010
to Qingshui Town.

400
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:25,970
Ru Shou was made the general

401
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,490
to annihilate the Chenrong rebels.

402
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,370
I heard about the assassination

403
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,250
and was worried.

404
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,209
So I came with Ru Shou.

405
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,770
I didn't expect

406
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,329
that I'd find you seriously injured.

407
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,049
I took it upon myself

408
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,049
to take you back for treatment.

409
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,650
What about Cang Xuan?

410
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,890
Rest assured.

411
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,689
Military affairs may be pressing,

412
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,209
but His Majesty is all right.

413
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,809
Ru Shou has taken over the work.

414
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:52,370
Once the troops are stabilized,

415
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:53,409
His Majesty

416
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:55,289
will take the coffin of Chief Chishui

417
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,569
back to Chenrong Mountain.

418
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,289
Good.

419
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:30,809
Xiaoyao found out about

420
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:32,169
what Chenrong Xinyue did.

421
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,449
I dare not

422
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,770
bring her back lest things go wrong.

423
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,449
Nian happened to be there.

424
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:41,209
So I told her to take Xiaoyao back

425
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,409
to Xiyan Mountain
while she was unconscious.

426
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:46,689
How did Xiaoyao get hurt?

427
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:49,329
Miao Pu said Xiaoyao shook her off

428
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:50,730
and sneaked out.

429
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,169
Xiaoyao had already lost consciousness

430
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,250
by the time she found her.

431
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,289
There were no signs of a fight.

432
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:00,650
Most likely,

433
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,169
it had something to do with Xiang Liu.

434
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,730
The death of Fenglong

435
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,130
may not be entirely bad
for the overall situation.

436
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:14,209
But

437
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,850
when he was alive,

438
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,010
you could treat Xinyue
however you wanted.

439
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:22,010
Now that he's gone,

440
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,449
you must treat her well.

441
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:27,929
I have promised Fenglong

442
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,209
to treat Chenrong Xinyue well

443
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:34,090
and ensure her safety for a lifetime.

444
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,169
(Chenrong Xinyue,
the Queen, is born into)

445
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,610
(a distinguished family.)

446
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:42,250
(Virtuous, graceful,)

447
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:43,650
(and well-mannered,)

448
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,809
(she promotes elegance)

449
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,929
(and sets a fine example for all.)

450
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,490
(I hereby
bestow upon her a pearl crown,)

451
00:32:50,689 --> 00:32:52,049
(a pair of jade pendants,)

452
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,370
(a set of white jade
cloud-patterned earrings,)

453
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,770
(a gold scepter with a cloud motif,)

454
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,890
(and a gold heart-shaped talisman.)

455
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,169
(With this honorary seal,)

456
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:03,610
(I wish her everlasting prosperity.)

457
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:05,130
(Let it be decreed.)

458
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,130
(These)

459
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:15,010
(are the things I have)

460
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,010
(coveted wholeheartedly)

461
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,929
(and clung to all these years?)

462
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:24,370
(I know you're)

463
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,370
(having a hard time.)

464
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:27,250
(Please put up with it.)

465
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,490
(Wait until I return from the war.)

466
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,850
(Even if you don't want me
as your brother,)

467
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,449
(we're bound by blood.)

468
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:39,289
(You'll always be my sister.)

469
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:45,370
Linglan.

470
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:47,650
My brother

471
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,809
is dead.

472
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:57,970
Your Majesty.

473
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,970
For a narrow-minded woman

474
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,890
like me,

475
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,890
who coveted power and status,

476
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:14,610
my brother...

477
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,090
My brother died.

478
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:31,850
Your Majesty.

479
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:39,610
Your Majesty, no.

480
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,289
To win the heart

481
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:56,410
of a man who never cared about me,

482
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,049
I lost my pride

483
00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:00,529
and my freedom.

484
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:04,569
I became despicable and narrow-minded.

485
00:35:05,249 --> 00:35:06,569
I even made my brother

486
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:09,850
die for me.

487
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:13,650
He was the only one who truly

488
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:17,370
cared about me.

489
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:24,289
I will not do anything foolish.

490
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:28,049
My brother secured

491
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:31,329
my position as the queen
at the cost of his life.

492
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,690
From now on,

493
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,650
I will be a decent queen,

494
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,410
not of Xiyan Cang Xuan,

495
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:49,329
but of the Chenrong
and Chishui families.

496
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,370
Tushan Jing.

497
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:15,650
(Give up on Xiyan Mountain.)

498
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,930
(Go for Chenrong Mountain.)

499
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:19,969
(It wasn't me.)

500
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:21,610
(It was Jing.)

501
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,410
(Jing saw Your Majesty's talent)

502
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,650
(and convinced me to support you.)

503
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,529
(Jing united the Central Plains clans.)

504
00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:33,170
(I...)

505
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,170
(I took all the credit.)

506
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,370
(Your Majesty.)

507
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:41,249
(I'm sorry.)

508
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:44,529
Sang.

509
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,489
Sang, bring me wine.

510
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,130
Tushan Jing.

511
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:23,529
No matter what,

512
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:24,850
thank you for your help.

513
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,410
Don't worry.

514
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,090
A tall tree is bound

515
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,329
to attract phoenixes.

516
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,249
(I hope a phoenix)

517
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,569
(can notice)

518
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:34,569
(this swaying tall tree.)

519
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,969
Tushan Jing.

520
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,850
Jun Yi.

521
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:18,249
Jun Yi.

522
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:21,249
Your Majesty.

523
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:23,450
Where is Lirong Chang?

524
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:25,049
Chief Lirong is still at sea.

525
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:26,090
He's taking the fleet

526
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,610
to search for Tushan Jing.

527
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,329
Still no news?

528
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:31,809
Not yet.

529
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,650
Tell him to keep searching.

530
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:39,090
Keep searching at all costs.

531
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,650
Bring him to me.

532
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:42,930
Dead

533
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:45,890
or alive.

534
00:38:47,009 --> 00:38:47,930
Understood.

535
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:24,769
Mother said that

536
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,569
I should repay the kindness

537
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:33,969
and take revenge accordingly.

538
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,090
I can distinguish

539
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:42,009
between gratitude and grudges

540
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:45,170
to give out rewards and punishments.

541
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,489
My conscience is clear.

542
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,729
My conscience is clear.

543
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:16,112
(Mount Jade)

544
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:21,930
Xiang Liu.

545
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:24,090
I have brought Xiaoyao here

546
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,610
as you requested.

547
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,930
You indeed kept your promise.

548
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,809
What are you up to?

549
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:08,529
You fool.

550
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,890
How dare you plant
the love poisonous bug

551
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:19,049
that binds our lives together?

552
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,890
The parasol trees grow old together.

553
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:26,569
The lovebirds never fly alone.

554
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:30,450
The Mandarin ducks die in pairs.

555
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,130
The love poisonous bug

556
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:38,049
is not removable.

557
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,569
I was able to help Cang Xuan remove it

558
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:43,809
because he hadn't

559
00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:45,410
planted it willingly.

560
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:47,529
You didn't actually

561
00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:48,890
plant the bug in him.

562
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:52,170
But I willingly

563
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,850
let you plant it in me.
