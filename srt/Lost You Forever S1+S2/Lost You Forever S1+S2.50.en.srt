=Lost You Forever S2=

2
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:32,720
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:36,874
Once, I was starving.

4
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:39,075
One of my heads

5
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:41,594
almost

6
00:01:41,594 --> 00:01:43,155
ate another one.

7
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:47,954
Really?

8
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:52,634
No.

9
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:53,834
You...

10
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:59,115
Someone once told me

11
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:02,634
that humans are strange.

12
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:05,115
They have to figure out

13
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:06,715
if they're happy or in pain

14
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:09,355
through comparison with others.

15
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:12,034
So I told you

16
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:14,914
about my miserable past
for your comparison

17
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:16,795
so that you realize

18
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:19,075
that you're just fine.

19
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:21,595
But I didn't lie.

20
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,114
I did crawl out of an egg.

21
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:29,114
I don't know my parents.

22
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:31,795
I do have nine heads.

23
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:34,315
As for the rest...

24
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:37,274
As for the rest,

25
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:39,754
I got carried away.

26
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,075
What did I say?

27
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:52,034
Do you need me to tell you more

28
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:53,595
about my tragic past

29
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:55,435
to make you think

30
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:57,634
that having a devil as a father

31
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:58,875
is actually not so bad?

32
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:01,634
No need.

33
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:06,834
Be it you deities,

34
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:07,955
or we demons,

35
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:11,995
no one can choose their origin.

36
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:15,595
So,

37
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,114
why get hung up on something

38
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,394
that happened before you were born?

39
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,955
Hong Jiang was Chenrong's general.

40
00:03:30,515 --> 00:03:31,795
When you followed him,

41
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:33,914
did you see Chi Chen?

42
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:38,384
No.

43
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,355
Chi Chen had died before I followed

44
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:45,274
my foster father.

45
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:48,834
It's said that Chi Chen was cunning

46
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:51,955
and heartless.

47
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:54,914
But why did he

48
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:56,554
insist on taking the path

49
00:03:58,315 --> 00:03:59,875
that was a dead end?

50
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:04,355
The war lasted for over 100 years

51
00:04:05,674 --> 00:04:06,674
with huge casualties.

52
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,795
Perhaps,

53
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:14,634
rather than living in pain
and mourning for

54
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:15,554
his people,

55
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:19,035
it was better to die.

56
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,234
For a general,

57
00:04:27,035 --> 00:04:28,315
the best end

58
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:31,995
is to die in battle.

59
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:40,475
What about you?

60
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:43,794
Why did you choose Hong Jiang?

61
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,954
Just because he was your foster father?

62
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:53,755
It's not just that.

63
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:55,954
There were also those who had

64
00:04:58,475 --> 00:04:59,995
fought alongside me.

65
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:02,755
We fought together,

66
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:05,674
drank together,

67
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:10,234
and we gathered our comrades' remains.

68
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:14,755
It's been centuries.

69
00:05:16,554 --> 00:05:18,554
Their bodies
have long since turned to dust.

70
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:26,155
But I have nine heads.

71
00:05:28,435 --> 00:05:30,475
It's impossible to forget something.

72
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:33,234
Even now,

73
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:36,074
I remember their voices

74
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:40,834
and faces.

75
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,155
My mother once told me

76
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:52,234
that there are things we must hold on to

77
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:54,954
even at the cost

78
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:57,875
of our lives.

79
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:01,954
Fourth Uncle abandoned
Auntie and Cang Xuan.

80
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,554
My mother abandoned me.

81
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:09,435
If they were not my relatives,

82
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:12,035
I would find them awe-inspiring.

83
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:16,954
But as a daughter,

84
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:21,794
no matter how awe-inspiring
my mother might be,

85
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:26,635
I don't want to forgive her.

86
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:48,114
What are you doing?

87
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:06,995
Tushan Jing.

88
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,384
(Slaying mighty foes)

89
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:26,234
Xiaoyao.

90
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:27,914
Take a closer look.

91
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:39,408
(Annihilating the nobles,
Protecting the Central Plains)

92
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:48,336
(Assuming great responsibility,
Abandoning personal feelings)

93
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:56,784
(Living up to the expectations
of the people and their loved ones)

94
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:17,635
I believe

95
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:20,714
that Xiang Liu's speculation
is the truth.

96
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,995
Your father did not betray your mother.

97
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:28,674
Nor did your mother

98
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:29,875
let your father down.

99
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:33,034
It's just

100
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:35,354
that as the great general of Chenrong,

101
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,275
and the general of Xiyan,

102
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:42,034
they had no choice in that chaotic era.

103
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:44,240
(Abandoning personal feelings)

104
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,416
(Living up to the expectations
of the people and their loved ones)

105
00:10:48,435 --> 00:10:50,075
They died

106
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,955
to live up to the expectations
of the people and their loved ones.

107
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:00,674
But they gave birth to me.

108
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:02,755
Why didn't they raise me?

109
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:07,594
Before they died,

110
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:11,315
didn't they think of me?

111
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:15,635
Weren't they worried

112
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,714
that I would be hunted down,

113
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:21,435
become homeless,

114
00:11:22,554 --> 00:11:24,395
and be tormented in a cage

115
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:27,315
by a nine-tailed fox?

116
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:34,154
Xuan.

117
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,354
I'm back.

118
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:36,594
Is it cold outside?

119
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,320
I asked Miao Pu to make you
some chicken soup.

120
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:39,635
Have it to warm yourself up.

121
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:40,395
No need.

122
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,714
It's not very cold.

123
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:44,635
Head back and have a rest.

124
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:45,755
Don't worry about me.

125
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:46,794
I'm fine.

126
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:49,955
Princess.

127
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:51,075
Have some hot soup.

128
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:55,075
I deserve to die.

129
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:00,594
You don't deserve to die.

130
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:03,395
I do.

131
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:07,914
Don't call me Princess anymore.

132
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:14,755
Remove the chessboard.

133
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,995
And bring some wine.

134
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:18,195
Yes.

135
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,515
Princess,

136
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,154
it's getting late.

137
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:33,234
Have a drink.

138
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:37,995
You know I'm not a princess.

139
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:40,034
But you're joining them

140
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:40,835
to bully me?

141
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,594
Why aren't you a princess?

142
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,794
Tomorrow, I can appoint you

143
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:46,395
as the Princess of Xiyan.

144
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:48,594
Let alone a princess,

145
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,435
you can be a lord

146
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:50,794
if you want to.

147
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:53,195
Feel free to pick a spot

148
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:54,114
under my reign.

149
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:54,875
It will be yours.

150
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:56,474
Xuan.

151
00:13:57,154 --> 00:13:58,594
Can you stop making trouble?

152
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:07,674
Do you really care
whether you are a princess?

153
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:11,234
You know very well

154
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:14,256
that I don't care about the identity,

155
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:14,835
but...

156
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:16,554
You care that Auntie deceived you

157
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:18,195
over and over again.

158
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:23,395
Auntie promised to go back to you

159
00:14:23,955 --> 00:14:25,154
but she never did.

160
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,515
Auntie knew who your father was,

161
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:29,114
but never told you the truth.

162
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:32,075
Even though they were

163
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:33,075
your own parents,

164
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:35,474
you knew nothing about

165
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:37,075
their past.

166
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:43,315
I have always wondered

167
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:48,034
who dared to seal
the Rejuvenating Flower

168
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:49,914
within me,

169
00:14:50,714 --> 00:14:52,794
making me a faceless person.

170
00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:56,554
It turned out to be my mother.

171
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:01,034
She wanted to hide my appearance.

172
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:06,114
She even tried to
deceive me about my looks.

173
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:22,794
Both our mothers are heartless.

174
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,315
Do you still hate your mother?

175
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:33,075
Not anymore.

176
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:37,354
But I often dream of her

177
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,835
committing suicide before my eyes.

178
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:44,835
I've become the ruler of a kingdom.

179
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:49,835
But whenever I wake up from a nightmare,

180
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:52,835
I still feel helpless

181
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:55,354
and desperate.

182
00:15:58,714 --> 00:15:59,594
Me too.

183
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:09,154
Every time I dream of my mother,

184
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:12,674
no matter how happy it starts,

185
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:16,034
in the end,

186
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:19,515
I always see her in her armor

187
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:20,955
walking away from me.

188
00:16:22,794 --> 00:16:25,554
I always call out to her from behind.

189
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:27,315
No matter how loudly I shout,

190
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:29,515
she keeps walking away

191
00:16:30,995 --> 00:16:32,034
and never turns back.

192
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:35,315
People think that Princess General

193
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:37,075
chose righteousness over life.

194
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,354
But the image of her

195
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:42,315
walking away with her back at me

196
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:46,315
is a life-long pain for me.

197
00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:48,794
People think

198
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:54,275
that my mother had a deep affection
for my father and followed him

199
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,474
to the afterworld.

200
00:16:58,914 --> 00:17:01,594
But what I couldn't get out of my mind
was the moment

201
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:05,755
she pushed me away

202
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:09,314
and plunged the dagger

203
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,635
into her own chest.

204
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:18,155
If she could die for my father,

205
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:22,635
why couldn't she live for me?

206
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:44,395
Mother.

207
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:48,875
Mother, I don't want to
go to Mount Jade.

208
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:53,035
I want to go home and find Xuan.

209
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:58,035
I don't want to go to Mount Jade.

210
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:03,035
I want to go home...

211
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:05,395
Xuan.

212
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:35,434
Don't be afraid.

213
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,954
Your brother has grown up.

214
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:42,675
No one can

215
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:44,635
take you away from me.

216
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:49,035
No one will dare to hurt you.

217
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:27,795
This stack of memorials

218
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:29,434
is all about the Great Princess.

219
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:31,555
It calls for celebration.

220
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:33,635
Haoling has been

221
00:19:34,114 --> 00:19:36,035
prosperous through proper governance.

222
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:38,035
The ministers have nothing to do

223
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:41,035
and can only comment
on my family affairs.

224
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:43,234
There are rumors everywhere

225
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:45,714
that the Great Princess disrupts
the bloodline of Haoling royal family

226
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:46,995
and she's a disgrace to Haoling.

227
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:49,155
They hope you can punish her severely.

228
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:49,834
Father.

229
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,314
The rumors are becoming outrageous.

230
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:52,434
You must do something.

231
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:53,314
Like what?

232
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,114
Summon the elders of the Lirong Family

233
00:19:55,314 --> 00:19:56,354
to perform rituals on the altar

234
00:19:56,515 --> 00:19:57,594
to prove Xiaoyao's identity,

235
00:19:57,755 --> 00:19:59,434
so that those idling ministers

236
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:00,714
stop spreading rumors.

237
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:02,594
Good idea.

238
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:05,275
Ru Shou.

239
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:07,114
Why are you silent?

240
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:08,555
Master.

241
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:10,915
There's something fishy about this.

242
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:13,194
Cang Xuan holds great power

243
00:20:13,314 --> 00:20:14,234
as the new king.

244
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:15,275
How come

245
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:16,915
he can't suppress such trivial rumors?

246
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:18,114
That's right.

247
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:20,155
There is something fishy.

248
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:21,635
I don't care if it's fishy.

249
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:22,635
Father.

250
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:24,314
Prove that Xiaoyao is your daughter

251
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:25,314
to make them shut up.

252
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:26,555
I can't prove it.

253
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:28,875
Because Xiaoyao

254
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:33,035
is indeed not my daughter.

255
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:35,314
How is that possible?

256
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:37,795
Guiwen.

257
00:20:38,074 --> 00:20:39,114
Convey my decree.

258
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:40,555
Lady Jiuyao is not

259
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,555
a descendant
of the Haoling royal family.

260
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:44,275
Proclaim to all

261
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,314
that I revoke her title
and clan membership

262
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:48,875
right now.

263
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:50,275
Yes.

264
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:50,834
Father.

265
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:51,915
What are you doing?

266
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:52,635
Even if my sister...

267
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:54,755
Even if Xiaoyao is not
your biological daughter,

268
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:55,675
she has been

269
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:56,995
your daughter for years.

270
00:20:57,035 --> 00:20:58,635
Don't you feel sorry for her?

271
00:20:58,954 --> 00:20:59,995
Why are you hitting her

272
00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:00,875
when she's down

273
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,995
instead of helping her?

274
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:02,714
Nian.

275
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:08,834
Father.

276
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,795
Xiaoyao is...

277
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:11,434
Master.

278
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:14,114
I take my leave.

279
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:41,995
(Heng.)

280
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:45,395
(I didn't fail
your and Qingyang's trust.)

281
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:47,395
(I brought up)

282
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:50,714
(Cang Xuan very well.)

283
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:05,035
Your Majesty.

284
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:06,515
Your Majesty.

285
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:08,395
What's the fuss?

286
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:14,114
All of you, leave.

287
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:21,434
The King of Haoling
announced that Haoling Jiuyao...

288
00:22:22,714 --> 00:22:23,280
No.

289
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:25,635
We should address her as Jiuyao now.

290
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:27,354
She is not of royal blood

291
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:29,395
and has been removed
from the royal clan.

292
00:22:30,074 --> 00:22:31,675
Heaven blesses Chishui and Chenrong.

293
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:33,074
If Chief had married

294
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:34,474
this false princess,

295
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:36,434
it would be a real disgrace.

296
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:39,074
Now that her reputation is tarnished

297
00:22:39,194 --> 00:22:40,434
by her unclear lineage,

298
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:43,314
she can marry
Chief Tushan as a concubine.

299
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:44,995
Even if Miss Jiuyao is not

300
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:46,395
the daughter of the King of Haoling,

301
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:48,795
she's greatly valued

302
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:50,114
by the Great Emperor and His Majesty.

303
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,155
If you talk nonsense

304
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:53,915
like this,

305
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:56,354
you'll get Her Majesty in trouble.

306
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,834
I apologize.

307
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:00,234
We're the only ones here.

308
00:23:00,434 --> 00:23:01,314
What can go wrong?

309
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:02,275
You may leave.

310
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:04,048
Yes.

311
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:05,395
Even if Xiaoyao is no longer

312
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:06,635
the Princess of Haoling,

313
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:09,114
she's valued by those two rulers

314
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:10,434
on Chenrong Mountain.

315
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:12,834
I know you're

316
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:14,995
holding a grudge against her

317
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:16,275
because of me.

318
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:18,755
But I have let go of what happened

319
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:20,474
on my wedding day.

320
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,515
Why would you hold onto it?

321
00:23:24,354 --> 00:23:25,474
Do you know who's been

322
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,515
fanning the flames to reveal the truth

323
00:23:27,954 --> 00:23:29,354
about Xiaoyao?

324
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:31,954
Isn't it you?

325
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:35,234
The Tushan Family
has joined forces with the Xiling

326
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:37,275
and Guifang families
to apply pressure on us.

327
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:39,755
One runs a petty business.

328
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:41,635
One has declined.

329
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,434
One sneaks around.

330
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:45,915
How dare they stand against

331
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:46,915
our families?

332
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:47,795
What a pity

333
00:23:48,074 --> 00:23:49,915
that you only look clever.

334
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,474
So it wasn't you?

335
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,275
But only His Majesty, you, and I

336
00:23:55,275 --> 00:23:58,714
know about the assassination of Xiaoyao
by Mu Fei and others back then.

337
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:00,434
Even Father was kept in the dark.

338
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:01,834
Yeah.

339
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:03,354
Apart from you and me,

340
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:05,114
His Majesty knows as well.

341
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:06,714
His...

342
00:24:07,675 --> 00:24:09,275
His Majesty spread the rumor?

343
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:11,035
His Majesty did this.

344
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:12,995
So when Jing suspected you,

345
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:14,474
I couldn't even defend you

346
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:15,834
and had to acquiesce.

347
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:16,714
Don't be absurd.

348
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:18,555
I can't wait

349
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:20,155
for Tushan Jing to marry Xiaoyao.

350
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:22,555
Yet he suspected me
of ruining his good deed.

351
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:23,354
Xinyue.

352
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:26,114
His Majesty went to great lengths

353
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,155
and did what seemed absurd

354
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:29,995
to care about Xiaoyao.

355
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:32,194
It shows how much she matters to him.

356
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,594
Do not act on a whim anymore

357
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:35,954
and displease him.

358
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:42,354
I am tired.

359
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:43,995
Linglan.

360
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:46,795
Escort Chief Chishui out.

361
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:51,035
Xinyue.

362
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:58,194
I take my leave.

363
00:25:16,555 --> 00:25:17,194
Miao Pu.

364
00:25:18,594 --> 00:25:20,474
These letters are from Father...

365
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:25,354
I mean, the King of Haoling.

366
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:28,555
Take them away and burn them.

367
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:32,395
Miss.

368
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:34,035
But...

369
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:36,234
Give them to me.

370
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:50,995
He doesn't want me anymore.

371
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:52,555
Why should I hold on to

372
00:25:52,555 --> 00:25:53,915
these letters shamelessly?

373
00:26:11,995 --> 00:26:12,795
What are you doing?

374
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:14,074
Don't move.

375
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:19,755
You seem to hold nothing.

376
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:21,354
But don't deny the process

377
00:26:21,354 --> 00:26:22,354
because of the outcome.

378
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:23,995
You did have

379
00:26:23,995 --> 00:26:25,795
a handful of water just now.

380
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:32,194
Yeah.

381
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:36,594
I can't deny
that Father once doted on me

382
00:26:38,035 --> 00:26:39,795
despite what's going on.

383
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:43,354
He gave me everything

384
00:26:43,555 --> 00:26:44,915
a father could offer.

385
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:50,395
These are

386
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:51,795
what you once had for real.

387
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:58,314
The Central Plains will accept Xiaoyao

388
00:26:58,314 --> 00:27:00,155
as long as the Xiling family
approves of her.

389
00:27:00,155 --> 00:27:01,234
Why bother?

390
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,834
Xiyan is the most distinguished surname.

391
00:27:05,114 --> 00:27:07,755
As long as she takes the surname Xiyan,

392
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,954
who dares to lay a hand on her?

393
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:13,354
Let me take a look.

394
00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:16,515
Who in the world doesn't know

395
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:18,834
that Xiaoyao is
Princess General's daughter?

396
00:27:19,434 --> 00:27:21,074
All those old clans

397
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,395
have followed you
and Grandmother in battles.

398
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:24,954
Even if they hate Chi Chen,

399
00:27:24,954 --> 00:27:25,954
they wouldn't

400
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:28,395
act against the daughter
of the deceased Princess General.

401
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:31,344
But it's different with the clans
in the Central Plains.

402
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:32,354
How so?

403
00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:36,074
Do they dare
to act against my granddaughter?

404
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:36,875
Grandfather.

405
00:27:37,194 --> 00:27:38,954
Let me take charge for once, okay?

406
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:40,074
No.

407
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:44,555
Xiaoyao.

408
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:46,155
Come here.

409
00:27:50,954 --> 00:27:52,114
You've arrived just in time.

410
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:54,795
I can't convince you, Grandfather.

411
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:56,234
Let her choose.

412
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:58,194
Xiaoyao.

413
00:27:58,675 --> 00:27:59,915
Isn't Jing here?

414
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:02,434
Won't you discuss it with him?

415
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:03,354
Grandfather.

416
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:06,995
What does it have to do with him?

417
00:28:11,594 --> 00:28:13,515
You tell me.

418
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:15,915
What kind of grandfather are you?

419
00:28:15,915 --> 00:28:18,035
Won't you help your own grandson?

420
00:28:18,194 --> 00:28:19,474
Are you my grandfather or not?

421
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:20,114
Alright.

422
00:28:21,354 --> 00:28:22,594
When did I ever say

423
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,354
that I want a surname?

424
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:26,675
Can't I have a name without a surname?

425
00:28:26,795 --> 00:28:27,834
- No.
- No.

426
00:28:32,314 --> 00:28:32,834
See?

427
00:28:33,234 --> 00:28:34,074
Grandfather does

428
00:28:34,074 --> 00:28:35,194
side with you.

429
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:38,515
Xiling, Xiyan.

430
00:28:38,755 --> 00:28:39,594
You choose one.

431
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:43,275
I'll go for Xiling.

432
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,834
(Jiuyao, daughter of Xiling Heng,)

433
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:02,834
(Princess General of Xiyan,)

434
00:29:03,114 --> 00:29:04,434
(is kind and graceful.)

435
00:29:04,714 --> 00:29:05,995
(She dwells in benevolence)

436
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:07,474
(and upholds virtue.)

437
00:29:08,074 --> 00:29:10,834
(I hereby announce to all)

438
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:13,474
(that I bestow upon Jiuyao
the surname Xiling and allow her)

439
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:15,395
(to reside on Chenrong Mountain.)

440
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,275
Are you worried about Shan Hu?

441
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,234
I want to send her back to Haoling.

442
00:29:31,155 --> 00:29:33,555
But the people of Haoling
see me as a disgrace.

443
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:36,114
She may be implicated

444
00:29:36,434 --> 00:29:37,194
and life may be

445
00:29:37,555 --> 00:29:38,875
difficult for her there.

446
00:29:39,915 --> 00:29:41,155
She can choose to stay

447
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:42,834
if she is alone.

448
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:45,675
But she has a brother and a sister.

449
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:47,635
Her brother is in the army.

450
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,035
Her sister is married.

451
00:29:50,194 --> 00:29:51,314
Leaving her in Xiyan

452
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:53,194
is not good for her and her family.

453
00:29:53,915 --> 00:29:55,954
You have looked into everything.

454
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,434
I bet you've come up with something.

455
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:02,875
My family does many businesses
in Haoling.

456
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,755
Jewelry and spice are favored

457
00:30:04,755 --> 00:30:05,555
by female customers

458
00:30:06,114 --> 00:30:07,194
and we need a female manager.

459
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,354
Shan Hu has seen tons of treasure

460
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:10,834
in the palace throughout the years.

461
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:13,035
She can manage the jewelry business.

462
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,314
And she's supported
by the Tushan family.

463
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:17,314
People wouldn't dare to bother her.

464
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:18,834
Okay.

465
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:20,755
Let's do as you say.

466
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:22,675
Thank you so much

467
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:24,155
for being so considerate.

468
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:26,555
It's a huge relief for me.

469
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,515
Thank you, Chief Tushan.

470
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:36,755
Many things happened.

471
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,194
There's something
you might not have noticed.

472
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:40,314
What is it?

473
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,474
Fangfeng Yiying has left Qingqiu

474
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:43,795
to live in seclusion.

475
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:46,314
The elders announced

476
00:30:46,314 --> 00:30:47,635
that Fangfeng Yiying

477
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:48,635
died of a lasting illness.

478
00:30:49,354 --> 00:30:50,194
One year later,

479
00:30:50,954 --> 00:30:52,194
I can get married again.

480
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,755
Do you know why I chose
the surname Xiling?

481
00:30:56,594 --> 00:30:57,200
Why?

482
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,434
Xiyan is too prestigious.

483
00:30:59,915 --> 00:31:01,795
Xiling and Tushan

484
00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:03,594
are well-matched.

485
00:31:18,954 --> 00:31:21,594
These lychees are brought
from Haoling, right?

486
00:31:22,635 --> 00:31:23,234
That's right.

487
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:24,594
I have my caravan

488
00:31:24,594 --> 00:31:25,395
bring back quite a few.

489
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:27,275
There are some left
from ones sent to the palace.

490
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:28,675
I'll send them

491
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:29,915
to you if you like.

492
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:31,714
You're too kind.

493
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:33,995
It's nothing.

494
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:35,875
Xiyan has good relations with Haoling.

495
00:31:36,114 --> 00:31:37,314
It's easy transportation.

496
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:38,314
I appreciate it.

497
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:46,234
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

498
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:46,992
Please sit.

499
00:31:47,194 --> 00:31:48,875
Today, I've summoned you here

500
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:50,474
to discuss something.

501
00:31:51,194 --> 00:31:53,474
What would Your Majesty like to discuss?

502
00:31:53,555 --> 00:31:54,995
I plan to send troops to Haoling.

503
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:00,240
Your Majesty.

504
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:01,995
Haoling features water.

505
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:03,954
Our troops are not adept
at naval warfare.

506
00:32:04,074 --> 00:32:05,314
I'm afraid they'll be...

507
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:06,000
Fenglong.

508
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:07,675
How is the naval training going?

509
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:08,555
Your Majesty.

510
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:10,875
Our 400,000 naval troops
have been trained

511
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:11,915
and are ready to serve.

512
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:14,434
Four hundred thousand naval troops?

513
00:32:14,915 --> 00:32:15,875
When did that happen?

514
00:32:16,354 --> 00:32:16,954
Your Majesty.

515
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:18,915
Haoling is powerful and prosperous

516
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:19,834
with a strong military.

517
00:32:20,234 --> 00:32:21,354
I'm afraid

518
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:23,714
it won't be easy to conquer it.

519
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,155
The consumption of provisions
will be enormous.

520
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:29,675
We should take our time
for proper preparation.

521
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:31,834
I have given orders
to complete the provision preparation.

522
00:32:32,114 --> 00:32:34,395
The current stock
in the warehouses is enough

523
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:36,155
to sustain 400,000 troops.

524
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,035
Feel free to speak.

525
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:40,395
The King of Haoling

526
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:41,515
brought you up

527
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:42,755
as your mentor.

528
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:44,314
Will you be criticized

529
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:46,064
if you start a war against Haoling?

530
00:32:46,275 --> 00:32:48,074
The King of Haoling and I

531
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:48,995
have a personal bond.

532
00:32:49,515 --> 00:32:50,755
But the war between

533
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:53,114
Xiyan and Haoling is a state affair.

534
00:32:53,594 --> 00:32:54,875
As long as we intend to unite

535
00:32:54,915 --> 00:32:57,234
Dahuang under my reign,

536
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:59,995
the war between Xiyan
and Haoling is inevitable.

537
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:01,434
As the King of Xiyan,

538
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,234
I won't shirk my responsibilities

539
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,875
due to personal matters.

540
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,275
I volunteer to be

541
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:10,434
the general

542
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:11,834
to share your burden.

543
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:15,920
- I wish to share your burden.
- I wish to share your burden.

544
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:20,234
- We are at Your Majesty's disposal.
- We are at Your Majesty's disposal.

545
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:21,714
Alright then.

546
00:33:22,395 --> 00:33:23,555
Let's discuss

547
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:24,675
the deployment of troops.

548
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,888
(Caoao Range, Chenrong Mountain)

549
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:54,714
I plan to propose to Xiaoyao here.

550
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:08,194
How should I decorate this place?

551
00:34:11,595 --> 00:34:13,394
Your prescription is alright.

552
00:34:13,474 --> 00:34:15,555
But the main ingredient

553
00:34:15,795 --> 00:34:17,234
grows in the deep mountains

554
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:18,355
and not here.

555
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:20,035
Your medicine will be costly.

556
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:21,315
Treating patients

557
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:22,874
has to be effective.

558
00:34:23,234 --> 00:34:24,434
Your medicine works slowly

559
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,914
and it hinders the appetite.

560
00:34:26,075 --> 00:34:27,154
Your medicine indeed

561
00:34:27,154 --> 00:34:28,634
works fast with few side effects.

562
00:34:28,874 --> 00:34:30,434
But the poor people can't afford it.

563
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,595
My medicine can save more lives.

564
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:34,234
They can make money afterward.

565
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:35,394
But the patients must be cured

566
00:34:35,434 --> 00:34:36,394
as fast as possible.

567
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,234
What about

568
00:34:37,434 --> 00:34:38,874
their family's livelihood?

569
00:34:39,115 --> 00:34:40,474
My prescription is more practical.

570
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:41,795
Mine is better.

571
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:42,874
Mine is better.

572
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:43,595
Mine is better.

573
00:34:43,595 --> 00:34:44,515
Mine is more practical.

574
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:45,434
Mine is better.

575
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:47,515
Why are you so happy?

576
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,474
Everything has been going smoothly.

577
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,755
Something happy is about to happen.

578
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:55,115
I wake up laughing from my dreams.

579
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:56,755
What's the happy thing?

580
00:34:57,154 --> 00:34:57,954
Of course, it is

581
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,536
Miss Xiaoyao and Chief Tushan's wedding.

582
00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:01,194
All those troublesome matters

583
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:02,154
have been resolved.

584
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:03,995
Miss Xiaoyao has nothing to worry about.

585
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,434
The two of them are busy being sweet.

586
00:35:06,714 --> 00:35:08,674
They will surely
discuss the wedding soon.

587
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:10,234
You should prepare

588
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:10,954
her dowry now

589
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,035
to not be late.

590
00:35:12,115 --> 00:35:12,914
Don't talk nonsense.

591
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:17,515
What did I say?

592
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,355
- My prescription is better.
- My prescription is better.

593
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:24,995
Mine is better.

594
00:35:24,995 --> 00:35:25,835
Mine is practical.

595
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:26,595
Mine is better.

596
00:35:29,115 --> 00:35:29,714
Grandfather.

597
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:30,995
Be the judge.

598
00:35:31,315 --> 00:35:32,515
Whose prescription is better?

599
00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:35,555
You've been arguing until now.

600
00:35:35,555 --> 00:35:36,674
Haven't you realized

601
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:39,154
that both of your prescriptions
have their shortcomings?

602
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:41,714
The best prescription

603
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:43,954
is not determined by
your medical skills,

604
00:35:44,194 --> 00:35:47,275
but by the patient's family.

605
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:48,795
Wealthy families

606
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:50,194
will use Yin's prescription.

607
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:51,555
Poor families

608
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:52,714
will use yours.

609
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:55,515
It's certainly important to be cured.

610
00:35:55,795 --> 00:35:58,914
But the livelihood
of a family also matters.

611
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:02,234
You can't cure the patient

612
00:36:02,914 --> 00:36:04,035
and let his family starve.

613
00:36:04,315 --> 00:36:04,914
Right?

614
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:09,355
You are right.

615
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:12,075
My patients are nobles.

616
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:13,995
I never realized that some patients

617
00:36:14,194 --> 00:36:15,555
couldn't afford the medicine.

618
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:19,634
I have been too focused
on using local herbs.

619
00:36:20,154 --> 00:36:22,234
A good prescription depends not only on

620
00:36:22,234 --> 00:36:23,434
the patient's financial situation,

621
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,234
but also where the patient is from.

622
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:29,515
When I was running a clinic in Haoling,

623
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:31,755
most of my patients were fishermen.

624
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:33,795
I gave prescriptions based on

625
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:34,995
the Herbal Encyclopedia.

626
00:36:35,515 --> 00:36:36,355
They worked well.

627
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:39,154
But this prescription
came from the Central Plains.

628
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:40,914
They didn't know it
and couldn't afford it.

629
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:43,315
So I started using local herbs.

630
00:36:43,714 --> 00:36:44,304
As expected,

631
00:36:44,515 --> 00:36:45,835
it was much more popular

632
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:46,674
than the previous ones.

633
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:49,714
The natural environment

634
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:52,115
varies throughout Dahuang.

635
00:36:52,714 --> 00:36:55,434
The Herbal Encyclopedia
is far from enough.

636
00:36:56,954 --> 00:36:57,714
That's true.

637
00:36:58,954 --> 00:37:00,234
How can the Herbal Encyclopedia

638
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:02,154
cure all diseases in the world?

639
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:03,795
What if there were dozens

640
00:37:03,795 --> 00:37:04,835
of Herbal Encyclopedia?

641
00:37:09,914 --> 00:37:11,234
That's a good idea.

642
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:13,115
No way.

643
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:14,234
It's impossible.

644
00:37:14,914 --> 00:37:15,995
Our ancestor exhausted

645
00:37:16,355 --> 00:37:18,275
his effort for
only one Herbal Encyclopedia.

646
00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:19,674
Just tell me.

647
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:21,714
Is this a good thing?

648
00:37:21,835 --> 00:37:22,954
Is it worth doing?

649
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:24,595
Of course it is.

650
00:37:24,595 --> 00:37:26,275
Since you've affirmed its value,

651
00:37:26,355 --> 00:37:27,434
why don't you do it?

652
00:37:27,835 --> 00:37:29,515
Just because it's difficult

653
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,714
and you dare not do it?

654
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:32,795
Do your best.

655
00:37:33,355 --> 00:37:35,035
Even if it's only
100 more prescriptions,

656
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:37,835
someone will benefit from them.

657
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:39,632
Xiaoyao.

658
00:37:40,714 --> 00:37:42,035
Do whatever you want.

659
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:43,634
I have your back.

660
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:46,115
It may be somewhat difficult.

661
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:48,075
But it can be done with the effort

662
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:49,515
of an entire nation.

663
00:37:51,595 --> 00:37:52,355
Thank you, Xuan.

664
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,755
Work on them tomorrow if you're tired.

665
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:22,075
These medical records won't run away.

666
00:38:22,115 --> 00:38:23,355
There's plenty of time.

667
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,674
You don't have to rush.

668
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:27,434
I want to get these all sorted out

669
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:28,795
before leaving Chenrong Mountain.

670
00:38:32,954 --> 00:38:34,194
Leaving Chenrong Mountain?

671
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:39,835
But

672
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:41,355
being with Jing

673
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:44,154
might delay the process
of editing the book.

674
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:49,275
Xiaoyao.

675
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:52,154
Compiling medical books

676
00:38:52,154 --> 00:38:52,995
requires a great deal

677
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:54,394
of manpower and resources

678
00:38:54,795 --> 00:38:57,434
as well as time and energy.

679
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:00,355
If you become Lady of Tushan,

680
00:39:00,355 --> 00:39:02,275
you certainly won't be so free

681
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,315
to communicate with physicians,

682
00:39:04,954 --> 00:39:06,835
and collect herbs from various places.

683
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,035
Jing will surely support me.

684
00:39:12,474 --> 00:39:14,795
Even if Tushan Jing supports you,

685
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:17,874
what about those elders
of the Tushan Family?

686
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:19,755
They will keep a close eye on you

687
00:39:19,795 --> 00:39:21,315
to see if you live up to the title

688
00:39:21,355 --> 00:39:22,434
of Lady of Tushan.

689
00:39:23,434 --> 00:39:25,035
They may not support you.

690
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:26,634
By then, Tushan Jing

691
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:28,394
will be caught in a dilemma

692
00:39:28,755 --> 00:39:30,355
because of you and the elders.

693
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:34,115
You are right.

694
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:36,035
Jing always puts me first.

695
00:39:36,595 --> 00:39:38,275
I can't make him defend me

696
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,634
and grow distant with those elders.

697
00:40:00,154 --> 00:40:01,035
Close your eyes.

698
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:03,115
Open them when I tell you to.

699
00:40:03,595 --> 00:40:04,874
Why did you bring me here?

700
00:40:06,515 --> 00:40:07,275
Close your eyes.

701
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:09,712
Okay.

702
00:40:16,674 --> 00:40:17,474
Watch your step.

703
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,115
Are we ready?

704
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:32,315
Open your eyes now.

705
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:42,434
Rejuvenation Hall.

706
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:44,874
Xiaoyao.

707
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:47,075
I have something to tell you.

708
00:40:49,835 --> 00:40:50,394
- I...
- Jing.

709
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:52,434
Thank you.

710
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:55,555
If you agree,

711
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,394
I should thank you.

712
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,434
You must have

713
00:40:58,555 --> 00:40:59,874
brought me here to encourage me

714
00:41:00,595 --> 00:41:01,795
about compiling

715
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:02,954
that medical book, right?

716
00:41:09,035 --> 00:41:09,584
Jing.

717
00:41:10,154 --> 00:41:10,835
Thank you.

718
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:12,434
Compiling a medical book

719
00:41:12,515 --> 00:41:14,234
is going to take a lot of time

720
00:41:14,634 --> 00:41:15,835
and I'll have to travel.

721
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:17,634
Our wedding

722
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:18,714
will have to wait.

723
00:41:19,434 --> 00:41:21,434
I didn't know how to tell you.

724
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,035
But you already knew.

725
00:41:24,595 --> 00:41:25,795
And you're so supportive.

Xiaoyao.

733
00:41:57,674 --> 00:41:58,755
Compiling a medical book

734
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:01,394
and practicing medical skills
can benefit the people.

735
00:42:01,835 --> 00:42:02,835
If you want to do it,

travels around all year

739
00:42:10,315 --> 00:42:11,714
and knows many places.

740
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:14,035
The physicians
can set out with the caravan

741
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:16,075
to collect prescriptions and herbs.

742
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:17,755
It's both safe and efficient.
