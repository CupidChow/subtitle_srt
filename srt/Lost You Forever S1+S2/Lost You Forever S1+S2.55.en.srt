=Episode 16=

3
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,801
Marrying Nian
will make you a bit happier.

4
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,600
After all, you watched her grow up.

5
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,081
In your heart,

6
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:45,721
she must be different from
those women from the Zijin Peak.

7
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:47,761
Nian is different from them.

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,001
But it doesn't mean

9
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:51,161
I want to marry her.

10
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:05,200
Your marriage to Nian would quell

11
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:07,361
the strife between our two kingdoms.

12
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:10,521
Moreover, Nian is sincere.

13
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:12,560
And you know she likes you

14
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:14,801
more than any other women.

15
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:18,321
Have you ever considered

16
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:19,200
what I truly feel?

17
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
You've only ever thought about Nian.

18
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,361
Nian wants to marry me.

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,680
You think

20
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,521
that I already have

21
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,721
so many women,

22
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,721
so one more woman

23
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,200
doesn't really matter, right?

24
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:31,161
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,441
I just think

26
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:34,881
if you could previously marry

27
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:36,560
those women to win over those clans,

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,881
why can't you marry Nian?

29
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,200
Is she in any way inferior to them?

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,801
Why are you looking at me?

31
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:48,640
Back then,

32
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,241
when you married Chenrong Xinyue,

33
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:51,200
you were all elated.

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,321
What's wrong with marrying Nian now?

35
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:55,161
Why so reluctant?

36
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:58,721
When was I ever elated?

37
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:01,640
Did you see that?

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,640
Tell me

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,840
how I was ever elated.

40
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:09,241
I didn't see it with my own eyes,

41
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,640
but back in the day,

42
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,920
when you married Chenrong Xinyue,

43
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:13,961
the people of Haoling all discussed it.

44
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,081
So many people

45
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:16,560
saw you in high spirits.

46
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:17,760
Xiaoyao,

47
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,521
anyone can say so, but you...

48
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,081
How could you?

49
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,029
Cang Xuan,

50
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,840
just be drunk

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,161
in front of all the guests from Dahuang

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,721
and the officials from both kingdoms

53
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:33,441
tomorrow.

54
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:35,361
Xiling Jiuyao, let me tell you.

55
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,760
I felt very sad
every time I got married,

56
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,321
especially when I married

57
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:40,881
Chenrong Xinyue.

58
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,001
I even hate myself

59
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,001
and hate you too.

60
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:47,961
If you are drunk again,

61
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:49,120
I will hit you.

62
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm serious.

63
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,801
I don't want any of those women.

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,001
I just want...

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,280
I just want...

66
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:36,240
Cang Xuan,

67
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,481
what is wrong with you?

68
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,201
Before,

69
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,840
I could always tell
what you were thinking.

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,321
But this time, I have no idea at all.

71
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:50,520
I admit

72
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,601
I did only think about Nian.

73
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:54,840
I didn't consider you.

74
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,641
Because in my heart,

75
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,881
I feel

76
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:04,080
you care more about the whole world

77
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,641
and the political landscape,

78
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,481
and care less about other things.

79
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,601
Which of these two pendants
do you prefer?

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,881
Whichever.

81
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,441
Then at the wedding ceremony tomorrow,

82
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,400
which color of lipstick
do you want to apply?

83
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,080
Vermilion,

84
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:56,881
silvery red,

85
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:57,641
scarlet,

86
00:05:57,721 --> 00:05:58,280
rose red,

87
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,360
begonia red

88
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:00,120
or peach red?

89
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:01,800
Whichever.

90
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:04,800
Why do you

91
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,041
always reply "whichever"?

92
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,560
My dream has come true.

93
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:10,013
I'm happy.

94
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,721
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

95
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,761
I've never seen a bride like you.

96
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,161
Then what do you think a bride

97
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:27,080
should be like?

98
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,321
If one day,

99
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,601
I can marry Cang Xuan,

100
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,161
I will definitely be nervous.

101
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,881
I'll also be a bit scared

102
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,080
that I'm not pretty enough.

103
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,120
From accessories to the color of rouge,

104
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,761
I will pick everything personally.

105
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:41,680
I will look forward

106
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,080
to my future with him.

107
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,981
Nian,

108
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:04,161
are you happy?

109
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:09,400
I used to think

110
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,041
if one day,

111
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,321
I could marry Cang Xuan,

112
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,520
I would surely be overjoyed.

113
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:18,080
But now my dream has come true,

114
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,120
and I am not as happy as I had imagined.

115
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,240
If you have regrets,

116
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,960
I will issue an edict at once

117
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,560
to cancel tomorrow's wedding.

118
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,481
Now all the people of Dahuang know

119
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:32,800
that I will be married
to the King of Xiyan tomorrow.

120
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,041
The Four Great Clans,

121
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,441
Haoling's four tribes,

122
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:38,400
the clans of the Central Plains,

123
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,321
and the old clans of Xiyan

124
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,120
all gather at Wushen Mountain.

125
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:43,881
The wedding

126
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,321
can't be canceled casually.

127
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,240
I am the King of Haoling.

128
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:50,001
So I have the final say.

129
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:52,321
You just consider
whether you want to marry or not.

130
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:54,680
Leave the rest to me.

131
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,560
Kings should keep their word.

132
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:59,680
Aren't you afraid of
being ridiculed by the people?

133
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,280
Compared to your lifelong happiness,

134
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:14,560
the people's scorn

135
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,721
is nothing.

136
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,560
All the clans gather at Wushen Mountain.

137
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,321
It is just good.

138
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,800
Presumably, each clan has sent out

139
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,280
their most outstanding offsprings.

140
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Among them are certainly
many outstanding young men.

141
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:36,281
You can choose an ideal husband

142
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,800
among them.

143
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,001
It is not

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
just mine and Cang Xuan's wedding.

145
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:49,680
It also concerns the peace
of the Dahuang.

146
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,680
Father,

147
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,881
if you cancel it

148
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,360
and change the groom casually,

149
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,641
aren't you afraid of causing
chaos in Dahuang?

150
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,881
So what?

151
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,841
I was able to quell
the Five Princes Rebellion back then,

152
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:05,480
so I am not afraid now.

153
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:07,401
Father,

154
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:10,881
you are the best father.

155
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,761
Nian,

156
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:22,720
Cang Xuan is an emperor.

157
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:24,641
He...

158
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:25,401
I know.

159
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
He doesn't like me,

160
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:33,600
but I like him.

161
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:38,521
Marrying him

162
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,720
isn't as happy

163
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,920
as I thought it would be,

164
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,761
but I know

165
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,081
if I don't marry him,

166
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:48,641
I'll never be happy in my life.

167
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:49,680
Nian.

168
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,240
Father,

169
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,401
don't worry.

170
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:56,240
I'm not what I used to be anymore.

171
00:09:57,281 --> 00:09:58,800
I still like Cang Xuan,

172
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:00,841
but he's not everything

173
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:04,521
to me anymore.

174
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,480
I'm not the most important to him.

175
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:09,800
Similarly,

176
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:13,281
he's not the most important to me.

177
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,641
If I have to choose between him

178
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:18,521
and you,

179
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
I will choose you.

180
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,800
If I have to choose between our people

181
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,521
and him,

182
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,321
I will choose our people.

183
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,761
If that's the case,

184
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:38,001
don't marry Cang Xuan.

185
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,680
Father,

186
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,800
I know well
Cang Xuan doesn't want to marry me,

187
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
but I insist on marrying him.

188
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,841
Because between his happiness

189
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,800
and mine,

190
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,321
I choose to make him unhappy

191
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:00,201
and make myself happy.

192
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:10,800
Father,

193
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
I've grown up.

194
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,881
I promise

195
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,720
I will take good care of myself.

196
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:28,720
If you really don't want

197
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,881
the wedding tomorrow,

198
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,720
we'll find a way to cancel it.

199
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,521
How do we do it?

200
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,800
Tomorrow's wedding
is already known to all the people.

201
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,001
Millions of troops

202
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,800
are guarding the border
between the two kingdoms.

203
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:44,240
One careless move

204
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,560
could lead to great chaos.

205
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:49,800
I haven't thought it through yet.

206
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:51,421
But

207
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,920
whatever you don't want to do,

208
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,961
I will support you.

209
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,761
Let's figure out a way together.

210
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:57,521
There must be a way to cancel it.

211
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:02,600
Aren't you afraid of danger?

212
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,381
No.

213
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:06,040
Since we were little,

214
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,920
we've never had a peaceful day.

215
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:23,521
What number is this?

216
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:25,961
Six.

217
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,560
Are you messing with me?

218
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,881
Tomorrow,

219
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,720

220
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:54,641
the King of Xiyan joyfully

221
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,040
marry the Princess of Haoling.

222
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,441

223
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,841

Things have come to this.

226
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:11,560
Marrying one more woman

227
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:13,800
makes no difference.

228
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,961
Are you really willing?

229
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:20,989
Yes.

230
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,081

324
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,681
of the danger of leaving
the throne empty

325

marry the King of Xiyan.

330
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:46,960

332
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,080

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,161
What?

334
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,561

to give the Haoling

as a dowry to Xiyan Cang Xuan?

336
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,320

After subduing Haoling,

344
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,360
he will then send troops
to attack Hong Jiang.

345
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,120
I thought the war
between Haoling and Xiyan

346
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,561

I didn't expect

348
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,561
Dahuang would be unified so quickly.

349
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,281

355
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,320
to do anything else?

356
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,801
The world is vast

357
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:24,080

358
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,041
Right.

359
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,200
You are a nine-headed demon.

360
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:30,360
Do you want to be bound by fate?

361
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:34,440
Have you not considered making

362
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,240
a different choice?

363
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,200

364
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:48,957
I know

365
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,720
you just see me

366
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,041
as an object of trade.

367
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,641
But I see you

368
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:55,881
as a friend.

369
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,881
Friendship

370

cannot be seen or touched.

371

373
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,840
we both have a poisonous bug
in our hearts

374
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,600
and our lives are connected,

375
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:22,281
will he kill me?

376
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,120
You are my pawn
to control the King of Xiyan.

377
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:32,921
You knew

378

379
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:35,801
Right?

380
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,240
Right, so what?

381
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,840
Since you could help Cang Xuan transfer

382
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,840
the poisonous bug to yourself,

383
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:46,200
you surely know the method to remove it.

384
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:48,161
Take a guess.

385
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,681
If I die,

386
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
will you still be alive?

387
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:52,600
Other way around.

388
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:54,960
If I die,

389
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,360
will you still be alive?

390
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:02,761
You can use the poisonous bug
as leverage against Cang Xuan.

391
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:04,720
Aren't you afraid

392
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,120
I would use the poisonous bug
to scheme against you?

393
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:08,840
Scheme against me?

394
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:14,161
I'm looking forward to it.

395
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:16,240
Xiang Liu,

396
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,881
what exactly do you want?

397
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:20,881
Make yourself clear.

398
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:21,405
Xiaoyao.

399
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:32,720
The wedding is over?

400
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:35,240
Yes.

401
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,921
Xuan.

402
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:39,561
Is everything going well with him?

403
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,401
Yes.

404
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,480
What are you worried about?

405
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,041
Nothing.

406
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
I was just taking a walk by the sea,

407
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:49,080
and Xiang Liu suddenly appeared.

408
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:51,681
I was just asking him
about removing the poisonous bug.

409
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:54,080
Does Xiang Liu have a way?

410
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,041
I guess he does.

411
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:56,840
Otherwise,

412
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,320
knowing it would
make our lives connected,

413
00:24:58,928 --> 00:25:01,001
he wouldn't put the poisonous bug
inside him willingly.

414
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:01,681
But

415
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:02,801
he didn't tell me.

416
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,240
The poisonous bug bothers me

417
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,320
until it's removed.

418
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,521
Xiang Liu is known as "Nine Lives"

419
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
with exceptional spirit power.

420
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:11,960
Between him and me,

421
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,401
I'm more vulnerable.

422
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:16,480
If there's any worry,

423
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,440
he should worry
that I might drag him down.

424
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:24,120
I misspoke.

425
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,960
I am hard

426
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,761
to kill

427
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:28,480
and sure to live a long life

428
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,001
and become an old woman.

429
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:32,521
Don't worry.

430
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,240
I've been studying
medicine and compiling

431
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
medical books recently.

432
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:37,440
Since Xiang Liu can remove
the poisonous bug,

433
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:39,041
I can certainly do it too.

434
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:41,161
It's just that I need some time.

435
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:42,200
You're right.

436
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,080
We will definitely find a way.

437
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,600
This place.

438
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,001
Have we been here before?

439
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,041
Chief Tushan,

440
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,561
it was here

441
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,801
where I offered my first kiss,

442
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,960
and you rejected it.

443
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,960
It was my fault for not knowing

444
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,041
what I was missing.

445
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:48,801
Now that you know it,

446
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,681
don't miss the opportunity anymore.

447
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:53,320
This time,

448
00:26:54,761 --> 00:26:55,600
you can't dodge.

449
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:09,641
This time,

450
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,320
it is you who can't dodge.

451
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,921
Since ascending to the throne
in my prime,

452
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,561
it has been hundreds of years.

453
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,720
And now I'm in my twilight years.

454
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,840
My body and spirit ail.

455
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:12,200
Still, state affairs are burdensome.

456
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,521
I am well aware
that I cannot sustain it.

457
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,240
Holding the throne in vain

458
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,360
isn't good for the kingdom.

459
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:20,320
I fear I would dishonor my ancestors

460
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:21,600
and disappoint the people.

461
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,641
Now there is a ruler who is wise

462
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,120
and capable.

463
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,641
I've decided to cede the throne to him.

464
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,161
I wonder

465
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:32,921
which member of the royal family
you have in mind.

466
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,720
Not from the Haoling royal family.

467
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:36,281
It is

468
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:41,281
Xiyan Cang Xuan.

469
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,677
Your Majesty.

470
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,921
Absolutely not!

471
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:48,200
Xiyan Cang Xuan is the king
of the Xiyan Kingdom.

472
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,480
If you cede the throne to him,

473
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:50,480
would it not be

474
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:52,561
like giving the great lands of Haoling

475
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,801
straight to him?

476
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,521
Please think again

477
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,761
and take it back.

478
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:58,600
- Please think again
- Please think again

479
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:00,281
- and take it back.
- and take it back.

480
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,720
The lands were once one.

481
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,600
Your Majesty, you prioritize peace
and the well-being of all people,

482
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,681
and abdicate the throne

483
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,960
to unify the lands.

484
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,360
Your generosity
is beyond ordinary people.

485
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:16,001
My subordinates and I

486
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,801
will abide by your command.

487
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,281
I will abide by your command.

488
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:21,245
Good.

489
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,041
Qinglong,

490
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,761
Xihe, do you two squads
have any objections?

491
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:26,801
We Qinglong Squad

492
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,440
will abide by your command.

493
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,120
We Xihe Squad

494
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,681
will abide by your command.

495
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:36,681
- Your Majesty, please don't.
- Please don't.

496
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:37,960
Issue the edict.

497
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,401
Here's His Majesty's decree.

498
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:43,801
I understand the rulership
is not a personal possession

499
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,161
but is earned through virtue.

500
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:47,240
Heaven and people

501
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,041
all demand the wise
and the capable to be selected,

502
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:50,960
which is a principle embraced by all.

503
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,840
The position isn't for one
to possess alone.

504
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:55,200
Cang Xuan of Xiyan

505
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:56,840
(Father cede the throne to me.)
is sagacious

506
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,240
(I'll try to be a good ruler and not let you down.)
and outstanding.

507
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,320
Today, I retire to another palace

508
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,001
and cede the throne to him.

509
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,240
That's all.

510
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,401
You and His Majesty have unified Dahuang

511
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:32,641
without waging war

512
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,281
or disturbing the people.

513
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,720
It is truly a joyous
and congratulatory event.

514
00:32:39,521 --> 00:32:40,801
It is too early

515
00:32:41,281 --> 00:32:42,440
to be happy now.

516
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:46,600
Cang Xuan
has only nominally unified Haoling.

517
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,600
The Haoling tribes

518
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,561
will not be sincerely convinced.

519
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,001
It is heard

520
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,681
that the court officials opposing
Cang Xuan's succession

521
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,720
are not in the minority.

522
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,440
Although

523
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,881
all have been suppressed by the might

524
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:01,001
of the King of Haoling,

525
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:04,801
they will surely obstruct at every turn.

526
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,641
It is not easy for Cang Xuan

527
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,561
to fully control Haoling.

528
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,960
You don't need to worry.

529
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,120
With His Majesty's wisdom and ability,

530
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:25,561
he will certainly make
the Haoling court officials convinced.

531
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:27,240
Right.

532
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,281
I believe that Cang Xuan can achieve it.

533
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:34,921
After all, I have spent centuries

534
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:37,801
but still failed to make the clans
of the Central Plains

535
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:39,480
truly submit to me.

536
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:45,041
Cang Xuan, however,
accomplished it in less than a century.

537
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,840
(Since Xiyan Cang Xuan
succeeded to the throne,)

538
00:33:58,281 --> 00:33:59,681
(he has governed with diligence)

539
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:01,200
(and love for the people.)

540
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
(Regarding Ru Shou, Qin Mang and others)

541
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,921
(who supported his succession,
he saw them as his right-hand men)

542
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,680
(and entrusted them
with important tasks.)

543
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:10,960
(Towards the good officials
who opposed his succession,)

544
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:12,680
(he treated them with courtesy)

545
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,240
(and accepted their criticism.)

546
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:16,121
(As for the treacherous ones)

547
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:17,880
(who profited from chaos,)

548
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,440
(he suppressed them)

549
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:21,240
(forcefully.)

550
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:25,121
(The turmoil over the throne
gradually subsided.)

551
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:28,561
(Under the rule of Xiyan Cang Xuan,)

552
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,480
(the order has been restored
and the governance has been upright.)

553
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:33,841
(Haoling has prospered.)

554
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,081
(All are convinced.)

555
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,801
(Now,)

556
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:39,920
(Haoling)

557
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,041
(and Xiyan)

558
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,680
(are truly united.)

559
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,200
(Xiyan Cang Xuan is honored)

560
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:48,521
(as the Lord of Dahuang.)

561
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,680
How is Father?

562
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,200
No serious issues.

563
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,200
But if he wants to fully recover,

564
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
he still needs to recuperate.

565
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:05,720
Father, you've worked hard.

566
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:09,181
Cang Xuan,

567
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:12,041
I want to ask you for something.

568
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:13,880
No matter what it is,

569
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,440
as long as you want it,

570
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,200
just take it.

571
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:18,920
I want Xiyan Mountain.

572
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:21,725
Father,

573
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,041
there's no need for that.

574
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:27,321
Father, why do you want that?

575
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,561
Now, the situation is settled.

576
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,880
I want to leave Wushen Mountain

577
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:33,601
and move to Xiyan Mountain.

578
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:35,001
Why?

579
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,720
Father does not want
two rulers in one kingdom,

580
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:41,081
and he is intent on crushing
all the officials' hopes,

581
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:45,041
and making everyone acknowledge
only Cang Xuan as the king.

582
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,601
There is also a personal reason.

583
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:51,361
Xiyan Mountain

584
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:53,561
is the birthplace
of the Xiyan royal family.

585
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:56,920
It's of extraordinary significance
to the Xiyan Kingdom.

586
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,240
Becoming the master

587
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:00,640
is to show the world

588
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:03,601
my status is the same
as the Great Emperor's

589
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,121
and Haoling is not a submission.

590
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:12,640
Father,

591
00:36:14,081 --> 00:36:15,281
there's really no need for that.

592
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,440
The climate of Wushen Mountain
and Xiyan Mountain

593
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,240
is entirely different.

594
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:21,321
You may not be able to adapt.

595
00:36:22,256 --> 00:36:23,960
The climate of Chenrong Mountain
and Xiyan Mountain

596
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,880
is also entirely different.

597
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,640
Isn't your grandfather
also living well there?

598
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:30,160
I've heard

599
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,920
he's must better
than when he was at Xiyan Mountain.

600
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,761
Father,

601
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,521
how can you bear
to leave Wushen Mountain?

602
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,081
On Wushen Mountain,

603
00:36:45,761 --> 00:36:47,281
the only one I can't bear to part with

604
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,400
is you.

605
00:36:55,361 --> 00:36:56,160
I am tired.

606
00:36:56,601 --> 00:36:58,001
I want to change my way of life

607
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:01,801
and don't want to stay
in this palace anymore.

608
00:37:06,281 --> 00:37:07,640
Your mother will stay to accompany you.

609
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,680
Even when Cang Xuan is not around,

610
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:10,960
you are not alone.

611
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:15,601
Cang Xuan,

612
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,880
are you willing
to give Xiyan Mountain to me?

613
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,480
Of course I am willing.

614
00:37:24,281 --> 00:37:25,361
But Father,

615
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,200
please recover fully before you leave.

616
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:29,920
If I stay here,

617
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,601
even if I do not want
to deal with something,

618
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:33,521
it will still reach my ears

619
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,321
and prevent me from resting in peace.

620
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:37,200
If possible,

621
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,240
I want to leave soon.

622
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:40,601
Father,

623
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:43,041
let me accompany you back
to Xiyan Mountain.

624
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,321
It's a good opportunity
to help you recuperate.

625
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:49,601
With you accompanying Father back,

626
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:51,081
I will be much more at ease.

627
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,081
Rest assured.

628
00:37:57,321 --> 00:37:58,960
I will definitely arrange it
as soon as possible.

629
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:05,520
(Sunlight Hall)

630
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,841
You're a good king.

631
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:47,960
In my lifetime,

632
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,440
I am not a good son,

633
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,281
a good brother, a good friend

634
00:38:55,321 --> 00:38:56,680
or a good husband.

635
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,841
But I am indeed

636
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,240
a good king.

637
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:07,960
You're a good father.

638
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,400
You're the best father to Nian and me.

639
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

640
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,001
What are you here for?

641
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:42,240
Are you still angry

642
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,601
about the matter
of the Queen of Haoling?

643
00:39:45,361 --> 00:39:46,680
It was my fault for not informing you

644
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,601
in advance.

645
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:50,121
I've come specially to apologize.

646
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:52,160
To apologize?

647
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:55,041
You did a lot

648
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,640
to help His Majesty marry

649
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,160
the Princess of Haoling.

650
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:02,400
Now, your fame
in the court is resounding.

651
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,321
I can't afford

652
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:07,081
your apology.

653
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:08,669
Your Majesty,

654
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:11,920
the marriage alliance between the two
royal families of Xiyan and Haoling

655
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,480
has averted a war

656
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:15,640
between the two kingdoms
that may last for decades

657
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,920
or even hundreds of years.

658
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:19,041
The people will all be grateful to you.

659
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:19,680
Enough!

660
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:22,521
Save your principles

661
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,001
for the court session.

662
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:26,521
I am not your peer or subordinate.

663
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:28,240
I am

664
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,001
your sister of the same mother.

665
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,561
Xinyue,

666
00:40:34,321 --> 00:40:35,321
I'm doing this for your good.

667
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:37,680
The Queen of Haoling lives
at Wushen Mountain.

668
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,761
You can't see her at all.

669
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,121
She has no impact on your status.

670
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,720
For my good?

671
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:46,400
You and father,

672
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,160
for what you call the clan's interest,

673
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:51,521
for your own high positions,

674
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:53,240
have sacrificed me once again.

675
00:40:56,561 --> 00:40:58,480
Putting on airs.

676
00:40:59,521 --> 00:41:01,081
Utterly hypocritical.

677
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:02,640
Just scold me

678
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,440
if you want.

679
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Don't bring Father into this.

680
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:07,640
I warned you about this from the start

681
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,761
His Majesty carried
the whole world in his mind.

682
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,200
If you wanted a devoted husband,

683
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
don't marry His Majesty.

684
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,960
This was your own choice.

685
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,720
It wasn't me or Father
who forced you to become the queen.

686
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,521
Without me and father,

687
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,480
would someone willful and selfish
like you secure your position?

688
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
Get out of my sight!

689
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,880
I will no longer need
your concern in the future.

690
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:03,312
(Base Camp of Chenrong Army)

691
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:04,640
One.

692
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,749
Two.

693
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:08,960
Three.

694
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,761
Four.

695
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,053
Five.

696
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:15,005
Six.

697
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:18,761
Mr. Xiang.

698
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,121
Starting today,

699
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,960
add an extra portion
of meat to everyone.

700
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,801
You've gathered more provisions.

701
00:42:29,361 --> 00:42:31,041
Let me say thank you
on behalf of everyone.

702
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:33,693
Three.

703
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,480
Four.

704
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:37,661
Five.

705
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:40,701
Six.

706
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,216
Tell me.

707
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,081
Does our perseverance make sense?

708
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
No matter the obstacles,

709
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,960
I shall go forth.
