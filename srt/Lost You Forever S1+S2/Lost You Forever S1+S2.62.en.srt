Is he dead?

Yeah.

26
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,587
Tear apart his body

(and full of lies.)

(The only truth you told me was...)

62
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:39,666
I can't protect myself.

63
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,746
I have no one to rely on,

64
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:45,947

68
00:08:57,947 --> 00:08:59,546

(You found a perfect lover.)

72
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:15,227
(You have someone to rely on.)

73
00:09:17,227 --> 00:09:18,746
(You're no longer alone,)

74
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,746
(drowning in loneliness.)

75
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:25,746
(My blood running in your veins)

76
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,787

00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:32,707

86
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:05,546
(To kill me,)

87
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:07,267
(you must shoot a few more arrows.)

88
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:11,347
Aim right here.

89
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,347
You think I wouldn't dare?

90
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:19,066
What do you want?

91
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:20,866
Your blood.

92
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,626
Haven't you taken a lot of my blood?

93
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:27,626
Was it not enough?

94
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:31,787
If I had known

95
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:35,426
that it would be our last meeting

96
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:38,387
in this lifetime,

97
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:42,147
no matter how cold you were,

98
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,587
I wouldn't have said those words.

99
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:30,907
You didn't mention it.

100
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:33,186
So I thought you forgot.

101
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:35,467
But it turned out...

102
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:41,106
But it turned out
that you had destroyed it.

103
00:11:50,787 --> 00:11:51,746
Xiang Liu.

104
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,746
How unbearable am I to you

105
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:00,827
that you wouldn't even

106
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:02,267
leave your memory behind?

107
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:23,626
Deal.

108
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,347
Chenrong's army was defeated.

109
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:18,827
Hong Jiang and Xiang Liu

110
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:19,626
died in battle.

111
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:22,106
Grandfather,
your wish has been fulfilled.

112
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:25,066
At last, Dahuang is truly united.

113
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:26,986
I say the same to you.

114
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:39,106
Since the fall of the Chenrong Kingdom,

115
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:40,387
the Chenrong rebels

116
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,467
have been a great concern to me.

117
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:46,746
The concern has been removed.

118
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:48,347
However,

119
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:53,426
it turns out
there is more regret than relief.

120
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:56,827
We may have been enemies,

121
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:00,746
but I'd like to toast to Xiang Liu.

122
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:10,827
Grandfather.

123
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,106
I just remembered something.

124
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:15,947
(I want you to promise me.)

125
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,746
If one day,

126
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:20,267
you become the ruler of Xiyan Kingdom,

127
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,267
make a peak on Chenrong Mountain

128
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:24,147
a forbidden area

129
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:27,506
so that the deceased
can have their ashes

130
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:29,186
sent back

131
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:30,787
to the place that they've missed.

132
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:32,947
Xiang Liu was only

133
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,626
in debt to himself.

134
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:39,027
Since you've promised,

135
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:40,426
let it be as he desired.

136
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:46,546
Your Majesty.

137
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,066
Letter from Zhaoyun Peak.

138
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:54,288
(Entrusted by Jing, I invite you
and the Great Emperor to Zhaoyun Peak.)

139
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:58,506
What does it say?

140
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:00,426
Father invites us

141
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:02,147
to meet at Zhaoyun Peak.

142
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:06,448
(Zhaoyun Peak, Xiyan)

143
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:11,626
Xiaoyao saved

144
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:13,227
my life and went through

145
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,746
hardship with me.

146
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,227
We are also friends and soul mates.

147
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:19,227
Even if the mountains fall,

148
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:20,907
and the water drains,

149
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:21,907
I won't let her down.

150
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:23,866
I don't seek

151
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:25,027
to achieve something

152
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:27,066
or gain fame and power.

153
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,186
I only wish I could be

154
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:30,426
with Xiaoyao forever.

155
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:34,746
Great Emperor.

156
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:37,626
Honorary Emperor.

157
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:39,984
Your Majesty.

158
00:15:40,746 --> 00:15:43,306
Please allow Xiaoyao

159
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:44,827
to marry me.

160
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,506
You and Xiaoyao
are in love with each other.

161
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:07,347
As the family,

162
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:09,546
we hope that Xiaoyao will be happy.

163
00:16:09,947 --> 00:16:11,626
Why would we turn you down?

164
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:13,986
I approve

165
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,666
of your marriage.

166
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:18,626
Thank you.

167
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,587
You and Xiaoyao

168
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:24,147
went through so much and came this far.

169
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:25,746
Of course, I approve of it.

170
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,387
Thank you.

171
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:30,506
I have a question.

172
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:31,587
Yes, Your Majesty.

173
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,866
Fenglong told me before he died

174
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,506
that it was your idea

175
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:44,227
to give up on Xiyan Mountain
and go for Chenrong Mountain.

176
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:47,106
Not only did you convince him to do so,

177
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,707
but you also pushed

178
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:51,306
the Central Plains clans to support me.

179
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:52,426
That's right.

180
00:16:52,787 --> 00:16:53,707
Why didn't you tell me?

181
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,306
All I want is Xiaoyao.

182
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:57,106
So you chose to support me

183
00:16:57,746 --> 00:16:59,306
because of Xiaoyao.

184
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,216
No.

185
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:04,546
No?

186
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:07,066
I followed the Tushan Family's caravan

187
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:08,786
throughout Dahuang

188
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:10,426
and saw the world in chaos.

189
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:12,587
A ruler of a kingdom

190
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,186
determines the people's lives.

191
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:17,347
I could abide by clan rules for Xiaoyao

192
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:19,107
to not support Deyan and Yuyang.

193
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:21,066
But I couldn't go against the teachings

194
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,546
and break the rules

195
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:25,066
to unite the Four Great Clans
and the Central Plains clans

196
00:17:25,426 --> 00:17:26,786
to support you.

197
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:30,747
I spared no effort

198
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:31,747
to support you

199
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,587
because your magnanimity and talent

200
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,467
convinced me

201
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:37,546
that I was doing the right thing.

202
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:01,146
Jing and Xiaoyao

203
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:03,347
are a matching couple

204
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:04,987
deeply in love.

205
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:07,546
Find an auspicious day for the wedding.

206
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,507
Thank you, Your Majesty.

207
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:28,627
I didn't expect you

208
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:29,627
to get married so soon.

209
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:32,426
So soon?

210
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,467
You got married decades ago.

211
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:42,227
What's wrong?

212
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:44,107
Why do you seem upset

213
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:45,627
and burdened by worries?

214
00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:57,906
This is for you.

215
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:06,747
This is left by your mother

216
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:08,707
to give to the girl you love.

217
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:10,507
How can you just give it to me?

218
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,507
I am giving it to the girl

219
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:15,587
I've always fancied.

220
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:20,186
Xiaoyao.

221
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,306
I fancy you.

222
00:19:27,587 --> 00:19:28,386
Cang Xuan.

223
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:32,066
You must be joking with me.

224
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:46,266
Along this journey,

225
00:19:48,026 --> 00:19:49,426
I've weighed the pros and cons

226
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:51,666
and made choices again and again,

227
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:54,146
but I never chose you.

228
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:57,786
I'm confessing my love today,

229
00:19:57,786 --> 00:19:58,947
but you can hardly believe me.

230
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:01,107
Xiaoyao.

231
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:04,546
My feelings for you

232
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,066
have never changed for a day.

233
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:09,107
I've always wanted to give this flower

234
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,347
to you, as you are

235
00:20:11,947 --> 00:20:12,786
the one and only person.

236
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:19,056
I...

237
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:21,867
How is that even possible?

238
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,906
Who else would treat me

239
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:25,906
better than you do?

240
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:30,827
This Ruomu flower belongs only to you.

241
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:58,947
It allows you
to command the Ruoshui Clan.

242
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,827
Consider it the dowry from me

243
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:06,107
and a blessing from an elder.

244
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:09,587
Both our mothers

245
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:12,306
would love to see you wearing it.

246
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,066
You probably have forgotten,

247
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:20,666
but I have always remembered

248
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:25,107
that right here in this Poinciana Wood,

249
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,906
you promised to be with me

250
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,227
forever and ever.

251
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:35,867
(But you will grow up.)

252
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:38,107
(You'll make a living
and start a family.)

253
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:42,227
Then you have to leave Zhaoyun Peak

254
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:44,146
and me.

255
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:50,107
We won't ever be parted

256
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,227
as long as I'm your little sister.

257
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:53,906
Sure.

258
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,146
You'll always be my sister.

259
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:56,707
And I'm your big brother forever.

260
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:59,186
(No matter what,
we'll be together forever.)

261
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:00,426
(Deal.)

262
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:01,386
(Together forever.)

263
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:02,306
(We will never)

264
00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:03,507
(be parted.)

265
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:09,507
I didn't expect...

266
00:22:11,026 --> 00:22:11,867
I didn't expect

267
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,146
that you still remember

268
00:22:16,747 --> 00:22:17,947
what we said as kids.

269
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:20,867
I thought...

270
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:22,627
You thought I was like Grandfather

271
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:26,227
and only cared about the throne.

272
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:33,306
I was determined to ascend the throne

273
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:38,026
because it could help me protect you

274
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:41,066
and keep us from parting.

275
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:42,827
I know

276
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:46,347
you wanted to ascend the throne

277
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:48,867
to protect me.

278
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:50,587
That's right.

279
00:22:55,947 --> 00:22:57,306
One day, Grandfather asked me

280
00:23:01,227 --> 00:23:03,627
if there were only two paths before me

281
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:09,227
and I had to choose
between the throne and you,

282
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:12,227
which one I would choose?

283
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:15,786
I couldn't answer him on the spot.

284
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:22,467
Lying in bed alone

285
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,906
in the deep of the night,

286
00:23:24,507 --> 00:23:25,467
I knew deep down

287
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:26,906
that the real answer was...

288
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:31,627
The throne.

289
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:35,227
Ever since Grandfather
asked me that question,

290
00:23:41,026 --> 00:23:42,467
I've often thought of the past.

291
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:47,666
Even though I knew
I would lose you one day,

292
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:52,546
I chose this path.

293
00:23:54,347 --> 00:23:56,107
Even if everything starts over,

294
00:23:58,867 --> 00:24:00,266
I would still have to make

295
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:01,906
the same choice as before.

296
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:05,747
Xiaoyao.

297
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:10,827
I'm sorry.

298
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:15,947
I'm no longer who I was back then.

299
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:20,266
That young Cang Xuan

300
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:24,306
lost his father,

301
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,666
his mother,

302
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:28,827
and everything.

303
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:34,786
You were all he had left in his world.

304
00:24:36,426 --> 00:24:37,827
But my world doesn't

305
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:43,107
revolve around you anymore.

306
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:48,146
I can't

307
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:49,507
give up everything

308
00:24:51,546 --> 00:24:52,747
just for you.

309
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:56,347
You were the one

310
00:24:56,347 --> 00:24:57,987
who risked your life

311
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,306
to win this world for me.

312
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:10,386
But I didn't choose you.

313
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:15,707
I didn't choose you.

314
00:25:20,627 --> 00:25:21,266
Xiaoyao.

315
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:26,666
I'm sorry.

316
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:31,504
Xuan.

317
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:34,426
Don't be sorry.

318
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:38,306
I helped you because you are my brother.

319
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:39,906
I never expected

320
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:41,066
anything in return.

321
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:43,426
You did well.

322
00:25:45,107 --> 00:25:46,426
We both survived.

323
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:48,666
As long as we're alive,

324
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:53,507
it's the best outcome.

325
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:57,627
Bow to heaven and earth.

326
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,146
Bow to the elders.

327
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:28,947
Hold hands.

328
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:41,426
Exchange vows.

329
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,347
Forever and ever,

330
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:45,347
I'll be with you.

331
00:27:46,546 --> 00:27:47,666
Forever and ever,

332
00:27:49,026 --> 00:27:50,066
I'll always love you.

333
00:27:53,227 --> 00:27:54,546
The ceremony is completed.

334
00:27:58,947 --> 00:28:00,186
Congratulations, sister.

335
00:28:00,186 --> 00:28:00,827
Brother-in-law.

336
00:28:01,232 --> 00:28:03,120
Congratulations, Jing.
Congratulations, sister-in-law.

337
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,424
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

338
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:11,146
Cang Xuan has to return

339
00:28:11,546 --> 00:28:13,026
to Chenrong Mountain soon.

340
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:15,707
Let's spare the formalities.

341
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:17,107
Xiaoyao.

342
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:18,186
Jing.

343
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:19,507
Come over here.

344
00:28:19,827 --> 00:28:21,507
Toast to Cang Xuan.

345
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:48,944
Jing.

346
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:51,107
You have a kind heart

347
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:52,507
and exceptional wisdom.

348
00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:54,066
But what's most precious

349
00:28:54,627 --> 00:28:56,507
is your devotion to Xiaoyao.

350
00:28:57,227 --> 00:28:58,987
You place her above everything.

351
00:29:00,827 --> 00:29:01,906
As her brother, I'm happy

352
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,026
that she's married to you.

353
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:06,786
Auntie and Grandmother

354
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:08,827
would certainly be happy too.

355
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:20,386
Thank you, Your Majesty.

356
00:29:24,786 --> 00:29:25,786
From now on,

357
00:29:27,146 --> 00:29:28,707
I entrust Xiaoyao to you.

358
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:32,747
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

359
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:36,266
I will not let you down.

360
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:42,786
Xuan.

361
00:29:52,146 --> 00:29:53,507
May you be of one heart.

362
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:56,947
May your love last forever.

363
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,507
We'll be a happy couple

364
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:02,266
with your blessing.

365
00:31:00,848 --> 00:31:03,984
(Cemetery, Xiyan Mountain)

366
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:17,546
Mother.

367
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:19,107
He is Tushan Jing,

368
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:21,026
my husband.

369
00:31:23,747 --> 00:31:25,587
I pay respects to you, mother-in-law.

370
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:40,426
During the hardest times,

371
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:43,146
whenever I thought of them,

372
00:31:43,827 --> 00:31:45,306
I felt I must persevere

373
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:46,747
no matter what.

374
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:48,266
Otherwise,

375
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:51,186
they wouldn't rest in peace.

376
00:32:04,546 --> 00:32:05,546
Any plans for the future?

377
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:09,546
I have freed myself
from all the burdens.

378
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:11,066
What about you?

379
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:12,026
Chief Tushan.

380
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:14,266
I am also free of concerns.

381
00:32:14,786 --> 00:32:16,386
Tian has succeeded as the chief.

382
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:17,906
It's awkward for me to go back.

383
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:21,786
I've been waking up from my dreams

384
00:32:22,627 --> 00:32:23,587
these years,

385
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:25,587
thinking of the days in Qingshui Town.

386
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:27,107
Me too.

387
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:30,707
In that case,

388
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:33,026
why don't we...

389
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:08,347
(Mother,)

390
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:10,627
(Auntie,)

391
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:14,026
(Xiaoyao and I are both well.)

392
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:35,627
(Xiyan Town)

393
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:36,786
Have you decided where to go?

394
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:37,627
Not yet.

395
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:39,026
We'll look around first

396
00:33:39,146 --> 00:33:41,627
and gather herbs and prescriptions
for compiling the medical books.

397
00:33:42,947 --> 00:33:43,987
If we find a place

398
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:45,066
that both of us like,

399
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:46,947
we might settle down.

400
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:49,426
Tell us once you

401
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:50,546
settle down.

402
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:54,227
Don't just disappear into thin air.

403
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:55,664
Okay.

404
00:33:56,386 --> 00:33:57,707
I have conquered

405
00:33:58,227 --> 00:34:00,906
most of Dahuang in my lifetime,

406
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:04,707
yet I'm trapped within the palace walls.

407
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:05,827
This time,

408
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:07,947
you and Jing must

409
00:34:07,947 --> 00:34:09,947
take a good look at Dahuang for me.

410
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:11,184
Okay.

411
00:34:12,027 --> 00:34:13,106
Rest assured, Grandfather.

412
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:14,027
If I see grains

413
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:15,826
I haven't seen before,

414
00:34:16,146 --> 00:34:17,106
I will have the caravan

415
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:18,666
bring them back to you.

416
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:19,707
Alright.

417
00:34:28,626 --> 00:34:29,227
Nian.

418
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:30,787
If you're bored

419
00:34:30,787 --> 00:34:31,947
on Wushen Mountain,

420
00:34:32,146 --> 00:34:34,106
keep Father company on Xiyan Mountain.

421
00:34:35,146 --> 00:34:38,227
Remember, never set foot
in the Central Plains.

422
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:41,186
Xiaoyao.

423
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:43,426
I've even been to the battlefield.

424
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,707
Although Qin Mang fought the battles,

425
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:47,507
I have seen all the bloodshed

426
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:48,707
and the deceased.

427
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:50,067
I know my limits.

428
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:51,067
Don't worry.

429
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:53,267
Yeah.

430
00:34:53,707 --> 00:34:55,186
Our Nian has grown up.

431
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:56,267
By the way,

432
00:34:57,186 --> 00:34:58,947
I have a wedding gift for you.

433
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:06,027
Here is the wedding gift for you.

434
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:10,267
I wish you and Jing a happy marriage

435
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:12,346
and everlasting love.

436
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:17,626
Haven't you already given me a gift?

437
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,267
Why are you giving me another one?

438
00:35:20,304 --> 00:35:21,707
But one can never have too many gifts.

439
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:23,027
Since you give me,

440
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:24,267
I'll accept it.

441
00:35:24,947 --> 00:35:25,507
Xiaoyao.

442
00:35:26,386 --> 00:35:27,307
Take this doll

443
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:29,106
to travel the world.

444
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:30,507
Make up

445
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:32,947
for what I long for

446
00:35:33,626 --> 00:35:34,426
but can't get.

447
00:35:36,826 --> 00:35:37,386
Alright.

448
00:35:40,947 --> 00:35:43,987
This doll is quite cute.

449
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:53,987
Grandfather.

450
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:54,987
Father.

451
00:35:55,426 --> 00:35:56,346
We're leaving.

452
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:57,584
Go ahead.

453
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:11,346
Where shall we go?

454
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:13,067
Let's go around.

455
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:14,416
Okay.

456
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:23,747
I forgot to tell Cang Xuan

457
00:36:24,586 --> 00:36:26,267
that Xiaoyao and Jing are leaving.

458
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:30,666
Me too.

459
00:36:33,146 --> 00:36:35,626
Xiaoyao fulfilled Heng's

460
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,267
unfulfilled wish.

461
00:36:39,826 --> 00:36:41,507
As long as the world is in peace,

462
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:43,547
our Xiaoyao

463
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,586
can live well.

464
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:49,067
We've lived up to the expectations
of Your Majesty and the Great Emperor.

465
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:50,146
The medical books are compiled

466
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:51,826
after 57 years.

467
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:53,987
It consists of 55 volumes,

468
00:36:54,227 --> 00:36:55,146
divided into two parts.

469
00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:57,186
Thirty-seven volumes record

470
00:36:57,186 --> 00:36:58,267
the herbs, prescriptions,

471
00:36:58,426 --> 00:36:59,707
and medical skills throughout Dahuang,

472
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:01,106
discussing life and death.

473
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:03,947
Eighteen volumes
are on illness prevention,

474
00:37:04,386 --> 00:37:06,267
discussing the way
of cultivating yin and yang.

475
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:10,146
Please name the books,

476
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:11,826
Your Majesty.

477
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,507
(People's Inner Health,
People's External Health)

478
00:37:16,507 --> 00:37:18,346
The thirty-seven volumes

479
00:37:18,346 --> 00:37:20,027
discussing life and death

480
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:23,987
are named "People's External Health".

481
00:37:24,987 --> 00:37:27,146
The eighteen volumes discussing the way

482
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:28,426
of cultivating yin and yang

483
00:37:29,027 --> 00:37:32,186
are named "People's Inner Health".

484
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:34,947
These two medical books

485
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:37,787
can relieve people from illness and pain

486
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:39,586
and bring them joy.

487
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:41,106
It benefits Your Majesty

488
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,626
and all the people in the world,

489
00:37:44,227 --> 00:37:46,787
which is a merit
that will last for generations.

490
00:37:47,987 --> 00:37:48,947
In 57 years,

491
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:51,947
a total of 68 physicians participated

492
00:37:51,947 --> 00:37:53,027
in the compilation.

493
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:55,747
A total of 3773 physicians collected

494
00:37:55,947 --> 00:37:57,227
and organized related materials.

495
00:37:57,787 --> 00:37:58,747
To collect herbs,

496
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:00,906
they've been to every corner of Dahuang.

497
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:02,906
Thirty-eight people

498
00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:04,626
fell off the cliffs and died.

499
00:38:05,747 --> 00:38:06,626
Fifty-two people

500
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,826
went missing
in mountain floods and blizzards.

501
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,507
Sixty-one people

502
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:12,626
died from poisons,
miasmas, and monsters.

503
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:14,547
And seven physicians

504
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:15,787
died from illness

505
00:38:16,947 --> 00:38:18,106
with their pens in hand,

506
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:19,467
documenting prescriptions.

507
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:25,584
(Compilation of medical books,
Xiling Jiuyao)

508
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,136
(Compilation of medical books,
Xiling Jiuyao)

509
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:51,472
(Xiling Jiuyao)

510
00:38:55,248 --> 00:38:57,488
(Compilation of medical books,
Xiling Jiuyao)

511
00:39:00,267 --> 00:39:01,227
Convey my decree.

512
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:03,146
Erect a monument for commemoration.

513
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:06,386
Inscribe the names of all the physicians

514
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:10,106
who participated in the compilation
and collection on the monument

515
00:39:10,586 --> 00:39:12,106
to record their achievements

516
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:16,067
for the later generations
to remember and admire them.

517
00:39:26,626 --> 00:39:27,386
Today,

518
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:28,787
I'm going to tell you

519
00:39:28,947 --> 00:39:31,586
a story called

520
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:32,987
"The Legend of Dahuang".

521
00:39:33,426 --> 00:39:34,586
In Dahuang,

522
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:36,547
there once was a folk song,

523
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,586
which was widely circulated.

524
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:43,146
It is about one mountain, two kingdoms,
three royal clans, and Four Great Clans.

525
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,307
We know the Four Great Clans.

526
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:46,146
Chishui.

527
00:39:46,346 --> 00:39:46,906
Tushan.

528
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:47,707
Xiling.

529
00:39:47,826 --> 00:39:48,626
Guifang.

530
00:39:49,426 --> 00:39:50,747
But what are the three royal clans?

531
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:52,666
There is only the Xiyan royal clan.

532
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:53,906
Young man.

533
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:55,426
Be patient.

534
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:57,586
You don't know the story.

535
00:39:57,707 --> 00:39:59,707
That's why you must listen to me.

536
00:40:00,507 --> 00:40:01,146
It all happened

537
00:40:01,146 --> 00:40:02,826
a long,

538
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:04,547
long time ago.

539
00:40:07,586 --> 00:40:08,987
Alright, I will be patient.

540
00:40:10,227 --> 00:40:10,747
Today,

541
00:40:10,987 --> 00:40:12,186
I am going to talk about

542
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:16,586
the one mountain, two kingdoms,
three royal clans, and Four Great Clans.

543
00:40:17,467 --> 00:40:21,426
Let's start with the wealthiest
among the Four Great Clans in Dahuang.

544
00:40:21,904 --> 00:40:22,467
Sorry.

545
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:23,024
Xiaoyao.

546
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:29,586
What did you say?

547
00:40:30,547 --> 00:40:31,987
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

548
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:33,507
It's okay.

549
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:38,027
- Great.
- Great.

550
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:42,707
Xuan.

551
00:40:43,426 --> 00:40:44,906
Are you thinking of Xiaoyao again?

552
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,866
Water flows to the sea.

553
00:40:49,386 --> 00:40:50,386
Birds return to the forest.

554
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:53,067
Xiaoyao returned
to the place she came from.

555
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:56,106
I wonder where she is

556
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:58,146
and whether she is doing well.

557
00:41:00,947 --> 00:41:02,106
Xiaoyao could be

558
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:03,666
the lady selling flowers.

559
00:41:04,426 --> 00:41:05,227
She could be

560
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:07,386
the woman
buying sweet soup for her child.

561
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:09,507
She could be

562
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:11,507
the merchant
dozing off in front of the stall.

563
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:18,426
Seeing them,

564
00:41:18,866 --> 00:41:20,626
you can tell that wherever she is,

565
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:22,586
she must be doing very well.

566
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,787
Xiaoyao is among the masses.

567
00:41:26,747 --> 00:41:29,507
The masses are Xiaoyao.

568
00:41:29,507 --> 00:41:31,707
- Great.
