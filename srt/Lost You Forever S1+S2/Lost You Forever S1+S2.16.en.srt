00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,544
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:44,219
Father, can I avoid being
the Princess of Haoling?

4
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:46,819
I love being your daughter,

5
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:48,458
but not the princess.

6
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,051
No.

7
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,290
Why not?

8
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:53,650
Because you're my daughter.

9
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:54,771
And I am the King.

10
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,691
But it's so troublesome
to be the princess.

11
00:01:58,811 --> 00:01:59,890
It's all about manners

12
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:01,290
whatever I do.

13
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,691
And I'll be sacrificed
to a political marriage.

14
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:05,411
It's too much for me.

15
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:08,290
Everyone should have manners.

16
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,570
It's not a bad thing to learn.

17
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,811
As for the marriage,

18
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,570
whom do you think I'll sacrifice you to?

19
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,531
I have no idea.

20
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,731
Anyway, Father, I don't want to
be the Princess of Haoling.

21
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:28,171
Let me have it my way.

22
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:31,130
Father.

23
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,050
Fine, do as you wish.

24
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:34,690
We will talk again.

25
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:37,570
I know you're the best.

26
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,531
I'm back.

27
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,770
My father told me

28
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:00,251
that my look changed
because of a rare weapon

29
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,050
sealed in my body
rather than a rare disease.

30
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,690
Once he gets it out,

31
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,971
I will go back to normal.

32
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:07,930
That's good.

33
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:12,451
What if

34
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:14,570
I am really ugly,

35
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:15,650
what will you do?

36
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,011
You are not.

37
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:18,531
What if I am?

38
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,650
Good.

39
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:22,690
You'd find it good if I'm ugly?

40
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,891
Everyone can tell if you're pretty.

41
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,331
But your inner beauty
can't be seen with eyes.

42
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,770
I'll keep it to myself.

43
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,171
What inner beauty?

44
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,011
I'm very dark.

45
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:35,971
What I find pretty

46
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,690
may seem ugly to someone else.

47
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,130
It's very personal.

48
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,011
There is no right and wrong.

49
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,371
That's why people say, "Love is blind."

50
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:54,611
Xiaoliu.

51
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,770
I have to go.

52
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,490
I've been worried about you.

53
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,930
But seeing that His Majesty
and Cang Xuan are nice to you

54
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:07,731
and that you're happy,

55
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,331
I feel relieved.

56
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,570
I have to go back and work on my things.

57
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:15,930
I know. Take care.

58
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:18,931
I will.

59
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:22,611
I know your big brother

60
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,931
did that because of your mom,
but he shouldn't

61
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:28,211
have taken revenge on you.

62
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:30,090
Even if you pity him

63
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,051
and want to make peace,

64
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,771
you must be careful

65
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,611
not to let him hurt you again.

66
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,850
Don't worry.

67
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:41,651
I'm not worried.

68
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,410
I just find you a bit dumb.

69
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,731
So it's a kindly reminder.

70
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:47,891
I am a bit dumb.

71
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:10,211
In 15 years,

72
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:13,451
don't open up your heart to another man.

73
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:18,931
What about 15 years later?

74
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,690
Can I open up my heart to another man?

75
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,731
Don't worry.

76
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:32,611
Fifteen years.

77
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,651
I'll wait for you.

78
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,810
Tushan Jing left.

79
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,530
Are you very upset?

80
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:14,211
Not so much.

81
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:18,171
I thought you enjoyed his company.

82
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:22,731
I did enjoy his company.

83
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:24,850
But I also know

84
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,011
that no one can keep me company forever.

85
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:33,611
Even my own mother ended up leaving me.

86
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,850
How can I entrust my happiness

87
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,810
to a man?

88
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:42,290
Unexpected, right?

89
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:44,171
This is how cold-hearted I am.

90
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,651
You're not cold-hearted.

91
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,530
You're sensible.

92
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,690
We've been through so many departures

93
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,891
and suffered that pain

94
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,891
so many times.

95
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:03,850
It doesn't want to hurt again

96
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:07,370
and has learned to protect itself.

97
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:15,810
Cang Xuan.

98
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,171
Have you ever had this feeling?

99
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,891
No matter how happy you are,

100
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:23,810
you feel that deep down,

101
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,370
another half of you keeps

102
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,051
reminding you that you will

103
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,051
lose everything.

104
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,250
Such sensibility

105
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,410
induced a gentle sadness

106
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,011
even in the happiest moment.

107
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:38,250
And when you lose what you have,

108
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,370
you accept it peacefully

109
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:42,290
no matter how sad you are

110
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:44,211
because you've seen it coming.

111
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:48,931
No ultimate happiness.

112
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,491
No ultimate grief.

113
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:56,370
I thought only I was like that.

114
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,530
Now that you're back,

115
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:04,250
I'm not alone anymore.

116
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,090
Sorry.

117
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,410
I was...

118
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,171
I know.

119
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,250
You have your reasons.

120
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,051
Actually...

121
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:29,530
Actually, I've always had doubts

122
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,730
about that thing.

123
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:36,490
You disgrace!

124
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,091
Princess General?

125
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:40,930
Fight for the kingdom?

126
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,091
Your mother is

127
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:44,730
an utter liar!

128
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,771
She committed adultery

129
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:48,651
with Chi Chen and gave birth to you!

130
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,130
King of Haoling

131
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:54,091
will kill you sooner or later.

132
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,730
Not just those two maids.

133
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,930
The nine-tailed fox also told me

134
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,091
while holding me captive

135
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:11,490
that I'm not the daughter of the king,

136
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,730
but the demon Chi Chen.

137
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,136
Utter nonsense!

138
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,331
The nine-tailed fox also said

139
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,730
that my mother had been
having an affair with Chi Chen.

140
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,891
They had kept it a secret
from everyone, including my father.

141
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:56,130
If he had found out about it,

142
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,250
he would have gotten rid of me.

143
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,451
And you believe in the nine-tailed fox?

144
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,690
Auntie killed Chi Chen in person.

145
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:26,370
Besides, Master is so smart.

146
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,331
How can he not know
if you're his daughter?

147
00:10:31,851 --> 00:10:33,211
Think about it.

148
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,930
Isn't he nice to you?

149
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,291
The pavilion in Yiqing Garden

150
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,291
has been renovated many times,

151
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:47,050
but my belongings are still there.

152
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:53,291
So

153
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,370
I'm the daughter of my father.

154
00:10:56,651 --> 00:10:58,250
That's for sure.

155
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,411
That's right.

156
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:07,651
How can I be so silly?

157
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,011
Of course, I'm my father's daughter.

158
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:13,011
Tell me if anyone dares to

159
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:15,011
tell you that nonsense.

160
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:16,971
I'll handle them.

161
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:21,570
Alright, I have someone to count on now.

162
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:48,291
(Xiaoyao's appearance change
is not a disease.)

163
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:49,531
(It's not?)

164
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,930
There is a rare weapon
sealed in her body.

165
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:54,651
Rejuvenating Flower.

166
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,570
Master, do you know who sealed it

167
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,011
in Xiaoyao's body?

168
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:09,291
(Rejuvenating Flowers
can change peoples' looks)

169
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:11,291
(and make them look a certain way.)

170
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:14,411
(Who would want to
change Xiaoyao's appearance?)

171
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:16,331
(Master's reaction showed)

172
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,651
(that he knew who had done it.)

173
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,211
Cang Xuan.

174
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:23,570
Xiaoyao...

175
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:27,370
Xiaoyao is different from you.

176
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,091
You must protect her well.

177
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,411
This is an order.

178
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:35,930
Can you do it?

179
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:53,771
The person who wanted
to change Xiaoyao's look

180
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:57,851
was Auntie.

181
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,050
(Whoever her father is,)

182
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,930
(Xiaoyao is my little sister.)

183
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:18,531
(I can't lose her again.)

184
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:20,971
(I'll do whatever it takes)

185
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,810
(to keep her safe.)

186
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:46,930
Princess, take a break.

187
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:48,130
Have some nuts.

188
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,810
I want to finish it soon
and give it to Xuan.

189
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,771
Princess, I've asked around.

190
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:00,531
His Majesty let Wen Xiaoliu
live in Huayin Hall.

191
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,370
He even showed him
around Yiqing Garden yesterday.

192
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:04,370
What spell

193
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:06,971
did he cast on my brother and father?

194
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,570
Father doesn't know
what he has done to me.

195
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,971
I have to tell Father

196
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,810
to punish him.

197
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:17,730
Princess.

198
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:28,050
Father, I have something to say.

199
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,331
Sit down first.

200
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:39,490
Father.

201
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:42,170
Someone assaulted me.

202
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,011
Who?

203
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:44,531
Wen Xiaoliu.

204
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,651
He was so disrespectful.

205
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:49,411
H-He even touched my hand and my back

206
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,891
and said a load of

207
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,451
utter nonsense.

208
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,771
Father, you must do me justice

209
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:55,930
and punish him.

210
00:14:56,971 --> 00:14:58,170
Wen Xiaoliu...

211
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,211
He...

212
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,091
He doesn't bear any ill will.

213
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,810
So don't mind him.

214
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,930
But he's insulted me.

215
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:10,250
How can I let go?

216
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:16,331
In a few days,

217
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:18,690
I will make a serious announcement.

218
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:20,411
I promise that

219
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:23,130
you won't mind him

220
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:25,531
taking advantage of you.

221
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,570
What kind of serious announcement?

222
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,730
Well...

223
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:32,891
I can't tell you yet.

224
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,730
It's good news, anyway.

225
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:56,490
What did His Majesty say?

226
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,730
He told me not to mind it.

227
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,331
He also said he'd make
a serious announcement.

228
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,250
And then I won't mind it.

229
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,291
You won't mind it?

230
00:16:07,771 --> 00:16:09,851
I thought His Majesty
would issue an edict

231
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:11,170
to cut Wen Xiaoliu's hands.

232
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:12,370
Haitang,

233
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,170
what would make a woman

234
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,211
not mind a man taking advantage of her?

235
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,730
And it's good news.

236
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,930
Oh my goodness.

237
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:32,490
Is he going to hold a wedding for me?

238
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,570
Is he making me marry that rogue?

239
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,651
No, no way.

240
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:37,690
Wen Xiaoliu is just a lowly person,

241
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,690
a lowly deity without spirit power.

242
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,570
How can he possibly marry you?

243
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,091
Princess, easy.

244
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:45,651
His Majesty can't be so reckless.

245
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:48,091
But Father never cares
about family background.

246
00:16:48,211 --> 00:16:50,570
He's promoted so many poor young men,

247
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:51,651
lowly deities,

248
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:52,930
and lowly demons these years.

249
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:55,610
Wasn't Qin Mang just a cowherd?

250
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,810
Maybe we should ask
Her Highness for help.

251
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,690
What can Mother do apart from crying?

252
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,330
(Mother was a laborer in a village
before she got married.)

253
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,811
(Now, it's highly likely
that Father is making me)

254
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,610
(marry a physician.)

255
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:29,531
What a pity.

256
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:31,970
This is water from Guixu Waterhole.

257
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:34,691
Your Highness,

258
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:35,891
what brought you here?

259
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,210
Are you alright?

260
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,811
Not at all.

261
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,450
Stay away.

262
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,291
I will fight back if you hit me.

263
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:56,090
Listen, I will never marry you.

264
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:57,051
If you marry me,

265
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:57,931
I'll fight you

266
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:59,130
and torture you every day.

267
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,330
I won't let you

268
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,450
live a day in peace.

269
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:07,531
I didn't think of marrying you.

270
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:10,370
Really?

271
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:12,411
Of course.

272
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,210
But I'm the Princess of Haoling.

273
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,130
I won't marry you exactly because

274
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,811
you're the princess.

275
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:26,330
Then you should do worse so that

276
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,730
Father doesn't like you.

277
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,610
Make him loathe you.

278
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:30,051
If you do well,

279
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,090
I'll forgive you.

280
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,531
I won't bother you.

281
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,090
Okay, I promise.

282
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,250
Your father won't let you marry me.

283
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,210
Promise?

284
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,610
I swear.

285
00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:45,531
I swear.

286
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:49,171
His Majesty will never
make the princess marry me.

287
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,610
Or I will die

288
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,051
a miserable death.

289
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,730
I will believe you for now.

290
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,931
Master.

291
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:16,330
I'm going back to Xiyan.

292
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:24,771
You haven't cultivated your power.

293
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,296
On the contrary, your two uncles

294
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:30,210
have run the Xiyan court for years
and taken in many followers.

295
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,370
It's not the time for you to go back.

296
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,531
I know what you're trying to say.

297
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:37,450
The best way to go back safely

298
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:39,411
is to bide my time

299
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,090
and cultivate power.

300
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:42,891
But I can't wait.

301
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,651
I must go back to Xiyan

302
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,210
and get everything back.

303
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:49,811
Only then can I protect
the people I care about.

304
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:37,090
I heard Nian came today.

305
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,011
You had a nice chat

306
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,171
without fighting?

307
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:45,330
Yeah, we had a nice chat.

308
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,051
That's good.

309
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,490
If Nian and I
fought right in front of you,

310
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:52,811
who would you help?

311
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:57,931
Whom do you think I'd help?

312
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,931
How would I know?

313
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,490
It wouldn't happen.

314
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,330
Because you're not like Nian.

315
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,850
You won't give me a hard time.

316
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:16,011
You're really good at coaxing women.

317
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,291
Got me scared.

318
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:27,171
I once thought that

319
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:29,931
you'd be like Nian,

320
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:32,330
who grew up being taken care of

321
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,931
without seeing
the dark side of the world

322
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:36,250
and had whatever you wanted.

323
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:38,250
If that's the case,

324
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:41,571
I'd shelter you from all the bad things.

325
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,291
But

326
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,691
you're completely different
from what I imagined.

327
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,051
You're disappointed?

328
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:55,571
No.

329
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,090
You've seen the dark side of the world.

330
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,691
So I'm not worried that I'd terrify you

331
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,811
with my true self.

332
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:06,816
You can understand and accept

333
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:10,291
both the good and bad things about me.

334
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:13,411
Xiaoyao.

335
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:18,931
You're better than my best imagination.

336
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,210
I'm not that good.

337
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:32,970
I'm going back to Zhaoyun Peak.

338
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,490
It's good.

339
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:46,051
You have to go back, anyway.

340
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,571
Won't you go?

341
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,730
I wonder if the swing is still there
under the Poinciana tree.

342
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:04,970
If it's gone,

343
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,370
we'll make another one.

344
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,651
Alright, let's make it the way it was.

345
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,850
The Zhaoyun Hall

346
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,571
used to be a happy place.

347
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,730
Now, we're the only two left.

348
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,931
No matter how hard the journey is,

349
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:33,171
I'm no longer embarking on it alone.

350
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,891
Granny held our hands
before she passed away

351
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:42,210
and said that we were poor kids

352
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,411
who should support
and take care of each other.

353
00:23:52,571 --> 00:23:56,370
She seemed to know our fate.

354
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,531
Go to bed.

355
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:20,850
Xuan,

356
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:27,130
I decided to be the Princess of Haoling.

357
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,970
Didn't you turn it down
when Master told you to?

358
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,450
You changed your mind?

359
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,891
I think Father is right.

360
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,130
If I am Princess of Haoling,

361
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,250
before anyone tries to harm me,

362
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,450
they must figure out

363
00:25:43,171 --> 00:25:46,051
whether they can
withstand the wrath of the emperor

364
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,330
and the power of a kingdom.

365
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:49,730
Are you doing it for me?

366
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,571
I am going to Xiyan,

367
00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:55,850
so you want to stand by my side

368
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,011
as Great Princess of Haoling

369
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,531
and assist me.

370
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,970
Not entirely.

371
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,011
Because I think

372
00:26:02,011 --> 00:26:04,250
being a princess is not completely bad.

373
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,011
I can bully others with power

374
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,250
and be arrogant.

375
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:12,090
I can grab whatever I like.

376
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:26,651
(Granny, Father,)

377
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,490
(Mother, Auntie.)

378
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,411
(Thank you for helping me
reunite with Xiaoyao.)

379
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,931
(This time,)

380
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:39,090
(I'll protect
my little sister for sure.)

381
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,691
(Since you chose to
return to Xiyan Mountain,)

382
00:26:45,651 --> 00:26:48,490
(despite the trials
and tribulations ahead,)

383
00:26:49,571 --> 00:26:51,051
(I'll help you fulfill your dreams)

384
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:53,490
(on your side.)

385
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,931
You've made up your mind?

386
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,891
Yes.

387
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,291
Why?

388
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,571
Are you worried

389
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:23,531
that I might cause trouble
as the Great Princess of Haoling?

390
00:27:23,531 --> 00:27:24,931
Did you change your mind?

391
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,090
I'm not worried about that.

392
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:34,450
Why do I work so hard to be the emperor?

393
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,210
I can't do anything myself.

394
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,691
Firstly, I don't have time.

395
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,490
Secondly, if I make a mistake,

396
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,651
the imperial censors
will say that I'm incapable.

397
00:27:44,411 --> 00:27:46,051
If I'm truly incapable,

398
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:47,531
then you have no freedom.

399
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,250
But since I have no freedom,

400
00:27:50,811 --> 00:27:53,130
you're free to do whatever you want.

401
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:55,291
It's all because I'm capable,

402
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,691
authentic, and powerful enough

403
00:27:56,811 --> 00:27:57,970
to take care of everything.

404
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:06,691
Thank you, Father.

405
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,771
Before I make the announcement,

406
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,970
you go to Mount Jade.

407
00:28:15,411 --> 00:28:17,210
I told Queen Mother
about you in the letter.

408
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,450
She agreed to restore your look.

409
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,931
Great, I'll go with her.

410
00:28:27,891 --> 00:28:28,850
Thank you, Father.

411
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:48,970
Master,

412
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,931
are you upset that I came along to Zhiyi

413
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,531
without your permission?

414
00:28:57,931 --> 00:29:00,051
I didn't want to be
so shameless, either.

415
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,411
But you've been cold to me

416
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:04,651
and shunning me.

417
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,970
You haven't seen me as your fiancee.

418
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,970
So I could only ask

419
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:13,130
Grand Madam for help.

420
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:30,931
Miss Fangfeng,

421
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,850
once we go back from Zhiyi,

422
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:37,171
let's cancel the marriage.

423
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,370
What did you say?

424
00:29:43,171 --> 00:29:45,571
We barely know each other.

425
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,051
We're not in love.

426
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,291
Our marriage is only
meant to connect our families.

427
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,651
It's good for us to cancel it.

428
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:57,610
The world knows how I feel about you.

429
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,651
How can you do this to me?

430
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,130
You've been serving Grand Madam

431
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,011
and taking care
of the household for years.

432
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:08,571
My family and I owe you big time.

433
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,291
I promise.

434
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:12,130
Once we cancel the marriage,

435
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,450
my family will keep supporting yours.

436
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,250
Apart from that,

437
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:18,850
I will try my best

438
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:21,090
to give you whatever you want.

439
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:26,291
What I value is you,

440
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:28,970
not the Tushan Family.

441
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:31,811
How can you doubt my feelings?

442
00:30:31,891 --> 00:30:33,970
You haven't even seen me before.

443
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:36,691
You have no idea what I'm like.

444
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:39,811
You don't even know if I'm a good man.

445
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,651
Your feeling is like a phantom.

446
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:44,571
It's untrustworthy

447
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,490
and may hurt you.

448
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,651
Miss Fangfeng,

449
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:58,330
I have hidden injuries
and no great ambitions.

450
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:00,291
I'm not the right man for you.

451
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:24,130
( Inn)
This inn in Zhiyi belongs to the Haoling.

452
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,291
It's safe.

453
00:31:25,771 --> 00:31:27,291
Let's rest here for the night

454
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,970
and head to Mount Jade tomorrow.

455
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,691
Isn't it too shanty?

456
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:33,051
Xuan, let's stay somewhere else.

457
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,771
We are traveling
as disciples of Dragon Squad.

458
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:37,330
Let's lay low

459
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:38,850
to avoid attention.

460
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:41,811
I'll do as you say.

461
00:31:42,811 --> 00:31:43,450
Cang Xuan.

462
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,490
Many royals
of the Central Plains gather here.

463
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,330
Some young kids

464
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,171
may be arrogant.

465
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,811
If you meet any,

466
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:54,411
try to avoid them

467
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:55,571
and ignore them.

468
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:57,090
If they are really rude,

469
00:31:57,171 --> 00:31:58,011
leave them to me.

470
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,370
Alright, senior.
I will be extra careful.

471
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,730
I knew you said it to me.

472
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,210
You're the smart one.

473
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,610
Others are all dumb. okay?

474
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,090
I heard that Zhiyi

475
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,490
has a nice Jingshui Lake.

476
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:12,850
The view is said to be amazing.

477
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,411
And it's a famous tourist attraction.

478
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:17,771
That's right. Let's go sightseeing

479
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:18,771
and have some fish.

480
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,850
Great.

481
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:28,210
I'll get things ready for tomorrow.

482
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,370
Enjoy the lake.

483
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:55,691
The sauce

484
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:57,771
is my secret recipe.

485
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,771
I can guarantee

486
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,411
that my grilled fish

487
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,250
tastes the best and it's the most unique

488
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,210
throughout Dahuang.

489
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,531
Here. Try it.

490
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,651
No, thanks. It's so dirty.

491
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,090
It's good.

492
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,291
Here, I've removed the skin.

493
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,891
Try the flesh.

494
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:40,330
It's not dirty. It's good.

495
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,171
Since you're begging me,

496
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,651
I will take a bite.

497
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,330
Yeah, I am begging you.

498
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:54,210
How is it?

499
00:33:58,651 --> 00:33:59,490
Have some more.

500
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,450
When did you become so close?

501
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:05,891
Who is close to him?

502
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:16,690
Don't forget our deal.

503
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,131
Of course. I won't forget.

504
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,490
I've taken a vow.

505
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,771
What a delicate new ship.

506
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,331
Only this type of ship

507
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:41,571
is good enough for you

508
00:34:41,571 --> 00:34:43,371
as the daughter of Lord of Zhiyi.

509
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,611
I designed it on my own.

510
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:46,930
My big brother got the best craftsmen

511
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,250
in the Chishui Clan to build it.

512
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,851
If you like it,

513
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:52,410
I can design another one

514
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,450
for you and Jing

515
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,531
as your wedding gift.

516
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:57,690
Please stop teasing me.

517
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,291
Your wedding is coming soon, right?

518
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:02,131
Granny is in poor health.

519
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,851
Jing and I have decided

520
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,650
to hold the wedding when she's better.

521
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,011
I see.

522
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,410
I heard that
you play the zither really well.

523
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,811
I haven't heard you play.

524
00:35:14,051 --> 00:35:15,611
Will I be so lucky

525
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:16,811
to enjoy the music today?

526
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,851
That's easy.

527
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:20,051
I only hope you don't despise me

528
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,410
for being worse than Jing.

529
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:26,650
Xiaoliu, who taught you how to cook?

530
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:28,131
I learned by myself.

531
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,650
How?

532
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,331
I couldn't cook at first.

533
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:34,410
But I was starving to death.

534
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,611
So I had to try.

535
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:38,410
Slowly, I found ways

536
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,450
to feed myself.

537
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:43,930
Let me grill some shrimp for you.

538
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:47,730
I will do those from now on.

539
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:49,611
You can sit tight like Nian

540
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,490
and wait for food.

541
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,091
Okay.

542
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,371
It's good.
It's better than Xiaoliu's fish.

543
00:37:01,811 --> 00:37:02,890
What a nice song.

544
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:05,531
You haven't heard anything good.

545
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:26,811
What a pity.

546
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:28,930
If you want,

547
00:37:29,571 --> 00:37:31,811
I'll make him play for you.

548
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,771
Haitang, bring my flute.

549
00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:35,371
Understood.

550
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:41,170
Father is highly skilled in music

551
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,851
and has taught him in person.

552
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,490
He may not be as good as Master Qingqiu,

553
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:47,011
but he's not bad.

554
00:38:10,091 --> 00:38:11,210
Who's playing the flute?

555
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:13,771
It matches your zither so well.

556
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:22,690
You've mastered the zither.

557
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:25,730
And this person can make it
match your zither so well.

558
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:27,210
What a soulmate.

559
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,930
Linglan, turn the ship.

560
00:38:39,331 --> 00:38:41,851
I'd like to meet the flute player.

561
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:42,851
Understood.

562
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,170
They turned around.

563
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,490
The zither matched your flute perfectly.

564
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,490
I wonder if it's a woman playing.

565
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:20,650
What's wrong?

566
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:21,890
I had enough.

567
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:23,930
Alright, I'll stop.

568
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,131
We're getting closer to the flute.

569
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,730
Why did it stop?

570
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:30,091
Never mind.

571
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:33,250
I think the flute player
is on a ship nearby.

572
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,291
I toast you.

573
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,690
(Prince of Xiyan.)

574
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,690
What are you looking at?

575
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:46,811
Did you see the flute player?

576
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:49,371
No, I don't think so.

577
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:51,170
It's just that the smell

578
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,210
of the grill made me hungry.

579
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,811
I'll get you some for a taste

580
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,410
in case you complain to Jing about it.

581
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,611
You're teasing me again.

582
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:01,771
Hurry up.

583
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:02,690
Understood.

584
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:07,331
Excuse me.

585
00:40:07,611 --> 00:40:09,611
Bring us some of your grilled food.

586
00:40:09,771 --> 00:40:11,930
If my lady likes it,

587
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:13,131
you will be rewarded.

588
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,450
Arrogant rich people.

589
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:15,371
Go away.

590
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,811
My lady said,

591
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,371
"Arrogant rich people.

592
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,250
Go away."

593
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:22,131
What did you say?

594
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:22,970
It's what I said.

595
00:40:23,371 --> 00:40:24,851
My lady said,

596
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:26,531
"Arrogant rich people.

597
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:27,730
Go away."

598
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:29,890
I dare you to say that again!

599
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:37,811
Go ahead.

600
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,531
Arrogant rich people.

601
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:42,730
Go away.

602
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,250
You…

603
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:54,851
Let's eat.

604
00:40:59,371 --> 00:41:00,690
Impressive.

605
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:04,650
Let me see who's so bold and reckless.

606
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:08,051
Forget it. I wanted to taste it.

607
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,450
It's not a big deal.

608
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:13,210
Zhiyi features
all powers of the Central Plains.

609
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,690
If you cross any royal families,

610
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:17,170
there will be trouble.

611
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:18,970
Let's not cause any trouble.

612
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,291
What kind of royal family

613
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,930
cruises the lake on a fishing boat?

614
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,131
Besides, we're at Zhiyi.

615
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:26,250
I have no reason

616
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,531
to be so cautious at home.

617
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:30,250
I shouldn't be so timid.

618
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,970
You're the daughter

619
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,450
of the Lord of Zhiyi.

620
00:41:33,811 --> 00:41:35,890
Your brother will
take over the Chishui Clan.

621
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,170
Being timid and cautious like me

622
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,131
doesn't suit your status.

623
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,410
I wouldn't disgrace
my father and brother.

624
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,170
Otherwise...

625
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:47,371
Linglan, pay them

626
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,091
whatever they want.

627
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,531
I don't believe they won't say yes.

628
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:52,571
Understood.

629
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:02,450
My lady said,

630
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,210
"Bring us your grills.

631
00:42:04,531 --> 00:42:05,690
You can ask for

632
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,970
whatever you want."

633
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:11,730
We don't need money.

634
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,611
But we wouldn't say no

635
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:15,611
to something nice.

636
00:42:16,091 --> 00:42:17,970
We just don't know what you have.

637
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:21,811
You can't find many things
my lady doesn't have.

638
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,890
Go ahead.

639
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,811
We dare not ask for something fancy.

640
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,851
I heard that the Fusang Tree at Tanggu

641
00:42:27,851 --> 00:42:29,011
can heat up without fire.

642
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,930
We'd like a bunch of those branches

643
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:33,170
to grill the rest of our food.

644
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,051
How dare you tease me!

645
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,291
Everyone knows how rare they are.

646
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,250
Even a small chunk is rare to find.

647
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,890
And you asked for a bunch?

648
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,011
Do you think it's the firewood you use?

649
00:42:44,011 --> 00:42:45,730
You told me to name the price.

650
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:47,450
How am I teasing you?

651
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:49,690
Think twice before you talk.

652
00:42:49,811 --> 00:42:52,250
Otherwise, joke on you.

653
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:11,890
Well done, Haitang.

654
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,170
You will be rewarded.

655
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,210
Thank you.

656
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:18,970
The maid surely learns from her master.

657
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:32,690
You know her?

658
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,851
The woman in the red gown

659
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,331
is Fangfeng Yiying.

660
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:40,331
So it's her.

661
00:43:45,811 --> 00:43:46,890
You're so rude.

662
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,771
You can turn us down

663
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,811
if you don't wish to sell us your food.

664
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,170
Why tease her and hit her?

665
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,210
We teased her and hit her?

666
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,011
Who was rude in the first place?

667
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:57,890
Who bragged first?

668
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:58,890
Who started the fight?

669
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,291
The maid learned from her master.

670
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,131
We can tell who's rude.

671
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,531
I was wondering what kind of people

672
00:44:05,531 --> 00:44:07,851
would drive such a ship
and be a disgrace.

673
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:08,690
Then I saw you.

674
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:10,851
Your ship looks just like you.

675
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:11,410
You…

676
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,490
Sister, it's all my fault.

677
00:44:16,811 --> 00:44:19,051
If I hadn't asked to taste their food,

678
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,811
you wouldn't be bullied.

679
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:23,851
Since I started it,

680
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:25,250
let me handle it.

681
00:44:25,811 --> 00:44:27,611
Your father and brother

682
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:28,811
won't blame you.

683
00:44:29,051 --> 00:44:29,851
Thank you.

684
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,730
Apologize now.

685
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,611
Or I will take measures.

686
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:45,811
Fine, I'd like to admire your measures.

687
00:45:05,091 --> 00:45:05,611
Go.

688
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:06,851
Go.

689
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:18,890
Watch out!

690
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,291
Look after Nian.

691
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:22,930
Okay.

692
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:24,331
Go.

693
00:45:40,851 --> 00:45:41,371
Go.

694
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,531
I can't swim.
