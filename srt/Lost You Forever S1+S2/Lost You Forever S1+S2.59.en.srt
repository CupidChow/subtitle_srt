3
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:43,514
Xiaoyao.

4
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:47,594
Xiaoyao.

5
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:49,594
Xiaoyao.

6
00:01:50,274 --> 00:01:52,955
Xiaoyao!

7
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:52,755
What tea is it?

8
00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:55,675
How can it produce

9
00:02:57,354 --> 00:02:58,915
such a realistic illusion?

10
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,475
It's tea from the divine tree
on Mount Dushuo.

11
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:06,195
It blooms once every 3,000 years,

12
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:08,074
bears fruit once every 3,000 years,

13
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:10,835
and matures once every 3,000 years.

14
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,675
It takes 9,000 years of cultivation

15
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:16,874
to bear the "Karma Fruit".

16
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:20,115
Illusion of Karma.

17
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:23,594
What did you see in the illusion?

18
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,115
I killed Tushan Jing.

19
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:31,994
Xiaoyao couldn't bear to kill me.

20
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:36,755
So she killed herself.

21
00:03:37,994 --> 00:03:39,154
I didn't solicit Tushan Hou

22
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:39,955
to kill Tushan Jing.

23
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:43,634
I knew it wasn't you.

24
00:03:44,154 --> 00:03:45,154
If it were you,

25
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:47,275
you wouldn't let Xiaoyao

26
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,794
go to Qingshui Town.

27
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:52,074
Then why did you

28
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,634
interrogate me with

29
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:56,714
the Illusion of Karma?

30
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:01,315
People fear karma but I fear the cause.

31
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:03,395
Without a cause,

32
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:07,115
this tea won't bring out any karma.

33
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:11,634
Xiaoyao grew up among the commoners.

34
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:15,234
She didn't know the sinister means
of the great clans

35
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:17,234
and couldn't notice the flaws.

36
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:18,514
But you?

37
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:22,115
You didn't have the slightest doubt

38
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:24,835
about the origin of the assassins?

39
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:27,835
It was my negligence.

40
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:30,955
Cang Xuan.

41
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:32,314
Tell me the truth.

42
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:34,595
Have you felt secretly pleased

43
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,675
with what happened to Tushan Jing?

44
00:04:44,155 --> 00:04:46,474
You can't easily fool Xiaoyao.

45
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:50,115
She's convinced that
you would investigate thoroughly

46
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,955
and wouldn't miss any clue.

47
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:54,794
You must not

48
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:57,234
fail her trust in you.

49
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:59,354
I will never fail Xiaoyao.

50
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:11,514
You should feel lucky

51
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:15,115
that the mastermind
wasn't as patient as you

52
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,555
and took action before you.

53
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:19,194
Otherwise,

54
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:22,354
what you saw just now
wouldn't be an illusion.

55
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:40,835
Why are you suddenly

56
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:42,155
visiting me, Fenglong?

57
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:48,395
Don't tell me you don't recognize this.

58
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,875
This is Fangfeng Yiying's weapon.

59
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:52,514
So what if I recognize it?

60
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:55,715
All those 108 highly skilled assassins

61
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:58,034
had their faces and traces

62
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:00,155
removed since childhood.

63
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,835
Chenrong Xinyue,

64
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:03,794
the Chenrong Family

65
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:05,314
assigned you these trained assassins

66
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:07,395
to protect yourself

67
00:06:07,395 --> 00:06:08,395
in critical moments,

68
00:06:08,794 --> 00:06:10,395
not to commit evil deeds.

69
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:12,034
Did you do it?

70
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:15,395
Yes, it was me.

71
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:19,715
That was your Brother Jing

72
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:20,995
you grew up with.

73
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:22,835
How could you do that?

74
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,754
Tushan Jing was just collateral.

75
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:30,194
The person I really wanted to kill

76
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:31,675
was Xiling Jiuyao.

77
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:34,194
I didn't expect that Fangfeng Yiying

78
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,034
would develop feelings for an enemy

79
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:37,835
and change her mind.

80
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:40,595
That madman Tushan Hou

81
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,194
accomplished nothing
and spoiled everything.

82
00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:46,194
He could have just killed Jing.

83
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:47,955
But he had to

84
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,194
have a fair fight with Tushan Jing.

85
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:52,314
And he failed.

86
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:53,360
Useless.

87
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:55,234
You are the mad one.

88
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:57,034
Do you know who Xiling Jiuyao is?

89
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:57,955
If you kill her,

90
00:06:57,955 --> 00:06:59,634
will the Great Emperor
and His Majesty let you off?

91
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:01,675
We've been oppressed for centuries

92
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:03,275
and finally got a break.

93
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:04,715
Do you want to put our clan

94
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,675
at risk again?

95
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,875
I had the guts to do it.

96
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:09,354
Of course, I had a way out.

97
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:11,955
Tushan Jing and Xiling Jiuyao

98
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:14,435
made Tushan Hou and Fangfeng Yiying

99
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:16,514
lose everything they had.

100
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:18,595
They killed Tushan Jing

101
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:19,995
and Xiling Jiuyao for revenge.

102
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:21,875
Isn't that a matter of course?

103
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:25,155
Now,

104
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:27,514
Tushan Hou and Fangfeng Yiying are dead.

105
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:29,555
There are no witnesses.

106
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:32,314
You don't have to worry.

107
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,995
You focus on trivial matters all day

108
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:38,194
and end up short-sighted

109
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:39,595
and narrow-minded.

110
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:41,555
How can you fathom

111
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,435
what the Great Emperor
and His Majesty would do?

112
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:45,234
I shouldn't have let you

113
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:47,715
become the queen while you lack virtue

114
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:48,955
for your position.

115
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:50,794
It's brewing trouble!

116
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:51,514
Indeed.

117
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:54,754
I'm not as open-minded
and insightful as you.

118
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,555
Because I grew up

119
00:07:56,555 --> 00:07:58,155
in Xiyan Town as a hostage.

120
00:07:58,675 --> 00:08:00,115
Not only was I mocked and bullied,

121
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:02,314
but I also lived in constant fear,

122
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:05,514
scared that
I'd become a prisoner at any time.

123
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:22,194
But rest assured.

124
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:25,875
I'll bear the consequences.

125
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:28,314
Should trouble arise,

126
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:31,354
you and our family won't be implicated.

127
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:48,475
I've taken care of

128
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:50,035
everything in Qingshui Town.

129
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:51,475
But remember.

130
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:53,795
Just this once.

131
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:56,235
You're on your own from now on.

132
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:38,434
Xiaoyao.

133
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:40,155
Your hair.

134
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:42,155
It's okay.

135
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:44,595
It's just a few strands of grey hair.

136
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:46,514
You're just in time.

137
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:47,835
Help me find

138
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:49,434
an expert of wood attribute

139
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:52,275
to deal with these manuscripts.

140
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:54,994
I want them to be impervious to

141
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:56,955
water, fire, and insects.

142
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:00,395
(I will find you
an expert of wood attribute)

143
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:01,915
(to make these manuscripts)

144
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:03,795
waterproof, fireproof,

145
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:05,155
and insectproof.

146
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:10,035
What's wrong?

147
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:13,275
Nothing.

148
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:16,674
I know

149
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:19,194
you are still angry about

150
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:20,194
the wedding.

151
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:21,395
Xiaoyao.

152
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:26,114
As long as you are alive,

153
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,874
you can do whatever

154
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:30,795
you want.

155
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:33,835
Rest assured.

156
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,835
I haven't compiled my medical book.

157
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:40,674
I will take good care of myself

158
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,795
and wait for Jing.

159
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:49,475
I want to ask you something.

160
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:51,074
Go ahead.

161
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,634
You said it was different this time.

162
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,514
Why is it different?

163
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:00,674
Because Mother and Jing are different.

164
00:11:02,514 --> 00:11:04,035
She was my mother

165
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,715
but she was also a citizen of Xiyan.

166
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:08,795
She values me

167
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:10,795
but her responsibility matters more.

168
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,955
When she was forced to choose,

169
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:15,514
I would inevitably be abandoned.

170
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:17,355
But I don't blame her.

171
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:19,994
After all, she was already

172
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:22,595
a citizen of Xiyan before I was born.

173
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:24,994
So she had a responsibility.

174
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,795
But for Jing,

175
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:33,035
I'm the most important.

176
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:36,235
Mother would abandon me and die.

177
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:40,395
But Jing would live for me.

178
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:43,874
He can't bear to part with me.

179
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:47,114
No matter how hard it is,

180
00:11:48,994 --> 00:11:50,674
he will definitely come back.

181
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:57,035
Tushan Jing is that important to you?

182
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:57,994
Yes, he is.

183
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:02,035
Xuan.

184
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:05,395
I don't believe that Jing is dead.

185
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:07,915
I'll keep looking for him.

186
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:09,715
Do you understand?

187
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:11,915
Yes, I do.

188
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:15,835
I will tell them to keep looking.

Your Majesty.

213
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:44,114
His Majesty returned after

214
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,874
his dinner with the Great Emperor.

215
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:47,434
So early?

216
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:51,314
I thought he would rather stay there.

217
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,114
His Majesty summoned Chief Lirong.

218
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:55,835
I assume that

219
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:57,754
he has matters to attend to.

220
00:13:59,434 --> 00:13:59,994
Your Majesty.

221
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:01,595
His Majesty has arrived.

Linglan.

223
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:06,155
Help me put on makeup.

224
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:09,554
Wipe it and put it in the gift box.

225
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:10,128
Alright.

226
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:11,994
And my zither.

227
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:12,835
Set it up.

228
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,074
Once I present the flute to His Majesty,

229
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:16,874
we can play a duet to test its tone.

230
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:17,955
Understood.

231
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:36,715
Your Majesty.

232
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:37,424
Leave us alone.

233
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:38,416
Understood.

234
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:43,795
Your Majesty.

235
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:46,355
Have I done something wrong?

236
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:48,634
You ordered Tushan Hou
to kill Tushan Jing.

237
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,554
I don't know
what Your Majesty is saying.

238
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:56,395
Wasn't Jing killed by Tushan Hou?

239
00:14:57,994 --> 00:14:59,835
Those assassins were your people, right?

240
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:03,754
I just can't figure out

241
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:05,874
why you wanted to kill Tushan Jing.

242
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:08,074
What do you gain from his death?

243
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:15,114
Your Majesty does not know

244
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,715
the benefits of killing Tushan Jing?

245
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:18,194
He had to die

246
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:20,475
for Your Majesty to marry

247
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:21,915
the one you were longing for.

248
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:26,874
What did you say?

249
00:15:27,074 --> 00:15:29,795
Don't you want to marry Xiling Jiuyao?

250
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:33,595
Don't you feel jealous of Tushan Jing

251
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:35,074
and want him to vanish?

252
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:40,395
I'm asking why you wanted
to kill Tushan Jing.

253
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:43,994
Why?

254
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:54,634
You're so smart,

255
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:56,835
yet you can't see through it.

256
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:58,915
It seems that

257
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:00,715
you've never

258
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:04,314
paid any attention to me.

259
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:08,514
You wanted to kill Xiaoyao.

260
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:09,915
That's right.

261
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:12,795
She was the one I wanted to kill.

262
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:14,955
Chenrong Xinyue.

263
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,795
You are unreasonable

264
00:16:17,795 --> 00:16:18,915
and insatiable.

265
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:20,595
I am unreasonable

266
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:21,955
and insatiable?

267
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:25,595
What about you?

268
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,275
Aren't you also insatiable

269
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,955
and always asking for more?

270
00:16:34,554 --> 00:16:36,074
Before you ascended the throne,

271
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:37,595
you sent your beloved one

272
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:39,434
into another man's arms.

273
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,314
But you regret it once you gain power

274
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:42,835
and try to get her back.

275
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:06,434
Xiyan Cang Xuan.

276
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:08,554
I'm Chenrong Xinyue.

277
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,554
If you have the guts,

278
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,914
demote and execute me.

279
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,154
I dare not.

280
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:19,115
Don't you want to be the queen?

281
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:23,235
I will let you be the queen

282
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:24,755
without any real power.

283
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:28,515
You'll be the thorn in people's flesh

284
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,115
and wither in agony.

285
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:34,595
Chenrong Xinyue.

286
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:39,235
Enjoy being the esteemed queen.

287
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:27,344
Great Emperor.

288
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:28,355
Your Majesty.

289
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:30,755
Hong Jiang still refuses

290
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:31,755
to submit.

291
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:33,755
I believe we have to launch an attack

292
00:18:33,955 --> 00:18:35,635
and resolve this major concern.

293
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,154
Everyone,

294
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,115
who wishes to lead the troops?

295
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:46,955
I'd love to.

296
00:18:47,674 --> 00:18:48,434
It's just that

297
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:51,515
I have been crushed by Xiang Liu

298
00:18:52,154 --> 00:18:54,794
and can't take on
the position of the general.

299
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:09,475
I wish to lead the troops.

300
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:11,914
If you volunteer,

301
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:13,034
I'll certainly follow.

302
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:14,314
I volunteer, too.

303
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:15,995
Alright.

304
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:17,434
Convey my decree.

305
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:18,755
Ru Shou will be the general.

306
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:20,274
Qin Mang will be the deputy general.

307
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:21,475
Dispatch...

308
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:22,096
Your Majesty.

309
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:23,595
I volunteer.

310
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:30,914
Your Majesty,

311
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,314
please allow me to lead troops.

312
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:34,914
Fenglong,

313
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:37,314
it is not a trivial matter.

314
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:39,515
Do not act impulsively.

315
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:42,755
It's not an impulsive decision.

316
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:44,274
I have thought it through.

317
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:45,674
Please, Your Majesty.

318
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:54,074
Approved.

319
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:57,875
Hong Jiang

320
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:00,755
pledges his loyalty

321
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:02,394
to the Chenrong Kingdom.

322
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:06,875
I surrendered

323
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:10,314
and let my father down.

324
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:11,835
But now,

325
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:13,434
you're leading troops

326
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,475
to exterminate

327
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,154
the last Chenrong army.

328
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,755
His Majesty showed mercy

329
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,154
and didn't let the clans

330
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:25,154
of the Central Plains lead the troops.

331
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,355
But you craved credit

332
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,875
and volunteered to fight.

333
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:31,434
You ungrateful traitor

334
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:34,194
of the entire family!

335
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,434
I didn't crave credit.

336
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:47,074
I have compelling reasons.

337
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:49,115
What is it?

338
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,674
Xinyue conspired with
Tushan Hou and Fangfeng Yiying

339
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:56,715
to kill Xiaoyao and Jing.

340
00:20:57,475 --> 00:20:58,794
Xiaoyao may be fine,

341
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:01,154
but

342
00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:04,554
Jing's remains are nowhere to be found.

343
00:21:06,355 --> 00:21:07,674
Xinyue could have been killed

344
00:21:08,794 --> 00:21:09,995
for committing such a crime.

345
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:12,914
But with you here,

346
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:14,794
with me here,

347
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,755
and with all the clans
of Central Plains here,

348
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,194
His Majesty can't demote and kill her.

349
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:24,875
But she has to suffer alive.

350
00:21:26,715 --> 00:21:28,794
Xinyue's life is doomed.

351
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:34,194
For some personal reasons,

352
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:36,194
I noticed something wrong

353
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,074
but tried to conceal it.

354
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:40,914
I have let Jing

355
00:21:42,115 --> 00:21:43,755
and His Majesty down.

356
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:49,595
I'm too ashamed to plead for my sister.

357
00:21:50,794 --> 00:21:51,635
But how can I

358
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:54,434
just stand by and watch Xinyue suffer?

359
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,515
If I can lead the troops

360
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:02,194
and resolve a major concern for

361
00:22:02,235 --> 00:22:03,875
the Great Emperor and His Majesty,

362
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:06,235
I won't ask for any awards or titles.

363
00:22:07,715 --> 00:22:10,355
I'll only ask His Majesty
to forgive Xinyue.

364
00:22:36,995 --> 00:22:38,875
Greetings, Your Majesty.

365
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:41,194
Lord Chishui,

366
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:43,314
you must be very busy.

367
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:45,314
How come you have time to visit me?

368
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:48,115
Today is our birthday.

369
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:49,835
I don't have time to hold a feast

370
00:22:50,355 --> 00:22:51,715
to celebrate with you because

371
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:52,794
I'm heading for war.

372
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,115
So I prepared a gift.

373
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:56,914
I hope you like it.

374
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:01,914
His Majesty

375
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,034
placed me under house arrest
and stripped me of power.

376
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:06,595
You and Father dare not say a word

377
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:07,955
to His Majesty.

378
00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:11,394
Why bother pretending
to be a good brother here?

379
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:13,674
Go ahead and fight for your future.

380
00:23:14,235 --> 00:23:15,875
Don't let your useless sister

381
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:16,595
hold you back.

382
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:18,955
You made a huge mistake.

383
00:23:20,154 --> 00:23:21,955
Father and I are in debt
to the Tushan Family

384
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:23,674
and His Majesty.

385
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:26,674
We're too ashamed to plead for you.

386
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:33,515
Get out of here.

387
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:36,314
From now on,

388
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:37,434
we have nothing

389
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:38,674
to do with each other.

390
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,154
You are not welcome here!

391
00:23:41,394 --> 00:23:43,194
I know you're having a hard time.

392
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,115
Please put up with it.

393
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:46,955
Wait until I return from the war.

394
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:48,995
Even if you don't want me
as your brother,

395
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,235
we're bound by blood.

396
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:53,955
You'll always be my sister.

397
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:55,595
Get out!

398
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:06,194
I'll take my leave.

399
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:48,794
Do you remember

400
00:24:48,794 --> 00:24:49,875
the strategy we discussed?

401
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:50,914
Yes, I do.

402
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:52,194
Encircle and slowly

403
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:53,235
eradicate them.

404
00:24:53,394 --> 00:24:54,074
Good.

405
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:56,595
We don't need to rush.

406
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,475
Try to minimize casualties.

407
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:00,674
Exhaust the enemy
until they reach their limit

408
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:02,515
and deliver a crushing blow.

409
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:04,595
- Understood.
- Understood.

410
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:22,115
Xiaoyao.

411
00:25:22,995 --> 00:25:24,194
Go out for a walk.

412
00:25:25,475 --> 00:25:26,955
Don't stay cooped up indoors.

413
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:29,635
You'll get sick like that.

414
00:25:31,674 --> 00:25:33,355
I have so much work to do every day.

415
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:34,995
What makes you think

416
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,074
that I'm cooped up indoors?

417
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:40,794
If Jing knew that

418
00:25:40,995 --> 00:25:43,235
you were neglecting your health,

419
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:45,034
he would be upset too.

420
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:49,194
Honestly, Grandfather,

421
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:51,115
I'm still upset every day.

422
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:53,034
And I have trouble sleeping.

423
00:25:53,835 --> 00:25:55,074
I want to finish the book

424
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:56,235
exactly because

425
00:25:56,995 --> 00:25:58,715
I know how terrible I feel.

426
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:00,755
Why is that?

427
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,434
The greatest sorrow in life
is losing parents at a young age,

428
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:07,314
losing a partner in the prime years,

429
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,515
and losing a child in old age.

430
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:13,715
Once I finish the medical book,

431
00:26:14,394 --> 00:26:17,314
there might be one less orphan,

432
00:26:18,154 --> 00:26:19,515
one less widow or widower,

433
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:21,794
and one less sorrowful senior.

434
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,355
Birth, aging, illness, and death.

435
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:26,995
Joy, sorrow, partings, and reunions.

436
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:30,995
We can't control birth and aging.

437
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:33,034
But we can cure some illnesses

438
00:26:33,355 --> 00:26:34,835
and prevent some deaths.

439
00:26:36,755 --> 00:26:38,755
I hope this world sees more reunions

440
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:40,394
and fewer partings,

441
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,434
more laughter

442
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,635
and fewer tears.

443
00:26:50,595 --> 00:26:54,554
"My pain makes me relate
to others who are in pain."

444
00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:58,355
Great Emperor.

445
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:03,235
Miss.

446
00:27:05,914 --> 00:27:06,755
So beautiful.

447
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:08,995
Come on.

448
00:27:09,554 --> 00:27:10,515
Confirm it.

449
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,755
I will draw it in the book.

450
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:15,955
These herbs were not mentioned

451
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:17,595
in any medical books.

452
00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:18,794
They are new.

453
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:29,835
The stationery belongs to Jing.

454
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:32,115
You can change them

455
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:34,074
if they're not handy.

456
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:35,475
They're just fine.

457
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:41,755
These herbs are confirmed.

458
00:27:43,794 --> 00:27:44,394
Okay.

459
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:52,034
Xiaoyao.

460
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:54,955
There are things

461
00:27:55,515 --> 00:27:57,074
I have to tell you.

462
00:27:58,314 --> 00:27:59,154
I'm listening.

463
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:03,074
Fenglong

464
00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:05,674
is leading the troops

465
00:28:06,194 --> 00:28:07,595
to fight Hong Jiang today.

466
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:11,394
I know that

467
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:14,794
you're acquainted with Xiang Liu.

468
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,355
Cang Xuan and I have done our best,

469
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:22,154
but Hong Jiang and Xiang Liu
wouldn't surrender.

470
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:26,154
I understand.

471
00:28:27,715 --> 00:28:29,995
This war is inevitable.

472
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,674
For Xiyan,

473
00:28:32,314 --> 00:28:34,034
that is a must.

474
00:28:34,515 --> 00:28:35,515
For Hong Jiang,

475
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:38,274
it's also a kind of relief.

476
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:42,755
I understand.

477
00:28:47,154 --> 00:28:49,314
You hold a different stance
from Xiang Liu.

478
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,955
Some things are destined.

479
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:02,274
I understand.

480
00:29:05,914 --> 00:29:06,995
What are you thinking?

481
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,515
I'm thinking about Qingshui Town.

482
00:29:14,434 --> 00:29:15,274
Rest assured.

483
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:18,115
Cang Xuan has also lived there.

484
00:29:18,515 --> 00:29:19,794
He has ordered the officials

485
00:29:19,955 --> 00:29:22,914
to properly settle the local residents.

486
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:28,074
You are thinking about Xiang Liu, right?

487
00:29:59,635 --> 00:30:02,274
The business
of Rejuvenation Hall was alright.

488
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:04,434
It was just enough

489
00:30:04,434 --> 00:30:05,875
to support our large family.

490
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:08,674
(Rejuvenation Hall)

491
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:09,296
Mu.

492
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:10,955
You're back.

493
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:15,115
(Out of the back door
of the Rejuvenation Hall,)

494
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,674
(there was Mu's
most precious medicinal field.)

495
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:24,835
(Not far from the medicinal field
lay the West River.)

496
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:27,274
(By the West River,)

497
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:28,914
(I found a beggar)

498
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:31,074
(and named him)

499
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,394
(Ye Shiqi.)

500
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:35,794
Beggar.

501
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:39,194
From now on, you will be Ye Shiqi.

502
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:44,194
(To help Skinny)

503
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:46,115
(and Pimply marry someone,)

504
00:30:47,074 --> 00:30:48,674
(I went into the mountains after Feifei)

505
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:51,955
(and ran into Chubby.)

506
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,034
(Xiang Liu thought I was a spy,)

507
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:57,475
(so he gave me forty lashes.)

508
00:30:58,394 --> 00:31:00,674
(In the end,
Shiqi carried me back home.)

509
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:06,394
(I set my mind on poisoning Xiang Liu,)

510
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:09,955
(but poisoned Shiqi instead.)

(I saw that he couldn't move)

529
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:56,235

00:33:01,835 --> 00:33:04,515

But it was weird

537
00:33:18,434 --> 00:33:19,755
because I could feel

00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:22,835

552
00:34:34,194 --> 00:34:35,834
This battle is different.

553
00:34:36,315 --> 00:34:38,114

I also appreciate

the person who should

565
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:16,235
pack up and beat it

566
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:17,634
is the advisor.

567
00:35:18,674 --> 00:35:21,475
But the advisor hasn't left.

568
00:35:21,795 --> 00:35:24,035
How could we bear to leave?

569
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:26,194
Let's stick together.

570
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:27,154
It's no big deal.

571
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:30,674
We just die in the worst case.

572
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:31,874
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

573
00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:37,194
Alright.

574
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:39,154
Let's fight together

575
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:40,955
to the end!

576
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:45,914
- Fight to the end!
- Fight to the end!

577
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:56,755
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

578
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:14,114
Brothers!

579
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:15,955
Run!

580
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:23,674
Darn it.

581
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:25,154
They're running away again.

582
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:25,995
Catch them.

583
00:36:25,995 --> 00:36:26,914
Your Lordship, no.

584
00:36:26,955 --> 00:36:27,715
It may be a trap.

585
00:36:28,515 --> 00:36:29,104
What...

586
00:36:32,154 --> 00:36:32,816
One.

587
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:35,515
Two.

588
00:36:36,955 --> 00:36:37,594
Three.

589
00:36:39,315 --> 00:36:39,955
Four.

590
00:36:41,594 --> 00:36:42,154
Five.

591
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:44,496
One.

592
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:48,275
You are diligent in training.

593
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:49,995
You prohibited me

594
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:51,634
from the battlefield.

595
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:54,555
I can only watch them training.

596
00:36:56,272 --> 00:36:56,834
There is

597
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:58,354
a task specifically for you.

598
00:36:58,834 --> 00:36:59,472
Tell me.

599
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:03,315
Tonight,

600
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,715
please lead a surprise attack
on Xiyan Army.

601
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:07,874
Make it as noisy as possible

602
00:37:09,515 --> 00:37:11,194
to alarm Chishui Fenglong.

603
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:13,354
Why tonight?

604
00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:17,795
The time has come.

605
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,235
(Xiyan is in power)

606
00:37:34,114 --> 00:37:35,434
(and can take its time.)

607
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,235
(But can Xinyue)

608
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,235
(put up with it for ten years?)

609
00:37:41,114 --> 00:37:42,874
- What's going on?
- What happened?

610
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:54,075
Sneak attack.

611
00:37:54,114 --> 00:37:54,874
Sneak attack.

612
00:37:54,955 --> 00:37:56,114
The Chenrong rebels are here!

613
00:37:57,795 --> 00:37:58,795
We're getting busy today.

614
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:01,275
Report.

615
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:02,795
General.

616
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:03,995
Hong Jiang sneaked upon us

617
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:05,194
and wanted to retreat after

618
00:38:05,194 --> 00:38:06,075
destroying our supplies.

619
00:38:06,594 --> 00:38:07,315
Hong Jiang?

620
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:08,235
You sure it's him?

621
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:09,594
I'm sure it's him.

622
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:11,035
Capture their leader first.

623
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:12,834
We can't let him escape this time.

624
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:13,755
Chu Man.

625
00:38:13,755 --> 00:38:14,275
Here.

626
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:15,354
Follow me to catch Hong Jiang.

627
00:38:15,354 --> 00:38:15,920
Understood.

628
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,235
General, don't.

629
00:38:18,035 --> 00:38:18,795
He finally showed up

630
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:19,874
after a whole year.

631
00:38:20,354 --> 00:38:21,795
We can't let him escape.

632
00:40:01,995 --> 00:40:02,594
Grandfather.

633
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:05,674
Fenglong rushed to chase

634
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:06,715
after Hong Jiang

635
00:40:07,394 --> 00:40:08,755
and fell into Xiang Liu's trap.

636
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:09,914
He lost big time.

637
00:40:10,354 --> 00:40:11,634
Chief Yanyu, Chief Huhe

638
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:13,515
and Chief Shusha submitted a petition

639
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:15,154
to change the general.

640
00:40:17,154 --> 00:40:18,275
Changing generals

641
00:40:18,555 --> 00:40:19,755
before the war is a great taboo.

642
00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:22,064
That's right.

643
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,795
And Fenglong is special.

644
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:26,955
If we replace him,

645
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:29,515
his supporters would say that

646
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:32,594
I distrust the Central Plains generals

647
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:34,914
and replace him after a single defeat.

648
00:40:35,795 --> 00:40:37,795
Those who do not support him would say

649
00:40:38,114 --> 00:40:39,075
that Central Plains generals

650
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:40,834
harbor ulterior motives

651
00:40:41,154 --> 00:40:42,874
and I no longer trust them.

652
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:46,035
Do you trust Fenglong?

653
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,475
Of course, I do.

654
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:49,035
Otherwise,

655
00:40:49,035 --> 00:40:50,515
I wouldn't have let him lead the troops.

656
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:52,272
Grandfather.

657
00:40:54,275 --> 00:40:56,035
I want to go to Qingshui Town.

658
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:01,712
Go ahead.

659
00:41:02,634 --> 00:41:03,634
I will go with you.

660
00:41:03,874 --> 00:41:04,634
No.

661
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:06,914
It's dangerous.

662
00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:09,394
I'll stay by your side.

663
00:41:10,914 --> 00:41:12,275
Can't you guarantee your safety?

664
00:41:13,315 --> 00:41:14,394
If not, neither of us

665
00:41:14,874 --> 00:41:16,354
would let you go there.

666
00:41:16,555 --> 00:41:18,394
You're always so sharp-tongued.

667
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:21,354
Cang Xuan.

668
00:41:22,795 --> 00:41:23,874
Take Xiaoyao with you.

669
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:28,315
She has lived in Qingshui Town
for many years.

670
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:29,795
Let her take a look.

671
00:41:30,235 --> 00:41:32,995
She's been longing for it.

672
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:42,795
Fine.

673
00:41:43,515 --> 00:41:44,594
You can come along.

674
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:45,674
But

675
00:41:46,594 --> 00:41:47,955
you can't leave my side.

676
00:41:47,955 --> 00:41:49,795
Always follow my instructions.

677
00:41:51,434 --> 00:41:52,035
Okay.

678
00:41:53,456 --> 00:41:58,896
(Qingshui Town)

679
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:11,594
This place

680
00:42:11,914 --> 00:42:14,075
used to be the busiest in Qingshui Town.

681
00:42:14,955 --> 00:42:16,955
Travelers and locals

682
00:42:17,594 --> 00:42:19,035
would gather in the tea house

683
00:42:19,035 --> 00:42:20,075
to pass the time.

684
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:22,594
I heard that the stone demon
of Qingshui Town

685
00:42:22,594 --> 00:42:23,795
loved to tell stories.

686
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:26,955
It was the place
with the most up-to-date gossip.

687
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:29,354
I came straight here

688
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:30,955
after I arrived at Qingshui Town.

689
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:44,400
(Xiaoliu, come again!)

690
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:44,955
(I'm off.)

691
00:42:44,955 --> 00:42:45,515
(Take care.)

692
00:42:45,515 --> 00:42:46,275
(I'm leaving.)

693
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,315
Xiaoliu, take care.

694
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:48,555
Whoever can't have a baby

695
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:50,315
can come to the Rejuvenation Hall.

696
00:42:54,995 --> 00:42:55,874
Are you alright?

697
00:42:55,955 --> 00:42:57,075
