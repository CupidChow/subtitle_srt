=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,544
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:49,505
Xiaoliu.

4
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:36,426
Why did you save Xuan?

5
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:45,216
Because...

6
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:49,385
Because I figured out his true identity.

7
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:54,706
A few days ago, I was wondering

8
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:57,986
why you are so idle,

9
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:00,066
watching me recover
from my injuries every day.

10
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:01,905
Then I found out

11
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:04,025
you were not looking after me,

12
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,586
but waiting for Xuan.

13
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:11,105
Tushan Jing

14
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:14,905
asked me to hide in the mountain

15
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,665
because he knew

16
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,825
you and Xiyan had been fighting
for hundreds of years.

17
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:24,185
Xiyan can't do anything about you.

18
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:26,706
If you didn't want Xuan to find me,

19
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:28,946
Xuan definitely couldn't.

20
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:30,825
But

21
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,545
you figured out his identity,

22
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:36,025
and you knew he wanted to kill me.

23
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:39,265
So you used me as a bait,

24
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:41,385
trying to lure and kill him.

25
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:45,185
I used you as a bait.

26
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,105
So what?

27
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,905
True, it doesn't matter.

28
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:54,306
After all, he wants to kill me.

29
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:57,105
But I knew later

30
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:01,265
he is the eldest grandson of
the legal wife of the King of Xiyan.

31
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:04,745
If I had killed him for you,

32
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:09,066
the King of Xiyan would definitely
avenge him with all his might.

33
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:14,226
Then I would never have peace,

34
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,146
and in Dahuang,

35
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:18,586
there would be no place for me.

36
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:25,945
I thought you had some guts.

37
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:28,026
I disappointed you.

38
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:31,146
You dare to confront the King of Xiyan,

39
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,706
while I dare not.

40
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,345
The wrath of the emperor
brings blood flowing a thousand miles.

41
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:37,586
I can't bear it.

42
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,545
How did you figure out Xuan's identity?

43
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:43,225
When you were chasing him,

44
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:46,665
I heard one of his attendants

45
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:48,426
shouting

46
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:49,825
something like

47
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,186
"Save His Highness".

48
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:54,466
It was vague,

49
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:56,146
but

50
00:04:57,026 --> 00:05:00,825
there's a very limited number of people

51
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:02,706
you want to kill at all costs.

52
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:06,146
One can figure out who he is

53
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,146
with a little thought.

54
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:18,626
So you know
that I want to kill him at all costs.

55
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,026
I ruined your plan.

56
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:24,026
If you want to kill me,

57
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,232
just do it.

58
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:28,832
Killing you

59
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:32,065
would be too easy for you.

60
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:20,026
Is that guy crazy?

61
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:24,265
With such a serious injury,
he is in the mood to do such a thing.

62
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:28,986
Your Lordship,

63
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:31,866
I am a man.

64
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:32,906
Are you?

65
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:36,385
If you are,

66
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,586
how did you manage to lure Feifei out?

67
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,026
I don't believe you can't
change your appearance and voice.

68
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,746
I trust a beast's intuition more.

69
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:52,265
If the intuition of beasts is accurate,

70
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:54,866
your Chubby wouldn't
have been poisoned by me,

71
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:56,906
there would be no traps in the world,

72
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,545
and hunters wouldn't be able to hunt.

73
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:02,026
What illusion technique are you using?

74
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,480
With low spirit power

75
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:06,906
you can make it untraceable.

76
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:09,586
Everything seems real.

77
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,064
My body is real.

78
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,706
Come on.

79
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:23,866
Touch it.

80
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:25,306
Come on.

81
00:08:26,186 --> 00:08:27,385
Touch it

82
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:30,146
only if you won't suspect
that I'm a woman anymore.

83
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:34,266
I'm not interested in your fake body.

84
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:37,986
No wonder.

85
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:41,585
You demons only have males and females
but not men and women.

86
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:45,225
Too bad I can't change into
a nine-headed female demon

87
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,905
to cater to you right now.

88
00:08:58,426 --> 00:08:58,946
I...

89
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:01,025
Well, I...

90
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:02,785
I didn't mean it.

91
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:35,946
Ouch, ouch.

92
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:41,545
Xiaoliu, Xiaoliu.

93
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:52,306
Xiao Liu,

94
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,665
Master, there's enough
spiritual medicine for Mr. Liu.

95
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,200
He'll recover soon with it.

96
00:12:31,506 --> 00:12:32,626
As cultivation is hard,

97
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:35,360
why do you consume
your own spirit power, Master?

98
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:37,585
Xiaoliu was injured
by overwhelming demon power.

99
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,506
Although my spirit power can't heal him,

100
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:42,826
it can alleviate his pain.

101
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,186
Then let me do it.

102
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:47,626
Master, you have many
important things to deal with.

103
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:51,426
How can you
waste your spirit power to heal others?

104
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,785
His safety is the most important.

105
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:55,506
Master.

106
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,304
You may leave.

107
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:00,746
Yes.

108
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,345
Xiang Liu, Xiang Liu.

109
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:27,905
Xiang Liu.

110
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,746
Don't move,
or your wound will open again.

111
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:48,386
(He hurt you like this)

112
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:50,545
(and you're still thinking about him?)

113
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:52,665
Please

114
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:54,426
don't...

115
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:57,665
Don't...

116
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:02,426
As long as you get better,

117
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:04,465
I promise you anything.

118
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:18,785
I heal so soon.

119
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:21,345
Much spiritual medicine
must have been used.

You finally woke up.

128
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:11,345
Did Mr. Liu's condition worsen?

129
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:13,344
Let me help him.

130
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:26,146
Miss, you are indeed impressive.

131
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:31,808
Mr. Liu saved my life,
but I have nothing to repay now.

132
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:34,065
Please accept my courtesy.

133
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:43,345
Thank you for saving my life.

134
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:45,152
If there is a chance in the future,

135
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:46,705
I will repay you, Master Qingqiu.

136
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:49,425
Mu and the others
are still waiting for me.

137
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:50,345
I'll take my leave.

138
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,192
Before I came,

139
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:59,065
you were chatting happily.

140
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:02,080
Did I disturb the two of you?

141
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:04,256
Is that why Mr. Liu left?

142
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:10,976
He was having a good chat with Ye Shiqi,

143
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:14,465
not with your master.

144
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:24,465
Xiaoliu.

145
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:26,506
Don't worry.

146
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:28,705
Just take the medicine on time,
and you will have a baby.

147
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:31,386
Thank you, doctor.

148
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:32,425
Take care.

149
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:43,266
Xiaoliu, have some water.

150
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:44,866
Thank you, Tian'er.

151
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:49,425
Doctor, doctor.

152
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:51,546
Come sit over here.

153
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:52,945
Let me check.

154
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:54,065
What happened?

155
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,906
When repairing the leaky roof,

156
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:57,105
he was hit by a tile.

157
00:18:58,506 --> 00:18:59,386
This wound is no big deal.

158
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:01,506
I'll bandage it up,

159
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:03,225
and he'll be fine
after a few days of rest

160
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:04,266
Thank you, doctor.

161
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,945
Skinny, do the bandaging.

162
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:17,705
Xiaoliu, I suddenly have a stomachache.
I have to go to the toilet.

163
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:24,506
Xiaoliu, let me do it.

164
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:31,986
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

165
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:57,825
Here, press it.

166
00:19:58,065 --> 00:19:58,986
Okay.

167
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,546
These few days, have a light diet.

168
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:11,866
Rest well. Prevent the wound from water.

169
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:14,825
Thank you, doctor.

170
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:16,026
It's my pleasure.

171
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,266
Take care.

172
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:19,146
Take care.

173
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,266
Take your time.

174
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:36,626
Usually, I watch you teach Skinny.

175
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:38,146
I've seen it so many times,

176
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:39,626
so I can sort of imitate it

177
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,185
and make easy treatments.

178
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,986
You are quite gifted

179
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:46,825
in observing and serving people.

180
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:51,666
Are you complimenting me, Xiaoliu?

181
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,185
Isn't diagnosing an illness
about observing people?

182
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:57,866
Isn't taking care of the sick

183
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:00,305
about serving people?

184
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:06,345
I think you could study medicine.

185
00:21:11,425 --> 00:21:13,666
Skinny and Pimply
have been with me for over 20 years,

186
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,866
but they are not cut out for this work.

187
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,105
I think you can do it.

188
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:22,705
If you are willing, study hard.

189
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:25,746
Learn my skills in treating infertility.

190
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:27,746
Wherever you and Skinny go,

191
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,105
you will never starve.

192
00:21:30,906 --> 00:21:32,425
Are you really willing to teach me?

193
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:34,546
Why wouldn't I?

194
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:36,866
Once you can work,

195
00:21:37,185 --> 00:21:38,225
I can finally be idle.

196
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:43,185
I've been married to Skinny for so long.

197
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,386
Not to mention arguing with him,

198
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:47,986
I've never criticized him.

199
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:51,626
It's not that we are
more affectionate than other couples.

200
00:21:51,986 --> 00:21:54,626
It's just that I have no one to rely on

201
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:58,225
and my background is poor.

202
00:21:58,626 --> 00:21:59,906
So I always compromise

203
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,345
and humor him.

204
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:03,746
But I know

205
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:06,065
this is not a long-term solution.

206
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:08,825
I have no way out.

207
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:11,305
I can only keep going until the end.

208
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:18,945
Thank you, Xiaoliu.

209
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:23,305
Thank you for giving me the chance

210
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:25,546
to learn a skill,

211
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:28,506
be independent, and earn my own bread

212
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,185
like Chuntao.

213
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:40,825
In the future, you and Skinny

214
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:42,386
should treat Mu well.

215
00:22:42,705 --> 00:22:45,266
If you both die while Mu is alive,

216
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:48,386
ask your children
continue to take care of him.

217
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:53,705
Xiaoliu,

218
00:22:55,305 --> 00:22:56,945
are you leaving Qingshui Town?

219
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:04,866
Xiaoliu, rest assured.

220
00:23:05,345 --> 00:23:07,465
I will definitely
take care of Mu and Skinny.

221
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:10,386
Are you entrusting your family?

222
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:20,825
What? You don't welcome me?

223
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:27,266
Tian'er, do your business.

224
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:30,906
Mr. Xuan, sorry for
not welcoming you sooner.

225
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:32,746
Please come in.

226
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:43,705
Drink water.

227
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:45,786
Empty.

228
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:50,746
Thank you, Mr. Xuan.

229
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,425
Mr. Xuan, what brings you here?

230
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:56,786
W-What can I do for you?

231
00:23:57,986 --> 00:23:58,786
Why did you save me?

232
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:09,906
If you die, the poisonous bug
inside you will also die.

233
00:24:10,705 --> 00:24:12,425
I-I've raised it with great difficulty.

234
00:24:12,546 --> 00:24:13,825
I don't want it to die.

235
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:23,945
Although I captured Nian,

236
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:26,026
I didn't really harm her.

237
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:27,666
I just tricked her.

238
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:29,425
Your people hurt me,

239
00:24:29,585 --> 00:24:30,786
so I didn't spare you either.

240
00:24:31,225 --> 00:24:33,065
Xiang Liu used me to set a trap,

241
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:34,425
but I saved your life.

242
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,896
Let's call it even.

243
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:37,945
We are even.

244
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,786
When will you remove the bug?

245
00:24:46,825 --> 00:24:48,026
When you leave Qingshui Town.

246
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:49,146
Why can't you do it now?

247
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:52,666
You're a person with grand aspirations.

248
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:55,305
You will definitely
leave Qingshui Town soon.

249
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:56,386
Don't worry.

250
00:24:56,546 --> 00:24:57,746
When you leave,

251
00:24:57,866 --> 00:24:59,386
I will definitely remove the bug.

252
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:01,626
The bug doesn't really harm you.

253
00:25:01,945 --> 00:25:03,386
It can only make you suffer from

254
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:05,105
what I'm suffering.

255
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:06,546
As long as you don't harm me,

256
00:25:06,786 --> 00:25:07,746
you won't suffer.

257
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:10,585
I just want to live in peace with you.

258
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:19,840
Alright.

259
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:32,266
When you have time,
come to the winery for drinks.

260
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:34,345
Okay.

261
00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:36,146
Also, take care of yourself.

262
00:25:36,906 --> 00:25:38,185
Especially when you're injured,

263
00:25:38,585 --> 00:25:39,425
restrain your desire.

264
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,225
Alright.

265
00:25:41,696 --> 00:25:42,208
What?

266
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:00,026
(Can I really)

267
00:26:00,506 --> 00:26:02,065
(come to drink with you,)

268
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:04,585
(Cang Xuan?)

269
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:23,705
Your body is not impaired, My Lord.

270
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:26,906
Wen Xiaoliu also said
this poisonous bug wouldn't harm me.

271
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:29,225
It can only make suffer from
what he is suffering.

272
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:32,866
But I don't believe even a word he said.

273
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:34,945
He refuses to remove the bug from me.

274
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:37,506
He must have other plans.

275
00:26:37,986 --> 00:26:41,425
I asked a few people
who are good at removing poisonous bugs.

276
00:26:42,345 --> 00:26:44,906
Only the person
who placed the bug on you can remove it.

277
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:47,906
I heard that someone had a similar bug,

278
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:50,746
and when the person
who placed the bug died,

279
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:53,465
the person who had the bug also died.

280
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:54,866
I'm worried

281
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:58,506
that Wen Xiaoliu
will use it to control you.

282
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:03,746
Although I don't like being threatened,

283
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:07,185
I'm not afraid of being threatened.

284
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:22,825
Pour it.

285
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:23,146
Thanks.

286
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:24,026
Tian'er, come.

287
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:26,185
The last dish is ready.

288
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:27,786
Wow.

289
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:30,506
Xiaoliu, try this cured meat.

290
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:32,705
This was especially given
by a patient to thank Tian'er.

291
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:33,546
Alright.

292
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:38,585
They sent two pieces in total.

293
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:40,305
I asked Mu to steam one,
and there's one left.

294
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:43,105
Tomorrow, I'll let Skinny send it
to Pimply and Chuntao.

295
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:43,825
Okay.

296
00:27:44,986 --> 00:27:46,666
Let's toast Tian'er.

297
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:49,185
Congratulations to Tian'er.

298
00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:51,425
You've made progress in medicine.

299
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:52,945
Now you can even run your own clinic.

300
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:53,786
Come on.

301
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:54,146
Congrats.

302
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:54,506
Cheers.

303
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:55,425
Congratulations, Tian'er.

304
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,465
I should toast you, Xiaoliu.

305
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,728
Thank you for your careful guidance.

306
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:11,146
Come on. Let's eat.

307
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:15,506
Eat more.

308
00:28:15,506 --> 00:28:16,465
It is really delicious.

309
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:20,384
It seems that your wounds
have completely healed.

310
00:28:20,506 --> 00:28:21,344
You should also eat one.

311
00:28:36,986 --> 00:28:38,105
What are you looking at, Xiaoliu?

312
00:28:38,105 --> 00:28:38,825
Nothing.

313
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:40,746
Come on. Let's drink.

314
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:42,144
Xiaoliu, have another drumstick.

315
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:43,906
Pour it.

316
00:28:43,906 --> 00:28:44,705
Ok, some more for you.

317
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:46,225
Pour for me first.

318
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,146
Ok, you first.

319
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:47,825
Pour it.

320
00:28:47,906 --> 00:28:48,666
Okay, here.

321
00:28:49,568 --> 00:28:50,592
(I'm afraid of loneliness.)

322
00:28:51,185 --> 00:28:52,705
(If I can't find
enduring companionship,)

323
00:28:52,986 --> 00:28:54,506
(brief one is also good.)

324
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:31,105
Xuan, cheers.

325
00:29:57,786 --> 00:29:58,345
Haitang,

326
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:00,746
help Nian get back to rest.

327
00:30:01,345 --> 00:30:01,786
Yes.

328
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,705
Why? I'm not drunk.

329
00:30:10,906 --> 00:30:13,425
I want to drink
and enjoy the plum blossoms with Xuan.

330
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:24,065
Watch the steps.

331
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,666
The Second Princess
is such a light drinker.

332
00:30:30,386 --> 00:30:31,866
How dare she compete with His Highness.

333
00:30:34,425 --> 00:30:36,065
The Great Princess

334
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:37,945
liked to drink secretly
when she was young.

335
00:30:38,345 --> 00:30:41,305
She has grown up now,
and must not be a light drinker.

336
00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:21,866
On such a snowy day,

337
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:26,945
it's most suitable for a family
to chat and drink together.

338
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:28,506
Cheers.

339
00:31:35,945 --> 00:31:37,705
When you have time,
come to the winery for drinks.

340
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:43,296
I'll go out and have a look.

341
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:44,585
I'll go out.

342
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:58,464
(He will leave soon.)

343
00:31:59,425 --> 00:32:00,825
(If we don't drink now,)

344
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:03,305
(we won't have the chance.)

345
00:32:13,585 --> 00:32:15,945
(Forget it.)

346
00:32:26,465 --> 00:32:28,266
Since you're here,
why don't you come in?

347
00:32:32,746 --> 00:32:34,945
I just saw
that there was no light in the house.

348
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:36,906
I thought there was no one here.

349
00:32:38,746 --> 00:32:39,146
Please.

350
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,065
The plum tree is in full bloom.

351
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:05,666
Nian wants to see it,

352
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:07,425
so I planted it for her.

353
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:12,666
You

354
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:14,986
really cherish your sister.

355
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:20,585
Where is Nian?

356
00:33:20,992 --> 00:33:22,705
How come she allows me

357
00:33:22,705 --> 00:33:23,786
to sit here and drink?

358
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:26,225
Nian is a light drinker

359
00:33:26,626 --> 00:33:27,465
and gets drunk easily.

360
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:29,506
She's having sweet dreams in the room.

361
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:48,160
This mulberry wine

362
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:52,506
is different from that
I've drunk elsewhere.

363
00:33:55,506 --> 00:33:57,465
It's a brew from many years ago.

364
00:33:58,026 --> 00:33:59,705
It's rare that Nian was in the mood

365
00:33:59,906 --> 00:34:00,705
to drink today,

366
00:34:00,986 --> 00:34:01,906
so I took it out.

367
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:06,026
Then I must drink more.

368
00:34:13,905 --> 00:34:16,066
You both are children of noble families.

369
00:34:16,425 --> 00:34:18,746
Why did you come
and suffer in Qingshui Town?

370
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:30,026
Tell me.

371
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:37,586
No one will believe it.

372
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:38,546
I will.

373
00:34:44,746 --> 00:34:45,625
For my sister.

374
00:34:48,106 --> 00:34:49,986
For Nian.

375
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:51,625
For taking her out to travel.

376
00:34:59,425 --> 00:35:00,346
Why did you save me?

377
00:35:07,746 --> 00:35:09,465
I'm not drunk yet.

378
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,225
It's not appropriate to ask now.

379
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,066
Then I'll wait until you're drunk.

380
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:18,786
Impossible.

381
00:35:20,225 --> 00:35:21,225
Why is it impossible?

382
00:35:24,986 --> 00:35:26,026
Because...

383
00:35:32,705 --> 00:35:33,506
Because...

384
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:45,346
Because I'm going to sleep.

385
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:23,185
Xiaoliu.

386
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:25,986
Xiaoliu!

387
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:53,385
You really aren't afraid of death.

388
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:12,064
Come in.

389
00:37:28,128 --> 00:37:31,145
What brings you here, Master Qingqiu?

390
00:37:31,456 --> 00:37:33,106
I'm Ye Shiqi of Rejuvenation Hall now.

391
00:37:55,746 --> 00:37:57,506
You still can't
remove the poisonous bug?

392
00:37:59,106 --> 00:38:00,786
I've tried everything, but none worked.

393
00:38:00,986 --> 00:38:01,826
I don't know why.

394
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:06,306
Do you want my help?

395
00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:08,266
Who's there?

396
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:40,185
Who is it?

397
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:43,026
No one. I must have misheard.

398
00:38:46,306 --> 00:38:48,905
I have other things to do.
You may leave.

399
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:51,945
And, don't bring me these anymore.

400
00:38:52,385 --> 00:38:53,385
Although I'm not rich,

401
00:38:53,546 --> 00:38:55,746
I can afford the snacks.

402
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:07,425
You're no longer the homeless Ye Shiqi.

403
00:39:07,986 --> 00:39:09,586
Your home is in Qingqiu Hill.

404
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:12,705
The Tushan family doesn't need me.

405
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:14,506
But I need...

406
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:24,705
I'll take my leave.

407
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,465
These braised dishes and green plum wine

408
00:39:31,905 --> 00:39:32,865
are made by me.

409
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:34,865
Have a try.

410
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,506
If you like them,
I can make more for you next time.

411
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:40,986
That scared me.
