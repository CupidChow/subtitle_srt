00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:33,760
=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:36,576
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:47,658
What a pity.

4
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,177
Such a good thing.

5
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:52,618
I should let
the nine-headed demon taste it.

6
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,698
In this world,
there is no more Wen Xiaoliu.

7
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:00,978
Even if we meet by chance in the future,

8
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,137
he will definitely not recognize me.

9
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:43,777
He's really free and unconstrained.

10
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:48,538
What did you look at?

11
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:51,898
Nothing.

12
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:53,137
Father, why are you here?

13
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:55,777
I've heard you are studying medicine.

14
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:58,738
I remembered your mother left
many medical books in the Zixin Hall.

15
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:00,258
I brought them especially for you.

16
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:01,538
You may find them useful.

17
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:02,337
Thank you, Father.

18
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:05,938
Father.

19
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:15,738
Who is he?

20
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:21,178
A friend who is not close to me.

21
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:26,258
A mirror forged from the soul of ape

22
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:29,378
can peek into the past
at the owner's will.

23
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:32,898
Does this friend

24
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:34,697
deserve your eternal memory?

25
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:38,617
I just remember him for fun.
Maybe it will be erased tomorrow.

26
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:41,378
I thought at this time

27
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:43,818
you'd be thinking about Tushan Jing.

28
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:50,057
Maybe he's enjoying
the moonlight with his fiancee,

29
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:51,458
being happy and carefree.

30
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:54,497
I'm not stupid.
Why should I bother myself

31
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:55,658
thinking about him?

32
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:00,458
I was worried
that you would be upset by love.

33
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:03,137
It seems that I'm overthinking.

34
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:04,938
Yes, you are overthinking.

35
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:06,857
I've been a man for hundreds of years.

36
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:10,178
I don't have
any romantic thoughts typical of girls.

37
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:34,138
It's better
to act sooner rather than later.

38
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:36,418
Later, I will send someone
to go to the Dragon Squad

39
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,017
to tell Xuan we have arrived.

40
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:44,217
Junior Master, Xuan
from the Dragon Squad is here.

41
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:46,098
Good!

42
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:48,017
Go invite him in.

43
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:48,497
Yes.

44
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:04,138
You came so quickly.
You're a good friend.

45
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:08,217
I knew he would come to see us
when he heard the news.

46
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:13,098
I have something to apologize for.

47
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:17,378
I'm not from the Dragon Squad
of Haoling.

48
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,698
Xuan is just my pseudonym.

49
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:21,938
I come from Xiyan.

50
00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:24,297
My real name is Xiyan Cang Xuan.

51
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:26,658
I didn't mean to conceal my identity.

52
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:28,698
It was just inconvenient
to reveal my identity

53
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:30,297
when I was passing through Zhiyi.

54
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:38,497
Judging from your behavior,

55
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:40,497
I felt your identity
was suspicious before,

56
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:44,057
but I didn't expect you
to be the Prince of Xiyan.

57
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,017
Please forgive me, Miss Chenrong.

58
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:57,978
Xinyue, it's a small matter.
Don't be so petty.

59
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:02,497
I'm just too surprised.

60
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:04,057
I haven't come back to my senses.

61
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:09,337
I didn't know your identity that day,

62
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:11,698
and accidentally hurt you.

63
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:12,978
Please forgive me.

64
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:14,378
Oh, right.

65
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:16,938
I forgot to salute you too,
Your Highness.

66
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:18,978
Please spare me.

67
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:20,938
Just call me Cang Xuan.

68
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,258
Your Majesty,

69
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:35,858
this dress was carefully crafted

70
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:37,538
by the famous weavers in Dahuang

71
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:38,978
I specially found.

72
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:41,578
Your Majesty, what do you think?

73
00:06:57,578 --> 00:07:00,457
It is not good enough. Remake it.

74
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:01,658
Remake it?

75
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:05,617
Your Majesty,
the celebration is coming soon.

76
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:06,818
I'm afraid

77
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:09,457
there is not enough time
to make another one

78
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:11,978
for such an important occasion.

79
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:14,017
So that's why

80
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:16,337
this matter was handed to you.

81
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:21,378
Yes, I will do my best.

82
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:30,658
Now all the people in Dahuang
are discussing the Great Princess.

83
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:32,017
I'm curious too.

84
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:33,737
Cang Xuan,

85
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:36,217
what does the Great Princess look like?

86
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:39,777
You'll know when you see her tomorrow.

87
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:42,378
Just tell us.

88
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:44,378
Just because we're your friends,

89
00:07:44,378 --> 00:07:45,938
we can know a bit earlier than others.

90
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:49,497
Which one is more beautiful,
the Great Princess or Nian?

91
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:51,098
Gardenias and orchids

92
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:53,138
are both beautiful in their own way.

93
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:54,418
Can't be compared.

94
00:07:55,217 --> 00:07:56,698
You're saying nothing with that.

95
00:07:57,297 --> 00:07:59,737
You silly girl. Don't you understand?

96
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:01,418
At least,

97
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:03,138
she must be a beauty.

98
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:17,737
You've been thinking
about this move for a while.

99
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:24,777
Cang Xuan,

100
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:27,098
did you make a mistake?

101
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:30,098
You must have made a mistake.

102
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:33,057
No regret once the piece is placed.
You can't take it back.

103
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:35,818
Jing, help me beat him soundly.

104
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:44,778
How could you play such a bad game too?

105
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,497
Did you two collude?

106
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:04,258
Didn't you go to see Chishui Fenglong?

107
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:05,818
Didn't it go well?

108
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:08,338
It went well.

109
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,097
As I expected,

110
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:14,818
they didn't mind at all

111
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:15,977
after I confessed my identity

112
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:17,578
and quickly accepted me.

113
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:20,698
Since it went very well,

114
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:24,057
why were you upset
when you came in just now?

115
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:25,778
What happened?

116
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:31,018
I met Tushan Jing.

117
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:36,657
So what?

118
00:09:41,177 --> 00:09:41,857
Xiaoyao.

119
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:45,057
If... I mean,

120
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:48,938
if one day between me and Tushan Jing,

121
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,378
you could only choose one,

122
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:52,938
who would you choose?

123
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,097
Cang Xuan.

124
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:01,378
I've been a man for hundreds of years.

125
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:04,258
Neither my mindset nor my actions

126
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:05,537
are those of a little girl.

127
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:09,698
Today's intimacy between lovers

128
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:11,458
may turn into heartlessness tomorrow.

129
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,578
Love arrives passionately
and fades fleetingly.

130
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:14,977
But the two of us

131
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:16,857
share a blood relation,

132
00:10:16,977 --> 00:10:18,218
and we're like sharing one life.

133
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:23,378
You mean

134
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:25,258
you'd choose me?

135
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,578
Whatever you want to do,

136
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:31,018
just go ahead.

137
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,458
Since now I'm here with you,

138
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:35,617
I'll be with you till the end.

139
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:38,537
If the Tushan Family becomes your enemy,

140
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:41,138
they will be mine too.

141
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:02,097
What a pity.
I really like this new dress.

142
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:13,938
Who did this?

143
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:17,818
If I find out,
I won't let his clan escape.

144
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:19,977
Then you shall count my father.

145
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:25,617
Nian...

146
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:27,458
She is after our lives.

147
00:11:31,977 --> 00:11:33,417
Your Highness, don't act innocent.

148
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:35,737
If it wasn't for your indulgence,

149
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,097
Nian wouldn't make trouble till today.

150
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,497
The two of you are fighting,

151
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,857
but now it's our heads on the line

152
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:43,018
due to your mess!

153
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:50,857
Ru Shou,

154
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:52,938
it's about time you stop the act.

155
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:55,698
You just want me
to cooperate with you, right?

156
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:57,898
I'll comply with your proposal.

157
00:12:03,977 --> 00:12:06,657
As for the solution,
there is indeed one.

158
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:11,218
I wonder if you still remember

159
00:12:11,258 --> 00:12:12,338
the original dress.

160
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:13,898
Yes, I do.

161
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:18,977
His Majesty really dislikes that dress,

162
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:20,898
but now time is limited,

163
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:23,177
and we don't have time
to discuss with His Majesty.

164
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:26,537
Now we can only
make decisions on our own.

165
00:12:26,898 --> 00:12:29,218
Just in case His Majesty wants to blame.

166
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,417
I'll bear it.

167
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,138
Isn't this exactly what you planned?

168
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:40,338
You're incredibly sharp.

169
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:42,977
I truly admire you.

170
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,737
You're the one who can adapt to changes.

171
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:49,338
I truly admire you.

172
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:26,297
The time has arrived.
The ceremony begins.

173
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:32,057
I destroyed her dress.

174
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,698
How could this...

175
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:45,737
Now I declare unto heaven and spirits.

176
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:50,057
Heaven and earth are silent yet trusty
and bring forth creatures.

177
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,578
Receiving heaven's grace,
I aim to follow the great undertaking.

178
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:58,818
Princess Jiuyao, with her grace,
virtue, and gentleness,

179
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,977
once was separated in childhood,
and now she has returned.

180
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,138
Father.

181
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:06,258
Now I respectfully offer sacrifices
and solemnly announce.

182
00:16:06,578 --> 00:16:07,904
- May they be enjoyed.
- Father.

183
00:16:33,338 --> 00:16:34,578
Complete.

184
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:49,657
May I see the Great Princess?

185
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:51,858
I can only convey the message.

186
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,818
Whether she sees you or not
depends on herself.

187
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:54,897
I appreciate it.

188
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:56,818
Please tell her that

189
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:58,777
I'll be waiting
outside the Dragon Bone Prison.

190
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:00,017
Dragon Bone Prison?

191
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:02,618
It is quite secluded,

192
00:18:02,897 --> 00:18:04,657
but it's not a place to meet a girl.

193
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:07,738
Thank you.

194
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,618
Don't mention it.

195
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:26,017
Father, I also wanted
to smile gracefully,

196
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,417
but that dress was too tight.

197
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:31,498
It hurt my waist and I couldn't breathe,

198
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,098
so I couldn't continue smiling.

199
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:35,456
You've already done very well.

200
00:18:36,288 --> 00:18:37,216
Rest well.

201
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:40,017
You don't have to go to the banquet
at the Yiqing Garden.

202
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:41,177
I will handle it for you.

203
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:43,297
Thank you, Father.

204
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:47,578
But Father,

205
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:49,098
why don't you ask me

206
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:51,777
why I wore the dress
that you didn't like?

207
00:18:54,938 --> 00:18:55,936
It must be Nian.

208
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:58,657
She wrecked the other dress, right?

209
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,257
I knew it.

210
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,218
You know everything Nian does.

211
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,098
If I had known this,
I wouldn't have ignored it.

212
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:12,017
But I don't want her
to think I'm biased.

213
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,858
So I can only indulge her
a bit more than before.

214
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:19,377
And some things are between you sisters.

215
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:22,858
It's not appropriate for me
or Cang Xuan to intervene.

216
00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:24,338
You have to solve it yourselves.

217
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,098
I know. I will solve it.

218
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:29,777
I'm just planning

219
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:31,938
to deal with Nian properly

220
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:33,698
after she vents her frustration.

221
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:37,137
In my lifetime,

222
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:40,938
I have exchanged everything
I have for what I want.

223
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:44,017
I have regrets for what I haven't done,
but none for what I have.

224
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:48,137
The people I only worry about
is the two of you.

225
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:52,297
If you two can truly accept

226
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:53,498
and look after each other,

227
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:55,377
then I will be at ease.

228
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:00,938
Don't worry, Father.

229
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,858
I may not do exactly what you hope,

230
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:06,537
but I will try my best.

231
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:08,897
Good.

232
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:26,177
Is it very painful?

233
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:30,698
Your father and brother
have both abandoned you.

234
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,632
How come you're here?

235
00:20:35,738 --> 00:20:36,417
What do you think?

236
00:20:38,377 --> 00:20:41,858
All the people in Dahuang are discussing
about the Great Princess of Haoling.

237
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:44,338
Surely I'm curious.

238
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:47,498
So I came over to join the fun.

239
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:52,657
It's her again. All of you only
have her in your eyes.

240
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:53,618
Yes.

241
00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:57,818
If it weren't for her,

242
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:02,338
you would still be
the only princess of Haoling,

243
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:04,417
the only daughter of your father,

244
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,578
and the only sister of your brother.

245
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:10,698
But that woman suddenly

246
00:21:10,698 --> 00:21:12,417
came out of nowhere

247
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:14,417
and took away everything that was yours.

248
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:19,738
Your Highness,
don't you want to get revenge?

249
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:33,417
Although I hate her for taking away
everything that was mine,

250
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:35,257
I don't want her to die.

251
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:39,578
I just want everything
to go back to the way it was.

252
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:43,938
I admit

253
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,698
I may want to kill the prince of Xiyan.

254
00:21:48,537 --> 00:21:50,738
But I would never kill
the princess of Haoling.

255
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,377
Our Chenrong Army

256
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:58,137
doesn't want to offend
the King of Haoling.

257
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:26,537
Why don't we torture her a bit

258
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:28,938
but not take her life?

259
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:31,738
What do you think?

260
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:49,338
You are a kind girl indeed.

261
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,498
Your father and brother

262
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:55,338
should favor you more.

263
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:00,992
Thank you.

264
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:05,024
But why do you want to help me?

265
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:07,840
What do you want me to do for you?

266
00:23:12,818 --> 00:23:14,978
You know the situation of our army.

267
00:23:17,978 --> 00:23:19,458
If there's a chance in the future,

268
00:23:21,498 --> 00:23:23,338
I hope that you can help me once too.

269
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:26,978
You don't even want me to swear.

270
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:28,537
Aren't you afraid I'll break my word?

271
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:37,738
I trust you.

272
00:23:39,338 --> 00:23:39,897
Alright.

273
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:43,177
You help me give
Great Princess a good lesson,

274
00:23:43,618 --> 00:23:44,738
and I'll help you once later.

275
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:48,578
But

276
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:52,098
how can we give her a good lesson?

277
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:04,938
The fruits fed
by a beauty are quite good.

278
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,738
Fortunately, you're not a man.

279
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:10,897
Otherwise, all the women
would be deceived by you.

280
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:17,177
Good.

281
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:18,978
Are you tired today?

282
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:24,017
I'm okay, except
that the dress was so tight

283
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:25,417
that I couldn't breathe.

284
00:24:27,738 --> 00:24:30,537
Shouldn't you be partying with them
at the Yiqing Garden now?

285
00:24:42,218 --> 00:24:43,818
What's wrong?

286
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:47,978
Tushan Jing wants to see you.

287
00:24:49,057 --> 00:24:50,537
He said he'd wait
outside Dragon Bone Prison.

288
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:53,098
I won't.

289
00:24:55,017 --> 00:24:57,818
If you don't want to see him,
I'll reject him for you.

290
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:01,818
Give me 20 years.

291
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,578
No, 15 years.

292
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:06,578
15 years later,

293
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:09,698
Ye Shiqi will be together with you.

294
00:25:11,938 --> 00:25:12,498
Wait.

295
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,618
I'll go see him.

296
00:25:25,218 --> 00:25:25,657
Okay.

297
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:37,856
(Mingse Hall)

298
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,938
Your Highness, how about this dress?

299
00:25:41,897 --> 00:25:43,257
You will look slender with a waistband.

300
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:44,777
It looks so good on you.

301
00:25:44,938 --> 00:25:46,218
Why don't you want to wear it?

302
00:25:46,698 --> 00:25:49,177
- It's really beautiful.
- Really beautiful.

303
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,177
It's too beautiful.

304
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:53,017
Alright, I'll listen to you this time.

305
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:54,978
Then I'll choose this dress.

306
00:25:56,297 --> 00:25:58,498
I'm going for appearance over comfort.

What on earth do you want to do?

You're not thinking
about pushing me down, are you?

331
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:39,177
You guessed it right.

332
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:44,698
(Did you forget that I could swim?)

333
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:01,657
(You want to die?)

334
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:07,377
How do you know I'm Wen Xiaoliu?

335
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:09,897
I was going to pretend

336
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,657
I didn't know you.

337
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:14,338
The poisonous bug is still in my body.

338
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:16,858
Do you want to deny the oath you made?

339
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,338
You are very good at lying.

340
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:35,137
This is not a lie.

341
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:38,016
I was Wen Xiaoliu back then.

342
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:44,137
Princess of Haoling.

343
00:31:46,218 --> 00:31:49,377
No wonder you insisted
on saving Cang Xuan that day.

344
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:53,440
What else you said

345
00:31:54,818 --> 00:31:56,537
were lies?

346
00:31:57,377 --> 00:32:00,098
Why not come clean about them all today?

347
00:32:01,777 --> 00:32:02,618
Relax.

348
00:32:04,938 --> 00:32:06,137
I won't kill you.

349
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:08,177
I've told you

350
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:11,498
I only talk nonsense, not lies.

351
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,458
Everything I've told you before is true.

352
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:36,498
Xiang Liu, are you angry?

353
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,297
I have recently developed
a lot of new poisons.

354
00:32:58,688 --> 00:32:59,840
Would you like to try this?

355
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:03,616
This was specially prepared for you

356
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,177
after I read many medical books.

357
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:10,818
Specially prepared for me?

358
00:33:11,938 --> 00:33:13,297
My goal is to poison you to death.

359
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:15,897
For this, I have consumed
a lot of medicinal materials.

360
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:27,938
I disappoint you again.

361
00:33:35,738 --> 00:33:36,978
I will continue to work hard.

362
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:53,632
Make more poisons for me in the future.

363
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,296
Okay.

364
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:01,458
But you have to promise me.

365
00:34:02,098 --> 00:34:03,498
Don't get Nian involved anymore.

366
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:05,938
She's well protected by my father,

367
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:08,337
unable to resist
schemes of the likes of you.

368
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,258
The likes of me?

369
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:11,857
What kind of person am I?

370
00:34:14,337 --> 00:34:15,778
You know it well.

371
00:34:16,177 --> 00:34:17,498
She hasn't considered you
as her sister,

372
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,817
but you are already playing
the role of a good sister.

373
00:34:21,097 --> 00:34:22,657
In relationships between people,

374
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:25,097
someone has to take the first step.

375
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:27,417
The same goes
for romantic relationships,

376
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:30,698
and for parent-child relationships.

377
00:34:31,498 --> 00:34:32,857
The reason why I first

378
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,298
show kindness to Nian

379
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:38,498
is not because she is
so good or worthy,

380
00:34:40,298 --> 00:34:42,617
but because of my father and Cang Xuan.

381
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,577
Why are you always looking at me?

382
00:34:57,337 --> 00:34:58,657
If you want to see good looks,

383
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:02,458
you're better off looking in a mirror.

384
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:11,298
When we were underwater,

385
00:35:13,058 --> 00:35:15,417
why didn't you let me help you
breathe even at the risk of dying?

386
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:20,978
I was dizzy at that time.

387
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:22,577
Who would remember?

388
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:27,938
Do you need me to help you recall?

389
00:35:31,698 --> 00:35:32,538
I remember.

390
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:40,978
Because I was scared.

391
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,538
Scared?

392
00:35:44,704 --> 00:35:45,696
Scared of what?

393
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:47,617
You.

394
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:52,738
I was scared of you.

395
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:25,058
Kissing me would be
more terrifying than death?

396
00:36:27,137 --> 00:36:28,018
My brother,

397
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:30,458
Cang Xuan,

398
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:32,657
once chatted with me one night.

399
00:36:32,938 --> 00:36:36,298
He laughed at me
for being a girl who still daydreams.

400
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:40,097
Continue.

401
00:36:42,218 --> 00:36:42,938
Although...

402
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:46,698
Although the possibility is very small,

403
00:36:50,097 --> 00:36:51,298
I'm still scared

404
00:36:54,778 --> 00:36:55,897
that I might accidentally

405
00:36:58,058 --> 00:36:59,458
let you into my dreams.

406
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:07,018
You are in no way the type
to be in a girl's dream.

407
00:37:09,258 --> 00:37:12,978
This is probably
more terrifying than death.

408
00:37:41,097 --> 00:37:43,657
This is just a girl's nonsense.

409
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:46,177
I know you're generous. Please don't...

410
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:49,018
Where are you going, Xiang Liu?

411
00:37:50,258 --> 00:37:51,617
You're not going to leave
me here alone?

412
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:53,538
How do I get back?

413
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:55,617
Swim back.

414
00:37:56,377 --> 00:37:57,577
I swim back from here?

415
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:58,938
This is the deep sea.

416
00:37:59,698 --> 00:38:00,978
There are monsters everywhere.

417
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:03,778
I have weak spirit power,
so any monster can eat me.

418
00:38:05,298 --> 00:38:06,377
I'm doing this for your good.

419
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:09,298
What if I'm too gentle
and considerate to you

420
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:11,377
and accidentally enter your dream,

421
00:38:12,577 --> 00:38:13,778
making your life worse than death?

422
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:16,577
Wouldn't that be a sin?

423
00:38:17,938 --> 00:38:19,897
Xiang Liu,

424
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:23,778
Xiang Liu, Nine Lives.

425
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:27,857

in the world anymore.)

428
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:57,137
(Father, I will miss you.)

429
00:39:57,577 --> 00:39:59,657
(Come to pick us up soon.)

430
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:00,698
(Okay.)

(I'll be back soon.)

434
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:10,258
(I will bring you back)

435
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:12,698
(from Mount Jade as soon as possible.)

436
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,097
(Okay, I'll wait for you.)

00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,538
(Every time I'm exhausted,)

438
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:22,097

I thought you weren't coming.

466
00:42:34,938 --> 00:42:36,218
Since you thought so,

467
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:37,938
why did you wait here?

468
00:42:39,218 --> 00:42:40,458
Besides that,

469
00:42:41,897 --> 00:42:43,458
I didn't know what else to do.

470
00:42:45,738 --> 00:42:47,817
Aren't you going to ask me
why I was late yesterday?

471
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,218
As long as you could come,
nothing else matters.

472
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,337
Yesterday, on my way to see you,

473
00:42:56,058 --> 00:42:57,137
I ran into Xiang Liu.

474
00:43:04,137 --> 00:43:06,018
To keep my promise to you,

475
00:43:06,258 --> 00:43:08,058
I swam in the sea all night.

476
00:43:08,978 --> 00:43:10,377
I felt like I was about to drown,

477
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,897
and when I was almost suffocating,

478
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:14,458
I suddenly regretted it.

479
00:43:15,498 --> 00:43:16,377
I was wondering

480
00:43:16,698 --> 00:43:20,298
if a promise is
more important than life.

481
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:24,498
But the moment I saw you,

482
00:43:26,218 --> 00:43:27,857
I didn't regret it at all.

483
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:34,498
Xiaoyao.

484
00:43:38,298 --> 00:43:40,417
I kept my promise to Ye Shiqi.

485
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,817
But you are not him.

486
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:48,298
You are Tushan Jing.

487
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:51,657
I would never marry Fangfeng Yiying,

488
00:43:52,177 --> 00:43:53,657
and she would never marry me.

489
00:43:54,337 --> 00:43:55,857
She's completely uninterested in me.

490
00:44:06,498 --> 00:44:08,538
Your Highness, have some hangover soup.

491
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:12,577
It's been a long time
since I saw you happy.

492
00:44:12,938 --> 00:44:15,298
You drank so much wine
and were unconscious.

493
00:44:17,617 --> 00:44:20,857
Yes, I haven't been this happy.

494
00:44:26,657 --> 00:44:28,778
Your Highness, the Great Princess
went out last night

495
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:30,498
and hasn't returned till now.

496
00:44:38,137 --> 00:44:40,897
She has probably had
too much fun with her friend

497
00:44:41,258 --> 00:44:42,258
and lost track of time.

498
00:44:43,337 --> 00:44:45,458
Don't spread the word.
I'll go bring her back.

499
00:44:45,778 --> 00:44:46,657
