00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:32,752
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:35,147
Because he hadn't

4
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:36,747
planted it willingly.

5
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:38,866
You didn't actually

6
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,226
plant the bug in him.

7
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:43,506
But I willingly

8
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:48,186
let you plant it in me.

9
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:55,027
You came to me
time and again to remove it.

10
00:01:56,427 --> 00:01:57,226
I didn't lie to you.

11
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:00,266
I really can't remove it.

12
00:02:13,227 --> 00:02:14,587
Although I can't remove it,

13
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:18,186
I can kill it.

14
00:02:19,227 --> 00:02:20,186
Don't blame me,

15
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:24,466
since you only asked
if I could remove it

16
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:27,666
and never asked if I could kill it.

17
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:08,427
The bug

18
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:12,666
was removed.

19
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:18,226
From now on,

20
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:22,707
you and I

21
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:31,907
have nothing to do with each other.

22
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:49,987
What was Xiang Liu doing just now?

23
00:04:50,467 --> 00:04:51,826
Somehow it seemed like

24
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:53,427
he took two of his lives.

25
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:55,540
(Queen Mother)

26
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,187
Xiang Liu lured
the bug out with his life.

27
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,946
He sacrificed two of his lives

28
00:05:00,386 --> 00:05:02,027
to kill the bug.

29
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,627
Only he who had nine lives

30
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:09,826
could use this method.

31
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:40,066
Thank you.

32
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:02,467
I have a favor to ask.

33
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:04,467
Tell me.

34
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:06,346
Xiaoyao once told me

35
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,786
she never wanted to see me again

36
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,427
for the rest of her life.

37
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:13,907
After tonight,

38
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,587
she and I will have nothing

39
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:20,506
to do with each other.

40
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:23,987
If Xiaoyao asks about the bug...

41
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,266
I will tell her

42
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:27,307
I've removed it.

43
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:33,467
The physician, King of Chenrong,

44
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:35,826
was once a dear friend of mine.

45
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:37,826
My lifespan is coming to an end.

46
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:41,226
You don't need to worry
I'll reveal the secret.

47
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:50,867
It concerns Xiaoyao.

48
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,427
Why can't she know?

49
00:06:52,707 --> 00:06:54,346
Since we're not meant to be,

50
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,946
it's better not to owe each other

51
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:58,946
or linger in memories,

52
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:01,307
as if we never

53
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:03,867
crossed paths.

54
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:05,488
You...

55
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:13,707
Don't worry.

56
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,467
I will never let Xiaoyao

57
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:17,747
know what happened today.

58
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:22,266
I swear

59
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:25,027
never to tell Xiaoyao.

60
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,427
If I break this oath,

61
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:27,587
my lifespan

62
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:28,826
will be shortened

63
00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:30,627
and my spirit will perish.

64
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,386
Thank you.

65
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:40,147
We don't accommodate outsiders,

66
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:43,106
but staying a day or two is permissible.

67
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:46,707
You might as well wait for your injuries
to heal a bit before leaving.

68
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:48,907
No need.

69
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:52,467
Facing the great army of Xiyan,

70
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:54,826
one more life or one less

71
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:57,427
makes no difference.

72
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:09,826
I'll take my leave.

73
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:38,427
The clear water washes away blood.

74
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:40,427
The green hills bury bones.

75
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:42,867
After the farewell,

76
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:46,106
they won't see each other again, right?

77
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:10,466
Not even a trace is left behind.

78
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:12,346
Grandfather.

79
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,827
The army has assembled completely.

80
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,867
In a few days,
Ru Shou will give a command

81
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:19,106
to launch a full-scale attack
on the Chenrong rebels.

82
00:09:25,827 --> 00:09:27,067
Chi Chen, Yanzhuan

83
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:28,307
and Hong Jiang.

84
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,387
They will never yield,

85
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:31,666
even facing death.

86
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:34,026
They would choose death over indignity.

87
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:36,187
As well as

88
00:09:38,106 --> 00:09:38,947
Xiang Liu.

89
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:51,947
How is Xiaoyao?

90
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,827
Nian sent a letter,

91
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,187
saying the Queen Mother
already helped Xiaoyao remove the bug.

92
00:09:57,786 --> 00:09:59,507
But it was a great depletion
of her energy,

93
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:01,146
and she is currently still in a coma.

94
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:04,466
After Xiaoyao recovers,

95
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,586
what do you plan to do?

96
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:13,867
I thought

97
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:16,666
planting phoenix trees on the Zijin Peak

98
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:19,827
would make Chenrong Mountain
Xiaoyao's forever home.

99
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:24,146
But Chenrong Xinyue killed Tushan Jing.

100
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:26,267
As long as Chenrong Xinyue
is still here,

101
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:29,307
I fear Xiaoyao will never return.

102
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:33,507
You've spared no effort
in searching up to now,

103
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:38,466
but there's still no news
of Tushan Jing.

104
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,947
He is probably dead.

105
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:46,387
There are no more obstacles
between you and Xiaoyao.

106
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:50,466
Have you thought about
your future with her?

107
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:57,346
There's no rush for this matter.

108
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:59,586
I'll wait for Xiaoyao
to move on from him completely.

109
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:02,827
After all, no matter how many years,

110
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:04,906
we will eventually be together.

111
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:17,106
The Karmic Fruit Tea
that takes 9,000 years to produce.

112
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,387
Even if you want to drink it,

113
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,987
I don't have it anymore.

114
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:26,146
How can I refuse something given by you?

115
00:11:26,346 --> 00:11:27,507
If you let me drink it,

116
00:11:27,507 --> 00:11:28,346
I will certainly do it.

117
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:35,346
This tea grows on Beihao Mountain.

118
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:36,947
It takes 1,000 years to bloom,

119
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,267
1,000 years to bear fruit

120
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:39,507
and then 1,000 years to mature.

121
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:41,627
It bears fruit every 3,000 years.

122
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:43,987
It's called Truth.

123
00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:45,827
When you drink this tea,

124
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,507
you will answer any question

125
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:49,507
and answer it honestly.

126
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:54,267
Truth Tea.

127
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,187
Grandfather.

128
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:09,026
I was joking just now,

129
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:12,067
but I do have a question to ask you.

130
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:15,187
It concerns all the people.

131
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:18,106
You must answer it

132
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:19,627
honestly.

133
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:21,226
Yes.

134
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:24,827
If Xiaoyao insists on killing Xinyue,

135
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:26,867
will you agree?

136
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:29,026
You know

137
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:30,586
Chenrong Xinyue must not die.

138
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:32,747
Why bother asking such a question?

139
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:36,867
Would you agree to kill Chenrong Xinyue?

140
00:12:39,786 --> 00:12:40,586
I can't.

141
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:41,987
On a personal level,

142
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:44,507
to save me, Fenglong died.

143
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:45,827
I promised Fenglong

144
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:47,706
I'd keep Chenrong Xinyue
safe her entire life.

145
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:48,586
Besides,

146
00:12:49,307 --> 00:12:50,307
behind Chenrong Xinyue

147
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:51,867
are the families of the Central Plains.

148
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:54,627
Now that the world is newly settled.

149
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:56,706
We cannot start another conflict.

150
00:12:58,146 --> 00:12:59,507
The final question.

151
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:02,947
Right now, you only have
two paths in front of you.

152
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:04,067
One

153
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:06,747
is to give up the throne
and be with Xiaoyao.

154
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:08,267
The other

155
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:09,947
is to abandon her

156
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:11,867
and continue as the King of Xiyan.

157
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:13,706
Which one do you choose?

158
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,546
The throne

159
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,307
was obtained by Xiaoyao for me.

160
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:19,747
Why must I choose one, Grandfather?

161
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:21,706
Cang Xuan,

162
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:23,827
you are not a child.

163
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:27,226
You can't greedily have it all.

164
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:29,586
If you regard Xiaoyao

165
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:32,706
as a woman of your harem,

166
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:36,627
you belittle her

167
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:39,226
and yourself too.

168
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:44,226
No one in the world can do
as they please.

169
00:13:44,546 --> 00:13:46,387
As the ruler of Dahuang,

170
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:47,627
you must not.

171
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,307
Every step in life,

172
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,146
every choice

173
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:54,507
is a matter of weighing pros and cons

174
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:57,387
and deciding
after careful consideration.

175
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,507
You only have two paths before you.

176
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:01,947
One

177
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:04,067
is to renounce the throne

178
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:05,706
and be with Xiaoyao.

179
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:06,507
The other

180
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:08,067
is to give up Xiaoyao

181
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,586
and continue as the King of Xiyan.

182
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:12,827
Which path will you choose?

183
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:17,546
Xiaoyao

184
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:19,747
or the throne?

185
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:31,827
Your Majesty.

186
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:33,106
Great Emperor.

187
00:14:33,346 --> 00:14:34,026
What is it?

188
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:35,226
Urgent news from Chief Lirong.

189
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,320
(Jing is alive and has gone to Mount Jade
to meet with Miss Xiling.)

190
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:18,706
It's been hundreds of years.

191
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,747
I never imagined
that after all these years,

192
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:23,947
I would return to this place.

193
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:28,747
This place

194
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:30,827
has not changed at all.

195
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,146
When I was young,

196
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:34,786
I hated the most

197
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:36,307
how unchanging this place was.

198
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:38,827
Even the peach blossoms

199
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,146
were ever-blooming and never wilting.

200
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,786
I wanted to desperately escape.

201
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,067
But now when I see

202
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,747
the same scenery as in my childhood,

203
00:15:51,387 --> 00:15:52,187
I feel

204
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:55,947
comfort and familiarity.

205
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:02,267
Grass clings together

206
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:04,307
and never abandons each other.

207
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,187
But people

208
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:10,067
are less loyal.

209
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:19,627
Fenglong knows the murderer
is Chenrong Xinyue.

210
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:22,387
Grandfather knows.

211
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:25,187
Cang Xuan also knows.

212
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:29,867
I am the last one to know.

213
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:38,507
The Queen Mother says
her lifespan is about to end.

214
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:40,987
She wants me
to take charge of Mount Jade.

215
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:44,187
If I become the Queen Mother,

216
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:46,106
it's like imprisoning myself.

217
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,947
Others can't come in.

218
00:16:48,427 --> 00:16:49,666
Nor can I get out.

219
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:51,067
That sounds

220
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:52,387
quite good, right?

221
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:01,226
When I was little,
I desperately wanted to escape,

222
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:03,747
thinking since the world was vast,

223
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,147
there was nowhere I couldn't go.

224
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:06,867
But now,

225
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:10,106
in the vast world,

226
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:13,507
I have nowhere to go.

227
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:18,466
You ask me why?

228
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:24,586
Why?

229
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:31,466
The Queen of Xiyan

230
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:34,346
killed Tushan Jing.

231
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:38,867
If I kill the Queen,

232
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:42,147
I will make enemies
with not only the families

233
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,387
of the Central Plains
but also those of Xiyan.

234
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:51,466
Though Dahuang is vast,

235
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:55,226
where can I go?

236
00:17:58,226 --> 00:17:59,826
Cang Xuan?

237
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:08,426
Cang Xuan...

238
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,547
Now,

239
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:15,627
he is not only my brother

240
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:19,106
but also the Lord of Dahuang

241
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:21,106
and the King of Xiyan.

242
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:25,547
The King of Xiyan

243
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:29,946
won't agree

244
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:32,987
to my killing his queen.

245
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,066
What is the lady talking about alone?

246
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:37,907
Isn't talking to herself

247
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:39,747
something she does

248
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,706
when she's hiding
in the mountains after losing face?

249
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:57,787
She's not in the mountains
where she can find

250
00:18:57,787 --> 00:18:58,867
no one to talk to.

251
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:00,667
If she wants to talk to someone,

252
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,027
why doesn't she talk to you?

253
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,147
Because of me,

254
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:07,186
Xiaoyao can't find anyone to talk to.

255
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:10,466
What have you done, Your Majesty?

256
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:16,267
It's okay.

257
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:18,027
She treats you best.

258
00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:20,706
You just need to apologize to her

259
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:21,946
to make up.

260
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:24,387
You are right.

261
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,627
In the world,

262
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:30,826
Xiaoyao treats me best.

263
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:36,627
Your Majesty,

264
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:38,507
go have a talk with the young lady.

265
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:43,027
The person Xiaoyao wants to see

266
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:45,787
is not me.

267
00:19:57,426 --> 00:19:58,226
Xiaoyao.

268
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,106
Xiaoyao.

269
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:52,267
Jing?

270
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:57,147
I'm back.

271
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:49,706
It's not an illusion, is it?

272
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:52,667
I'm not dreaming, am I?

273
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:54,387
It's real.

274
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:04,426
It's really you.

275
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:08,027
I'm Ye Shiqi who belongs to Wen Xiaoliu,

276
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:10,627
named after the 17 leaves

277
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:11,907
of an herb

278
00:22:12,106 --> 00:22:13,466
you picked casually.

279
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,586
It's you.

280
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:24,907
It's really you.

281
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:28,586
You have come back.

282
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:30,907
Xiaoyao,

283
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:33,387
I'm sorry for making you worried.

284
00:22:39,147 --> 00:22:40,226
I knew

285
00:22:41,147 --> 00:22:42,747
you would definitely come back.

286
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,267
You would definitely come back.

287
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:48,586
I have been waiting for you.

288
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:51,627
I knew you would definitely come back.

289
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:10,147
Your Majesty,

290
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:13,066
you don't seem very happy.

291
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:17,387
I am happy.

292
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,747
Auntie, Father and I

293
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:26,667
have all disappointed Xiaoyao,

294
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:31,946
but Tushan Jing did not disappoint her.

295
00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:34,426
I am happy.

296
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:36,946
I am very happy.

297
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:38,706
You must be too happy.

298
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:40,507
It's good that you didn't give up

299
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:42,907
and had Chief Lirong keep searching,

300
00:23:43,627 --> 00:23:44,987
so Chief Tushan

301
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:46,066
could return safely.

302
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:50,787
From start to finish,

303
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:54,027
it was Xiaoyao

304
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:56,186
who saved Jing.

305
00:24:21,946 --> 00:24:23,426
You must have suffered a lot.

306
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:34,946
You too.

307
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:44,106
Once the spirit power dissipates,

308
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:46,706
my hair will turn white again.

309
00:24:48,426 --> 00:24:50,027
I'll take some medicine later

310
00:24:50,226 --> 00:24:51,466
and I'll be fine.

311
00:24:52,706 --> 00:24:54,907
I just won't let
the spirit power dissipate.

312
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:56,656
♪You are the breeze♪

313
00:24:56,656 --> 00:25:00,016

317
00:25:16,186 --> 00:25:17,267
How did you come back?

318
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:19,627
Did Lirong Chang save you?

319
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,826
It was you who saved me.

320
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:25,507
You're cajoling me again.

321
00:25:26,346 --> 00:25:27,987
How could I have saved you?

322
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,027
This puppet

323
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,267
blocked

324
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,867
Tushan Hou's deadly strike for me.

325
00:25:38,426 --> 00:25:39,507
It saved my life.

326
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,346
But I was severely damaged

327
00:25:42,747 --> 00:25:43,667
and exhausted,

328
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:44,867
and I passed out.

329
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:48,907
I drifted along
the West River into the sea.

330
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:51,987
I didn't encounter any sea beasts,

331
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:54,186
but I encountered
a big whirlpool on the seafloor

332
00:25:55,027 --> 00:25:57,147
and was sucked into a cave
deep under the sea,

333
00:25:57,586 --> 00:25:58,787
which made my condition worse.

334
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,426
Fortunately,
the spiritual medicine you gave me

335
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,667
healed and replenished me,

336
00:26:05,826 --> 00:26:08,186
giving me a glimmer of hope
in a desperate situation.

You saved me once again.

342
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:38,186
For dispelling bad luck.

343
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:40,306
Just a sachet.

344
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:41,867
From now on,

345
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,106
I'll make one for you every year.

346
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:46,267
Okay.

347
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:55,706
After you came out
of the underwater cave,

348
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:57,426
what happened?

349
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,466
After a narrow escape from the cave,

350
00:27:00,106 --> 00:27:01,346
due to severe injuries,

351
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,787
I passed out.

352
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:07,627
For sea beasts and demons,

353
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,466
a deity is the best tonic.

354
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:10,987
Before passing out,

355
00:27:11,346 --> 00:27:13,466
I also worried about
being eaten by them.

356
00:27:13,987 --> 00:27:15,586
Fortunately, Chang found me in time.

357
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:21,867
I must express my gratitude

358
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:22,547
to Lirong Chang.

359
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:25,987
I should thank you.

360
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:29,466
Chang told me my family had a new Chief

361
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:30,867
and gave up looking for me.

362
00:27:31,507 --> 00:27:33,186
Only you refused to give up

363
00:27:33,627 --> 00:27:34,627
and kept waiting for me.

364
00:27:35,426 --> 00:27:36,826
That was why His Majesty didn't give up

365
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:38,627
and had Chang still search for me.

366
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:44,627
Good that you know.

367
00:27:44,987 --> 00:27:46,507
Fortunately, your return was timely.

368
00:27:47,186 --> 00:27:48,586
If you didn't come back,

369
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,706
I'd just stay here
and be the Queen Mother.

370
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:54,387
Back then, when you were drifting,

371
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:56,547
you didn't return to Mount Jade
no matter how hard it was.

372
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:58,586
Why would you want
to become the Queen Mother?

373
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:02,547
I planned to kill Chenrong Xinyue.

374
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:10,826
Xiaoyao.

375
00:28:14,586 --> 00:28:15,216
What?

376
00:28:16,106 --> 00:28:17,426
You're so moved and eager to repay me?

377
00:28:20,547 --> 00:28:21,826
Then marry me in return.

378
00:28:22,586 --> 00:28:23,186
Okay.

379
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:39,907
(By the command of Xiyan Cang Xuan,)

380
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:42,106
(the commander Ru Shou)

381
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,867
(led large troops)

382
00:28:44,226 --> 00:28:46,466
(to besiege the Chenrong rebels
at all costs.)

383
00:28:47,346 --> 00:28:49,027
(To end the battle quickly,)

384
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:51,186
(Ru Shou ordered
a scorched-earth policy)

385
00:28:51,267 --> 00:28:53,027
(and executed
a sweeping encirclement strategy.)

386
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:55,387
(He even set fire to the mountains)

387
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,066
(so that the Chenrong rebels
had nowhere to hide.)

388
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:01,507
(Accompanied by fierce battles
one after another,)

389
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:03,426
(the encirclement gradually tightened)

390
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,426
(until the two armies met.)

391
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:44,426
Hong Jiang is my foster father.

392
00:29:45,547 --> 00:29:46,346
It doesn't concern you.

393
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,466
Alright.

394
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:04,826
I'm not driving you away.

395
00:30:27,787 --> 00:30:29,106
There's a saying among mortals,

396
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:32,226
"The sky is high for birds to fly."

397
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,987
Since you have wings,

398
00:30:37,706 --> 00:30:39,547
you should soar freely.

399
00:30:42,826 --> 00:30:44,226
I've told you before

400
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:47,066
people may bear evil intentions,

401
00:30:47,787 --> 00:30:49,186
so don't trust others easily.

402
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:51,066
After I am gone,

403
00:30:52,027 --> 00:30:53,387
you should be more cautious.

404
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,426
I saved you back then,

405
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:11,946
and you accompanied me for 300 years.

406
00:31:14,787 --> 00:31:16,106
We're even.

407
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:33,306
Chubby.

408
00:31:42,706 --> 00:31:43,787
Yuhong grass.

409
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:46,226
It can't be called poison.

410
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:48,426
With your nine heads,
of course, it won't knock you out.

411
00:31:48,826 --> 00:31:50,466
But if you had just one head,

412
00:31:50,747 --> 00:31:52,147
you'd surely sleep for several days.

413
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:54,267
It's not very poisonous,

414
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:55,867
but it tastes good.

415
00:31:57,027 --> 00:31:58,226
You like drinking, don't you?

416
00:31:58,507 --> 00:31:59,787
Put this in wine.

417
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:02,027
Even poor wine
will taste good with this.

418
00:32:05,387 --> 00:32:06,586
I made it especially for you.

419
00:33:13,027 --> 00:33:16,066
Our king is the nine-headed demon,

420
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:20,147
not you
filthy and crippled six-headed demon.

421
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:53,667

422
00:33:53,787 --> 00:33:55,987

423
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:57,867

424

- Chief Tushan.

425
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:13,466

427
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:16,226
- Chief Tushan.
- Chief Tushan.

00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:42,032

(For a general,)

468

470
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:21,146
I just had a nightmare.

471
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:22,987
Suddenly, my heart palpitated,

472
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:24,347
and I couldn't fall back to sleep.

473
00:39:24,787 --> 00:39:26,706
Didn't the Queen Mother say
that the bug was removed?

474

It's not the bug.

475
00:39:31,426 --> 00:39:32,426
It's the war.

476
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:26,987
We've besieged Hong Jiang
for six days and nights,

477
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:29,987
and he still has the energy to fight.

478
00:40:36,787 --> 00:40:37,547
General,

479
00:40:37,587 --> 00:40:39,186
I pursued in the southwest direction

480
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,067
but didn't find Xiang Liu.

481
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:40,946
General,

482
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:42,626
I pursued in the southeast direction

483
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:43,666
but didn't find Xiang Liu.

484
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:44,848
General,

485
00:40:45,186 --> 00:40:46,027
done in the northwest

486
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:46,946
and northeast directions.

487
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:48,067
We didn't find Xiang Liu.

488
00:40:49,987 --> 00:40:52,226
If Xiang Liu wanted to escape,

489
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:54,307
he must have left long ago.

490
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,186
He would never wait until now.

491
00:41:21,226 --> 00:41:21,987
Stop!

492
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,666
Everyone, retreat immediately.

493
00:41:23,827 --> 00:41:24,666
Retreat.

494
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:29,146
Retreat.

495
00:41:34,747 --> 00:41:35,626
Bows and arrows.

496
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:36,747
Attack from a distance.

497
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:37,626
Don't get close to him.

498
00:41:37,987 --> 00:41:38,706
- Yes.
- Yes.

499
00:41:41,587 --> 00:41:42,386
Xiang Liu,

500
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:44,987
after such a long time fighting,

501
00:41:45,426 --> 00:41:47,146
we finally met face to face today.

502
00:41:47,747 --> 00:41:49,107
Why not show your true self?

503
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:07,987
It really is you.

504
00:42:09,386 --> 00:42:11,226
You're very clever.

505
00:42:11,507 --> 00:42:12,386
I'm impressed.

506
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:13,906
In terms of intelligence,

507
00:42:14,987 --> 00:42:16,466
I'm no match for you.

508
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:18,107
If the conditions

509
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:19,267
were balanced today,

510
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:20,587
I would be no match for you.

511
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:24,706
Now, we have surrounded you
from all directions.

512
00:42:24,706 --> 00:42:25,987
There's no way out.

513
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:27,987
Why not let go of the past

514
00:42:27,987 --> 00:42:28,987
and have a good talk with us?

515
00:42:30,186 --> 00:42:31,426
As long as you are willing,

516
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:34,267
I can promise on behalf of His Majesty

517
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:37,946
that you will be a king

518
00:42:38,186 --> 00:42:39,666
and granted a territory.

519
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:46,827
If back then, Haoling was defeated

520
00:42:47,226 --> 00:42:48,507
by Xiyan,

521
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:51,787
and Cang Xuan offered generous terms

522
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:53,547
to let you surrender,

523
00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:56,866
would you do it?

524
00:43:14,587 --> 00:43:17,146
Even you cannot do it.

525
00:43:19,987 --> 00:43:21,146
Why bother making it hard for me?

526
00:43:24,466 --> 00:43:25,027
But,

527
00:43:25,307 --> 00:43:28,146
