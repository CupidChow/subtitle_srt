00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:29,792
=Lost You Forever S2=

2
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:32,816
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:38,394
Since time began,

4
00:01:38,673 --> 00:01:40,114
the emperor Pangu

5
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,233
has reigned over the world

6
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:44,114
and managed the people.

7
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:45,353
Within Dahuang,

8
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:47,034
people were conquered.

9
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:49,434
Since Pangu's death,

10
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:51,553
wars have raged on

11
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:53,394
and people have suffered.

12
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:56,233
Xiyan devotes its strength

13
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:57,714
to recapturing the Central Plains.

14
00:01:58,273 --> 00:01:59,474
A wise emperor and good officials.

15
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:01,114
The people are living in peace.

16
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:04,273
Now, Xiyan will dispatch troops south

17
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:07,553
into Haoling by the order of Heaven

18
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,073
to maintain order.

19
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:11,554
To stop people

20
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:13,313
from misunderstanding us,

21
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:14,914
we hereby inform them of this.

22
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:16,914
When troops arrive,

23
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:18,873
they don't have to escape.

24
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:21,513
Our orders are strict,

25
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,153
so they won't attack civilians.

26
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:24,593
Those who surrender

27
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:27,754
will be treated as the people of Xiyan.

28
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:29,513
Therefore,

29
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:31,554
we hereby inform them of this.

30
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:38,073
(In the first half)

31
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,313
(of March,)

32
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:41,914
(under the command of Chishui Fenglong,)

33
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:44,394
(Chishui Xian led a night raid
on Haoling.)

34
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:46,953
(They quickly occupied Jingdu,)

35
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:49,394
(south of the Chishui.)

36
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:50,634
(The next day,)

37
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:53,754
(the King of Xiyan appointed
Chishui Fenglong as the general)

38
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:56,114
(and dispatched 400,000 people
to attack Haoling.)

39
00:02:56,873 --> 00:02:59,073
(The Xiyan's army advanced quickly)

40
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,394
(and took two of Haoling's fortresses
within three days.)

41
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:04,274
(Faced with this sudden change,)

42
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:07,873
(the entire Dahuang was shocked.)

43
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:12,354
I heard

44
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:14,274
General Yu Jiang
has captured two cities of Haoling.

45
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:16,513
Haoling hasn't been at wars

46
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:17,873
with others for over ten thousand years.

47
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,513
It has no fighting force

48
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,754
anymore.

49
00:03:22,354 --> 00:03:23,554
But Xiyan is different.

50
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,834
Since its founding,
it has always been at war.

51
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,114
How could Haoling possibly fight it?

52
00:03:29,354 --> 00:03:29,904
Exactly.

53
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:31,233
If it goes on,

54
00:03:31,554 --> 00:03:32,793
General Chishui will lead the troops

55
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:35,634
to attack Haoling's capital soon.

56
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:38,994
Remember

57
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:40,593
- to check it out before filling it out.
- Okay.

58
00:03:40,593 --> 00:03:41,313
Especially here.

59
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:43,834
It messes up every time.

60
00:04:10,073 --> 00:04:10,713
Grandfather.

61
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:13,073
Xiaoyao.

62
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:14,994
Jing.

63
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:16,794
Why did those physicians

64
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:17,674
act a bit strange?

65
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:18,833
Didn't Cang Xuan

66
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,074
pay their wages?

67
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:22,113
They didn't work very hard.

68
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:25,194
What's wrong?

69
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:27,954
Xiaoyao.

70
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:29,273
They...

71
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:39,873
Grandfather.

72
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:42,153
Are you hiding something from me?

73
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:43,474
What's going on?

74
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:45,354
You've grown up.

75
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:47,234
Ask Cang Xuan

76
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,194
about what happened.

77
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:51,034
Jing and I

78
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:54,954
don't want to be blamed for being nosy.

79
00:04:58,833 --> 00:04:59,433
Jing,

80
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:01,754
play Go with Grandfather.

81
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:03,634
I'll cook some delicious food

82
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:04,433
for you.

83
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:05,914
Okay.

84
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,194
Miao Pu.

85
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,914
Invite His Majesty for dinner.

86
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:11,194
Yes.

87
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:22,194
Sit.

88
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:27,856
(Cheng'en Palace)

89
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:29,794
Your Majesty, an emergency.

90
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:31,634
This morning,
Xiyan's army struck Yao City.

91
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:33,634
Yao City's general Chang Jun
led troops to fight the enemy.

92
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:34,914
Ultimately, he was defeated

93
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:35,754
and lost the city.

94
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,713
The war has just begun.

95
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:39,234
But we have lost three cities.

96
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:40,144
Well,

97
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,754
what should we do?

98
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:45,153
These defenders are useless.

99
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:46,954
Are we going to watch

100
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:49,113
Xiyan's army capture our capital?

101
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,113
Cang Xuan

102
00:05:50,194 --> 00:05:51,234
started the war suddenly.

103
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:52,393
He's so ungrateful

104
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:53,273
and shameless

105
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:54,393
with ruthless ambition.

106
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:55,433
If we had known this,

107
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:56,634
we should not have let him

108
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:57,914
leave Haoling alive.

109
00:05:57,914 --> 00:05:58,512
That's right.

110
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:00,433
After talking so much,

111
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:03,354
do you have any strategy
to counter the enemy?

112
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:06,354
If you don't have any strategy,

113
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:08,954
is anyone willing to fight the enemy?

114
00:06:10,593 --> 00:06:11,184
Your Majesty.

115
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,313
I'm willing to lead troops into battle.

116
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:16,833
So am I.

117
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:21,873
Your Majesty.

118
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,514
I've learned a lot
from Your Majesty these years.

119
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,234
Finally, I can put my learning into use.

120
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:29,113
I request Your Majesty's permission
to go into battle.

121
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:30,993
Please, Your Majesty.

122
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:34,634
Ru Shou.

123
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:36,754
I appoint you as the commander,

124
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:38,273
Qin Mang as the vanguard.

125
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:39,313
You lead the troops.

126
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:40,514
Qinglong,

127
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:41,433
Baihu,

128
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:42,754
Changxi,

129
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:45,713
and Xihe shall all follow orders.

130
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:47,113
- I will, Your Majesty.
- I will, Your Majesty.

131
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,433
This time, I learned

132
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,833
to make this from someone.

133
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:22,313
If you don't like it,

134
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:23,914
just take it as a fangle.

135
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:25,553
You made it.

136
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:26,514
Of course, I like it.

137
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:44,313
It's a pity it's not winter.

138
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:45,553
I can't see plum blossoms.

139
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:41,273
Your Highness.

140
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,513
This is between Cang Xuan and me.

141
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:20,914
It has nothing to do with you.

142
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:24,314
Cang Xuan is still your brother.

143
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:40,234
Father.

144
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:42,753
Since he started a war with you,

145
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:44,474
he's no longer my brother.

146
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:46,753
You took him as an apprentice

147
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,354
and taught him with great care.

148
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:50,674
How could he be so cruel?

149
00:09:51,393 --> 00:09:53,393
Cang Xuan is my apprentice.

150
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:55,674
He's also Xiyan's ruler.

151
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:58,393
If he forgets his duty as emperor

152
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:01,554
because of personal affection,

153
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:04,753
I will be disappointed in him.

154
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:06,794
And what about my sister?

155
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:08,833
Why didn't she try to stop him?

156
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:11,554
Though she is
not your biological daughter,

157
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:12,794
she has been

158
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:14,314
the Princess of Haoling
for so many years.

159
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:15,753
Could she

160
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:20,114
watch the downfall of Haoling?

161
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:47,153
Brother.

162
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:48,153
You said before

163
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:49,393
that you liked this dish.

164
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:50,753
I made it.

165
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:51,713
You try it.

166
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:52,336
Alright.

167
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:57,593
Today, I found that Grandfather

168
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:58,474
and those physicians

169
00:10:58,474 --> 00:10:59,593
were very strange.

170
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:01,434
Brother.

171
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:02,633
Can you tell me

172
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:03,674
what has happened?

173
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:19,914
As long as I go down the mountain,

174
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:21,354
I will figure it out.

175
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:23,674
But I hope

176
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:25,833
that you will tell me about it.

177
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:41,914
I sent troops

178
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:43,593
to attack Haoling.

179
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:47,474
Cang Xuan.

180
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:50,273
What did you say?

181
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:56,794
I...

182
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:00,234
I sent troops

183
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:01,753
to attack Haoling.

184
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:10,593
Xiaoyao.

185
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:11,994
Xiaoyao.

186
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:15,153
Play Go with me.

187
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:29,713
Xiaoyao.

188
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:32,474
Xiaoyao, open the door. Let me explain.

189
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,633
What are you going to say?

190
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,153
Do you remember?

191
00:12:35,393 --> 00:12:36,393
When you were driven desperate

192
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:37,314
by your uncles back then,

193
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:38,674
the King of Haoling took you in.

194
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:41,434
He took you as an apprentice,

195
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,593
teaching you
to play the zither, brew wine,

196
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:44,914
improve the people's livelihood,

197
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:46,193
deal with state affairs,

198
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:47,593
and train secret guards for you.

199
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:49,474
Xiaoyao, you don't understand.

200
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:50,753
I don't understand?

201
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:52,833
Then explain it to me clearly.

202
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:54,554
What I just said

203
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:55,513
is false?

204
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:56,794
Xiaoyao,

205
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:58,073
you were telling the truth.

206
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:00,434
But there are many other things

207
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:01,393
that you don't know about.

208
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:02,713
If it weren't for him,

209
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:04,273
we wouldn't have become orphans.

210
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:05,953
I wouldn't have needed his shelter.

211
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,434
And you wouldn't have had to be homeless

212
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:09,674
for over 300 years.

213
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:12,434
What did you say?

214
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:13,994
I don't understand.

215
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:17,314
Back then, Auntie found out

216
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:18,874
about Chenrong Yanzhuan's conspiracy

217
00:13:18,874 --> 00:13:22,393
and begged the King of Haoling
to save my father.

218
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:31,073
Your Majesty.

219
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:33,073
(Xiling Heng)
Please lend me an army

220
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:34,874
to save Zhongyi.

221
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:36,114
Please rise first.

222
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:47,073
Your Majesty.

223
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:53,034
It's not a small thing.

224
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:56,633
Troops are so precious to every nation.

225
00:13:57,513 --> 00:13:59,153
Can you guarantee the safety

226
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:00,953
of Haoling's soldiers?

227
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:15,674
Heng.

228
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,794
By cutting a finger,

229
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:29,994
I swear I'll ensure the safety
of Haoling's soldiers.

230
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:31,953
Your Majesty,

231
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:34,953
please lend me an army.

232
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:41,593
Auntie cut one of her fingers

233
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:46,193
and implored the King of Haoling
to save my father.

234
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,753
But he refused.

235
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,874
Xiaoyao, he refused.

236
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:02,273
No wonder when I asked my mother

237
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:04,674
about her broken finger,
she didn't tell me.

238
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:09,593
No wonder my mother

239
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:11,513
divorced my father

240
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:13,794
after your father died.

241
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:16,193
Moreover,

242
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:18,994
Haoling also took part in the battle

243
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,513
between Xiyan and Chenrong.

244
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:22,994
Your father and mother

245
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:24,994
met each other on the battlefield.

246
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:27,234
The King of Haoling is also to blame.

247
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:49,554
Xiaoyao.

248
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:53,073
Xiaoyao.

249
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:54,794
Perhaps it cannot

250
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:56,554
be entirely blamed on Master.

251
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:00,434
But whenever I think

252
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:02,073
that my father could have lived,

253
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:05,753
my mother didn't have to kill herself
before my eyes,

254
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:07,554
Grandma could have lived longer,

255
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:09,354
Auntie didn't have to go to war,

256
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:12,034
and you didn't have to leave me,

257
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:15,554
I really

258
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:19,953
can't only

259
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:22,474
regard him as my master.

260
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:53,314
Great Emperor.

261
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:54,672
I...

262
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:56,554
This is between him and his sister.

263
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:58,633
Let them resolve it themselves.

264
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:00,713
Cang Xuan is an emperor.

265
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:03,953
He could allow Xiaoyao
to throw a cup at him.

266
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:06,834
And he's even begging
for her forgiveness.

267
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:10,794
But he may not permit an outsider

268
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:13,314
to see his embarrassment.

269
00:17:19,353 --> 00:17:23,473
Cang Xuan and Xiaoyao
have faced hardships since childhood.

270
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:26,753
They almost lost all their relatives.

271
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,233
Over these years,

272
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:30,353
the two of them have been inseparable

273
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:32,314
and relying on each other.

274
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:33,714
Sometimes,

275
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:35,594
I am also an outsider

276
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:37,794
to them.

277
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:47,353
I see.

278
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:49,113
Thank you for your reminding.

279
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,473
You are a clever child.

280
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:53,674
Sit.

281
00:18:21,153 --> 00:18:21,914
Xiaoyao.

282
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:25,074
Xiaoyao, can you open the door?

283
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:27,513
We can talk face to face.

284
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:31,233
No wonder you hate him.

285
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:35,714
I even want to hate him too.

286
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:37,714
I do hate him.

287
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:41,353
But I also understand him.

288
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:43,513
Why?

289
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:46,594
Because that was his only choice

290
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:48,674
as an emperor.

291
00:18:48,954 --> 00:18:51,554
I believe he regards my uncle
as a close friend

292
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:53,153
and my father as a brother.

293
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:55,794
And he really liked Auntie.

294
00:18:57,314 --> 00:18:59,273
But whenever faced with a choice,

295
00:19:00,314 --> 00:19:01,794
he would sacrifice personal feelings

296
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:04,353
for the greater good.

297
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:08,314
Because he is the ruler of a nation?

298
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:10,914
Yes.

299
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:14,233
Our surnames

300
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:16,473
determine the responsibilities
we must bear.

301
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:20,954
Indeed.

302
00:19:22,993 --> 00:19:24,353
My mother did the same.

303
00:19:27,113 --> 00:19:30,034
My mother protected Xiyan's children
from losing their mothers.

304
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:33,473
But I lost my mother.

305
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:35,393
My mother

306
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:38,674
could abandon me for the greater good.

307
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,314
As the ruler of Haoling,

308
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:45,273
he sacrificed personal feelings
for the sake of the country.

309
00:19:45,473 --> 00:19:46,954
What's wrong with that?

310
00:19:49,594 --> 00:19:51,353
I decided to attack Haoling

311
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,194
because I am also an emperor.

312
00:19:57,674 --> 00:20:00,074
This is a decision I must make.

313
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,434
I believe Master understands me.

314
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:05,194
Xiaoyao.

315
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:09,074
Do you understand me?

316
00:20:13,074 --> 00:20:14,194
I understand.

317
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:18,473
As the ruler of a nation,
you did nothing wrong.

318
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:21,993
But it doesn't mean I won't be sad.

319
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:23,873
You and my mother

320
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:26,273
made the same right choice
as the King of Haoling.

321
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:28,353
But you are just like them.

322
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:31,393
You don't care about my feelings.

323
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:34,113
Since you don't care about my feelings,

324
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:35,353
just get out of here.

325
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,074
I don't want to see you.

326
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,633
From now on,

327
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:41,273
you're no longer welcome here.

328
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:43,513
Xiaoyao.

329
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:46,473
Xiaoyao, I care about your feelings.

330
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:48,834
I care about your feelings, Xiaoyao.

331
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:54,353
Xiaoyao, I care about your feelings.

332
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,714
Xiaoyao, can you open the door?

333
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,674
I care about your feelings.

334
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:00,954
Xiaoyao.

335
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,993
Xiaoyao, I care about your feelings.

336
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:13,714
I care about your feelings.

337
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:19,834
You may leave.

338
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:22,594
Yes.

339
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:27,233
Where is His Majesty?

340
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:29,674
Your Highness.

341
00:21:30,434 --> 00:21:32,393
His Majesty went
to Xiaoyue Peak for dinner.

342
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:33,993
He hasn't come back yet.

343
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:40,393
That fake princess is the best
at putting on an act.

344
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:44,473
Perhaps she knows
Xiyan has sent troops to attack Haoling

345
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:46,074
and is now losing her temper.

346
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,153
His Majesty has made up his mind.

347
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:50,314
If that woman displeases His Majesty

348
00:21:50,513 --> 00:21:51,794
and makes a big fuss,

349
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:54,393
they will become less close.

350
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:58,074
For a man,

351
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,993
love cannot compare to great ambitions.

352
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:05,674
I don't believe

353
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:07,233
His Majesty will still tolerate her.

354
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:19,034
Your Highness.

355
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:21,616
It's fine.

356
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:54,794
I swear.

357
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,233
I swear.

358
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:58,554
- Cang Xuan and Xiaoyao
- Cang Xuan and Xiaoyao

359
00:22:58,674 --> 00:23:00,113
- will trust each other,
- will trust each other,

360
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:01,794
- take care of each other,
- take care of each other,

361
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:03,753
- and never betray each other
- and never betray each other

362
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:05,714
- in this life.
- in this life.

363
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,272
(Zhaoyun Hall)

364
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:10,393
Cang Xuan.

365
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:11,714
Let's go home

366
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:13,113
together.

367
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,113
Okay.

368
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:15,753
Let's go home together.

369
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:20,362
♪It's hard to run away from it♪

370
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:23,914
♪I keep out of the world♪

371
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:25,074
Don't move.

372
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,074
No, Xiaoyao.

373
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:28,794
Don't move.

374
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:30,194
Move away!

375
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,594
I am the Princess of Haoling.

376
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,233
They don't dare to kill me.

377
00:23:33,794 --> 00:23:34,674
Trust me.

378
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:36,074

It's time for the court.

408
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:14,353
Please return.

409
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:29,594
Your Majesty.

410
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:31,633
Your forehead is injured.

411
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:32,794
Before the court,

412
00:25:32,954 --> 00:25:33,834
please treat the wound

413
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:34,674
and get changed.

414
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:42,074
Xiaoyao.

415
00:25:44,314 --> 00:25:45,954
I'm going to court.

416
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:47,794
After the court is dismissed,

417
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:50,113
I'll come back for you.

418
00:26:42,074 --> 00:26:42,954
Our army

419
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:44,753
has successively captured

420
00:26:44,794 --> 00:26:46,473
six cities of Haoling.

421
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:49,194
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.

422
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:54,113
It's time
to slow down the pace of advance.

423
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:55,674
Your Majesty.

424
00:26:55,873 --> 00:26:57,273
We have already won the battle.

425
00:26:57,314 --> 00:26:58,674
Why not speed up?

426
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,194
Being quick may bring good results.

427
00:27:00,674 --> 00:27:01,914
But it will cost too much.

428
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:05,034
What I want is not a city

429
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:06,714
full of the ravages of war

430
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:09,353
or citizens filled with hatred
towards Xiyan.

431
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:11,074
If the marching pace slows down,

432
00:27:11,314 --> 00:27:12,633
what will we do with the soldiers

433
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:13,554
who are not in the war?

434
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:15,674
The rainy season is approaching
in Haoling.

435
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,074
The flood season is about to begin.

436
00:27:17,314 --> 00:27:19,034
Flood disasters are inevitable.

437
00:27:19,434 --> 00:27:20,513
Convey my decree.

438
00:27:21,714 --> 00:27:23,993
Soldiers who are not
in the war will stay in Haoling

439
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:26,034
to help the local people
dredge the rivers

440
00:27:26,393 --> 00:27:27,233
and maintain the dikes.

441
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:28,914
Yes, Your Majesty.

442
00:27:32,314 --> 00:27:34,473
How did His Majesty get injured?

443
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:37,113
(Jin Xuan)
Your Highness.

444
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:39,194
His Majesty has been too tired lately.

445
00:27:39,714 --> 00:27:41,194
Last night, while reviewing memorials,

446
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:42,233
he nodded off

447
00:27:42,554 --> 00:27:44,233
and accidentally hit the candlestick.

448
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:45,594
So he injured his forehead.

449
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:49,314
His Majesty must be worried
about the battles.

450
00:27:49,674 --> 00:27:51,393
It has been a long time
since he had a good rest.

451
00:27:51,993 --> 00:27:54,034
As his maid,

452
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:56,153
you should be more attentive.

453
00:27:57,233 --> 00:27:58,554
Yes, Your Highness.

454
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,434
Duly noted, Your Highness.

455
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:03,034
I have the incense

456
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:04,153
to help him sleep.

457
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,633
I'll send someone to deliver it
to His Majesty's bedchamber.

458
00:28:08,273 --> 00:28:10,233
His Majesty once mentioned

459
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:12,714
that your incense helped him sleep.

460
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:14,873
I will have someone stew tonic soup

461
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:15,834
for His Majesty.

462
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:21,674
Since you are to send things
to His Majesty,

463
00:28:22,674 --> 00:28:24,113
you all may go and prepare.

464
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:25,794
- I'll take my leave.
- I'll take my leave.

465
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:36,314
Tell me the truth.

466
00:28:36,794 --> 00:28:38,633
Did His Majesty get injured
at Xiaoyue Peak?

467
00:28:39,194 --> 00:28:40,113
Xiaoyue Peak?

468
00:28:40,993 --> 00:28:42,113
Where did Your Highness

469
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:43,314
hear such unfounded rumors?

470
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:44,034
How dare you!

471
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:47,353
Answer my question.

472
00:28:48,314 --> 00:28:49,393
Your Highness.

473
00:28:50,074 --> 00:28:52,473
His Majesty's head was injured
in the study,

474
00:28:52,753 --> 00:28:54,714
not at Xiaoyue Peak.

475
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:00,353
You are a clever person.

476
00:29:00,594 --> 00:29:02,954
Think carefully before answering me.

477
00:29:03,554 --> 00:29:04,954
How did His Majesty

478
00:29:05,554 --> 00:29:06,993
actually get injured on his face?

479
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:10,954
I'm not lying, Your Highness.

480
00:29:11,153 --> 00:29:12,674
If you do not believe me, Your Highness,

481
00:29:12,954 --> 00:29:14,434
you can ask the person

482
00:29:14,434 --> 00:29:15,753
on duty last night.

483
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,113
If I'm lying,

484
00:29:18,314 --> 00:29:19,353
I'll accept punishment.

485
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:25,714
You may leave.

486
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,473
Serve His Majesty well.

487
00:29:27,873 --> 00:29:29,473
If His Majesty gets hurt again,

488
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:32,314
there will be no need
for you to serve His Majesty.

489
00:29:32,753 --> 00:29:34,194
Duly noted, Your Highness.

490
00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:38,034
I'll take my leave.

491
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:57,473
Is it worth it to lose yourself

492
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:58,434
because of a man

493
00:29:59,353 --> 00:30:00,194
who doesn't like you?

494
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:20,674
You must leave?

495
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:22,074
Yes.

496
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:24,393
I want to leave Chenrong Mountain.

497
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:26,714
Have you thought about the consequences?

498
00:30:30,674 --> 00:30:31,473
Over the years,

499
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:34,353
I've helped Your Majesty
gather information

500
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:36,554
and have been by Your Majesty's side.

501
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:37,993
So I know too much.

502
00:30:39,873 --> 00:30:41,194
I know that only the dead

503
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:42,314
can keep secrets.

504
00:30:43,753 --> 00:30:45,034
If you want my death, Your Majesty,

505
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:46,914
I'm willing to die.

506
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:18,034
Since you're going to leave,

507
00:31:19,393 --> 00:31:20,794
just drink this.

508
00:31:58,113 --> 00:31:59,954
Where have I done wrong?

509
00:32:00,714 --> 00:32:01,753
Have I ever

510
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,034
not rewarded you properly?

511
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,473
Have I failed you

512
00:32:04,473 --> 00:32:05,393
in some way?

513
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:09,113
If so,

514
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:11,674
why would you rather die than stay?

515
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:15,554
At first, I worked for Your Majesty

516
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,794
to fulfill someone's trust.

517
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:20,633
But over the years,

518
00:32:20,954 --> 00:32:23,393
I have spent much time with Your Majesty

519
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:25,674
and you have done everything well.

520
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:28,314
And because of that,

521
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:30,873
I have a crush

522
00:32:31,954 --> 00:32:33,273
on Your Majesty.

523
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:36,993
You have treated me very well.

524
00:32:38,674 --> 00:32:40,314
But it's not the feeling I want.

525
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,794
You cannot give what I want.

526
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:45,753
In that case,

527
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:47,794
if I stay in this Zijin Palace,

528
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:50,113
I fear my desires

529
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:51,554
and jealousy will turn me

530
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,473
into the kind of person I hate.

531
00:33:30,393 --> 00:33:31,353
This is not poisoned wine.

532
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:33,914
You just drank a thank-you drink.

533
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:37,794
Thank you for your assistance.

534
00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:40,113
Since I employ you,

535
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:41,513
I dare to trust you.

536
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:43,393
Though everything I did

537
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:45,074
may not all be righteous,

538
00:33:45,393 --> 00:33:46,353
I have a clear conscience.

539
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:48,434
No need to cover it up with your death.

540
00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:52,074
If you're unwilling to stay,

541
00:33:53,393 --> 00:33:55,873
can you help me travel through Dahuang

542
00:33:56,353 --> 00:33:57,674
to gather information?

543
00:34:00,194 --> 00:34:01,153
Yes.

544
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:25,473
This

545
00:34:26,753 --> 00:34:27,874
is a farewell drink.

546
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:29,953
The Dahuang is full of good men.

547
00:34:30,953 --> 00:34:32,394
Once you step out of this small place

548
00:34:32,513 --> 00:34:33,473
to see the world,

549
00:34:33,913 --> 00:34:36,513
you will surely find the right man.

550
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:40,554
That's what I thought.

551
00:34:41,794 --> 00:34:42,554
The broader my vision,

552
00:34:43,273 --> 00:34:44,394
the more choice I have.

553
00:34:45,193 --> 00:34:47,554
I will meet something new

554
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:49,874
and forget Your Majesty.

555
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:07,554
Chief.

556
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:10,114
I've inquired the expert
in the poisonous bug.

557
00:35:10,634 --> 00:35:11,513
The princess

558
00:35:11,753 --> 00:35:13,394
might be afflicted
with the couple poisonous bugs.

559
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:14,953
If one person is injured,

560
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:15,953
the other person

561
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:17,953
will be affected.

562
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:22,114
What will happen?

563
00:35:22,513 --> 00:35:23,473
The other person

564
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:25,753
could die.

565
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:30,034
(Xiyan will besiege Chenrong's remnants)

566
00:35:30,034 --> 00:35:31,114
(sooner or later.)

567
00:35:31,794 --> 00:35:32,993
(By then, Xiang Liu will...)

568
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:35,993
(I must remove the poisonous bug)

569
00:35:36,753 --> 00:35:38,034
(from Xiaoyao's body soon.)

570
00:36:54,953 --> 00:36:56,433
Why haven't you rested yet,
foster father?

571
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:59,074
You are not resting, either.

572
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,874
I just came out and had a look.

573
00:37:07,713 --> 00:37:09,634
How long can the lights

574
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:12,154
in the camp last?

575
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:15,673
Haoling is at war with Haoling.

576
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:16,993
If Xiyan wins,

577
00:37:18,114 --> 00:37:19,673
its next target

578
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:20,794
will be us.

579
00:37:22,193 --> 00:37:23,193
You know

580
00:37:23,594 --> 00:37:25,993
we stand no chance
against the Xiyan's army.

581
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:30,554
Yes, I do.

582
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,554
We serve Chenrong.

583
00:37:34,594 --> 00:37:36,074
Our soldiers will fight

584
00:37:36,074 --> 00:37:37,753
to the last man.

585
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:40,713
You don't have to stay

586
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:43,114
to join us in this deadly war.

587
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:46,354
You have done enough
for the Chenrong Army

588
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:47,554
to repay the favor

589
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:49,513
you owed me.

590
00:37:49,913 --> 00:37:50,834
- You...
- Foster father.

591
00:38:00,874 --> 00:38:01,713
Never mind.

592
00:38:02,753 --> 00:38:04,233
Anyway, it's just death.

593
00:38:05,394 --> 00:38:06,554
It's no big deal.

594
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,168
Grandfather.

595
00:38:27,874 --> 00:38:29,154
Xiaoyao is not at home again?

596
00:38:29,953 --> 00:38:31,154
Recently,

597
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:34,193
she has been leaving early
and returning late.

598
00:38:34,673 --> 00:38:38,314
She is not here today.

599
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:40,953
I'm afraid she will be away

600
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,794
tomorrow and the day after.

601
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:45,473
I know she's avoiding me.

602
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:47,753
Even so,

603
00:38:48,314 --> 00:38:49,554
you still come here every day?

604
00:38:53,673 --> 00:38:54,394
Let me help.

605
00:38:57,354 --> 00:38:58,713
Xiaoyao isn't here,

606
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:01,673
but I can keep you company.

607
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:03,993
I can play Go and drink tea with you.

608
00:39:05,673 --> 00:39:07,273
I'm glad to hear that.

609
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,874
Given what you've experienced
as an emperor,

610
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,913
I feel bad for you.

611
00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:15,354
I've done what I should do

612
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,913
as a ruler of a country.

613
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:17,953
I want

614
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:20,554
to be myself at home.

615
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:36,912
(Rejuvenation Hall)

616
00:39:46,513 --> 00:39:47,074
Miss.

617
00:39:47,273 --> 00:39:48,354
Are we going back?

618
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:49,513
No, I'm not.

619
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,034
Where are we going?

620
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:55,794
Just strolling around.

621
00:39:55,811 --> 00:40:02,288
(Rejuvenation Hall)

622
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:10,640
Xiang Liu.

623
00:40:11,473 --> 00:40:12,513
You have mighty spirit power

624
00:40:12,673 --> 00:40:13,473
and nine lives.

625
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:14,794
But Xiaoyao does not.

626
00:40:17,354 --> 00:40:18,953
I just want to confirm one thing.

627
00:40:19,993 --> 00:40:21,473
If you are in danger,

628
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:23,953
will Xiaoyao be implicated?

629
00:40:25,193 --> 00:40:26,314
You will know

630
00:40:27,154 --> 00:40:28,034
when I die.

631
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:29,753
I must know it right now.

632
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:31,473
Please help me

633
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:32,953
remove the poisonous bug from Xiaoyao.

634
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:34,594
I can give you high rewards.

635
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:35,554
I can't help.

636
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:38,594
Cang Xuan removed it successfully.

637
00:40:38,993 --> 00:40:39,794
Why can't Xiaoyao?

638
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:41,473
I'm not Cang Xuan.

639
00:40:42,114 --> 00:40:43,034
I am Xiang Liu.

640
00:40:43,513 --> 00:40:46,554
I can't remove the poisonous bug.

641
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:48,834
If you help Xiaoyao
remove the poisonous bug,

642
00:40:49,554 --> 00:40:51,594
I can give you as much grain
and forage as you want.

643
00:40:51,874 --> 00:40:53,794
You have provided 37 years

644
00:40:53,794 --> 00:40:55,233
of army provisions.

645
00:40:55,713 --> 00:40:56,874
You can provide more,

646
00:40:57,473 --> 00:40:58,834
but the Chenrong Army

647
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:02,634
won't have another 37 years.

648
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:13,834
There is no other way

649
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:14,753
to remove the bug?

650
00:41:15,314 --> 00:41:15,993
No.

651
00:41:56,273 --> 00:41:56,913
Xiang Liu.

652
00:42:01,513 --> 00:42:02,713
Miss, you've been following me.

653
00:42:02,993 --> 00:42:03,993
Why?

654
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:13,673
Since you've been doing this,

655
00:42:14,154 --> 00:42:14,993
could you

656
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:17,713
have feelings for me?

657
00:42:19,114 --> 00:42:19,713
Xiang Liu.

658
00:42:20,354 --> 00:42:21,273
Stop pretending.

659
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:22,753
I know it's you.

660
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,034
Don't you feel shy?

661
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:31,034
If you don't let go,

662
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:33,233
don't blame me for being rude.

663
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:34,193
Fine.

664
00:42:34,713 --> 00:42:35,753
Go ahead.

665
00:42:36,713 --> 00:42:38,114
Anyway, if I'm in pain,

666
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:39,554
you will feel the same.

667
00:42:58,394 --> 00:42:59,713
