=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,322
=Episode 34=

3
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:57,749
Princess, Master of Tushan
is seeking an audience.

4
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:16,229
Jing.

5
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:27,348
Why are you all soaked?

6
00:02:27,988 --> 00:02:29,468
Why are you standing here
instead of coming in?

7
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:31,429
Come in with me.

8
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:33,949
Come on. Come in now.

9
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:49,429
I have taken Master of Tushan

10
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:51,509
to meet Princess as per your order.

11
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,789
Okay. You may leave now.

12
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:55,389
Yes.

13
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:07,108
It's late. You shall rest.

14
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:12,908
As the storm is raging,
and the guest hasn't left yet,

15
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:16,108
how can I rest at ease?

16
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:20,149
Oh, my Master Qingqiu.

17
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:21,949
What urgent matter does he have

18
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,669
that he had to barge into the Mountain
in the middle of the night?

19
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:46,309
It can't be a good thing
since the storm is sweeping.

20
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:49,708
I should be happy,

21
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:53,669
but when I think of Xiaoyao,

22
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,628
I feel very upset.

23
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:07,309
What on earth happened?

24
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:11,268
Grandmother is ill.

25
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,828
She has been waiting for my return

26
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:18,269
and overusing her spirit power
over these years.

27
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:20,669
Now her spirit power is exhausted,

28
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:24,229
and she only has a few months left.

29
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:27,389
Grandfather passed away early.

30
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:29,028
So did my father.

31
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,628
For the sake of the Tushan Family,

32
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:34,269
Grandmother has been struggling

33
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:37,748
and never enjoyed a single day of peace.

34
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:51,468
Grandmother wants me to succeed

35
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:53,428
as the head of the Tushan Family
in three days.

36
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,348
I...

37
00:04:57,868 --> 00:04:59,229
I can't refuse.

38
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:07,949
I understand.

39
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:16,829
I originally planned

40
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:19,789
to stay with you

41
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:22,229
whether Grandmother agreed or not.

42
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:24,868
But now...

43
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:27,389
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:31,908
It's okay.

45
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:33,949
It's really okay.

46
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:36,588
Xiaoyao,

47
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,428
I've disappointed you again.

48
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:43,308
If you really
so cruelly abandon everything,

49
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:46,549
including your grandmother
who has shown you great kindness,

50
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:48,748
even if it was for me,

51
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:51,588
you wouldn't be the Jing I like.

52
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:02,588
I'm sorry.

53
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,829
The shackles you can't break free of

54
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:11,789
are actually your gentleness.

55
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:14,989
And it is this gentleness

56
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:18,308
that makes me like you.

57
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:36,512
(In memory of Mrs. Shen, known as Yue)

58
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:53,028
Mother,

59
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:56,789
you must be very comforted

60
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,148
in heaven, right?

61
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:05,148
Do you know?

62
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,468
What shamed me the most today

63
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:14,188
is not what Grandmother said
that the Central Plains' clans

64
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,188
and the Tushan Family
only recognize Jing,

65
00:07:17,148 --> 00:07:20,069
but that Jing regards
what I desperately strive for

66
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:24,588
as nothing.

67
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:57,468
I know you're down.

68
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,109
But why do you
torment yourself like this?

69
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:11,269
What Grandmother said
was indeed disheartening,

70
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:13,949
but we still have a chance to win.

71
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:19,308
A chance to win?

72
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:22,148
Is it by killing Tushan Jing,

73
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:24,148
or killing the nine elders

74
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:26,588
and those clan leaders who support him?

75
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:40,748
Is that true?

76
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:48,149
Providence.

77
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:53,228
It's providence.

78
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,269
Mother, if you were watching it
from heaven,

79
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:14,188
please enjoy this great drama.

80
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:14,548
Are you thinking about Tushan Jing?

81
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:16,269
No.

82
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,428
I just want to enjoy the breeze here.

83
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:20,829
Can't you do so in the Zijin Palace?

84
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:23,308
It's quiet here.

85
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:26,589
It's indeed too noisy
in the vast Zijin Palace

86
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:28,949
where only the two of us live.

87
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:33,628
It's from my master.

88
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,269
He lets you attend the ceremony of
Tushan Jing's succession as clan leader.

89
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,628
Father is so nice to me

90
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,228
that it allows me
to attend the ceremony properly.

91
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,589
Even if it has turned out this way,

92
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:49,308
do you still want to meet him?

93
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:52,428
After all, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime event for him.

94
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:53,829
No matter what,

95
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:55,509
I want to go and see it.

96
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:58,668
Attend it if you like.

97
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:00,469
For me,

98
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:02,269
only your happiness matters.

99
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:05,069
Don't worry.

100
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,589
Happiness brings us together,
and sorrow sets us apart.

101
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:10,628
It's easy for us siblings to move on.

102
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:13,108
Would I really

103
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:14,108
cry over a man?

104
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:16,748
I hope so.

105
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:42,628
As it's the auspicious time,
the ceremony begins.

106
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,589
As it is shown

107
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:12,428
by the fate constantly,

108
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:16,349
alas, the clan leader
is virtuous and righteous.

109
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:23,868
Clan leader.

110
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:25,628
Clan leader.

111
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:26,909
Clan leader.

112
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:29,108
Clan leader.

113
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:45,188
Our next generations

114
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,469
follow our principles

115
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:51,428
and admire and carry on

116
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:54,909
the clan leader's great achievements.

117
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,628
As heaven sends an auspicious sign,

118
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:18,949
heaven blesses Qingqiu Hill.

119
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:23,788
As heaven sends an auspicious sign,

120
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:25,788
heaven blesses Qingqiu Hill.

121
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:31,788
As heaven sends an auspicious sign...

122
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:33,829
Such an auspicious celestial sign

123
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:36,829
doesn't appear at every clan leader's
ceremony of succession.

124
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:39,228
It seems that
Tushan Jing's succession as clan leader

125
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,509
is a great blessing for
the Tushan Family.

126
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:43,428
Heaven blesses Qingqiu Hill.

127
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:58,469
Complete.

128
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:44,389
Xiaoyao.

129
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:00,389
(Xiang Liu didn't save you for nothing.)

130
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:03,788
(He asked for a peak
of Chenrong Mountain in exchange.)

131
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:24,628
I didn't see you

132
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:25,349
at the ceremony.

133
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:28,788
In your eyes,

134
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,029
besides Tushan Jing,

135
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:30,909
who else could you see?

136
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:33,389
At the succession ceremony
of Chief Tushan,

137
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:34,428
should I look around,

138
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:35,949
instead of watching Tushan Jing?

139
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:39,949
I heard from my sister

140
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:42,029
that Tushan Jing
didn't want to be a clan leader.

141
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:44,748
If he really can't be a clan leader,

142
00:15:45,548 --> 00:15:46,748
then with my sister's temperament,

143
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,069
she would probably think of a way
to cancel the engagement decently.

144
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,428
But now Tushan Jing
has become the clan leader.

145
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:54,389
My sister has endured for years,

146
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:55,868
so she won't give up.

147
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:01,269
It's Tushan Jing who should worry about
whether Fangfeng Yiying gives up.

148
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:02,389
Not me.

149
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:06,149
Fangfeng Yiying
has nothing to do with you,

150
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,589
but Tushan Jing
is intimately related to you.

151
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:12,349
You thought hope
was right in front of you,

152
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:15,389
but it turned out
to be getting further and further away.

153
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:16,589
Aren't you sad?

154
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:19,829
I've been used to bad luck
since I was a child.

155
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:21,829
No matter how good things happen,

156
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,628
I'm always subconsciously
prepared for them to fall apart.

157
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:26,548
No matter how touching the vows are,

158
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,389
I won't fully believe them.

159
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:31,988
I can't say I'm not sad at
all against my mind,

160
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:35,029
but I'm not that sad either.

161
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:39,349
Your personality is not very good.

162
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:41,709
No matter how joyful things are,

163
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:43,349
you're always waiting for sadness.

164
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:46,428
So I should cherish
the real joy at the moment.

165
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,548
Only that is true.

166
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:53,108
Princess,

167
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:57,228
would you like to go with me
to find some real joy?

168
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:00,788
Why not?

169
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:03,428
(Lirong Casino, Qingqiu Hill)
I didn't expect

170
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:04,629
that the doggies have done business

171
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:06,548
right under the nose of
the Tushan Family.

172
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:10,989
The relationship between the head of
Lirong Family and Jing is not easy.

173
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,229
Without Tushan Jing's help in the dark,

174
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,109
they wouldn't be able to
run their business so well.

175
00:17:16,629 --> 00:17:18,308
Jing seems to enjoy friends
here and there,

176
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:20,428
even with the two-headed dogs.

177
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,629
Mind your words.

178
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:25,428
Don't keep saying 'dog'.

179
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,268
Stay away from me,

180
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,829
in case you don't get me involved
when the Lirong Family gang up on you.

181
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,229
I'll be close to you.
I'll get you involved.

182
00:17:37,469 --> 00:17:38,908
Stop it, my lady.

183
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:11,989
Excuse me. Thank you.

184
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:29,229
Isn't that the young man
we saw in Xiyan Town

185
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,308
four decades ago?

186
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:33,028
He made a deal with the slave master.

187
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:35,268
He wins consecutively for 40 years,

188
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:37,589
and the slave master
will grant him freedom.

189
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:38,989
40 years?

190
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:43,589
Tonight is the last night.

191
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:45,508
As long as he can survive tonight,

192
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:47,069
he can be freed from slavery.

193
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,989
Winning consecutively for 40 years,

194
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:51,668
how did he make it?

195
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:54,869
Just like what you did
in the Nine-Tailed Fox's cage.

196
00:18:57,908 --> 00:18:59,548
It's nothing but following your heart,

197
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:02,349
with endless patience,

198
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:04,908
and long waiting,

199
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:08,709
as well as never giving up

200
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:11,308
for a faint hope.

201
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:17,589
What are you talking about?

202
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,388
What do you think I'm talking about?

203
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:09,589
Get up!

204
00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:11,109
Get up and continue.

205
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,709
Stand up.

206
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:14,629
Get up!

207
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:26,069
Go for it! Go for it!

208
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:27,709
Stand up!

209
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:30,428
You've been waiting for 40 years.

210
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:33,388
You'll be free
only by winning this time.

211
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:35,548
Stand up!

212
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:37,989
Get to your feet!

213
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,069
Stand up now!

214
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:43,629
Stand up! Stand up!

215
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:46,508
Get to your feet!

216
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:52,229
Stand up! Stand up!

217
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:54,869
Stand up!

218
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:00,109
Hurry up. Stand up!

219
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:02,908
Get to your feet!

220
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,268
He won!

221
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:49,308
He won, he won!

222
00:22:49,308 --> 00:22:50,989
Did you see it? He's free now.

223
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:53,908
He won. You won!

224
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:13,469
Yeah, he won. He's free.

225
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:43,349
Wait a minute.

226
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:48,709
Just now,

227
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:52,069
I heard you asking me to stand up.

228
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:54,109
I remember you.

229
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:55,829
You hugged me before.

230
00:23:57,829 --> 00:23:58,668
I remember you too.

231
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,388
I'm glad you won.

232
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:02,148
Do you remember him?

233
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:04,428
Yes.

234
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:06,268
He watched me fight to the death.

235
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:08,469
Seven times.

236
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:12,668
I'm free now.

237
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:14,749
I can do whatever I want.

238
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:16,388
Can I follow you?

239
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:20,668
I don't need people.

240
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,188
What's your name?

241
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:31,548
They call me Nu Shiyi.

242
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:35,069
May I give you a name?

243
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:36,949
Okay.

244
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:39,749
What about Zuo Er?
[*Left ear]

245
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:43,508
If anyone mocks you
because you're missing an ear,

246
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,028
you don't need to care.

247
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:48,668
You should be proud of
your missing left ear.

248
00:24:49,148 --> 00:24:50,028
My name.

249
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:52,388
Zuo Er.

250
00:24:55,388 --> 00:24:56,268
Where are you planning to go?

251
00:24:56,908 --> 00:24:58,028
I want to see the ocean.

252
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:00,548
I've heard it's vast,

253
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:02,548
like the sky.

254
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,709
I've never seen it.

255
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:09,469
If you have nowhere to go
after seeing the ocean,

256
00:25:09,949 --> 00:25:12,548
come to Chenrong Mountain
and find a person named Cang Xuan.

257
00:25:13,148 --> 00:25:14,788
Tell him that I sent you,

258
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:16,629
and he will give you a job.

259
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:20,069
My name is Xiaoyao.

260
00:25:20,668 --> 00:25:21,308
Did you remember?

261
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:22,869
Chenrong Mountain.

262
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:26,144
Cang Xuan and Xiaoyao.

263
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:27,788
I remember it.

264
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:31,788
Here is the money I won
by betting on you.

265
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:34,109
Take this money and go see the ocean.

266
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:30,749
He has gone. Why are you still dazed?

267
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:34,349
- Let's go.
- When you escaped from the death arena,

268
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:36,788
if it was I who saved you,

269
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:39,308
it would be great.

270
00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:54,229
If I saved you,

271
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,109
I would only let you be Fangfeng Bei,

272
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:02,949
a free Fangfeng Bei.

273
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,148
Owing no one a favor

274
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:11,428
or gratitude.

275
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:14,388
Bearing no responsibility,

276
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:17,069
morality,

277
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:19,829
or duty.

278
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,229
You want to save me?

279
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:29,229
You're not worthy.

280
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:40,709
I am not saying
Lord Hong Jiang is not good,

281
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,388
I just think

282
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:45,349
- you were born to be as free as a bird.
- Shut up!

283
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:09,869
I heard you want to cancel the marriage.

284
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:15,229
Is my sister not good enough for you

285
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,308
because you're the clan leader now?

286
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:20,589
Miss Fangfeng is very nice,

287
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:23,109
- but...
- Leave him alone. Let's go.

316
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:31,308
I didn't plan to leave you.

317
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:32,629
Really?

318
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:35,668
When I saw you become Chief Tushan,

319
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:39,428
I did feel a bit lost and hesitant.

320
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:40,908
I thought

321
00:32:41,824 --> 00:32:43,908
we were at a crossroad,

322
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:46,148
and took different paths.

323
00:32:51,188 --> 00:32:52,428
But I don't feel it now.

324
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:55,308
Even Zuo Er could persevere for 40 years

325
00:32:55,749 --> 00:32:56,589
for such a faint hope.

326
00:32:57,229 --> 00:32:59,629
How could we give up so easily?

327
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:01,589
Even if the roads are different,

328
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:03,668
roads are still made by people.

329
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:05,028
How can we, two living people,

330
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:07,349
be confined by the roads?

331
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:09,989
Xiaoyao.

332
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:17,268
For me,

333
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:19,829
I am selfish and heartless.

334
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:23,148
My first reaction
is always self-preservation,

335
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:25,308
and I'm unwilling to trust others.

336
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:28,188
I always think
that people's hearts are changeable.

337
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:31,709
It's not easy for you

338
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:33,829
to tolerate me.

339
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,028
I've said

340
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:40,908
I'm willing to trust
and make efforts first.

341
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:05,229
Tushan Jing is determined to
cancel the marriage for Xiaoyao.

342
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:07,908
Is that true?

343
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:09,948
Yes.

344
00:34:10,468 --> 00:34:13,988
For Xiaoyao, the Tushan Family
will definitely support Cang Xuan.

345
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:15,268
The Xiling family and Cang Xuan

346
00:34:15,548 --> 00:34:18,028
are blood relatives.
No need to mention it.

347
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:21,228
Chishui Family's attitude is unclear,

348
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:24,189
but Chishui Fenglong
is already on Cang Xuan's side.

349
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:26,308
If he succeeds as the clan leader,

350
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:28,109
then among the Four Great Clans,

351
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:31,028
three are already on Cang Xuan's side.

352
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:34,149
The situation is not beneficial to us.

353
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:41,109
The Four Great Clans
have always been protecting themselves,

354
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:44,149
unwilling to get involved
in royal disputes.

355
00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:46,748
Even if they support Cang Xuan,

356
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:48,708
they dare not be blatant.

357
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:52,109
But their attitude would
influence the Central Plains' clans.

358
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:53,948
With their support,

359
00:34:54,228 --> 00:34:56,869
naturally, there will be clans
who dare to be blatant.

360
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:00,788
Cang Xuan has been trying to
win over the Central Plains' clans,

361
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:03,669
thinking himself fully fledged.

362
00:35:04,988 --> 00:35:07,389
But I want to see him fall
because of these people.

363
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:11,189
Brother means...

364
00:35:13,508 --> 00:35:18,189
Time to use the undercover we planted
in Chenrong Mountain 40 years ago.

365
00:35:23,228 --> 00:35:26,548
Zijin Palace is where the Kings of
Chenrong live and handle affairs,

366
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,988
the symbol of Central Plains.

367
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:30,109
So all clans
attach great importance to it.

368
00:35:31,669 --> 00:35:32,909
The main hall, Daming Hall,

369
00:35:33,669 --> 00:35:35,708
is even more significant
and extraordinary.

370
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:37,869
You must be extra careful.

371
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:39,748
No omissions are allowed.

372
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,629
Understood. We will be extremely careful

373
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:43,948
and won't let Your Highness down.

374
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:47,468
Please rest assured, Your Highness.
For the palace renovation,

375
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:49,228
I have been doing it for decades.

376
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,028
As the renovation of the Daming Hall

377
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:53,028
has been discussed again and again,

378
00:35:53,228 --> 00:35:55,869
all details are clear in my mind.

379
00:35:57,748 --> 00:35:58,548
Thank you all.

380
00:35:59,228 --> 00:36:00,508
When the great work is completed,

381
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:02,268
you will definitely be rewarded.

382
00:36:07,616 --> 00:36:10,560
(Shen Shutong, Fan Zhang)

383
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:18,489
Your Highness, this is the day decided
by Lord Chenrong

384
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:20,228
for the Daming Hall's blessing ceremony.

385
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:21,788
Please review it.

386
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:31,228
The schedule is a bit tight.

387
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:34,468
This is the day chosen
by the six major clans

388
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:36,189
and the Chenrong clan
after days of discussion.

389
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:38,308
The schedule is indeed a bit tight,

390
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:39,788
but it is an auspicious day.

391
00:36:39,988 --> 00:36:41,589
Please tolerate us, Your Highness.

392
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:43,708
Alright.

393
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:47,189
I will urge my subordinates
to speed up the work.

394
00:36:48,928 --> 00:36:51,866
(Chenrong Mansion)

395
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:53,508
Jing,

396
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,708
you clearly know that my brother
is not welcoming you now,

397
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:56,869
but why are you still coming?

398
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,429
I'll wait for Fenglong to drive me away.

399
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:00,708
Aren't you going to say something?

400
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:02,589
He can be very unreasonable when he can.

401
00:37:25,268 --> 00:37:27,669
Tushan Jing,
you still have the guts to come.

402
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:36,268
You can give me three punches.

403
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:37,869
If you continue,

404
00:37:38,268 --> 00:37:40,028
- I won't be polite.
- Not polite?

405
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:41,748
When have you been polite?

406
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:48,629
- Fenglong.
- Tushan Jing!

407
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:50,028
Tushan Jing!

408
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:51,548
Fenglong.

409
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:54,149
I'll teach you a lesson
for hiding things from me.

410
00:37:55,028 --> 00:37:56,988
Let men handle their own business.

411
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:01,468
My brother's spirit power is strong.

412
00:38:01,669 --> 00:38:02,589
If they really fight,

413
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:04,629
even three Jing are not enough for him.

414
00:38:05,228 --> 00:38:07,028
Don't worry. No one will die.

415
00:38:11,228 --> 00:38:11,829
Fenglong!

416
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:15,748
Are you sure no one will die?

417
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:21,228
Maybe, they'll be bedridden
for a few months.

418
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:39,149
I remember when we were young,

419
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:40,508
you were polite,

420
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:42,589
and always neatly dressed.

421
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,788
Unlike me, messy like a monkey.

422
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:48,149
But once I insulted Hou
and you heard it,

423
00:38:49,189 --> 00:38:50,548
you picked up the guqin and hit me.

424
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,468
We two had a big fight in the mud.

425
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:55,308
I could fight better than you,

426
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:56,988
but you fought desperately,

427
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,268
which forced me to swear,

428
00:38:59,268 --> 00:39:00,869
never to insult Hou again.

429
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:04,268
You still remember it so clearly.

430
00:39:07,508 --> 00:39:10,268
Since then, I've started to envy Hou.

431
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:14,228
If only I had a brother
who would fight for me.

432
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:16,389
One day Auntie suddenly told me

433
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:19,788
to get along with you like siblings.

434
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:21,109
I suddenly realized

435
00:39:21,988 --> 00:39:23,708
we are cousins after all.

436
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:27,349
As long as I'm willing,
we can be good brothers.

437
00:39:28,788 --> 00:39:29,589
Fenglong.

438
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:32,028
All these years,

439
00:39:33,149 --> 00:39:36,069
I can tell you all my ambitions

440
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:37,548
and selfish desires

441
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:39,909
and you never think I'm daydreaming.

442
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:42,869
Even when I told you

443
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:44,909
I want to break
the rules of the Four Great Clans,

444
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:47,829
you just laughed and replied

445
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:50,149
that rules are made by people,

446
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:52,228
and naturally,
they can be broken by people.

447
00:39:53,028 --> 00:39:54,308
I asked you if you would help me.

448
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,189
I don't want to cause any trouble,

449
00:39:56,748 --> 00:39:59,508
- but I won't sit back.
- Right.

450
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:01,228
That's what you said.

451
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:03,429
All these years,

452
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:06,149
no matter what I'm pondering,

453
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:09,268
you can understand and will help me.

454
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,069
I'm not as good as you say.

455
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,948
Actually, I'm not angry
that you stole Xiaoyao.

456
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:21,629
I'm angry that
you don't treat me as your brother.

457
00:40:22,268 --> 00:40:23,429
Why didn't you tell me?

458
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:27,748
I had fallen for Xiaoyao

459
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:30,109
before she became Xiaoyao.

460
00:40:30,748 --> 00:40:32,548
You would definitely blame me
for not telling you earlier,

461
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:34,708
but I really had no way to tell you.

462
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:37,748
Many times,

463
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:39,869
I feel conflicted.

464
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:42,069
I think I'm not good enough for her.

465
00:40:42,548 --> 00:40:45,109
You and Fangfeng Bei are better choices.

466
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,228
No matter who of you
gets close to Xiaoyao,

467
00:40:49,308 --> 00:40:50,788
I think it's good for her.

468
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,189
Maybe it's better than being with me.

469
00:40:55,669 --> 00:40:57,268
I often tell myself to give up,

470
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,429
but I really can't give up.

471
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,389
What do you mean
you're not compatible with Xiaoyao?

472
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:05,069
Tushan Jing,

473
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:07,788
when did you become
so timid and useless?

474
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:11,468
Did the torture of Tushan Hou
even soften your bones?

475
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:13,508
Listen to me.

476
00:41:14,189 --> 00:41:16,228
My brothers are the best.

477
00:41:16,948 --> 00:41:17,708
Let alone one Xiaoyao,

478
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:19,788
you deserve even ten Xiaoyao.

479
00:41:23,268 --> 00:41:24,548
You still consider me as your brother?

480
00:41:27,948 --> 00:41:29,308
I know you consider me as a brother,

481
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,349
and I know you will
definitely give in to me,

482
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:34,189
so I dared to brazenly
ask for her on your territory.

483
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:41,268
You just said

484
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:43,988
you fell in love with Xiaoyao

485
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:46,189
before she became Xiaoyao.

486
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:50,629
What does it mean?

487
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:53,829
Actually, I knew her a long time ago

488
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:57,829
when she wandered about
the mortal world.

489
00:41:59,988 --> 00:42:01,869
So you've been fooling us all along.

490
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:03,748
Do you think I wanted to?

491
00:42:04,228 --> 00:42:06,429
What do you think I felt watching you

492
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:08,909
trying various ways to please Xiaoyao?

493
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:09,748
You deserved it.

494
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,149
- Are we cool?
- Not yet.

495
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:18,669
Have more fights?

496
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:21,948
If they spread the news that I've beaten
the head of the Tushan Family like this,

497
00:42:21,948 --> 00:42:23,069
no one will believe it.

498
00:42:29,429 --> 00:42:31,548
As long as you can calm down,
you can continue to hit me.

499
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:32,909
After all, I can't beat you down.

500
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:38,589
Close your eyes.

501
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:51,708
It's done.

502
00:42:55,468 --> 00:42:57,748
You guys wasted
the Light Dance pills like this?

503
00:42:57,748 --> 00:42:59,028
Be careful of
getting struck by lightning.

504
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:01,629
Close your eyes.

505
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:10,548
All right.

506
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,429
Look at them.

507
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:16,669
So they have feelings for each other

508
00:43:17,149 --> 00:43:19,389
under our noses.

509
00:43:19,508 --> 00:43:21,788
No wonder the song
Xiaoyao sang the other day

510
00:43:21,788 --> 00:43:24,948
was appealing, full of affection.

511
00:43:27,629 --> 00:43:29,948
You dared to do it then
but you're shy now?

512
00:43:30,468 --> 00:43:31,189
I'm not.

513
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:36,788
Fenglong, why not invite Cang Xuan?

514
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,948
- So we could stop her endless chatter.
- Jing, you...

515
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,629
Are you bullying me to help Xiaoyao?

516
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:50,988
We've already sent
a message to Cang Xuan

517
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:52,228
for discussing a serious matter.

518
00:43:52,288 --> 00:43:54,669
Once Jing teases you, you become silly.

519
00:43:55,228 --> 00:43:57,468
Now Xiaoyao has a big supporter,

520
00:43:57,548 --> 00:43:59,189
and I dare not bully her anymore.

521
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:02,189
Don't worry. Your supporter is here too.

522
00:44:04,988 --> 00:44:07,708
This is the first time I've seen you
joke with others like this.

523
00:44:09,308 --> 00:44:12,189
Jing, finally,
you're back to your old self.

524
00:44:14,028 --> 00:44:15,349
You two are really capable.

525
00:44:16,548 --> 00:44:17,429
One is the head of the clan.

526
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:19,268
The other is
the future head of the clan.

527
00:44:20,468 --> 00:44:21,988
But you didn't
care about priorities at all.

528
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:23,909
Do you not intend to see people anymore?

529
00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:26,189
