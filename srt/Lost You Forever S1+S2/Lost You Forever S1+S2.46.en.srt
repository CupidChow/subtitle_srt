=Lost You Forever S2=

2
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,784
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,529
Has Skinny ever disliked you?

4
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:40,289
Have you ever had regrets or grievances?

5
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:46,370
I'm not a prostitute,
and he's not my client.

6
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:50,490
Life can't always be sweet.

7
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,569
Sometimes, it's also bitter.

8
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:57,810
After I gave birth to two sons,

9
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,690
I almost split up with Skinny.

10
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,329
However,

11
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:07,130
Skinny begged me

12
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:08,209
and apologized.

13
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:13,330
So, I forgave him.

14
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,090
When I look back and think about it,

15
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,769
I feel lucky

16
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:25,010
that I didn't break up with him.

17
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:30,289
It seems time has ultimately proven

18
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:33,610
that your choice was not wrong.

19
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:39,129
In my life,

20
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,929
I've cried, laughed,

21
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,530
and tasted bitterness and sweetness.

22
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,489
It's been worth it.

23
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,049
It's been worth it.

24
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,010
But people can only see the choice
in front of them,

25
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,330
not in the future.

26
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,409
What if we make a choice right now

27
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,010
that makes us sad,

28
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:12,450
but we won't regret it in the future?

29
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,929
About this question,

30
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,569
I can't answer it.

31
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,370
Even those deities

32
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,730
who've lived for hundreds of years

33
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:24,049
can't answer it either.

34
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,769
Living a life is

35
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,450
like making a journey in the wilderness.

36
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,489
Nobody knows what lies ahead.

37
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,330
Perhaps it's smooth.

38
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,010
Or perhaps,

39
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,129
it's a bumpy road.

40
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,929
So,

41
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,289
everyone wants to find a companion

42
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,409
to support each other.

43
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,530
Life is full of challenges,

44
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,649
obstacles, and setbacks,

45
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:11,010
but we try to live our lives.

46
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,970
What if you choose

47
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,489
and trust the wrong person?

48
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,249
Young lady.

49
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:19,849
Just remember

50
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,969
that if you want something,

51
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:24,650
you must believe

52
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,930
that it exists.

53
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,170
If you refuse

54
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,249
to believe,

55
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,730
you won't give your heart.

56
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:38,610
If you don't even give your heart,

57
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,650
you won't

58
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,129
get what you want at all.

59
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:47,849
(If I don't believe)

60
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,010
(and give,)

61
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,809
(I won't get what I want.)

62
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:55,809
(Jing and I have come to this.)

63
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,249
(Could it be my fault?)

64
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:26,809
Tian'er.

65
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,569
You've done well.

66
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:33,450
Skinny must feel lucky

67
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,010
to marry a good wife.

68
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,730
Mu

69
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,849
and I are happy for you.

70
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,730
Who are you?

71
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,770
Xiaoliu.

72
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:13,450
This place hasn't changed.

73
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,969
Sadly, you and I

74
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,409
can no longer get along as we used to.

75
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,330
You are the Princess of Haoling.

76
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,089
I am a rebel general.

77
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,369
We live in different worlds.

78
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,170
No need to feel sad.

79
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,529
You're right.

80
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,890
We are from different worlds.

81
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,689
I've been missing for so long.

82
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:42,650
There must be an uproar out there.

83
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,330
You did this.

84
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,050
Yet the Fangfeng Family
has to take the blame.

85
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,969
Fangfeng Yiying will have to shield them

86
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:56,330
from this unexpected disaster.

87
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,249
She is Chief Tushan's wife.

88
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:01,890
So she will
get the Tushan Family involved.

89
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,050
You think I'm the one
who wants to ruin your wedding?

90
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:16,289
If it's not you, who then?

91
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:22,689
I have a deal to do with you.

92
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,129
I need you

93
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:25,730
to stop Fenglong's wedding with Xiaoyao.

94
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,089
In what capacity do you ask for my help?

95
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:29,650
Ye Shiqi?

96
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,729
Can he afford my help?

97
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,129
Ye Shiqi can't afford it,

98
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,290
but Tushan Jing can.

99
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,249
Tushan Jing?

100
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,809
Who is he to stop this wedding?

101
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,210
I pay for a service.

102
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,850
You get paid to do a job.

103
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:46,410
Since when do you care who I am

104
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,369
when doing business?

105
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,850
Help me stop this wedding.

106
00:08:57,929 --> 00:08:58,809
From now on,

107
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:01,489
I will provide provisions
for the Chenrong Army every year.

108
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,929
This seal is the proof.

109
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,970
Money is a good thing.

110
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,809
You can hire others

111
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:09,249
to do what you dare not to do.

112
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:10,929
Chief Tushan.

113
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,809
That's very generous.

114
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,569
Will you take this deal or not?

115
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:15,248
I'll take it.

116
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,330
Why not?

117
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,369
You know,

118
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,609
I never turn down money.

119
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,544
Good.

120
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:24,609
I hope you can stop it
before the wedding.

121
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,489
Don't disturb others.

122
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,530
Minimize the harm.

123
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,770
I've taken the deal.

124
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,569
I decide how to finish this.

125
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,410
You needn't bother.

126
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,049
I don't need you to tell me what to do

127
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:41,489
or set the price.

128
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,049
I decide how you're going

129
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:44,970
to pay for my help.

130
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:46,290
My word is final.

131
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,049
I help you ruin the wedding,

132
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,169
and you provide the Chenrong Army
with army provisions

133
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:53,890
for 37 years.

134
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,090
Tushan Jing hired you to do that?

135
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,330
If you don't believe it,

136
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,210
you can ask Tushan Jing yourself.

137
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,609
By what right did he ruin my wedding?

138
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:06,410
What does he want?

139
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,290
I was hired to do a job.

140
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:10,129
What the employer thinks

141
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:11,569
is none of my concern.

142
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:18,210
I hate him.

143
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:20,809
When can I leave?

144
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,970
I've already got what I wanted.

145
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,169
You can leave

146
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:26,450
at any time.

147
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,410
Just a reminder,

148
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:35,568
the poisonous bug isn't removed.

149
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,970
If you reveal that I'm Fangfeng Bei,

150
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,410
I will give you a painful death.

151
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:52,090
You don't believe it?

152
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,569
If you don't want to die,

153
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,609
don't say anything you shouldn't.

154
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,210
Is this

155
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,650
why you won't remove the poisonous bug?

156
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:25,049
General Xiang Liu.

157
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,010
What a scheming one.

158
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:32,609
This is the kind of person I am.

159
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:35,729
You knew it.

160
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,609
Mr. Yu.

161
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,049
Yu Xin.

162
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,609
Watch your manners.

163
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:08,010
Miss.

164
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,890
Are you looking for me?

165
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:10,569
I want to see Tushan Jing.

166
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,929
Take me to Qingqiu.

167
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,290
Who do you think you are

168
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,049
to see Chief Tushan?

169
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,330
Tushan Jing will definitely see me.

170
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,090
If I'm lying,

171
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,609
you'll just make a trip in vain.

172
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,450
After all, I am in your hands.

173
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:24,569
You can punish me.

174
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:26,330
If I'm not lying,

175
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:27,770
but you refuse me,

176
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,410
you will make a big mistake.

177
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,689
You don't look like an ordinary lady.

178
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,770
I don't think you're lying.

179
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,729
I will accompany you to Qingqiu.

180
00:13:51,636 --> 00:13:53,584
(Qingshui Town)

181
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:01,744
Miss.

182
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,369
After leaving Qingshui Town

183
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,489
and the snow abates,

184
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,609
we'll take a cloud carriage.

185
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:06,832
Okay.

186
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,569
(I'm afraid of loneliness.)

187
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:25,049
(If I can't find
enduring companionship,)

188
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,729
(a brief encounter is also good.)

189
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,489
(Fangfeng Bei,
who accompanied you briefly, has died.)

190
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42,530
(You can now enjoy someone else's
enduring company.)

191
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:35,600
(Tushan Mansion)

192
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,049
She wants to see the Chief.

193
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,450
So you brought her here?

194
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:43,249
How could you act so rashly?

195
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:45,290
It is her.

196
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:00,890
Jing Ye.

197
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,080
Prin...

198
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:05,890
Princess?

199
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,090
This pill only relieves your heartache.

200
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,249
But it can't cure you.

201
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,650
Your heart is damaged.

202
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:33,330
Don't think or worry too much.

203
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,450
You need some quiet rest.

204
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:36,176
Okay.

205
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:38,049
I got it.

206
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,689
I know

207
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,049
you're worried about someone.

208
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:44,650
You can't stop worrying.

209
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:47,770
Chief.

210
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,729
The princess is here.

211
00:16:59,129 --> 00:16:59,760
Jing Ye.

212
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,809
Get new clothes for me.

213
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,169
I smell of medicine.

214
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:04,369
How do I look?

215
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:05,930
You look much better.

216
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,530
The princess is weary from her trip.

217
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,489
I have arranged for a maid

218
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:11,010
to help the princess get bathed
and dressed.

219
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,489
It will take a while.

220
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,890
Chief, no rush.

221
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:14,849
Take your time.

222
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,170
No need to sweep it.

223
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,129
The princess likes the snow.

224
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:34,129
Your Majesty.

225
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,050
The princess hasn't returned.

226
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,449
The snow...

227
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,089
Xiaoyao will come back.

228
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:40,449
No matter where she is,

229
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,170
I will find her and bring her back.

230
00:17:43,489 --> 00:17:44,080
Okay.

231
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,810
Keep the snow

232
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:47,449
until the princess returns.

233
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,530
This year's winter is unusually cold.

234
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:55,729
It's the same every year.

235
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,329
Every year around this time,

236
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,489
it snows frequently.

237
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,290
In previous years, with Xiaoyao around,

238
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,089
even when it snowed,

239
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:05,010
I didn't feel cold.

240
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,449
The princess loved the snow.

241
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,249
At Zhaoyun Peak,

242
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:10,369
whenever it snowed,

243
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,609
the princess would be happy.

244
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,890
It's always spring in Haoling.

245
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,369
Xiaoyao never saw snow before.

246
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:20,810
Naturally, she's happy

247
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,849
to see the snow.

248
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,050
Your Majesty used to do this

249
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,329
to please the princess.

250
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,209
You're drawing me.

251
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,249
It was easy to cheer her up
when she was a kid.

252
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:01,650
Her emotions always appeared
on her face.

253
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:04,570
If I pleased her,

254
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,129
she would be very happy.

255
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:26,320
(Forget it.)

256
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,290
(What can I do even if I ask him?)

257
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,010
(Even though Tushan Jing is behind it,)

258
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,690
(can I kill him?)

259
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:35,810
(It's just going to bother me.)

260
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,890
(I'd better leave.)

261
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,369
Thank you.

262
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:11,570
I came here
in a fit of anger because of Xiang Liu.

263
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:13,570
You know,

264
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,369
people tend to be impulsive
when they are angry.

265
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:17,410
When I'm impulsive,

266
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,410
I'll do something I don't want to.

267
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,089
Actually, I didn't intend to see you.

268
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:24,849
I just...

269
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,930
It's getting late.

270
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:29,290
There might be a blizzard.

271
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:30,770
You stay for the night.

272
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,010
Tomorrow morning, I'll send you
back to Chenrong Mountain.

273
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,810
It doesn't look like
it's going to snow again.

274
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:40,849
Look.

275
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:43,050
The weather wants you to stay.

276
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:48,770
Fine.

277
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:50,170
I'll go back to my room.

278
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,770
I'll use the front door.

279
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:23,690
(Since I'm here,)

280
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,690
(I might as well make things clear.)

281
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:35,089
- I...
- I...

282
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:39,024
You go first.

283
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,249
I have something to say.

284
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,010
I also have something to say.

285
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:48,650
I waited outside the Tushan Mansion

286
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,089
but I didn't see the princess.

287
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:52,729
But I saw a suspicious person.

288
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,449
Who?

289
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:54,650
Upon investigation,

290
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,849
that person is Yu Xin.

291
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,249
He talked with the guard

292
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,329
at the gate.

293
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,290
The carriage went straight
into the Tushan Mansion.

294
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:01,810
But I don't know

295
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,690
if there's anyone else in the carriage.

296
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,890
Yu Xin?

297
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,729
She's in the Tushan's.

298
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,770
Bring her back.

299
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,488
Yes.

300
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,530
So Xiaoyao has stayed

301
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,129
in Qingshui Town for a while.

302
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:15,170
No wonder I searched the entire Dahuang

303
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,369
and could not find her.

304
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,810
But why did Fangfeng Bei

305
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,410
take the princess to Qingshui Town?

306
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:23,290
Go to Qingshui Town to verify this.

307
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,129
If you can't find anything,

308
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:29,089
you can go to the Rejuvenation Hall.

309
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,712
Yes.

310
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,410
I haven't been able to sleep well
these years,

311
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,729
always tossing and turning,

312
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:47,650
thinking about the past.

313
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:52,129
I thought

314
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:54,849
you had completely let it go

315
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:56,089
and didn't care.

316
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,209
In those first few years,

317
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,010
I really resented you.

318
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,930
So whenever you appeared,

319
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,369
I deliberately acted
as if I didn't care.

320
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,530
But actually,

321
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,449
I've been secretly paying attention
to your reactions.

322
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,770
However, over these years,

323
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:17,249
my mindset has changed a lot.

324
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:19,890
The way I view things has also changed.

325
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,249
I increasingly feel

326
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,010
that blaming everything

327
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,209
on you

328
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,089
is actually not right.

329
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,650
Fangfeng Yiying tried

330
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,890
to assassinate Cang Xuan
many times, you know?

331
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,489
Once,

332
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,530
she shot through Cang Xuan's chest.

333
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,249
Well,

334
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:40,810
when facing you,

335
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,729
she's always been kind, polite,

336
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,930
and gentle.

337
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,650
But I have long known

338
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,410
that she is deep in thought

339
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:50,969
and ruthless.

340
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:54,449
I also know that you are soft-hearted

341
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:55,930
and feel guilty towards her.

342
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,690
She will definitely

343
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,449
use your temperament against you.

344
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:00,849
But,

345
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:05,050
I did nothing.

346
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,890
I thought I was clear-headed
and stood by.

347
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:15,010
I even

348
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,410
never reminded you.

349
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:20,129
Actually, we could have

350
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,570
easily solved the problem together.

351
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:25,690
However, I watched you struggle

352
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:28,930
and fall into the trap.

353
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:30,810
It's not like that.

354
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,489
It's all my fault.

355
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,609
Because of my childhood experiences,

356
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:44,129
I feel pessimistic

357
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,570
about human relationships.

358
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,050
And nothing is reliable.

359
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:53,410
I've never truly believed in you

360
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,129
because I don't dare to.

361
00:24:57,849 --> 00:24:59,849
I've also never done anything for you.

362
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,209
Whenever something occurs,

363
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:04,129
I will be like,

364
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:05,930
look,

365
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,570
everything is going as I expected.

366
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:10,930
Human nature is unpredictable.

367
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:12,770
No one is reliable.

368
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,849
However,

369
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,849
there is a saying

370
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,810
that you reap

371
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:23,410
what you sow.

372
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,969
I got what I sowed.

373
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,969
Because of my distrust

374
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:35,609
and my self-righteousness,

375
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:39,890
I have lost the person I like.

376
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,650
Unfortunately,

377
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:45,849
some mistakes

378
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,729
can be corrected,

379
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,849
but some mistakes

380
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,570
can never be corrected.

381
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,209
Xiaoyao.

382
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:08,849
Don't cry.

383
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:11,050
It's not your fault.

384
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:14,530
I promised to give

385
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:16,650
and trust you first.

386
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,010
I should've protected you.

387
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:22,729
But I failed.

388
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,530
I am the one to blame.

389
00:26:27,729 --> 00:26:28,304
Xiaoyao.

390
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,369
I would rather you don't care about me

391
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:33,930
and forget me.

392
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:37,489
I can't watch you

393
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:38,770
endure the same pain as me.

394
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,410
I don't want to care about you.

395
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:44,369
I want to forget you.

396
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,650
But why did you stop me from marrying?

397
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,609
Why did you stop me from moving on

398
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,209
and acting as if nothing has happened?

399
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,209
Before,

400
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,329
I apologized to you.

401
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,449
Now I take it back.

402
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:04,489
I do not regret it at all.

403
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:07,849
Xiang Liu used the most extreme methods

404
00:27:07,969 --> 00:27:09,729
to stir up things in Dahuang,

405
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,170
but I'm very happy

406
00:27:12,209 --> 00:27:13,530
that you didn't marry Fenglong.

407
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:17,729
You rogue.

408
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,690
I've always been a rogue.

409
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,530
I will return
to Chenrong Mountain tomorrow.

410
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,770
You don't need to see me off.

411
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:44,010
The mistake has been made.

412
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,890
Even if we regret it,

413
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,290
there is no going back.

414
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:53,089
Whether it's for you

415
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,010
or me,

416
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:57,729
from now on,

417
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:02,690
we should not meet again.

418
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,209
I've heard you out.

419
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,570
It's your turn to hear me out.

420
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,170
That's fair to me.

421
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,449
I have already...

422
00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:15,050
Tushan Tian is not my son.

423
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:25,449
Mother.

424
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:27,570
Why doesn't Father come to see me?

425
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:29,729
I miss Father.

426
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,410
(Fangfeng Yiying)

427
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,129
How about I perform a magic trick
for you?

428
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:33,968
Great.

429
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:55,849
The butterfly plays with you, okay?

430
00:28:59,089 --> 00:28:59,728
Mother.

431
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,170
Did you use magic

432
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,249
on Father?

433
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,849
Otherwise,

434
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:08,449
why does Father become mute

435
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,849
as soon as he sees you?

436
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:12,050
He never talks to you

437
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,290
or keeps me company.

438
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,530
Don't talk nonsense.

439
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:18,650
But it's the truth.

440
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:19,810
Time to sleep.

441
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,609
So, you suspect

442
00:29:36,729 --> 00:29:38,129
that Tian is Tushan Hou's son.

443
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,489
Fearing the truth would come out,

444
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,290
they killed your sister-in-law.

445
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,010
Exactly.

446
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,890
Didn't you say you remembered nothing

447
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,050
about that night?

448
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:54,849
How can you be sure

449
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,810
that Fangfeng Yiying and you did not...

450
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:02,690
Fangfeng Yiying had Grandma drug me,

451
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,570
tipping me over the edge.

452
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,609
And I mistook her for you in a daze.

453
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:12,050
But Fangfeng Yiying didn't know

454
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,570
what you meant to me.

455
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,489
Precisely because it was you,

456
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:18,770
I definitely couldn't

457
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,089
take you in that case.

458
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:23,530
Even if I offered to sleep with you,

459
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,489
would you refuse me?

460
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,410
If you did that,

461
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,209
I'd only be more restrained.

462
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:31,969
If you did that,

463
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,890
it meant you trusted me.

464
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:36,530
I'd never betray your trust.

465
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,489
I'd give you the best of everything.

466
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,170
I'd only take you after marrying you.

467
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:48,129
Even though I can't

468
00:30:48,129 --> 00:30:49,530
remember what happened that night,

469
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:53,050
I clearly remember

470
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,369
I was in Fangfeng Yiying's room.

471
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,690
I have always desired

472
00:30:59,729 --> 00:31:01,690
to be with you openly.

473
00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:04,530
How could I possibly

474
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,410
take you on another woman's bed?

475
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,010
I was delirious,

476
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,489
but I would never go

477
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:13,810
against my innermost desires.

478
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,290
I trust you.

479
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:21,690
Thank you for trusting me.

480
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:29,010
Hou.

481
00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:31,050
You know Tushan Jing is now in Qingqiu.

482
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:32,449
Why do you want to meet with me?

483
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,329
If others see us,

484
00:31:34,969 --> 00:31:35,969
our efforts will be in vain.

485
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,592
Hou.

486
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,329
I don't want

487
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,690
to live furtively anymore.

488
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,690
What do you want?

489
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,129
It was hard to kill Tushan Jing

490
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,129
when he hid in Zhiyi.

491
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:46,050
Now that he has returned to Qingqiu,

492
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,849
we can take the opportunity to kill him.

493
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:53,770
Tushan Jing

494
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,609
(Tushan Hou)

495
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:56,170
can't do without medicine.

496
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:57,729
Why make an unnecessary move?

497
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:00,050
I've sent someone to investigate it.

498
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,729
The dosage
of his medicine is increasing.

499
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,449
It means his heart condition
is getting more severe.

500
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:07,170
There's no need
for us to take action at all.

501
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:11,249
Alright.

502
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,609
Just be patient.

503
00:32:17,209 --> 00:32:18,089
Don't alert him.

504
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:20,010
It's better to wait quietly.

505
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,930
Just watch Tushan Jing

506
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:25,010
live longer in pain.

507
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:32,329
So you've long suspected them.

508
00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:34,609
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

509
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,410
I have no evidence.

510
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,570
If you've already forgotten me,

511
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,930
why should I say it and upset you?

512
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:44,010
Tonight,

513
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,849
I've learned you never forget me.

514
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:49,249
Things couldn't get any worse anyway.

515
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,209
So I tell you all.

516
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,690
How have you been these...

517
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,329
What's wrong?

518
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:04,930
I'm fine.

519
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:07,050
It's getting late.

520
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:08,609
Good night.

521
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:09,770
I have to go.

522
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,008
Jing.

523
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:32,816
Chief.

524
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:45,129
What exactly is the illness you have?

525
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,010
It's nothing serious.

526
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:51,410
I'll be fine after some rest.

527
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,050
How could this happen?

528
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,010
Decades ago,

529
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,770
Chief was utterly devastated

530
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:16,570
with a heart condition.

531
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,530
Over the years, for the sake of you,

532
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,770
he could neither sleep nor eat well.

533
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:21,929
His moods grew gloomier.

534
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:23,689
Over three months ago,

535
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:24,489
you even invited Chief

536
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,050
to your wedding banquet.

537
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:27,929
It made Chief get a serious illness,

538
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:29,489
and the heart condition worsened.

539
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,370
His lifespan has been affected.

540
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,368
- I'm afraid...
- Jing Ye.

541
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:34,960
Just leave.

542
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:55,290
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

543
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:14,889
Xiaoyao.

544
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,050
Don't cry.

545
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:22,330
Don't cry for me.

546
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:27,249
Don't cry for me.

547
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,649
Take medicine
according to my prescription.

548
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,370
You mustn't use your spirit power.

549
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,090
Think and worry less.

550
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,409
Have some quiet rest.

551
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,112
Alright.

552
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,889
Chief's illness began over 40 years ago.

553
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:06,449
Now, he has old

554
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:07,969
and new diseases.

555
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:10,449
Your Highness' prescription is good.

556
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,090
But it requires long-term care.

557
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:13,610
A decade or two, I guess.

558
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:15,850
Your Highness, have you decided?

559
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,010
Do as the princess says.

560
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:21,209
Yes.

561
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:31,568
What's wrong?

562
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,649
Does your heart hurt again?

563
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:48,209
This is your medical fee.

564
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,050
Please accept it.

565
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:07,330
Chief.

566
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:08,449
The King of Xiyan

567
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:10,010
sends someone
to bring the princess back.

568
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,130
Your Highness.

569
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:14,169
I'm here by His Majesty's command

570
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:16,050
to escort you back to the palace.

571
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,169
If I accept this,

572
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:36,169
I'll promise to cure your illness.

573
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:42,810
I'll do what you say

574
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,010
and take care of myself.

575
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:45,810
In a few days,

576
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:47,330
I will go to Zhiyi.

577
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,689
Please continue treating me then.

578
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,929
If you didn't get the grains and fodder,

579
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,249
many brothers would die this winter.

580
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:19,449
I am the adviser of the Chenrong Army.

581
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:21,729
I'm doing what I should.

582
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:23,929
How did you

583
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:25,570
convince the Tushan Family
to lend a hand?

584
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:29,449
Just do it as the businessman does.

585
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,130
What business could make them take risks
to provide us

586
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:36,010
(Hong Jiang)
with grains and fodder for free?

587
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,050
The King of Xiyan might send people

588
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,090
to inspect Qingshui Town.

589
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,969
Tell our people to be cautious

590
00:38:45,649 --> 00:38:46,489
lest we're exposed.

591
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:48,729
Why?

592
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:51,530
Could they find out
about the grain supply?

593
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,409
With Tushan Jing's capability,

594
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:57,610
I don't think he can't handle it well.

595
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,449
Then what happened?

596
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,649
If you don't want to say,
you surely have your reasons.

597
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,010
I won't ask you.

598
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,370
I will instruct soldiers

599
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:14,249
to act cautiously.

600
00:39:29,072 --> 00:39:30,409
(Why not quit being a princess)

601
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,770
and rove the world with me?

602
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:49,328
Okay.

603
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,290
If you give up everything,

604
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:52,770
I will go with you.

605
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:10,810
Grandfather.

606
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,610
Grandfather.

607
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:16,530
I am back.

608
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,010
Grandfather.

609
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:51,330
You even had the nerve

610
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,649
to call off the wedding
in front of everyone.

611
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,249
I thought you were afraid of nothing.

612
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,610
Come out and talk.

613
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,370
Come out.

614
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,209
What exactly is going on

615
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,449
between you and Fangfeng Bei?

616
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,570
If he wants to marry you,

617
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,249
will he have no courage to meet us?

618
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:25,689
Fangfeng Bei is dead.

619
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:30,610
Are you sure Fangfeng Bei is dead?

620
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,169
I am sure.

621
00:41:33,729 --> 00:41:35,449
Fangfeng Bei

622
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:38,489
will never appear again.

623
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,729
Fangfeng Bei died for me.

624
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,130
I don't want to talk

625
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,889
about him anymore.

626
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:51,610
In front of the crowds,

627
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:54,249
Fangfeng Bei and Xiaoyao left together.

628
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:56,209
Now Xiaoyao has come back,

629
00:41:56,649 --> 00:41:57,570
but he is dead.

630
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,370
We owe an explanation to the people.

631
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,610
When my guards caught up with Xiaoyao,

632
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,850
Fangfeng Bei refused to release her.

633
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,649
To protect the princess,

634
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:16,449
the guards killed him

635
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:17,850
in an emergency.

636
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,010
Actually, it's good
that Fangfeng Bei was killed.

637
00:42:20,649 --> 00:42:21,770
That's what the Chishui Family

638
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,130
and other people want.

639
00:42:23,649 --> 00:42:26,249
It also helps appease Fenglong
and Chenrong Yi.

640
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:28,449
The Fangfeng Family doesn't dare
to complain

641
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,010
because of a baseborn son.

642
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,729
That's good.

643
00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:41,370
You go back and rest.

644
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,729
I need to discuss some things
with Grandfather.

645
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:52,770
You may leave.

646
00:43:06,736 --> 00:43:08,489
When you asked me
to persuade Xiang Liu to surrender,

647
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:09,570
did you already know

648
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,050
that Xiang Liu and Fangfeng Bei

649
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:12,330
were the same person?

650
00:43:15,649 --> 00:43:17,689
It was just my speculation before.

651
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,850
I only found it out today.

652
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:30,249
If it had not been
for Chi Chen back then,

653
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:32,449
Auntie wouldn't have...

654
00:43:35,169 --> 00:43:37,489
Xiang Liu is really too arrogant.

655
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:40,489
How dare he see Xiaoyao again.
