00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:29,792
=Lost You Forever S2=

2
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,848
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,450
Aren't you?

4
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:37,329
Xiaoyao.

5
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:39,770
I don't want you to leave. I want...

6
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,770
Cang Xuan, let go.

7
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:50,170
Xuan.

8
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:52,450
Let it go.

9
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,050
We can't let
the Chishui Family beat us to it

10
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,249
and make Father feel

11
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,730
that he has to learn about

12
00:01:57,929 --> 00:01:59,690
my marriage from someone else.

13
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,649
His Majesty

14
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,810
gave consent to your wedding?

15
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,530
Of course.

16
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,489
Didn't he say anything?

17
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:25,450
Are you saying

18
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,049
that His Majesty would oppose it?

19
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:28,330
Great Emperor wouldn't.

20
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,064
But His Majesty...

21
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:35,170
His Majesty is close to Xiaoyao.

22
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:37,129
I'm afraid His Majesty would

23
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,370
find your proposal to Xiaoyao too abrupt

24
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,890
and disapprove of it.

25
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,530
Too abrupt?

26
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,810
Do you think I'm acting on impulse?

27
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,129
Aren't you?

28
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,489
You didn't consult with us at all.

29
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,090
This is my marriage.

30
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,090
Of course, I'll decide on it myself.

31
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,689
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

32
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,170
I have thought it through

33
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,730
and decided to get married soon

34
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,450
to avoid any changes.

35
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,689
Why?

36
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,569
Brother.

37
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,409
Make yourself clear.

38
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,689
His Majesty is waging a war
against Haoling.

39
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,810
Really?

40
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,090
Such a serious matter

41
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,289
requires confidentiality.

42
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,769
Princess, take a break
and have some water.

43
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,450
You did nothing this morning.

44
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:39,689
Are you short of herbs?

45
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,209
No.

46
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,649
I just don't know

47
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:44,649
what I should make

48
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:46,569
for the last time.

49
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,769
For the last time?

50
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,849
(I can still make pills)

51
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:54,409
(for you right now.)

52
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,209
But after I get married,

53
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,090
I won't be able to anymore.

54
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:03,730
The last time

55
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,010
has to be a bit special.

56
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,489
Take your time.

57
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:07,450
You'll figure it out.

58
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,450
Yeah.

59
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,250
The last time has to be a bit special.

60
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,010
Shan Hu.

61
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,409
Run an errand for me.

62
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,969
Take this list to His Majesty

63
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:28,650
and ask for the ingredients.

64
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,170
Ten deep-sea fish gallbladders.

65
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,490
Ten Beiming serpent scales.

66
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,369
Ten Zhaoyuan red pearls.

67
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,170
A melon-sized

68
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,650
ten-thousand-year ice crystal.

69
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,809
Princess.

70
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,330
Are you emptying the treasury

71
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,210
of Xiyan?

72
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:43,809
So many rare treasures.

73
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:44,890
By the way,

74
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,249
I also need two experts

75
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,409
to watch the furnace,

76
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,450
preferably of ice and fire attributes,

77
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,330
respectively.

78
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,170
Yes, Princess.

79
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,170
I'll convey your message.

80
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:06,610
I pay my respects, Your Majesty.

81
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:08,650
Xiaoyao sent us a letter

82
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,490
saying she's marrying Fenglong.

83
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:11,450
Bring her back

84
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,730
to prepare for the wedding.

85
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,288
Understood.

86
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,730
But this is

87
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:17,210
not urgent.

88
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,849
You don't need to rush.

89
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:20,129
Health comes first.

90
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:23,730
Master.

91
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,289
Even if it's urgent,

92
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:26,569
I can't rush.

93
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,569
I've been

94
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:28,490
feeling unwell.

95
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,010
I'm always dizzy

96
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,369
and can't even ride a mount.

97
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:32,610
Wherever I go,

98
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,210
I walk slowly.

99
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,490
What a convenient time.

100
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,689
Besides,

101
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:39,809
I finally arrived

102
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:41,170
in Cang Xuan's turf.

103
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,210
I deserve some rest, anyway.

104
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,089
And I have to visit a few friends

105
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,650
in Zhiyi City.

106
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:47,849
Master.

107
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:49,650
You won't see me

108
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,170
in a long time.

109
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,650
Go ahead.

110
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:56,129
Understood.

111
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:29,210
What is this?

112
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,330
Chishui Xian.

113
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,249
More spirit power.

114
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,289
Yu Jiang, stop.

115
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:56,784
That's enough.

116
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,369
Made it.

117
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,770
What on earth are you making

118
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,930
that you need two experts?

119
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:13,930
It's just a pill.

120
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,050
I thought Nian was extravagant enough.

121
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,529
I didn't expect that

122
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,289
she's nothing comparable to you.

123
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,369
I'm going to Zhiyi in a while.

124
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:27,849
Do as you wish.

125
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:30,770
I have been weary and exhausted

126
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,249
from the journey.

127
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,409
I need a few days of rest.

128
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,770
No rush.

129
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,210
To the usual place.

130
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:41,936
Be fast.

131
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:43,289
Please rest assured.

132
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:49,249
Thank you.

133
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,770
To Qingshui Town again?

134
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,450
Yes.

135
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:12,569
Anything wrong on Chenrong Mountain?

136
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,010
Why is she suddenly

137
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,409
sending something to Qingshui Town

138
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,129
when it hasn't been three months?

139
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,490
Everything is fine there.

140
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,770
But the Chishui Family

141
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:21,210
has been acting weird.

142
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:22,330
Chief.

143
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,450
Should we intercept this box

144
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:25,969
or take a look inside?

145
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,689
Send it fast.

146
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:29,450
Do not delay.

147
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:30,096
Understood.

148
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,650
Prepare the mounts.

149
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,770
Find out what

150
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,970
Fenglong has been doing.

151
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:36,850
Understood.

152
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,090
Prepare some...

153
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:40,809
Chief.

154
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,410
You should rest first.

155
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:47,530
Go to Chishui.

156
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,592
Understood.

157
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:25,249
They make nice braised dishes.

158
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,129
Try and see

159
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,330
if you like them.

160
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,770
My tastes have changed.

161
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:34,450
I no longer like these.

162
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:39,369
Then try the green plum wine.

163
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,010
Chief Tushan, didn't you hear

164
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,169
what I just said?

165
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,609
I said my taste had changed.

166
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,090
The wine I love to drink now

167
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:51,770
is the Lianhua Liquor from Chishui.

168
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,169
It just happens

169
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,809
that I have

170
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:07,970
something to tell you.

171
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,929
Fenglong and I are getting married.

172
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,010
You're a good friend of Fenglong.

173
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,129
Please come early for the wedding

174
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,129
for fine wine.

175
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,489
Alright.

176
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,530
I've said everything I needed to.

177
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:27,210
I won't disturb you anymore.

178
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:32,129
Miao Pu.

179
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:32,890
Shan Hu.

180
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:42,530
Chief.

181
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:49,929
Princess.

182
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:53,970
Princess.

183
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,809
Princess.

184
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,410
Princess.

185
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,049
What's wrong?

186
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,689
Princess.

187
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,850
Are you alright?

188
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:09,489
Why would you ask that?

189
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:14,169
Do all the major clans

190
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,809
know about my wedding?

191
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,010
Princess of Haoling is marrying

192
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,129
Chief Chishui.

193
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:20,609
The major clans must have

194
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:21,890
heard about it.

195
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,770
Chief Tushan didn't seem to know.

196
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:26,809
That's right.

197
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:29,169
He seems to have just found out.

198
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,450
The wedding will take place soon.

199
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:34,770
But His Majesty and the King of Haoling

200
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,249
kept the news tightly sealed.

201
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,049
The Chishui clan would not
announce it rashly.

202
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:41,410
So Chief Tushan may not have

203
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,410
heard about it.

204
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,249
Their Majesties are not

205
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:45,369
very enthusiastic

206
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,929
and they still haven't announced it.

207
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:47,970
It seems as if

208
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,929
they're waiting for you
to change your mind.

209
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,770
Nonsense.

210
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,290
I made

211
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:08,770
these dishes for you.

212
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:11,530
What made you so happy

213
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:14,049
that you cooked in person?

214
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,330
I'm heading back tomorrow

215
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:18,890
to wait for the wedding.

216
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:20,650
I'm here to bid you farewell.

217
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,530
So soon?

218
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,929
I want to

219
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,090
spend some time with Father.

220
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:36,249
Actually, there's no need to rush.

221
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,450
We can simply postpone the wedding.

222
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,929
That's not how things work.

223
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,290
Xuan.

224
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:57,410
I can't bear to leave you.

225
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,010
It's not like I'm never coming back.

226
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,249
Maybe I'll come right back

227
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,049
after the wedding.

228
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,729
Just think of it

229
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,689
as a usual parting.

230
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,689
I'm just going back

231
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,010
to visit Father.

232
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,450
We are only parting

233
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,369
for a short while.

234
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,169
It's different this time.

235
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,290
How?

236
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,970
No matter where you went,

237
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,129
I could always bring you back.

238
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,249
But

239
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,249
it's different now.

240
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,489
No matter how long and how far

241
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,049
we were apart,

242
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,650
we had no one but each other.

243
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:50,609
Be it on Zhaoyun Peak,

244
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,569
Wushen Mountain,

245
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:54,489
or Chenrong Mountain,

246
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,929
the two of us shared

247
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:00,530
weal and woe.

248
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,929
Be it in poverty,

249
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:05,770
wealth,

250
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,569
or grave danger with our lives

251
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,489
at risk,

252
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:14,249
we were each other's support

253
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:16,410
and family.

254
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:20,010
But from now on,

255
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:22,330
you will have your family

256
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,049
and children.

257
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:28,850
I'm no longer your only one.

258
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:32,929
Am I being selfish?

259
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,609
We have grown up. That's all.

260
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:42,689
We have grown up.

261
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,970
Let's drink by bowls

262
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,609
and get wasted.

263
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:50,320
Alright.

264
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,650
Cheers, Xuan.

265
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,369
Xiaoyao.

266
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,850
Do you remember how I sent you away

267
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,450
to Mount Jade

268
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:23,330
from Zhaoyun Peak when we were kids?

269
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,729
I thought I couldn't keep you

270
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:31,650
because I wasn't the king.

271
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:35,090
I thought once I became

272
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,569
the King of Xiyan,

273
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,929
then I could

274
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:40,169
keep you forever.

275
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:43,569
But now I am the King of Xiyan.

276
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:47,809
I still have to send you away.

277
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:41,210
It's all my fault.

278
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,850
I let them get close to you.

279
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:51,090
I let them into your heart.

280
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:56,929
It's not your fault.

281
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,169
Whatever you do

282
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,249
is right.

283
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,249
You did nothing wrong.

284
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:02,970
No.

285
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,129
I was wrong.

286
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,010
I was terribly wrong.

287
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,129
Xiaoyao.

288
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:19,824
Today,

289
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:23,089
I shall speak my mind.

290
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,969
I must confess.

291
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:26,170
Go ahead.

292
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,570
I like you.

293
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:34,290
I only like you.

294
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,930
Don't marry Fenglong.

295
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,129
Marry me.

296
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,290
Become my queen.

297
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,489
I can promise that you'll be

298
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,849
my only one

299
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:49,969
in this lifetime.

300
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:50,650
I don't want

301
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,050
any of those women.

302
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,410
I will drive them all away.

303
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:57,890
I only want you.

304
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,010
I only want you...

305
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:05,616
Jun Yi.

306
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:10,290
Take His Majesty away.

307
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:10,960
Understood.

308
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,050
Guard His Majesty tonight.

309
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:14,729
If he says anything,

310
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:16,290
whoever hears it

311
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:17,609
shall be killed.

312
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:18,170
Understood.

313
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,249
You're drunk.

314
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,530
Xuan.

315
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,690
You're drunk.

316
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,184
Zhoushan.

317
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:30,129
Tomorrow,

318
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,890
issue a decree to proclaim

319
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,249
that Chief Chishui

320
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,129
is about to marry Princess of Haoling.

321
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,392
Understood.

322
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:42,960
(Wushen Mountain, Haoling)

323
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,896
(Cheng'en Palace, Haoling)

324
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,410
Father.

325
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:55,729
I'm back.

326
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,089
Good.

327
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:59,329
It's earlier than I expected.

328
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,209
I'm getting married.

329
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:03,050
I must come back to prepare for it.

330
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,650
I will

331
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:08,690
take my leave first.

332
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:16,290
Your grandfather
has made an announcement.

333
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,329
But I haven't picked the date
with the Chishui Clan.

334
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:21,410
Why haven't you?

335
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,249
Xiaoyao.

336
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,089
Have you thought it through?

337
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:27,770
Yes.

338
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,650
I'll give you another week.

339
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,369
Seven days later,

340
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:32,609
answer me again.

341
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:33,449
Father,

342
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,570
I have thought it through.

343
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,570
I know.

344
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,969
But I still want you

345
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:39,690
to think it over.

346
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,530
Don't worry about what others

347
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:42,129
might say.

348
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,810
Tell me if you change your mind.

349
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:46,930
I have your back.

350
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:48,369
No need.

351
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:49,129
Father...

352
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,249
Your marriage

353
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,010
will decide how you live

354
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,089
from now on.

355
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:00,449
If you have

356
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,369
no regrets

357
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,249
or hesitation,

358
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,690
then why can't you

359
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,449

397
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:45,392
(West River Bank, Qingshui Town)

398
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,410
My older brother tortured me

399
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,650
in a dungeon for three years.

400
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,729
I lost all my spirit power

401
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:52,129
and my limbs were ruined.

402
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,849
Even my throat
was scorched by the spirit fire.

403
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,209
I couldn't say a single word.

404
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,249
He thought I was destroyed

405
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:02,930
and threw me into the river.

406
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,129
I had long lost the will to live.

407
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,410
Semi-unconscious,

408
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:11,650
I didn't know how long I drifted

409
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,849
until I ended here.

410
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:20,129
You were sealed

411
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,290
and didn't see me.

412
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,530
My flesh was rotting

413
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,329
with a stench.

414
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:28,849
I barely looked like a human.

415
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:31,570
Those who saw me

416
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,010
covered their noses and avoided me.

417
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:35,969
Even those who knew me

418
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:37,290
wouldn't come closer.

419
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,329
Only Xiaoliu.

420
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:42,729
Only Xiaoliu held me

421
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:43,930
without any disdain.

422
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,690
She didn't mind the stench

423
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:50,369
or the terrible wounds on my body.

424
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,810
She treated my wounds,

425
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,410
washed my hair,

426
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:56,369
and fed me.

427
00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:00,209
She told me stories
so that I wasn't bored.

428
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,930
What a nice girl.

429
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,690
But I lost her.

430
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,089
What would Ye Shiqi do

431
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:18,489
at this point?

432
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:27,570
This imperial edict

433
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,329
has been sent
throughout Xiyan and Haoling?

434
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,089
Your Majesty.

435
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,650
We followed the order

436
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,170
given by the Great Emperor.

437
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,170
Grandfather.

438
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,849
I don't get it.

439
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:02,770
Why would you help Fenglong,

440
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,930
the outsider?

441
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,369
I'm not helping Fenglong.

442
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,969
I'm helping Xiaoyao.

443
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,690
Xiaoyao is the only child
Heng left behind.

444
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,570
She wishes to live
a peaceful and stable life.

445
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,810
Shouldn't I grant her that?

446
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,770
Xiaoyao does not like Fenglong.

447
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,089
She doesn't know

448
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:25,290
what she wants.

449
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,249
Then what

450
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:28,489
do you think she wants?

451
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,209
To always follow you?

452
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,329
To always be embroiled
in court and infighting?

453
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,810
To always be cautious

454
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:39,449
and make sacrifices?

455
00:26:43,449 --> 00:26:45,449
Both of you grew up

456
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,170
on Zhaoyun Peak.

457
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,170
But ever since Xiaoyao was cast adrift
among the common folk,

458
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,369
she's been different from you.

459
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,810
She wants

460
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:57,890
a leisurely life of a commoner,
which is peaceful and stable.

461
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,810
It's not like I can't give her
what she wants.

462
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:02,209
I just need...

463
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,449
Some time.

464
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:04,969
Right?

465
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:07,969
Cang Xuan.

466
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,369
I've been in your position

467
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:11,249
before.

468
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,089
I know more than anyone

469
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,050
that as long as one sits on that throne,

470
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,369
he always needs to

471
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:20,290
be cautious and vigilant

472
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:23,089
and make sacrifices.

473
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,369
You need some time.

474
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:27,690
But even you

475
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,290
don't know how long it will be.

476
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,770
What did you promise your aunt?

477
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:49,089
I promised to

478
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,410
protect Xiaoyao.

479
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:57,969
Let Xiaoyao get married

480
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,849
and do what she wants to do.

481
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,530
Give her the life she wants.

482
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,489
This is how you protect her.

483
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:31,849
Poinciana flower wreath.

484
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:33,089
I made it for you.

485
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:50,650
Xiaoyao.

486
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:52,410
What are you waiting for?

487
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,249
I don't know.

488
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:56,530
But you're waiting.

489
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:59,089
Maybe I'm waiting for destiny.

490
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:01,410
Destiny?

491
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,089
What is destiny?

492
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,449
I don't know.

493
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,449
Xiaoyao.

494
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,609
You're not being serious.

495
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,449
You keep saying you don't know.

496
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:17,650
I really don't know.

497
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,849
Isn't it true that

498
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,089
none of us know anything about life?

499
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:24,770
We don't know when

500
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:26,890
we'll be born or die.

501
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:28,810
We don't know if

502
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,449
lovers can get married.

503
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,650
We don't know if loving couples

504
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:34,410
can stay together forever.

505
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,810
We don't even know

506
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,650
what will happen tomorrow.

507
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:42,609
We don't know.

508
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:47,530
Back then,

509
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:49,530
I thought I was the Princess of Haoling

510
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,209
and could have anything I desired.

511
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,249
But I didn't know that

512
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:55,650
Xuan would suddenly leave Haoling

513
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,770
and become the King of Xiyan.

514
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,449
Nor did I know that

515
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,849
he would marry someone else.

516
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,129
And now, I don't know

517
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,930
if I can

518
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,290
be with him or not.

519
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:26,209
Xiaoyao.

520
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,530
What are you expecting?

521
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,650
Father asked me to wait for a week.

522
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:35,089
It is destiny

523
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:37,810
if nothing happens within the week.

524
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,690
It is also destiny if something happens.

525
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:45,170
When you can't change anything

526
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,129
and don't know how to

527
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:48,050
make a change,

528
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:52,410
it seems all you can do is wait.

529
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:17,050
It's your turn.

530
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:30,010
I've lost.

531
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,290
Your mind is unsettled.
Of course you will lose.

532
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:36,729
I'll go out for a walk.

533
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:37,729
I'll come with you.

534
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,650
What are you worried about?

535
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:47,329
You think I'll stop Xiaoyao

536
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:48,369
from getting married?

537
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:56,489
I am the King of Xiyan.

538
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:58,969
With the power I have,

539
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,010
I can directly issue an imperial decree

540
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,410
to cancel the wedding.

541
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,129
Or I can give

542
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:09,010
a secret command to the assassins.

543
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,570
They will fulfill my wishes

544
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,290
at all costs.

545
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:16,290
Just a single word

546
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,089
and I could avoid the pain.

547
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,570
But I will not do so.

548
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:29,449
Because this is what Xiaoyao wants.

549
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:32,449
No matter what she wants,

550
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:33,530
I will give it to her.

551
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,770
I will take out my heart for her

552
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,050
if she wants it.

553
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,449
This is the life of a king.

554
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,489
We gain everything.

555
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:50,290
But we also lose everything.

556
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,209
Grandfather, I am not like you.

557
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,729
I have never yearned to be a king.

558
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,890
I lost my father,

559
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,249
my mother,

560
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,209
my grandmother,

561
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:07,410
and my aunt.

562
00:33:08,729 --> 00:33:10,690
I have come this far.

563
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,890
What I want

564
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,089
is to protect

565
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:16,729
whatever I have left.

566
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,449
But when I have

567
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:24,129
the power to protect everything,

568
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,369
I have lost

569
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:29,810
the only person I want to protect.

570
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,810
(We won't ever be parted)

571
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,850
as long as I'm your little sister.

572
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:04,489
Alright.

573
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:05,689
You're always my sister.

574
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,290
And I'm your big brother forever.

575
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:08,370
No matter what happens,

576
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:09,729
we'll be together forever.

577
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,050
Deal.

578
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,090
Together forever.

579
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,010
We will never be parted.

580
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,850
It's a promise.

581
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,976
♪You appear at the end of the river♪

582
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:57,360
♪But disappear as clouds rise♪

583
00:35:58,064 --> 00:36:01,744
♪You appear when I look up♪

584
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:06,192
♪But disappear as I lower my head♪

585
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:10,544
♪You appear in the snow♪

♪You appear as the smoke rises♪

588
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,800
♪You disappear in the light♪

589
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,290
Princess.

590
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:32,649
Do you want this rouge?

591
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:33,729
Or that one?

592
00:36:34,649 --> 00:36:35,249
Either is fine.

593
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:37,530
Princess.

594
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:39,370
King of Haoling

595
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,810
gave you a phoenix pendant.

596
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:41,969
Great Emperor

597
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,850
gave you a cloud-pattern pendant.

598
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,570
Which one would you wear today?

599
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:46,370
Either works.

600
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,449
I've never seen a bride like you.

601
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,810
What should a bride be like?

602
00:36:56,729 --> 00:36:58,050
If one day

603
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,169
I can marry Cang Xuan,

604
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,770
I will definitely be nervous.

605
00:37:01,209 --> 00:37:02,409
I'll also be a bit scared

606
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:03,850
that I'm not pretty enough.

607
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:06,530
From my accessories and jewelry

608
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:07,729
to the color of my rouge,

609
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,850
I will hand-pick everything.

610
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:10,249
I will look forward

611
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,810
to my future with him.

612
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,169
It will make me smile.

613
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,249
And I'll be reluctant

614
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,090
to leave my father and mother.

615
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:20,689
I will surely cry.

616
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,209
Are you anticipating

617
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:23,169
or are you afraid?

618
00:37:23,169 --> 00:37:23,969
Will you cry

619
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:24,770
or will you laugh?

620
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:28,489
This is what every woman is like
when she marries

621
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:29,249
the man she loves.

622
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,090
Crying and laughing.

623
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,010
Anticipating and afraid.

624
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:39,969
Xiaoyao.

625
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,689
Do you like Chief Chishui?

626
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,649
Boatman.

627
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,130
Boatman.

628
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:17,330
Boatman.

629
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,850
(I am content)

630
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,729
(with my lot.)

631
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,249
Wherever I go is home.

632
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,489
I taught you how to protect yourself.

633
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,489
Yet you just muddle along

634
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:05,409
and idle around.

635
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,489
Did you ask for my permission?

636
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:14,090
Xiaoyao.

637
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:15,050
Did you hear me?

638
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,969
Do you like Chief Chishui or not?

639
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:20,489
Fenglong is a handsome man

640
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:22,010
from a good family.

641
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,050
He has a good temperament.

642
00:39:24,649 --> 00:39:26,610
Which noble lady in Dahuang

643
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:28,130
wouldn't like such a gentleman?

644
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:29,729
I don't care if the others

645
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:30,929
like Chishui Fenglong

646
00:39:30,929 --> 00:39:31,649
or not.

647
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:33,850
I'm asking if you like him.

648
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:40,810
Great Princess.

649
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,489
We have arrived.

650
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,770
You can get off now.

651
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:45,810
I see.

652
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,209
You haven't changed
into the wedding dress.

653
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:50,810
And the jewelry.

654
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,770
Hurry. Don't be late.

655
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,449
Hurry.

656
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:58,969
Stand up, please.

657
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:00,449
Hands up, please.

658
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:15,504
Chief.

659
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,130
Princess' boat has arrived.

660
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:23,010
Look at me.

661
00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:24,530
Is there anything improper?

662
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,570
Not at all.

663
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,929
Don't be so anxious.

664
00:40:30,449 --> 00:40:31,489
I have to be anxious.

665
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,889
I'm marrying

666
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,850
the most

667
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,929
distinguished lady in Dahuang.

668
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:36,290
Sister of the King of Xiyan.

669
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,489
Daughter of King of Haoling.

670
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:38,810
Disciple of the Queen Mother.

671
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,050
Then you should be more at ease.

672
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,449
Because throughout Dahuang,

673
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,850
only you deserve the princess

674
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,050
with your status

675
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:45,010
and ability.

676
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:46,090
Makes sense.

677
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:47,120
You'll be rewarded.

678
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:52,169
- The princess has arrived.
- The princess has arrived.

679
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:53,689
Let's greet the bride.

680
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,370
She's not only the most prestigious

681
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,889
but also the prettiest lady in Dahuang.

682
00:42:33,729 --> 00:42:34,290
(You)

683
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,729
(saved me.)

684
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,090
(I am)

685
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:42,649
(your servant.)

686
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,090
(Please name me.)

687
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,330
Beggar.

688
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:49,489
Starting today,

689
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,810
you'll be Ye Shiqi.
