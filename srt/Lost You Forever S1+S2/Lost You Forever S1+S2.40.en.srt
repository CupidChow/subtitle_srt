=Lost You Forever S2=

00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,688
=Episode 1=

3
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:36,362
(Previously)

4
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,362
Seven bunny babies.

5
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:40,362
The mother and the kids are fine.

6
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:41,841
Whoever can't have a baby

7
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,282
(Rejuvenation Hall)
come to my Rejuvenation Hall

8
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:44,602
and look for me, Wen Xiaoliu.

9
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:46,082
It's been 300 years.

10
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:48,201
Cang Xuan, swing higher.

11
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:49,441
Higher.

12
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:50,032
Alright.

13
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,201
I've traveled through Dahuang

14
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:54,082
and searched everywhere
in Haoling and Xiyan,

15
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:56,801
but I have no news of her.

16
00:01:57,642 --> 00:01:58,841
Xiaoyao must think

17
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:01,322
that her brother is useless, right?

18
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:05,402
Beggar.

19
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,161
Starting today,

20
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:08,722
you'll be Ye Shiqi.

21
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:11,082
A physician from Qingshui Town

22
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:12,162
could be so powerful.

23
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:14,442
Do you have wives
or concubines who are infertile?

24
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:16,048
Who

25
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:18,082
are you exactly?

26
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,841
I am just an abandoned person.

27
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:21,481
Mother.

28
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:23,522
When you miss me,

29
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:25,681
take it out and look at it.

30
00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:27,522
I couldn't protect myself,

31
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,082
had no one to rely on,

32
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:33,401
and had nowhere to go.

33
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:36,162
Get the most experienced interrogator.

34
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:38,681
Just leave Wen Xiaoliu alive.

35
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:45,082
I swear.

36
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,802
I swear.

37
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:49,201
- We stand by each other.
- We stand by each other.

38
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:50,722
- Forever and ever.
- Forever and ever.

39
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:52,282
- We shall trust
- We shall trust

40
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:54,681
- and look after each other.
- and look after each other.

41
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:56,481
- Never go back on my word.
- Never go back on my word.

42
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:57,522
Cang Xuan.

43
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:01,002
You are descendants of great families.

44
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:04,002
Why did you come
and suffer in Qingshui Town?

45
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:05,162
For my sister.

46
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:06,681
I will bring you back

47
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:08,722
from Mount Jade as soon as possible.

48
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:12,401
Xiaoyao.

49
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:14,681
Xiaoyao.

50
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:15,882
Six years.

51
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:18,041
I've taken you in for six years.

52
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:20,882
You exempt me from six years of rent.

53
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:22,442
From now on,

54
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:24,082
we owe each other nothing.

55
00:03:24,802 --> 00:03:25,882
Even the rarest scenery would

56
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:27,041
be dull if it was seen too often.

57
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:28,681
It will only be meaningful

58
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:29,802
if someone is with me.

59
00:03:30,882 --> 00:03:33,002
Life is precious as long as we can

60
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:35,242
enjoy such views.

61
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,922
The love poisonous bug

62
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:39,642
not only wants your life

63
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:41,401
but also your heart.

64
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:43,442
You may have nine lives,

65
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:44,561
but you only

66
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:46,442
have one heart.

67
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:48,681
Once you give your heart,

68
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,961
you can never take it back.

69
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:53,201
Cang Xuan.

70
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:54,802
Now that you're back,

71
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:57,041
I'm not alone anymore.

72
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:58,922
I decided to be the Princess of Haoling.

73
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:01,282
Since you chose

74
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,681
to return to Xiyan Mountain,

75
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:04,761
despite

76
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:06,642
the trials and tribulations ahead,

77
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:09,321
I'll help you fulfill your dreams

78
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:11,802
by your side.

79
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:13,002
Cang Xuan.

80
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:15,201
Let's

81
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:17,281
go home together.

82
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:22,601
What if I fall in love with you

83
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:24,881
at first sight?

84
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:28,082
I want you to remember me.

85
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:29,562
Fang

86
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:31,082
Feng

87
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:33,362
Bei.

88
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:34,601
Remember.

89
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,362
Don't move!

90
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,962
Xiaoyao, move away!

91
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,201
Don't move!

92
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,601
You cannot die.

93
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:45,441
We're still alive.

94
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:48,402
Why not quit being a princess

95
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:50,642
and wander around with me?

96
00:04:51,642 --> 00:04:52,208
Alright.

97
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:54,281
If you give up everything,

98
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:55,842
I'll go with you.

99
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:57,881
I'm afraid of men

100
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,962
like you and my father.

101
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,362
Because in your hearts,

102
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:02,522
there is always

103
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:04,041
something more important
than your women.

104
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:06,802
We are not suitable to be husbands.

105
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:08,362
In my lifetime,

106
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:10,001
I hope to see

107
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,082
a real prosperous empire

108
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:12,601
that leaves a grand legacy

109
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:14,122
throughout history.

110
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:17,962
In 15 years,

111
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:21,321
don't open up your heart to another man.

112
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,082
Even if I'm not Tushan Jing,

113
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,481
I can still be Ye Shiqi.

114
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,802
The one with nothing?

115
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:29,281
Yes.

116
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:31,522
When I saved him,

117
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:33,001
he had nothing.

118
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:35,242
So I don't mind

119
00:05:36,682 --> 00:05:38,001
if he becomes nothing again.

120
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:41,642
Don't break her heart.

121
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,362
If that day really comes,

122
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:44,842
kill me.

123
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:47,281
Miss Fangfeng.

124
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,082
You're pregnant.

125
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,281
I don't hate you.

126
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,362
But between you and me,

127
00:05:58,481 --> 00:05:59,481
the relationship ends here.

128
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:02,201
We are strangers now.

129
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,041
Xiaoyao.

130
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:06,281
Xiaoyao.

131
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:09,362
No matter what the future holds,

132
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:13,402
I will always stay by your side.

133
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,362
When you escaped from the death arena,

134
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:18,881
if it'd been me who saved you,

135
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:21,321
how great that would be.

136
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,481
Xiaoyao.

137
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:24,881
Let's get married.

138
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:27,802
Do you want to marry him?

139
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:29,001
He

140
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,642
swore that he would be good to me

141
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:31,962
and only have one wife

142
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:33,522
for his entire life.

143
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:36,481
Actually, that's all

144
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:38,402
a woman wants.

145
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:50,352
(Previously)

146
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,592
(Daming Hall, Zijin Palace)

147
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:06,562
After all these years,

148
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:08,481
we finally

149
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:10,082
get to drink so carefree.

150
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:18,201
Taking over by force
was an obvious shortcut.

151
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:20,281
Yet you choose not to make a move.

152
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:22,682
Were you certain that Grandfather

153
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,082
would choose you?

154
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:25,201
Of course not.

155
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,441
I knew

156
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:27,682
(Xiyan Cang Xuan)
if Grandfather

157
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:29,402
made Deyan the Crown Prince,

158
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:31,441
I would face

159
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:34,201
worse consequences
if I made a move then.

160
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:35,321
But I took a bet.

161
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,562
(Haoling Jiuyao)

162
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:37,802
I bet that Grandfather knew

163
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,082
what I wanted Xiyan to be like.

164
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,242
But what if he didn't?

165
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:43,682
There are many paths.

166
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:45,441
But there's only one throne.

167
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:47,242
Even if I'm bathed in blood

168
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:48,402
with my life at risk,

169
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,601
I have to go for it.

170
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,161
You and Grandfather

171
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:57,761
really know each other.

172
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:00,881
He bet you wouldn't stage a coup.

173
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:03,721
You bet he would pass the throne to you.

174
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:05,922
This time,

175
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,601
both of you won.

176
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,281
I am very grateful

177
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:13,601
not just because he gave me the throne.

178
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,962
I'm grateful because

179
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:18,962
he knows what kind of king I want to be.

180
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:43,002
Take it back.

181
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:51,202
I was moved by what you told me

182
00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:52,161
last night.

183
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,122
But this Ruomu flower

184
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:55,202
was given to you

185
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,721
by Fourth Aunt before she passed away.

186
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:57,961
She wanted you

187
00:08:57,961 --> 00:08:59,442
to give it to the girl you love.

188
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:00,721
I dare not accept it.

189
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,122
You'd better keep it.

190
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:21,202
Xiaoyao, I...

191
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:24,144
I...

192
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:27,922
What?

193
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:30,202
Since when do we keep secrets?

194
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:31,568
I...

195
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:42,322
I am very...

196
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:47,922
Grateful to you.

197
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,521
We are in it together.

198
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:55,122
You're grateful?

199
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:56,362
Do you want a beating?

200
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:13,122
Your wish has finally been fulfilled.

201
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:15,802
Why do I feel that

202
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:17,481
you're not so happy?

203
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:19,481
Yeah.

204
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,362
I find it strange too.

205
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:26,281
We have obviously

206
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:27,442
reached the top.

207
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:31,762
Yet I don't feel so happy.

208
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,521
It feels like there's a long way to go.

209
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,762
The burden we shoulder
hasn't been removed.

210
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:42,002
It has grown even heavier.

211
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:45,161
Yeah.

212
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:49,562
You are the King of Xiyan now,

213
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:51,002
the ruler of a nation.

214
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:53,481
You are not just Cang Xuan anymore.

215
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:55,401
The burden you carry

216
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:56,802
is surely heavier now.

217
00:10:58,362 --> 00:10:59,802
I only want to protect my family

218
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,481
and not be powerless when faced with

219
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:03,641
life and death.

220
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:06,802
That's why I wanted
to be the King of Xiyan.

221
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,378
♪All is bleak without you♪

222
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:17,834
♪It began like a tornado♪

223
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:19,122
I know.

224
00:11:19,122 --> 00:11:23,274
♪And went away leaving only dust♪

225
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,090

♪Is a mess♪

(Chenrong Mansion, Zhiyi City)

229
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:45,721
Miss.

230
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,041
Check and see if

231
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,041
you like these fabrics.

232
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:55,682
His Majesty has been enthroned.

233
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:57,281
(Chenrong Xinyue)
You will soon become

234
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,281
the Queen of Xiyan.

235
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:00,081
So I'm thinking,

236
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:02,002
we should have the weavers

237
00:12:02,002 --> 00:12:03,882
make some new clothes
that fit your status

238
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:04,841
to not be

239
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,362
in a rush when the time comes.

240
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:09,481
You are very thoughtful.

241
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,322
It's my job to be considerate

242
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:12,401
to you, Miss.

243
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,041
Have you sent the gifts

244
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,041
to Chenrong Mountain as I told you to?

245
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:18,562
Did His Majesty reply?

246
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:21,041
The gifts have arrived.

247
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:23,562
But His Majesty hasn't replied.

248
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:30,242
His Majesty must be occupied

249
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:31,682
by the state affairs.

250
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:33,762
He will want to see me

251
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:34,802
once he's done.

252
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:35,922
You're right, Miss.

253
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:36,841
It must be so.

254
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:38,682
Let me write him another letter.

255
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,202
I'm worried that he will be

256
00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:41,362
neglecting his health.

257
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:09,081
Haitang.

258
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:10,481
Pack all those

259
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:11,601
spiritual medicines here.

260
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,641
I'll take them

261
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:13,562
as gifts to Xuan.

262
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:14,641
Understood.

263
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:24,144
Nian.

264
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:25,584
Father.

265
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:29,961
Are you going to

266
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:31,362
empty my storeroom?

267
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:32,562
(Haoling Yi)

268
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,721
How can I empty the storeroom

269
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:35,002
of the wealthiest man in the world?

270
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:35,802
I even think

271
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,202
(King of Haoling, Ru Shou)
it's not enough.

272
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:38,401
Why don't you

273
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:39,882
add a few more things

274
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,002
as my gifts to Xuan

275
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:41,882
to congratulate him?

276
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:43,322
Alright.

277
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:44,496
Alright.

278
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:45,442
I'll hand-pick them.

279
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:47,216
Step aside.

280
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:55,762
She's even packing nuts for him.

281
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,362
A grown girl is bound to leave home.

282
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:00,521
I mean,

283
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:02,161
time has changed.

284
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:04,442
Cang Xuan is now the King of Xiyan.

285
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:05,601
If the Second Princess

286
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:06,481
runs off there,

287
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:08,161
people may have opinions.

288
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:09,882
Let her be.

289
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:11,041
With Xiaoyao there,

290
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:12,521
nothing can go wrong.

291
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:15,762
That's right, Your Majesty.

292
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,762
It's not your problem if the princess

293
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:19,882
goes to Chenrong Mountain.

294
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:21,521
It's someone else's problem.

295
00:14:27,362 --> 00:14:29,721
How many days has it been
since we sent the letter?

296
00:14:31,242 --> 00:14:32,041
It's been

297
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:33,442
seven days.

298
00:14:35,122 --> 00:14:37,202
And His Majesty hasn't replied?

299
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:38,401
No.

300
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:41,202
Miss Shen

301
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:42,641
is truly blessed.

302
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,922
Everyone thought that
her marriage to His Majesty

303
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:45,721
was a mistake.

304
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:47,601
But His Majesty ascended the throne

305
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:48,721
and became the King of Xiyan.

306
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:50,202
Just for the sake of

307
00:14:50,202 --> 00:14:51,922
all the hardships they've been through,

308
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:52,961
Miss Shen could

309
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:54,242
become the Queen of Xiyan.

310
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,481
Stop calling her "Miss Shen".

311
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,442
Now,

312
00:14:57,442 --> 00:14:58,841
she is the consort of the King.

313
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:00,601
Even Miss Xinyue has to pay respects

314
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:01,882
and greet her accordingly.

315
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:05,721
Who allowed you to gossip here?

316
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:07,641
Miss.

317
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:09,281
Go away.

318
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:10,562
- Yes.
- Yes.

319
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:16,721
Miss.

320
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:18,161
His Majesty needs

321
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:19,202
a queen by his side.

322
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:20,562
All the major clans of Xiyan,

323
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,762
let alone the ones
in the Central Plains,

324
00:15:22,762 --> 00:15:24,122
intend to send someone to His Majesty.

325
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:26,442
You should make plans early.

326
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:27,802
Which lady from any major clan

327
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:29,562
can be more distinguished

328
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:30,521
than me?

329
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,762
Those women are not worth concern.

330
00:15:33,362 --> 00:15:34,682
But what about the Princess

331
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,961
from Wushen Mountain
who clings to His Majesty?

332
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:43,122
Haoling Yi.

333
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:48,521
(Following His Majesty's sacred decree,)

334
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:50,242
(the populations and land ownership)

335
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:51,721
(throughout the Central Plains)

336
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:52,961
have been fully tallied

337
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,202
and documented.

338
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,762
Please take a look.

339
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:10,064
(Xiyan Deyan, Xiyan Yuyang)

340
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:12,802
Your Majesty,

341
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:14,721
(Chief of Huhe)
I have something to report.

342
00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:15,600
Speak.

343
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:17,762
You've stayed in the Central Plains

344
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:18,882
since your ascension.

345
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:20,281
(Chishui Fenglong, Chenrong Yi)
This place may be prosperous,

346
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:21,841
but Xiyan Town is the capital.

347
00:16:22,002 --> 00:16:23,481
Your Majesty,

348
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:25,281
please return to Xiyan Town.

349
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:26,762
Seconded.

350
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:28,322
Seconded.

351
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:31,362
- Please return to Xiyan Town.
- Please return to Xiyan Town.

352
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,202
(Chief of Shangyang)

353
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:34,762
Your Majesty,

354
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,961
Xiyan Town is the capital of Xiyan.

355
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:38,562
But your decrees are sent

356
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,682
from Chenrong Mountain
after your enthronement.

357
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:42,882
It's inappropriate to go on like this.

358
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,442
Your Majesty,
please relocate the capital to Zhiyi.

359
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:50,122
Your Majesty.

360
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,122
Please don't.

361
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:52,562
Xiyan Town has been the capital

362
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,081
since the founding of Xiyan.

363
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:55,682
How can we just move the capital?

364
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:56,882
Xiyan boasts

365
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:58,641
a vast territory,

366
00:16:58,682 --> 00:16:59,721
abundant supplies,

367
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:00,961
and countless talents.

368
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:02,362
Yet Xiyan Town

369
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,601
is located in the northwest,

370
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:05,041
surrounded by mountains.

371
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:06,442
With poor transportation

372
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:08,041
of supplies and talent,

373
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:09,121
it can't function

374
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,202
as the capital city.

375
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:11,722
Xiyan Town is the foundation

376
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:12,641
of our entire nation.

377
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:13,922
Moving to Zhiyi

378
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:15,842
is disrespectful to our ancestors.

379
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:16,881
Zhiyi is situated

380
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:18,562
in the heartland of Dahuang

381
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:19,722
with access to all directions.

382
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,641
Relocating the capital to Zhiyi

383
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:24,161
will give us access
to supplies and talents.

384
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,442
It will be a policy
that boosts prosperity

385
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:28,682
and ensures long-term governance.

386
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:31,041
The Central Plains
are not our native land, after all.

387
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:33,361
The Central Plains
are within our territory.

388
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:36,322
How can you say
they are not our native land?

389
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:37,922
Say no more.

390
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:39,962
Relocating the capital

391
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:41,682
is of great importance

392
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:44,322
and requires proper discussion.

393
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:53,136
Your Majesty.

394
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:57,041
Lady Shen invites you over

395
00:17:57,322 --> 00:17:59,202
to have lunch with her.

396
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,041
Miss Chenrong is here,

397
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:02,722
visiting Lady Shen.

398
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:06,482
I have some court affairs

399
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:07,442
to discuss with Grandfather.

400
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,361
I won't go to Lady Shen today.

401
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:23,856
(Shen Shuhui)

402
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:51,361
Nice tea.

403
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:54,082
It's a tribute

404
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:55,682
from the Beijiang Clan,

405
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:58,761
allegedly exclusive
to the Xiyan royal family.

406
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:00,482
It's my first time having it.

407
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:02,361
If you like it,

408
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:04,442
I will have the maid pack some

409
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:05,521
for you to take home.

410
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:06,241
No need.

411
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:08,322
I was just indulging in something new.

412
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:10,482
I might forget it if I take it home.

413
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:12,202
Naughty girl.

414
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:16,881
Has His Majesty arrived?

415
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:19,761
His Majesty went to the Great Emperor.

416
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:21,121
He won't come over today.

417
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:29,322
Have some tea.

418
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:51,401
Grandpa.

419
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:52,761
Give me one more chance.

420
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:55,842
No, no.

421
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:58,442
I've given you three chances.

422
00:19:58,881 --> 00:19:59,641
One last time.

423
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:01,041
I promise it's the last time.

424
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:03,041
Deal.

425
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:06,739
(Great Emperor of Xiyan)

426
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:10,241
No regrets once you've made a move.

427
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:11,922
No, no, I haven't moved.

428
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:16,521
Have you decided?

429
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:21,802
Why don't you enter, Your Majesty?

430
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:26,842
This is why I'm guarding the world.

431
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,722
Only by seeing that

432
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,842
can I continue forward with conviction.

433
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:37,121
Why don't you just walk in?

434
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:39,962
You sound like
you're jumping into a pit of fire.

435
00:20:47,962 --> 00:20:48,562
Xuan.

436
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:49,922
Good to see you, Nian.

437
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:54,722
I haven't settled scores with you.

438
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:55,922
Both you and her

439
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:58,041
underestimated me

440
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:58,842
and drove me away.

441
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:00,202
Am I that unreliable?

442
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:01,121
Of course not.

443
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:03,001
You're the most reliable.

444
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:05,161
Except when you cheat.

445
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:07,761
Grandpa.

446
00:21:07,881 --> 00:21:09,241
Xuan is bullying me.

447
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:12,682
Will you help me or him?

448
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:14,962
I'll help whoever calls me sister.

449
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:16,521
Sister.

450
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:18,521
Sister.

451
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:20,442
Sister...

452
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:21,761
Alright.

453
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:23,281
I'll help you, alright?

454
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:25,641
Why did you come at this hour?

455
00:21:26,322 --> 00:21:27,322
Did something come up?

456
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:31,024
Yes.

457
00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:32,208
Grandfather.

458
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:42,922
I am planning

459
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,322
to take someone from
the Shangyang Clan as my consort.

460
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:06,224
Xiaoyao.

461
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:07,824
I...

462
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:13,641
I don't mean to take a consort.

463
00:22:14,562 --> 00:22:15,962
I want to avoid warfare.

464
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:17,802
Of course, I know.

465
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:20,281
Grandfather passed the throne to you.

466
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:22,281
Naturally, you can't let him down.

467
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:24,562
To convince the old clans of Xiyan

468
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:25,602
to relocate the capital

469
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:27,041
and give up on the Fifth King,

470
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:29,802
bonding and reasoning
with them is not enough.

471
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:32,361
You have to benefit them.

472
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:39,922
Don't congratulate me.

473
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:42,161
Understand?

474
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:45,722
I know.

475
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:49,401
Go back.

476
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:53,521
Xuan.

477
00:22:56,202 --> 00:22:56,962
I feel that

478
00:22:56,962 --> 00:22:58,082
you're a bit upset.

479
00:22:58,722 --> 00:23:00,761
Should I accompany you for a walk?

480
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:04,082
I have a pile of work to do.

481
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:06,482
How can I afford to be upset?

482
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:08,682
Be at ease and go back.

483
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:11,568
Okay.

484
00:23:12,962 --> 00:23:13,761
Then I'll go back.

485
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:14,842
Okay.

486
00:23:14,842 --> 00:23:18,928
♪You appear at the end of the river♪

487
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:23,018
♪But disappear as clouds rise♪

488
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:27,594
♪You appear when I look up♪

489
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:31,722
♪But disappear as I lower my head♪

490
00:23:32,336 --> 00:23:36,298
♪You appear in the snow♪

491
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:40,629
♪But disappear as flowers bloom♪

492
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:43,178
♪You appear as the smoke rises♪

493
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:48,752
♪You disappear in the light♪

494
00:23:49,584 --> 00:23:52,464
♪You disappear♪

495
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:57,258
♪In the light♪

496
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:06,241
What are you doing?

497
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:09,041
I'm going to find Cang Xuan.

498
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:10,521
Nian.

499
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:15,322
Why do you want to find him?

500
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:19,682
Grandpa.

501
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:23,361
I like Xuan.

502
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:24,922
I want to marry him.

503
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:26,442
Grandpa.

504
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:28,682
Will you make him marry me, please?

505
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:29,322
Nian.

506
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:30,602
You're free to drink.

507
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,881
But don't act crazy.

508
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:33,001
Nian.

509
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:35,922
I really like him.

510
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:37,121
Grandpa.

511
00:24:37,682 --> 00:24:39,322
Grandpa, can you help me, please?

512
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:41,072
Fine.

513
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,761
I will help you.

514
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:47,281
Really?

515
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:49,482
Grandpa, you've agreed?

516
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:52,482
I never go back on my word.

517
00:24:54,602 --> 00:24:55,722
Would you stop it?

518
00:24:57,202 --> 00:24:58,281
That's enough.

519
00:25:00,722 --> 00:25:01,241
Nian.

520
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:04,922
That's great.

521
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:09,361
Grandpa finally said yes.

522
00:25:10,202 --> 00:25:11,001
Finally...

523
00:25:15,322 --> 00:25:17,082
I can marry Cang Xuan.

524
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:23,922
Grandfather.

525
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:25,722
How can you lie to her?

526
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:26,922
She will believe it.

527
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:30,442
Nian is a sweet little girl,

528
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:33,082
innocent, unruly, pure, and clever.

529
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:34,842
She doesn't have

530
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:36,802
those complicated schemes.

531
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:38,128
You should

532
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:39,442
really learn from her.

533
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:41,082
Be more willful

534
00:25:41,482 --> 00:25:42,401
and more unrestrained.

535
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:45,722
I can't be willful or unrestrained

536
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:47,281
because of you and Cang Xuan.

537
00:25:50,442 --> 00:25:52,881
What do you mean by that?

538
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:54,241
If I say I want to

539
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,241
hang out with Xiang Liu,

540
00:25:56,562 --> 00:25:57,401
would you agree?

541
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:03,202
No.

542
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:07,562
Cang Xuan is bound to have
a decisive battle with him.

543
00:26:07,962 --> 00:26:09,442
You hold different stances.

544
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:10,640
You see,

545
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:12,521
my bloodline makes it impossible

546
00:26:12,682 --> 00:26:13,881
for me to do as I please.

547
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:14,960
So,

548
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:16,761
why should I lie to myself?

549
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:20,784
Nian.

550
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,602
Why is Your Majesty in a bad mood?

551
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:39,161
I once thought

552
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:41,202
the moment I turned Zijin Peak

553
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:42,641
into Zhaoyun Peak,

554
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:44,641
I could return to the past.

555
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:48,722
But even if I plant phoenix trees

556
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:50,001
all over Chenrong Mountain,

557
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:51,082
what then?

558
00:26:53,482 --> 00:26:54,322
One wrong step

559
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:55,842
leads to a wrong path.

560
00:26:57,562 --> 00:26:59,401
I don't think I have any chances now.

561
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:02,121
Which step was wrong?

562
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:04,922
I have no idea, either.

563
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:08,962
All along the way,

564
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:11,361
it seemed like every step

565
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:12,241
was the only choice.

566
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:14,962
But it just turned out

567
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:19,881
to be wrong.

568
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:25,281
Even if there are mistakes,

569
00:27:25,802 --> 00:27:26,641
it doesn't matter.

570
00:27:27,401 --> 00:27:28,881
Withered trees can thrive again.

571
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:29,881
Let alone people.

572
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:31,041
Where there's a will,

573
00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:32,241
there's a way, for sure.

574
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,161
Is there really a way?

575
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:37,401
Of course.

576
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:38,881
There is nothing you can't do,

577
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:39,842
Your Majesty.

578
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:46,281
Let's hope you're right.

579
00:27:48,482 --> 00:27:49,521
Relocating the capital

580
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:51,881
will surely
shake the foundation of Xiyan.

581
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:53,562
It absolutely can't be done.

582
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,641
His Majesty hasn't expressed an opinion,

583
00:27:56,082 --> 00:27:57,322
but he seems attempted.

584
00:27:57,482 --> 00:27:59,241
Please come forward to stop him.

585
00:28:00,802 --> 00:28:01,842
I'm afraid His Majesty

586
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:03,442
won't listen to me.

587
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:05,802
Only you can persuade him.

588
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:18,962
Father.

589
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:21,488
Father.

590
00:28:31,602 --> 00:28:33,041
I don't have the power

591
00:28:33,802 --> 00:28:36,401
to rule the court anymore.

592
00:28:37,322 --> 00:28:37,968
Great Emperor.

593
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:39,281
It's time for medicine.

594
00:28:54,722 --> 00:28:56,281
You two may leave.

595
00:29:04,682 --> 00:29:06,001
Please take care of yourself.

596
00:29:07,682 --> 00:29:08,442
I take my leave.

597
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:09,641
I take my leave.

598
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:25,322
Why did you stop me just now?

599
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:27,442
Cang Xuan has been

600
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:28,962
establishing his power in court.

601
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:30,802
If Father doesn't stop him,

602
00:29:31,281 --> 00:29:32,016
then he will

603
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:33,161
surely relocate the capital

604
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:34,082
despite our opposition.

605
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:45,082
Father no longer has the power.

606
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:48,641
We are unable to stop Cang Xuan now.

607
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:51,322
However,

608
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:54,241
it may not be bad

609
00:29:54,722 --> 00:29:56,761
if he insists on relocating the capital.

610
00:29:57,602 --> 00:29:58,521
Why is that?

611
00:30:02,922 --> 00:30:04,442
Such an act

612
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,202
will surely offend the majority

613
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:08,401
of the old clans who are against it.

614
00:30:09,802 --> 00:30:11,361
The more opposition he gets,

615
00:30:14,322 --> 00:30:15,521
the better for us.

616
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:17,962
That's right.

617
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:21,641
They won't change the capital city.

618
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:22,482
Then,

619
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:24,602
it's time to change the king.

620
00:30:43,322 --> 00:30:43,842
Grandfather,

621
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:46,521
what do you think
about relocating the capital?

622
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:56,482
What I think doesn't matter.

623
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:59,641
What matters is what Cang Xuan will do.

624
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:01,922
Relocating capital has always met with

625
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:03,562
great resistance in history.

626
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:05,281
If not handled carefully,

627
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,322
the ministers may turn against the king

628
00:31:08,322 --> 00:31:09,641
and stir up trouble.

629
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:11,361
It may even lead to

630
00:31:11,761 --> 00:31:13,722
something like
the Five Princes Rebellion

631
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:16,361
back in Haoling.

632
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:23,761
(The Shangyang lady
has recorded merits.)

633
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,442
(Attired in fine garments,)

634
00:31:25,562 --> 00:31:26,761
(she is gentle and compliant,)

635
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:28,281
(wise and intelligent.)

636
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:30,001
(Possessing a graceful presence,)

637
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:31,562
(she is known for her kind nature.)

638
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:33,602
(She is hereby titled a consort.)

639
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,322
(I hope she remains
sincere, filial, humble,)

640
00:31:36,442 --> 00:31:37,962
(respectful and frugal.)

641
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,922
(The head of the Shangyang Clan
has been loyal and upright.)

642
00:31:41,202 --> 00:31:42,442
(He has been grateful,)

643
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:44,161
(dignified, and righteous)

644
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,482
(while safeguarding the nation.)

645
00:31:45,842 --> 00:31:47,241
(Such a man deserves appreciation.)

646
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:49,001
(I hereby bestow him with)

647
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:51,161
(the Qingyao Mountain as a reward.)

648
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,641
"Possessing a graceful presence,

649
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,401
she is known for her kind nature."

650
00:32:05,442 --> 00:32:06,281
Miss.

651
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:07,802
The phrases in the decree

652
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:09,562
are always exaggerated and polished.

653
00:32:09,722 --> 00:32:11,361
Please don't take it too seriously.

654
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:18,521
Miss.

655
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:20,682
Why don't you play the zither?

656
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:24,602
No one is here to listen to it.

657
00:32:25,202 --> 00:32:26,521
What's the point of playing it?

658
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:30,281
Back then, we played
the zither and flute together

659
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:31,962
throughout the night.

660
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:33,802
But now,

661
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:35,962
it's hard to just meet each other.

662
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:37,322
Maybe

663
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,722
we can ask the young master to help.

664
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:40,121
Times have changed.

665
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,881
My brother can advise on state matters,

666
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:45,121
but not on His Majesty's
personal affairs.

667
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:46,802
Then,

668
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,082
let's get Madam here.

669
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:56,041
My mother may be Madam Chenrong.

670
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:58,121
But she resides in Chishui

671
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:00,562
and has no idea what's happening here.

672
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:02,482
She can't be of much help.

673
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,082
So what can we do?

674
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:12,161
My brother and my mother can't help.

675
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:14,001
But I have

676
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,602
a sister-in-law on Chenrong Mountain.

677
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,626
(Chenrong Mansion)

678
00:33:21,761 --> 00:33:23,001
This house of yours

679
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,082
has been repaired just fine.

680
00:33:26,442 --> 00:33:28,041
Your Highness, if you like it,

681
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:29,161
stay here with Xiaoyao

682
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:30,082
for some days.

683
00:33:30,482 --> 00:33:31,922
I have no sisters.

684
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,281
I'm so lonely here.

685
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:35,082
Indeed.

686
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:37,641
We're not like those men

687
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,001
who at least have jobs to do.

688
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:40,722
We have too much free time.

689
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:42,602
It really is boring without company.

690
00:33:47,082 --> 00:33:47,602
Xiaoyao.

691
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:48,881
I heard from my brother

692
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:50,881
that His Majesty has been distressed

693
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:52,602
because of the capital relocation.

694
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:55,121
It's a pity that I can't help at all.

695
00:33:55,442 --> 00:33:56,121
It's okay.

696
00:33:56,562 --> 00:33:57,922
It's the thought that counts.

697
00:33:58,361 --> 00:33:59,442
Cang Xuan will understand.

698
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:02,082
What's the point of that?

699
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:03,722
He keeps everything to himself.

700
00:34:04,082 --> 00:34:05,482
He never appreciates it

701
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:06,641
even if we want to help.

702
00:34:15,202 --> 00:34:16,401
That's right.

703
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:17,561
It's all his fault.

704
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:18,962
I'll give him a scolding.

705
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:20,816
- It's not his fault!
- It's not his fault!

706
00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:27,641
Forget it.

707
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:28,482
Let's not talk about it.

708
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:30,121
The weather is so nice.

709
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:31,601
Let's go out for a stroll.

710
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:32,240
Good idea.

711
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:33,601
I haven't been out

712
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:34,282
for a long while.

713
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:39,696
Okay.

714
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:49,042
Let's check out the fabrics.

715
00:34:49,202 --> 00:34:49,840
Okay.

716
00:35:06,922 --> 00:35:07,482
Thank you.

717
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:11,105
(Tushan Jing)

718
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:14,561
The nard is spilled. Let it be.

719
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:17,081
I'll have them repack some for you.

720
00:35:18,922 --> 00:35:19,561
No need.

721
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:21,482
Thank you, Chief Tushan.

722
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,321
Come take a look.

723
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:41,161
Fresh out of the pot.
Braised chicken feet.

724
00:35:41,202 --> 00:35:42,042
Braised duck necks.

725
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:43,121
Braised duck feet.

726
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:44,601
Come have a look.

727
00:35:44,962 --> 00:35:46,762
Fresh out of the pot.
Braised chicken feet.

728
00:35:46,762 --> 00:35:48,042
Braised duck necks.

729
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:48,841
Braised duck feet.

730
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:51,282
Don't miss out as you pass by!

731
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:52,922
Come take a look!

732
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:54,442
Please take a look.

733
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:57,161
Would you like some
to go with your drink?

734
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:01,616
Miss.

735
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:04,202
Miss.

736
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:07,561
No need.

737
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:17,522
Miss.

738
00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:18,482
What will you bet on?

739
00:36:18,482 --> 00:36:19,561
What will you bet on?

740
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:20,841
I don't believe it. I'll bet on...

741
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:22,000
Big.

742
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:23,442
I follow your bet.

743
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,161
Small.

744
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:26,722
- Small.
- Small.

745
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,336
(Lirong Chang)

746
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:36,121
This lady bets quite boldly.

747
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:39,881
I run a small business.

748
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:41,161
You must compensate me.

749
00:36:45,522 --> 00:36:46,522
Alright.

750
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:47,762
Impressive!

751
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,601
You are truly marvelous.

752
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:52,601
Don't tell me

753
00:36:53,282 --> 00:36:55,722
she's the girl you like.

754
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:02,522
I must take a closer look.

755
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:04,482
The woman who can enthrall my buddy

756
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:06,042
must be extraordinary.

757
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:11,401
You are truly marvelous.

758
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:12,722
What's the point of these trifles?

759
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:13,841
If we play,

760
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:15,442
let's play big.

761
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:19,601
Who dares to play with me?

762
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:23,962
Why don't you

763
00:37:24,401 --> 00:37:25,522
have a round with her?

764
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:27,482
Carry her home if you win the bet.

765
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:34,922
Buddy,

766
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:36,361
if you don't go out now,

767
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:37,922
you may lose your love to someone else.

768
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:47,482
Let's bet on

769
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:49,361
something new.

770
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:50,522
(Fangfeng Bei)
I dare you.

771
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:53,121
- Bet with him!
- Bet with him!

772
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:55,841
- Bet with him!
- Bet with him!

773
00:37:57,682 --> 00:37:58,361
Why not?

774
00:37:58,801 --> 00:37:59,361
Big or small.

775
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:01,081
The loser

776
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:02,242
must answer a question

777
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:03,841
without lying.

778
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:06,482
That's new.

779
00:38:06,522 --> 00:38:07,042
Okay.

780
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:08,121
Let's bet.

781
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:40,042
Sorry.

782
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:40,962
I'm really sorry.

783
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:42,242
Who

784
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,161
do you like?

785
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:49,202
What kind of question is that?

786
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:54,002
What a lousy question.

787
00:38:54,242 --> 00:38:54,841
Next one.

788
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:56,202
I'll ask whatever I want.

789
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:58,002
Just answer truthfully.

790
00:38:58,561 --> 00:38:59,641
You lose if you don't answer.

791
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:02,401
Fine, then.

792
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:04,561
The person I like...

793
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:11,401
Is the one I want to spend my life with.

794
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:18,361
Who do you want to spend your life with?

795
00:39:18,801 --> 00:39:19,682
That's another question.

796
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:21,922
Let's talk if you win.

797
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,002
She won.

798
00:39:40,442 --> 00:39:41,321
It's my turn.

799
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:43,601
If you were given another chance,

800
00:39:44,242 --> 00:39:45,801
would you still choose this path?

801
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:54,672
Yes.

802
00:39:55,922 --> 00:39:56,641
Why?

803
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:02,561
Because I met someone

804
00:40:05,722 --> 00:40:07,121
very important along the way.

805
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:11,242
If I had chosen a different path,

806
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:14,881
I might not have met that person.

807
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:23,801
You are quite loyal
to your foster father.

808
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:30,881
This is not fun.

809
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:32,161
I'm done.

810
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:33,601
Don't go.

811
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:35,361
Your money?

812
00:40:35,361 --> 00:40:36,601
Who says she doesn't want the money?

813
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:40,762
Put all her money into my account.

814
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:42,242
On what ground?

815
00:40:50,002 --> 00:40:51,561
You're wearing the wrong color

816
00:40:51,561 --> 00:40:52,881
today.

817
00:40:55,682 --> 00:40:56,682
It's not a good omen.

818
00:41:04,482 --> 00:41:05,202
Why were you

819
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:06,442
gambling alone?

820
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:08,962
Where is your future husband,
the pride of the day?

821
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:16,561
You know I'm engaged?

822
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:20,442
Chief Chishui is engaged
to the Princess of Haoling.

823
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:22,881
It's hard not to know.

824
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:26,442
I forgot to congratulate you.

825
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:27,522
Congratulations.

826
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:34,442
Don't you have

827
00:41:36,282 --> 00:41:37,081
anything else

828
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:37,962
to say to me?

829
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:46,881
What should I say?

830
00:41:58,522 --> 00:41:59,042
Nothing.

831
00:42:00,242 --> 00:42:01,202
There are two things

832
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:02,321
I'd like to discuss with you.

833
00:42:04,002 --> 00:42:04,528
Go ahead.

834
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:05,881
The first thing.

835
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:08,321
I can still make pills

836
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:10,081
for you right now.

837
00:42:11,242 --> 00:42:12,561
But after I get married,

838
00:42:14,002 --> 00:42:15,522
I won't be able to anymore.

839
00:42:21,002 --> 00:42:21,881
And the second thing?

840
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:24,561
I want to remove the poisonous bug.

841
00:42:27,682 --> 00:42:29,202
It keeps causing you trouble.

842
00:42:29,762 --> 00:42:30,442
Last time,

843
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:31,762
you were tired of it.

844
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:33,922
When you have time,

845
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:36,482
we'll go to Baili

846
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:38,841
to remove the poisonous bug.

847
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:47,482
Rest assured.

848
00:42:48,282 --> 00:42:49,282
After that,

849
00:42:50,202 --> 00:42:51,401
I will still keep my promise

850
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:52,161
to you.

851
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:58,042
Alright.

852
00:42:58,601 --> 00:42:59,401
When I have time.

853
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:07,321
I'll deliver the pills to you

854
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,042
every three months.

855
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:09,881
I have to go.
