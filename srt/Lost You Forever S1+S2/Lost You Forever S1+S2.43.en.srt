=Lost You Forever S2=

00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:32,624
=Episode 4=

3
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,568
You haven't practiced archery for ages.

4
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:32,666
How come you are here?

5
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:35,266
I came for the pills.

6
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:40,386
I haven't been
in the mood for making pills.

7
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,266
Can you give me a few more days?

8
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:43,427
What happened?

9
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:48,947
And you dare to make me wait?

10
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:53,987
Nothing. I'm just in a bad mood.

11
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:56,186
Your Lordship, aren't you busy?

12
00:02:58,987 --> 00:02:59,947
I'm just passing by

13
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:01,347
to collect a debt.

14
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:03,347
You made me come in vain.

15
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:05,867
You've grown bolder.

16
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,466
Your Lordship,

17
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:08,987
please spare me this time.

18
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:10,507
Next time,

19
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:11,386
I will surely

20
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:12,626
treat your matters

21
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:14,186
with top priority

22
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:15,867
and never delay again.

23
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,746
Stop it if you can't play.

24
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:27,906
Do you play better than me?

25
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:52,432
♪Oh, yeah♪

26
00:03:54,672 --> 00:04:01,866
♪Please gouge out my eyes♪

00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:08,074
♪When my blood splatters

♪Let my blood flood the wilderness♪

♪Think about me♪

36
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,786
What a bloody song.

37
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,346
It's Chi Chen's song.

38
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:15,027
A bloody person sings a bloody song.

39
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,307
King of Haoling is kind to you.

40
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,506
Of course.

41
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,386
He is the best father

42
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:29,467
in the whole world.

43
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:33,867
I don't think

44
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:34,987
you've finished the song.

45
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:36,066
What comes after?

46
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:39,666
I forgot.

47
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,826
With nine heads,
you still forget things?

48
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:53,147
Knock me out

49
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:55,027
and see who's going to
make pills for you.

50
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:18,786
Your Majesty.

51
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:21,386
Her Majesty's maid came to inquire

52
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:22,666
about your whereabouts again.

53
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:23,987
But no one dares

54
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,027
to snitch after you

55
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:26,587
handled those maids last time.

56
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:30,666
You can handle this
and don't have to tell me.

57
00:06:30,864 --> 00:06:31,504
Yes.

58
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:40,346
Your Majesty.

59
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,826
Has Xiaoyao sent a message?

60
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:43,506
No.

61
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:49,840
(Letter to Xiaoyao)

62
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:10,987
Send it to Wushen Mountain.

63
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,336
(Thirteen)
Yes.

64
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,346
What does the number

65
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:19,546
written on the letter mean,

66
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:20,707
Your Majesty?

67
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,266
This is to remind Xiaoyao

68
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:25,627
to come home as promised.

69
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:34,224
♪All things are dim♪

70
00:07:34,224 --> 00:07:37,584
♪While only your eyes shine bright♪

♪Everything seems sad♪

♪You came with wind and rain♪

Miao Pu.

78
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:02,826
Put this letter away.

79
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:07,306
♪All is bleak without you♪

♪And went away leaving only dust♪

82
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:19,747
His Majesty sends a letter every day,

83
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:21,346
urging you to return
to Chenrong Mountain.

84
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:22,826
Won't you reply even once?

85
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:24,106
I don't want to go back.

86
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:25,587
I'd rather not reply.

87
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:28,587
But what if His Majesty gets angry?

88
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:30,066
Let him be.

89
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:31,946
After all, I'm far away.

90
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:33,427
He can't reach me.

91
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,346
Wait over there for a check-up.

92
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:51,152
I'll be right there.

93
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:10,827
Let me see.

94
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:11,627
Don't move.

95
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:14,226
Why did you come here?

96
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:15,507
Don't you know

97
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:16,786
kings should act cautiously?

98
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:18,146
You are the King of Xiyan.

99
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:19,827
How can you put yourself at risk

100
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,146
and come to another nation?

101
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:25,827
I'm taking you home.

102
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,226
How many people know you are here?

103
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:30,546
If you come back with me now,

104
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:32,307
not many people will know.

105
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:34,706
If you don't come with me,

106
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:36,267
I don't know

107
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:37,466
who will find out.

108
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:38,747
Perhaps,

109
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:40,387
everyone in Dahuang.

110
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:41,706
You are coercing me

111
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:43,906
with my concern for your safety?

112
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:45,552
Yes.

113
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,827
I am coercing you

114
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,627
with my safety.

115
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:53,947
Do whatever you want.

116
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,226
I don't believe

117
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:55,947
you'd stay

118
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:56,546
if I stayed.

119
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,146
Stay here if you want.

120
00:09:58,187 --> 00:09:58,706
No one cares.

121
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:02,906
This place is quite

122
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:04,026
suitable for living.

123
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:07,187
I just saw
the shop next door is for rent.

124
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:09,346
Maybe I can rent it and set up

125
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:10,346
a winery

126
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,026
to keep you company.

127
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:13,666
You finally ascended the throne

128
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,146
and you'll open a winery here?

129
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:20,387
You can be a physician.

130
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,346
Why can't I open a winery?

131
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:25,267
If you're the princess,

132
00:10:25,827 --> 00:10:27,067
then I'll be the King of Xiyan.

133
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:28,987
If you want to be a commoner,

134
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:29,906
then I will stay

135
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:31,067
and give up everything

136
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:32,507
to keep you company.

137
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:34,226
Anyway, I'll go

138
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:35,307
wherever you go.

139
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:42,067
Where should I keep your luggage,

140
00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:43,106
Your Majesty?

141
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:44,747
Clean up the room

142
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:45,466
next to hers for me.

143
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,586
Yes.

144
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:51,026
You mean it?

145
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:53,867
You think I traveled all the way

146
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,947
to Wushen Mountain just to play house?

147
00:10:57,466 --> 00:10:58,466
The fish is quite fresh.

148
00:10:58,586 --> 00:10:59,786
I'll make you a fish soup.

149
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,226
Xiyan Cang Xuan.

150
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:12,747
You rascal!

151
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:17,827
Stop chopping.

152
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:19,106
I'll go with you.

153
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:20,427
But remember,

154
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:22,307
it's against my will.

155
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:24,267
Miao Pu.

156
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:25,987
Leave the luggage there.

157
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:27,546
We're going back
to Chenrong Mountain now.

158
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:28,507
Yes.

159
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:36,592
(Xiaoyue Peak)

160
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:38,448
The Herb Valley of Xiaoyue Peak
is right ahead.

161
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,106
Grandfather moved here

162
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:41,786
as he didn't like Zijin Palace.

163
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:43,666
I guess

164
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,026
you want to live closer to him.

165
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:47,187
So stay at Xiaoyue Peak.

166
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:53,346
Stop being mad at me.

167
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:54,346
Okay?

168
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:56,666
I can apologize however you want.

169
00:11:58,146 --> 00:12:00,466
Save your tricks for the other ladies,

170
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:01,586
not me.

171
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:03,346
I won't buy it.

172
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,146
This herb field

173
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:14,906
is tended by Grandfather.

174
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:18,666
He used to farm and hunt
when he was young.

175
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:21,546
Tending a herb field
is no trouble for him.

176
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,346
You planted a phoenix tree here, too.

177
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:29,466
Do you like it?

178
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:08,387
I know you are mad

179
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:09,586
as I forced you to return.

180
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:11,466
I also know you stayed

181
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:12,867
in that small clinic in Yingzhou

182
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:14,146
because you missed

183
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:15,947
the days in Qingshui Town.

184
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:17,546
If possible, I'd love to

185
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,307
live the life

186
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:19,906
of commoners with you.

187
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:21,987
You can open a clinic.

188
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,546
And I'll open a winery next door.

189
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:26,546
You can see patients.

190
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:28,466
And I'll sell wine.

191
00:13:28,947 --> 00:13:31,026
We can live a simple and happy life,

192
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:34,586
without worrying about court strife

193
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:36,867
or forcing ourselves to do

194
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:38,226
things we don't want to do.

195
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:40,706
But I never had a choice.

196
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:43,267
I am selfish.

197
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:46,546
I can't give you the life you want.

198
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,346
Neither can I let you leave.

199
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:51,627
The Xiaoyue Peak here

200
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:54,586
may not be as bustling as the city

201
00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:56,187
with only a herb field,

202
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:57,627
a phoenix tree,

203
00:13:58,226 --> 00:13:59,067
and a swing set.

204
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:01,226
But you have me and Grandfather.

205
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:04,466
I hope you can

206
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:06,187
consider this place your home.

207
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,026
Live freely and comfortably,

208
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:10,307
and do whatever you want to do.

209
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:17,267
In that sense,

210
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:19,067
this place seems pretty good.

211
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,586
Don't ever leave again.

212
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,187
Because wherever you run off to,

213
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:33,666
I'll find you and bring you back.

214
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:36,947
I was never running away.

215
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:39,747
If I really wanted to run away,

216
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:41,267
I'd go somewhere

217
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:42,827
you simply couldn't find.

218
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:43,507
Then I will

219
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,706
conquer that place

220
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:46,586
and make it mine.

221
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,187
That's quite bold.

222
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:49,706
There is always

223
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:51,267
a place that doesn't belong to you.

224
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:52,144
Then I...

225
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:55,387
I will make the whole world mine.

226
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:57,947
Wherever you go,

227
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:00,586
I'll find you and bring you back.

228
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:01,947
Fine.

229
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:03,346
The entire world is yours.

230
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,546
Perhaps then,

231
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:10,226
I can give you

232
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:12,226
the life you truly desire.

233
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,507
Grandfather.

234
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:27,586
You're back.

235
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:30,187
Cang Xuan.

236
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:33,146
Why don't you
hurry back to Zijin Palace?

237
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:36,106
Xiaoxiao and others
may be covering for you,

238
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:38,786
but those women you married

239
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,546
are no fools.

240
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:47,627
Yes, Grandfather.

241
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:49,586
I will go back right now.

242
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:55,600
Go ahead.

243
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:57,067
I'm leaving then.

244
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:25,427
We didn't know Your Majesty would come.

245
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:26,906
Great Emperor went

246
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:28,267
to the fields early in the morning

247
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:29,346
for fieldwork.

248
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:31,987
I'm afraid he wouldn't
want to be disturbed.

249
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,106
I can wait here

250
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:35,267
for him to return

251
00:16:35,387 --> 00:16:36,546
to show filial piety.

252
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:39,627
I will surely convey

253
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:41,067
your filial piety to him.

254
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:43,267
But he often gets immersed in the field

255
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:44,546
and forgets the time.

256
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:46,906
You have numerous affairs

257
00:16:47,427 --> 00:16:48,627
to attend to in Zijin Palace.

258
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:51,307
Why don't you come another day?

259
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:53,146
Ever since Xiaoyao moved here,

260
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:55,226
I haven't seen her for a long time.

261
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,346
I wish to see her before I leave.

262
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:58,706
Just a moment, Your Majesty.

263
00:16:59,226 --> 00:16:59,906
I will

264
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,146
ask the princess

265
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:02,627
if she could meet you.

266
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,106
Her Majesty is the Queen

267
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:05,826
of the nation.

268
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:07,787
Does she need permission to see anyone?

269
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:08,747
Besides...

270
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:09,264
Linglan.

271
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:12,747
This is Xiaoyue Peak.

272
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:14,627
You are visitors.

273
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:15,706
No matter who you are,

274
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:17,066
I must ask

275
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:18,946
the masters if they want to meet you.

276
00:17:26,787 --> 00:17:28,547
I was unaware
of your arrival, Your Majesty.

277
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:29,987
Welcome.

278
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:32,667
There's no need

279
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:34,147
for such formalities.

280
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:38,667
I should pay respect

281
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:41,226
to my sister-in-law
even if we spare the formalities.

282
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:43,907
Let's still get along

283
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:45,507
as friends, as before.

284
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:47,426
Just call me Xinyue in private.

285
00:17:48,106 --> 00:17:50,186
It seems too distant
to call me "Your Majesty".

286
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:54,147
Even if we are close,

287
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:56,186
we can't abandon the proper decorum

288
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:58,346
at least in front of others.

289
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:02,306
Your Highness,

290
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,787
if you agree to go to the fields
with the Great Emperor,

291
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:07,027
please don't sleep in.

292
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:08,586
He delayed breakfast

293
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:09,586
for an hour

294
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:10,706
just to wait for you.

295
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:11,547
I see.

296
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,907
To not make Grandfather wait,

297
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,267
I won't agree to
go to the fields with him.

298
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:17,547
Great Emperor

299
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,466
is not making you do the fieldwork.

300
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:20,306
He simply

301
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:22,667
doesn't want you to oversleep every day,

302
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:24,106
so he skips breakfast.

303
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,426
You told him to sleep and rise early

304
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:27,066
for health.

305
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:28,106
But you should

306
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,027
also take care of yourself

307
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:31,987
so as not to worry him.

308
00:18:33,226 --> 00:18:34,027
I got it.

309
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:40,987
Zhoushan

310
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:43,106
made these for Grandfather.

311
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:46,226
They may seem simple
but they're very tasty.

312
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:48,867
Please stay and eat with us.

313
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:52,747
I've had breakfast.

314
00:18:53,106 --> 00:18:54,027
Enjoy the meal.

315
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:54,907
I'm off.

316
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:56,346
Let me walk you out.

317
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:07,627
(Where did His Majesty go?)

318
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:09,787
Is he in the residence
of another concubine?

319
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:12,627
Your Majesty,

320
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,184
His Majesty didn't go to the residence
of another concubine.

321
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,066
(It's said that he is walking alone
in the Poinciana Wood.)

322
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:22,987
I heard that the phoenix trees
and swing set on Chenrong Mountain

323
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:25,066
were planted and built by His Majesty.

324
00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:27,226
He grew up in Zhaoyun Peak,

325
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:30,186
which was full of phoenix trees.

326
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:32,066
Our mothers

327
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,826
made a swing for us.

328
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:35,226
For him,

329
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:36,826
it's a childhood memory,

330
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:38,147
and a memory of home.

331
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,066
His Majesty is truly nostalgic.

332
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:44,106
Aren't we all like that?

333
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:45,547
No matter how far we go,

334
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:47,186
we can't let go of our hometown.

335
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:48,946
Alright, you can leave me here.

336
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:50,787
I'll visit again.

337
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:52,747
Farewell, Your Majesty.

338
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:03,267
I didn't do

339
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:04,466
anything rude, right?

340
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:06,066
Not at all.

341
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:08,547
You were utterly respectful and formal.

342
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:10,346
I've never seen you

343
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:12,346
so respectful to the Great Emperor
and His Majesty.

344
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,547
Xinyue and I could spare the formalities
when we were friends.

345
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:17,466
But it's different now.

346
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:18,826
She is the queen.

347
00:20:19,706 --> 00:20:21,946
I fear that any careless action of mine

348
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:23,226
might offend her.

349
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:24,706
She may be a queen,

350
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:26,147
but she's the Queen of Xiyan,

351
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:27,907
not the Queen of Haoling.

352
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,186
We're on Chenrong Mountain.

353
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,667
This place belongs to His Majesty.

354
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:32,867
His Majesty said

355
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,147
that what's his is yours.

356
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:36,106
He told you to see this place as home.

357
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:38,946
Even Nian understands this.

358
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,027
Cang Xuan has a wife now.

359
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:42,306
Many things are no longer

360
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:43,106
the same as before.

361
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:44,667
Let alone Chenrong Mountain,

362
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:46,946
even Xiaoyue Peak

363
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,987
can't keep troubles at bay

364
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:50,306
by closing the gate.

365
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:51,907
What is troubling you?

366
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:55,387
Nothing.

367
00:20:57,987 --> 00:20:59,267
Don't spout nonsense to Cang Xuan.

368
00:21:01,147 --> 00:21:02,267
I'm going back to sleep.

369
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:03,907
Princess.

370
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:04,787
Breakfast.

371
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:05,747
I'm not eating.

372
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:09,267
You can go rest.

373
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:10,306
Stop following me.

374
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,072
Great Emperor.

375
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:13,987
You're back.

376
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:15,867
How is Xiaoyao doing?

377
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:16,987
Princess

378
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:18,466
has been down

379
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:19,826
all the time.

380
00:21:20,306 --> 00:21:21,466
She can't just

381
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:22,787
sleep all day.

382
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:27,466
Cang Xuan ascended the throne.

383
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:28,867
The crisis was resolved.

384
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:32,466
Tushan Jing was married.

385
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:35,826
She has lost her pursuit for now.

386
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:39,586
That's why she lives in idleness.

387
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:41,027
That's right.

388
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:48,387
I want to retrieve my memories.

389
00:21:59,147 --> 00:22:00,787
Memories of that night
with Fangfeng Yiying.

390
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:01,586
What?

391
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:06,706
Haven't you been
drowning yourself in wine

392
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:08,226
to forget about it?

393
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:09,106
Avoidance

394
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:10,867
solves nothing.

395
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,426
I want to know

396
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:14,706
what exactly happened that night.

397
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:16,027
What could have happened?

398
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:18,267
You caused her to get pregnant.

399
00:22:24,547 --> 00:22:25,667
Could it be that

400
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:27,027
you are suspecting...

401
00:22:28,016 --> 00:22:28,592
Jing.

402
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:30,306
Are you being paranoid?

403
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:31,907
Aren't you foxes the best

404
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:33,507
at bewitching and seducing people?

405
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:36,267
Solve the problem from the root.

406
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:38,106
Your grandmother schemed against you.

407
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:38,704
So,

408
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,667
seek help from the elders in your clan.

409
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:41,547
I have tried it

410
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:43,106
with the help of some cultivated elders,

411
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:45,426
but I just couldn't remember anything.

412
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:47,826
That is indeed a bit suspicious.

413
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,507
You're my last resort.

414
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:52,066
After all, finding lost items

415
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,186
is the expertise of you dogs.

416
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:56,624
Who's a dog?

417
00:22:57,226 --> 00:22:58,306
Who did you call a dog?

418
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:01,226
We are the double-headed dog deities.

419
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:02,627
We're not foxes either.

420
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:05,066
Fine.

421
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:07,226
That's the problem, right?

422
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:08,987
I'm looking for the lost memories.

423
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:11,186
Only the bloodline
of double-headed dog deities

424
00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:12,027
can do that.

425
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:13,106
We have to

426
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:16,987
ask my uncle for help.

427
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:17,907
Please ask

428
00:23:17,907 --> 00:23:19,306
Uncle Lirong for help.

429
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:21,466
No way.

430
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:24,787
Uncle.

431
00:23:29,226 --> 00:23:30,706
I don't mean to turn you down.

432
00:23:31,547 --> 00:23:33,346
But this is way too risky.

433
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:34,466
It may deplete

434
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:36,466
your spirit power and cultivation

435
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:38,507
and even kill you in the worst case.

436
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:39,987
In this world,

437
00:23:40,147 --> 00:23:41,426
everything

438
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,706
has its trajectory.

439
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:44,186
We can only probe

440
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:45,226
into the future

441
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:48,147
and not backtrack into the past.

442
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:49,826
It's that serious?

443
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:51,507
Jing.

444
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:53,066
Maybe you should let it go.

445
00:23:53,186 --> 00:23:54,667
Even if you figure out everything,

446
00:23:54,787 --> 00:23:55,627
you're already

447
00:23:55,627 --> 00:23:56,306
married.

448
00:23:56,306 --> 00:23:57,387
What's the point?

449
00:24:01,027 --> 00:24:03,747
As the clan chief,
you shoulder great responsibility.

450
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:06,466
You'd better not put yourself in danger.

451
00:24:17,186 --> 00:24:18,466
The days of yesterday

452
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:19,867
cannot be retrieved.

453
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:20,987
People of the past

454
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:22,106
cannot be retained.

455
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:23,186
Whatever is gone

456
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:25,867
is gone for good.

457
00:24:28,027 --> 00:24:28,867
Uncle Lirong,

458
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:34,186
I want to try it

459
00:24:35,547 --> 00:24:36,627
even at the risk of my life.

460
00:24:37,306 --> 00:24:38,960
Xiaoyao is not the one of the past.

461
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:40,826
She is my everything.

462
00:24:42,186 --> 00:24:43,066
As long as I'm alive,

463
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:45,547
she's a crucial part of my life.

464
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:47,586
Please help me.

465
00:24:55,706 --> 00:24:56,946
Since you're not afraid of death,

466
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:58,987
then I'll risk my life

467
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:01,586
to help you trace back through time.

468
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:06,066
Great Emperor tried his best to persuade

469
00:25:06,387 --> 00:25:08,426
the princess to go out
and clear her mind.

470
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:09,387
But she still

471
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,946
spends all day sleeping,

472
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:12,226
unwilling to do anything.

473
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:14,992
Your Majesty.

474
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:16,667
Chief Fenglong,

475
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,027
Lord Yu Jiang and Lord Chishui Xian

476
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:18,706
are outside.

477
00:25:19,346 --> 00:25:19,856
Bring them in.

478
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:21,168
Yes.

479
00:25:25,027 --> 00:25:25,547
You may leave.

480
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:27,184
Yes.

481
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:31,907
I have summoned you here

482
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:34,267
to discuss the naval forces' training.

483
00:25:35,186 --> 00:25:35,907
Xiyan features

484
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:36,706
more mountains

485
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:37,946
than water.

486
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:39,586
In my humble opinion,

487
00:25:40,226 --> 00:25:41,547
our naval force is good enough.

488
00:25:41,826 --> 00:25:43,066
There is no need to further burden

489
00:25:43,346 --> 00:25:44,387
the national treasury.

490
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,346
Agreed.

491
00:25:45,547 --> 00:25:46,867
Xiyan is stable and prosperous now.

492
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:48,507
That is exactly why we should

493
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,066
be vigilant in times of peace.

494
00:25:51,346 --> 00:25:52,426
Maintaining an advantage

495
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:53,507
in land combat is needed.

496
00:25:53,706 --> 00:25:54,907
But we must also strengthen

497
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:56,306
the naval force.

498
00:25:57,387 --> 00:25:59,106
The Chishui Family resides by water

499
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:00,747
and is skilled in naval combat.

500
00:26:01,147 --> 00:26:02,907
I will do my utmost for Your Majesty

501
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:04,387
to build an elite naval force.

502
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:05,306
Good.

503
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,466
I'll entrust the training

504
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:09,226
of naval force entirely to you.

505
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:11,267
Yu Jiang will assist you.

506
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:12,826
I won't let you down.

507
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:13,867
Remember.

508
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:15,466
Act secretly,

509
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:17,346
and be discreet.

510
00:26:17,466 --> 00:26:18,186
- Yes.
- Yes.

511
00:26:19,387 --> 00:26:20,466
These are all herb books

512
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:22,066
left in Herb Valley by King of Chenrong.

513
00:26:22,627 --> 00:26:23,547
Sort them out

514
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:25,627
and lay them here to air out.

515
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,346
Yes.

516
00:26:27,426 --> 00:26:27,987
Princess.

517
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:56,507
Xuan.

518
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:57,547
Come and see

519
00:26:58,306 --> 00:27:00,027
what I found on Xiaoyue Peak.

520
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:02,586
What is this?

521
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:04,387
Handwritten notes

522
00:27:04,387 --> 00:27:05,667
left by King of Chenrong

523
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:07,426
recorded remedies

524
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:09,106
for various intractable diseases.

525
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:10,987
Unfortunately, King of Chenrong

526
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:12,267
passed away before finishing it,

527
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:14,627
leaving behind
this incomplete manuscript

528
00:27:15,027 --> 00:27:15,946
which no one can decipher.

529
00:27:16,226 --> 00:27:17,226
What a pity.

530
00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:19,226
If it was the complete note,

531
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,226
it would save all the people
from illness.

532
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,507
Others can't decipher it.

533
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:25,387
But I can.

534
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,027
The Herbal Encyclopedia

535
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:29,466
offers clues
to this incomplete manuscript.

536
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:34,147
My mother left me

537
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:36,907
the Herbal Encyclopedia

538
00:27:37,387 --> 00:27:38,946
sealed in the jade medallion
before she left.

539
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:41,066
The Queen Mother said

540
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,826
it was a calamity.

541
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:44,667
She forced me to memorize it

542
00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:46,747
and destroyed the jade medallion.

543
00:27:47,706 --> 00:27:48,627
When I was imprisoned

544
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:50,306
by the nine-tailed fox in the cage,

545
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:52,907
the Herbal Encyclopedia saved me.

546
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:54,586
King of Chenrong wrote it

547
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:55,667
to save people.

548
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,267
But I studied it

549
00:27:58,466 --> 00:27:59,667
to save myself.

550
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,547
I never understood

551
00:28:02,946 --> 00:28:04,586
what was written in it.

552
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:09,867
Although King of Chenrong

553
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:11,586
never taught me medicine,

554
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:13,787
my medical skills

555
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:16,547
stemmed from the Herbal Encyclopedia,

556
00:28:16,907 --> 00:28:18,387
which makes me his disciple.

557
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:19,787
Whether it's to repay

558
00:28:19,787 --> 00:28:20,987
his kindness in teaching

559
00:28:20,987 --> 00:28:22,267
or the grace of saving me,

560
00:28:23,987 --> 00:28:25,826
I should fulfill his wish to save

561
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:27,267
the people from diseases

562
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:28,586
and alleviate any suffering.

563
00:28:28,826 --> 00:28:30,066
Do whatever you want to do.

564
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:31,787
You have my support.

565
00:28:31,987 --> 00:28:32,586
I am very happy

566
00:28:33,306 --> 00:28:35,267
to see you revitalized.

567
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:37,907
There are still

568
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:39,066
many meaningful things

569
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:40,027
that I have to do.

570
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:41,826
I can't always be dispirited

571
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:42,826

Princess

594
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:01,907
completed

595
00:30:02,186 --> 00:30:04,507
King of Chenrong's notes in three years.

596
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:05,706
Aptitude.

597
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:06,706
Talent.

598
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:08,186
Hard work.

599
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:09,547
Each one is indispensable.

600
00:30:10,147 --> 00:30:11,586
She's like her mother.

601
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:32,907
Grandfather.

602
00:30:35,387 --> 00:30:36,186
You're back.

603
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:41,907
Xiaoyao is back.

604
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:45,426
Aren't you going to keep her company?

605
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,466
Xiaoyao is busy.

606
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:54,096
Great Emperor,

607
00:30:54,346 --> 00:30:55,066
after this game.

608
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:56,826
I've just finished reading

609
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:58,106
your combat notes

610
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,106
and finally figured

611
00:30:59,106 --> 00:30:59,946
something out.

612
00:31:18,426 --> 00:31:19,024
Xiaoyao.

613
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:21,547
Take a break.

614
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:22,987
Just a bit more.

615
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:18,346
Where is Xuan?

616
00:32:20,466 --> 00:32:21,106
Xiaoyao.

617
00:32:23,547 --> 00:32:24,826
I made your favorite dish.

618
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:26,960
Did...

619
00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:28,226
Did you make this?

620
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:29,747
Yeah.

621
00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:32,667
To reward you for your hard work.

622
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:42,706
Grandfather.

623
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:43,907
Fenglong.

624
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:45,346
Food is ready.

625
00:32:45,872 --> 00:32:46,512
Okay.

626
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:47,627
Coming.

627
00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:49,907
Grandfather.

628
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,226
Let me think.

629
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:53,706
Fenglong.

630
00:32:53,907 --> 00:32:54,667
Food is ready.

631
00:32:58,547 --> 00:33:00,226
I know you're good at seasoning,

632
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:02,186
but try this.

633
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,306
Try the folk cuisines I learned

634
00:33:04,346 --> 00:33:05,267
throughout Dahuang.

635
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:11,472
Grandfather.

636
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:12,987
This game of chess

637
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:14,426
taught me so much.

638
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:15,826
I've benefited a lot.

639
00:33:16,547 --> 00:33:18,547
Your strategies of attack and retreat

640
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,507
were obtained
from the battlefield, right?

641
00:33:22,907 --> 00:33:23,507
Fenglong,

642
00:33:24,147 --> 00:33:25,547
even if you are not hungry,

643
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:27,946
you should let Grandfather eat.

644
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:29,547
It's rare for me

645
00:33:29,547 --> 00:33:30,507
to see Grandfather.

646
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:31,867
Unlike you.

647
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:33,507
You're always by his side

648
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:34,507
to seek advice.

649
00:33:34,826 --> 00:33:35,346
Wait.

650
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:36,747
Who says you can

651
00:33:37,387 --> 00:33:38,226
call him Grandfather?

652
00:33:38,507 --> 00:33:39,306
With your consent,

653
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,186
I can address him like that.

654
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,224
Your Majesty.

655
00:33:47,387 --> 00:33:48,346
I want to marry Xiaoyao

656
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:49,706
as soon as possible.

657
00:34:01,426 --> 00:34:02,667
This is the Lamp of Time.

658
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:04,066
With life as the flame

659
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:05,267
that sustains it.

660
00:34:06,306 --> 00:34:08,112
This is the Guifang Family's rare weapon.

661
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:09,226
I've heard of it

662
00:34:09,226 --> 00:34:10,186
but never seen it.

663
00:34:10,768 --> 00:34:11,376
Uncle.

664
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,466
How did you get it?

665
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:15,307
Once the Lamp of Time is lit,

666
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:17,987
it takes your hair as the wick,

667
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,866
your blood as the oil,

668
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:24,107
and your life as the flame.

669
00:34:24,987 --> 00:34:26,426
Are you really ready for this?

670
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:29,946
I'm ready.

671
00:34:30,386 --> 00:34:30,987
Jing.

672
00:34:31,226 --> 00:34:32,307
Is this truly worth it?

673
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:33,987
You're the chief of Tushan Family.

674
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:34,787
Your family,

675
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:35,507
fame, fortune,

676
00:34:35,547 --> 00:34:36,107
power,

677
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:37,226
and all the splendors.

678
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:38,547
Won't you hold onto any of those?

679
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:39,906
Do you have to risk your life?

680
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:41,787
I'm not risking my life.

681
00:34:42,946 --> 00:34:44,307
Xiaoyao is my life.

682
00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:47,787
I'm not like you and Fenglong.

683
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:49,787
My heart is too small

684
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:51,866
to hold the entire world.

685
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:54,107
It can only hold one person.

686
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:58,186
Please begin, Uncle.

687
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:37,866
Beggar.

688
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:39,146
Starting today,

689
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:40,307
you'll be Ye Shiqi.

690
00:35:42,747 --> 00:35:43,587
Don't follow me.

691
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:55,866
Jing.

692
00:36:00,787 --> 00:36:01,466
Jing.

693
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:02,587
Jing.

694
00:36:02,987 --> 00:36:03,626
Jing.

695
00:36:05,107 --> 00:36:05,827
Uncle.

696
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:31,466
Great Emperor.

697
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:34,386
I think Xiaoyao and I
should hold the wedding.

698
00:36:35,386 --> 00:36:36,307
My grandfather

699
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:37,466
is waiting for a great-grandson.

700
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:39,347
I bet you're anticipating, too.

701
00:36:40,186 --> 00:36:41,027
It's fine by me.

702
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:43,987
As for the wedding,

703
00:36:44,347 --> 00:36:45,347
it's up to you.

704
00:36:47,547 --> 00:36:48,226
Your Majesty.

705
00:36:49,226 --> 00:36:50,307
You already have

706
00:36:50,386 --> 00:36:51,626
several consorts in Zijin Palace.

707
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:53,787
Yet I am still all alone.

708
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:54,866
So lonely.

709
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:56,386
Your Majesty,

710
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:57,626
won't you show me some pity?

711
00:37:06,146 --> 00:37:07,186
This is Xiaoyao's wedding.

712
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:08,706
Why are you asking me?

713
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:12,626
Xiaoyao.

714
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:15,146
Would you like to hold the wedding soon?

715
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:25,107
Xiaoyao.

716
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:27,946
A wedding is just a formality.

717
00:37:28,906 --> 00:37:30,386
If you like Chenrong Mountain,

718
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:32,787
we can ask His Majesty for a peak

719
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:34,426
to settle down here.

720
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,307
If you like Zhiyi,

721
00:37:36,747 --> 00:37:38,466
we can renovate the old residence

722
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:39,386
of the Chishui Family

723
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:41,347
and reside there.

724
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,946
If you find both places too noisy,

725
00:37:44,146 --> 00:37:45,226
we can go to Chishui.

726
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:47,027
You can open a clinic.

727
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:48,386
I support you.

728
00:37:48,906 --> 00:37:49,747
You know me.

729
00:37:50,307 --> 00:37:51,787
I've always been mischievous,

730
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:53,987
and have never been fond of formalities,

731
00:37:54,226 --> 00:37:55,386
or bound by norms.

732
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,507
No matter what you want to do,

733
00:37:58,466 --> 00:37:59,307
I'm happy

734
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:00,347
as long as you're happy.

735
00:38:04,027 --> 00:38:04,666
Xiaoyao...

736
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:05,987
If Xiaoyao agrees,

737
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,107
then it's settled.

738
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:12,067
You've agreed?

739
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:19,312
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Thank you, Great Emperor.

740
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:21,347
I'll ask my grandfather to send someone

741
00:38:21,626 --> 00:38:23,307
to Haoling to settle the wedding date.

751
00:39:15,827 --> 00:39:16,587
How is he?

752
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:20,787
His heart meridian is damaged.

753
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:22,787
But fortunately, he survived.

754
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:26,866
You were half dead once.

755
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,827
Rest well after you return.

756
00:39:30,226 --> 00:39:31,347
You must not

757
00:39:31,347 --> 00:39:32,587
exhaust yourself

758
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:34,987
or overthink again.

759
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:40,987
Uncle, are you okay?

760
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:43,866
I've just overexerted my spirit power.

761
00:39:44,946 --> 00:39:46,626
I'll be fine after a nap.

762
00:39:58,547 --> 00:39:59,226
Jing.

763
00:40:00,186 --> 00:40:01,267
Do you remember something?

764
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:13,507
And after that?

765
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:15,466
After that,

766
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:18,027
I don't remember anything.

767
00:40:18,587 --> 00:40:19,787
The same outcome.

768
00:40:20,386 --> 00:40:22,347
Fangfeng Yiying is really ruthless.

769
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:23,866
She actually lowered herself

770
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:24,626
and shamelessly

771
00:40:24,747 --> 00:40:26,386
seduced you
in the form of another woman.

772
00:40:26,987 --> 00:40:27,547
Jing.

773
00:40:29,906 --> 00:40:31,267
Although it's not your fault,

774
00:40:31,587 --> 00:40:32,747
at this point,

775
00:40:34,547 --> 00:40:35,827
you might as well give up.

776
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:37,547
A broken heart is hard to heal.

777
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:38,827
My uncle said

778
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:40,067
that you should rest well

779
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:42,267
and avoid overthinking things.

780
00:40:42,587 --> 00:40:44,386
Otherwise, your life will be in danger.

781
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:50,067
Xiaoyao.

782
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:52,466
Have you really decided?

783
00:40:56,307 --> 00:40:57,587
The wedding will take place

784
00:40:57,946 --> 00:40:59,027
sooner or later anyway

785
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:00,987
and Fenglong wants it done soon.

786
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:02,466
Then I will ask Father

787
00:41:03,107 --> 00:41:04,067
to choose a wedding date.

788
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:06,226
Fenglong mentioned it

789
00:41:06,226 --> 00:41:07,626
and you just decided on it.

790
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:10,027
You haven't thought it through.

791
00:41:10,547 --> 00:41:11,987
Isn't it a bit hasty?

792
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:15,507
I've known Fenglong for decades.

793
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:17,626
We know each other very well.

794
00:41:18,547 --> 00:41:19,587
There's nothing hasty.

795
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:30,987
Xuan.

796
00:41:32,906 --> 00:41:34,307
I don't want you to get married.

797
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:35,706
I understand

798
00:41:35,946 --> 00:41:36,827
how you feel.

799
00:41:38,226 --> 00:41:40,267
Back when you married Xinyue,

800
00:41:41,027 --> 00:41:42,507
I also felt hurt deep down.

801
00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:45,747
I felt that she would take you away

802
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:49,027
and I would become an outsider.

803
00:41:50,987 --> 00:41:53,747
You were upset when I got married?

804
00:41:56,507 --> 00:41:58,186
I was very upset.

805
00:41:59,347 --> 00:42:00,747
It was like something

806
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:03,587
that belonged to me was taken away.

807
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:04,688
Xiaoyao.

808
00:42:06,787 --> 00:42:08,827
But then I realized I was being petty.

809
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:11,027
You have been married to Xinyue
for so long,

810
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:12,347
yet you are still my brother

811
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:13,946
and so nice to me.

812
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:15,386
Xinyue didn't take you away.

813
00:42:16,307 --> 00:42:17,347
Don't worry, Xuan.

814
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:18,987
After I marry Fenglong,

815
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:20,626
you'll still be my closest family member

816
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:22,027
whom I trust the most.

817
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:23,347
Your closest family member

818
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:25,787
whom you trust the most.

819
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:28,547
Aren't you?

820
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:29,426
Xiaoyao.

821
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:31,866
I don't want you to leave. I want...

822
00:42:31,866 --> 00:42:32,866
Cang Xuan, let go.

823
00:42:41,747 --> 00:42:42,267
Xuan.

824
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:44,547
Let it go.

825
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:47,146
We can't let
the Chishui Family beat us to it

826
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:48,347
and make Father feel

827
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:49,827
that he has to learn about

828
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:51,787
my wedding from someone else.
