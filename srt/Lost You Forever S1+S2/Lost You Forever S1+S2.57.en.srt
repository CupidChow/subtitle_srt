2
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:32,880
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,010
Struck by the tragic news,

4
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,168
Miss Xiling developed chest pain.

5
00:01:37,168 --> 00:01:39,568
And regardless of low spirit power,
she stayed in cold water all night...

6
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:40,770
Just tell me if it's serious.

7
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,410
Can you treat her?

8
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,929
It's serious but I can treat her.

9
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,690
But the result

10
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:45,849
depends on her will.

11
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:46,490
Get the medicine.

12
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:47,440
Yes.

13
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,969
Bring it over as soon as possible.

14
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,352
Yes.

15
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,410
Your Majesty, you haven't rested

16
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,969
throughout the journey.

17
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:01,810
I will take good care of Miss Xiling.

18
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:03,490
Please get some rest.

19
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:07,280
Your Majesty,

20
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,569
Chief Chishui and Lord Ru Shou are here.

21
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:13,610
Look after her.

22
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:18,090
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

23
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,649
Any news?

24
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,730
Lord Ru Shou and I have

25
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,330
searched the entire West River,

26
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,810
including the estuaries,

27
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,250
but we found nothing.

28
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,010
Keep searching.

29
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:28,849
Find him, dead or alive.

30
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,370
If we keep searching,

31
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:31,689
we'll be searching the sea.

32
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,209
Even if we mobilize

33
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,129
the entire Xiyan army,

34
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,330
it's just a speck in the sea.

35
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:38,250
Keep searching.

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,769
- Yes.
- Yes.

37
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,409
Jing was such a good person.

38
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,530
But Tushan Hou just killed him.

39
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,049
My brother says

40
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,569
that the Tushan Family is in disarray.

41
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:58,649
The elders are in immense grief.

42
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,090
They regret listening

43
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,409
to the one-sided story

44
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:03,409
of Tushan Hou

45
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,569
and let him off so easily.

46
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:11,890
Life has been hard on Miss Xiling.

47
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,530
She finally discovered

48
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,289
the truth about Fangfeng Yiying

49
00:03:16,649 --> 00:03:17,689
and made things right.

50
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,689
She was about to

51
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:21,569
get married soon.

52
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,569
But it turned out

53
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,409
to be such a tragedy.

54
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:32,129
She is alive, safe and sound.

55
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,010
How is life hard on her?

56
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:37,730
First, it was Fangfeng Bei.

57
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:39,489
Now it is Tushan Jing.

58
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,250
I'd say life has been hard

59
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:42,890
on the people around her.

60
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,129
She's totally a jinx.

61
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,250
Any news of Jing?

62
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:04,370
We've been searching

63
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,370
for three days and nights.

64
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,129
But we found nothing.

65
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,289
How come you couldn't find anything?

66
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,129
The West River
is connected to the estuary.

67
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,170
Jing must have drifted into the sea.

68
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,369
But the sea is vast

69
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:22,610
with countless sea monsters.

70
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,849
And Jing was seriously injured,

71
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:27,569
which would surely
attract the sea monsters.

72
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,569
I'm afraid he didn't make it.

73
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,210
Lirong Chang and Ru Shou
are still searching for him.

74
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,369
I will make them keep searching

75
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,849
until they find Jing.

76
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,129
How long have I been unconscious?

77
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:07,610
For two days and nights.

78
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:11,249
Xuan.

79
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,529
I want to go to the seaside.

80
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,330
Okay.

81
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,730
I'll go with you.

82
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,369
Did Jing really end up in the sea?

83
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,129
Lirong Chang said that Jing was injured

84
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,170
and would float along the West River

85
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,050
into the open sea.

86
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,730
Why is the sea so vast?

87
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,969
We will keep searching.

88
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,289
Nian heard about it

89
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,770
and sent the Wushen Army to help.

90
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,689
We will keep searching.

91
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:29,050
I just don't get it.

92
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,689
Whenever we made a mistake,

93
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,809
we knew what we did wrong

94
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,569
and we would improve.

95
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,730
But this time,

96
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,409
what did we do wrong?

97
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,210
Jing rushed to check on
a seriously ill child.

98
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,249
He did nothing wrong.

99
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,969
I wanted to save an innocent child.

100
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:56,529
I did nothing wrong.

101
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,450
Jing brought all his secret guards.
He did nothing wrong.

102
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,289
He fought to buy some time

103
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,849
to avoid getting killed on the spot.

104
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,730
He did nothing wrong.

105
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,409
Since we did nothing wrong,

106
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:18,170
how did we end up like this?

107
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:21,650
What did we do wrong?

108
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:25,689
Xiaoyao,

109
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,650
Jing did nothing wrong
by seeing the child.

110
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:31,210
You did nothing wrong
by saving the child.

111
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:32,969
You did nothing wrong.

112
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,050
Since neither of us

113
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:40,809
did anything wrong,

114
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,529
what went wrong?

115
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,689
Xuan.

116
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:56,569
Whenever we made a mistake,

117
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,890
we could correct it.

118
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,409
Then everything would be alright.

119
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,010
But what do we do this time?

120
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,569
How do we correct it this time?

121
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:12,330
Can you tell me?

122
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:13,890
Tell me.

123
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,650
What did I do wrong?

124
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:17,930
I'll correct it as long as you tell me.

125
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:19,689
I will correct it.

126
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,050
If that could bring Jing back,

127
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,050
I can do anything.

128
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,450
I can do anything

129
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,330
to bring Jing back.

130
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,689
As long as he comes back.

131
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:51,970
Xiaoyao.

132
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:54,090
It's not your fault.

133
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,330
It's not your fault.

134
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,569
Jing promised me

135
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:11,729
that we'd get married once we finished

136
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,049
compiling the medical book.

137
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,369
He promised me.

138
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:24,850
He can't be dead.

139
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,689
He can't be dead.

140
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:31,530
He will definitely come back.

141
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,489
He will definitely come back.

142
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:34,290
Xiaoyao.

143
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,330
Xiaoyao.

144
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,880
Xiaoyao, don't go.

145
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,330
Tushan Jing.

146
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:48,890
Tushan Jing.

147
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,210
Tushan Jing.

148
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,770
Tushan Jing!

149
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,609
Tushan Jing!

150
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:05,249
Don't you want to marry me?

151
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,129
As long as you come back,

152
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:10,249
I will marry you right away.

153
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:12,410
Will you come back?

154
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,489
In seven days.

155
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,090
It's the day of the full moon

156
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,010
in seven days.

157
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,890
As long as you come back,
I will marry you right away.

158
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,770
We will bow to heaven and earth
and our families

159
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:29,169
and inform everyone in Dahuang

160
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,890
that we will be husband and wife.

161
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:35,330
Tushan Jing.

162
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,249
You are the groom.

163
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,929
You must come back.

164
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,210
You can't break your promise.

165
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:48,249
Before the wedding,

166
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,770
no matter where you are,

167
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,489
come back to me

168
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,689
even if you have to crawl.

169
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:59,369
If you dare to break your promise,

170
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,530
I will never forgive you.

171
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:05,049
Never.

172
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,049
Never!

173
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:10,970
Never.

174
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,450
It's the day of the full moon.

175
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:52,809
Miss can't

176
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,970
possibly marry

177
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,129
Chief Tushan, right?

178
00:11:57,489 --> 00:11:58,809
You sent tens of thousands

179
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,129
of people to search
for ten days and nights,

180
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:02,330
but to no avail.

181
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,010
I'm afraid

182
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,929
that Chief Tushan

183
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,650
has little chance of surviving.

184
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,169
The deceased can't come back to life.

185
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,169
Your Majesty,

186
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,689
we can't let Miss

187
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:14,210
marry a dead man.

188
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,369
Your Majesty.

189
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:17,129
Your Majesty, how can you leave?

190
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,770
We must persuade her.

191
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,440
Where is my wedding gown?

192
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:29,650
Miss.

193
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,249
Chief Tushan

194
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:33,650
hasn't come back.

195
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:36,049
Why don't you get changed later?

196
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,090
I said.

197
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,290
Bring my wedding gown.

198
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,210
Yes.

199
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,970
Let me do it.

200
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,809
Grandfather, Xuan,

201
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:21,090
I was about to send someone to get you.

202
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:23,929
The elder's divination says

203
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,689
the third quarter of the You hour

204
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:28,850
is auspicious for a wedding.

205
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:32,010
I didn't believe in these things.

206
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,090
But it's my wedding.

207
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,929
I'd rather believe in it

208
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:38,410
just in case.

209
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,249
I want to start the ceremony

210
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,890
at that moment.

211
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,090
Xiaoyao.

212
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,809
Marriage is a major life event.

213
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:49,850
Don't mess around.

214
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,929
Look at this palace and me.

215
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,450
Do I look like

216
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:56,970
I'm messing around?

217
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,410
Grandfather.

218
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:00,569
I'll pay tributes to heaven and earth

219
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,249
and inform our families

220
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,290
that I'm marrying Tushan Jing.

221
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,689
Tushan Jing isn't even here.

222
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:07,729
How can you marry him?

223
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,249
I have the final say in his affairs.

224
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,129
The auspicious time is upon us.

225
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,530
What are you waiting for?

226
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:29,489
Tushan Jing is dead!

227
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,249
Tushan Jing is dead.

228
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,489
Tushan Jing is dead.

229
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:37,729
Xiaoyao.

230
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,330
I know you're upset.

231
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,530
You refuse to believe it.

232
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,210
But you must

233
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,330
accept the fact, anyway.

234
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,249
Tushan Jing is not coming back.

235
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,049
I know you are heartbroken.

236
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:50,970
Just like when we lost our mothers,

237
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:53,049
we were in deep pain.

238
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,049
I will be with you.

239
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:56,850
We will put up with it,

240
00:15:58,169 --> 00:15:59,210
and get through it.

241
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,129
No matter how sad we are,

242
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,210
we will get over it.

243
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:04,650
Xuan.

244
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:07,970
It's different this time.

245
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,249
How is it different?

246
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,369
If not in 10 years,

247
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,689
we can get through it
in 20 years, 30 years,

248
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,530
100 years or 300 years.

249
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,970
We will get over it.

250
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:19,569
You are welcome

251
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,569
to attend the wedding.

252
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:23,489
It will take place

253
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:24,850
even if you don't

254
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,929
want to attend, anyway.

255
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,809
Cang Xuan.

256
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,850
Xiaoyao

257
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,249
grew up alone.

258
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:49,090
She has never relied on me.

259
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:51,010
Nor has she relied on you.

260
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,129
Neither of us has the right
to interfere with her decision.

261
00:16:58,729 --> 00:16:59,369
Yes.

262
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,569
You're right.

263
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,930
Xiaoyao has never relied on me.

264
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,050
But I have relied on her.

265
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,209
I've made it so far thanks to her.

266
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,690
I will never allow her

267
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,129
to waste her life

268
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:19,530
because of a man like Tushan Jing.

269
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:43,824
Xiaoyao.

270
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:46,410
Let's wait a bit longer.

271
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,089
I'll gather the forces
and assign more people.

272
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:50,530
Once they find Tushan Jing,

273
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:52,570
you'll hold the wedding.

274
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:54,089
Let's wait, okay?

275
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:55,568
Xuan.

276
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,969
I'm tired of waiting.

277
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:00,690
Jing and I have wasted

278
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,810
too much time.

279
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,770
I won't allow it!

280
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:19,410
Without my permission,

281
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,329
Miss Xiling of Gu Shu

282
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:22,609
shall not marry Chief Tushan of Qingqiu.

283
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,209
I do not allow

284
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,089
the wedding today.

285
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,369
I humbly

286
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,489
beseech Your Majesty for approval.

287
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,089
Is Tushan Jing really that important?

288
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:19,969
I humbly

289
00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:22,369
beseech Your Majesty for approval.

290
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,410
All rise.

291
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,040
The auspicious time has come.

292
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:39,170
Don't miss the moment.

293
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:51,408
Thank you, Your Majesty.

294
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,329
Xiling Jiuyao

295
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,930
pays respect to heaven and earth,

296
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,849
and families.

297
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,770
Tonight, I'm holding
my wedding with the moon

298
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,690
standing in for the groom.

299
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,489
Xiling Jiuyao and Tushan Jing
are deeply in love

300
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,209
and vow to get married.

301
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:29,010
We will be together

302
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:31,609
and never part.

303
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,290

Tonight,

314
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,969
Jing can't make it here.

315
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:57,890
But heaven grants reunion

316
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,010
in the mortal world.

317
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,249
The moon waxes and wanes.

318
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,890
There is sorrow and joy.

319
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,249
Let the full moon be the lamp

320
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,930
and the crescent be the boat.

321
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:11,729
Be it full or crescent,

322
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,050
bring my beloved one back

323
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:16,410
from the end of the world.

324
00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:19,129
I have asked around.

325
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:21,329
No news from the Tushan Family.

326
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,290
Miss.

327
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,369
Put out the candle and rest.

328
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:29,170
Once there is news,

329
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:31,050
I will come and inform you.

330
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:35,249
It's midnight?

331
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:36,690
That's right.

332
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,810
It's midnight sharp?

333
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:42,930
That's right.

334
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:49,410
I will wait a bit longer.

335
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,729
Yes.

336
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,650
Miss.

337
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:03,530
Remove my makeup.

338
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,449
Miss.

339
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,136
You...

340
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,329
Waiting

341
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,890
is a bit tiring.

342
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,810
I'm hungry.

343
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,650
You're hungry?

344
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,969
Alright.

345
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:14,209
What would you like to eat?

346
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:15,890
I will ask the chef to make it.

347
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:28,930
Chicken feet.

348
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:30,890
Chicken wings.

349
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:33,249
Duck necks.

350
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,729
Duck feet.

351
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:46,209
I want wisteria flower pancakes now.

352
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:48,144
Okay.

353
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:49,849
I will be right back.

354
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,890
How's the taste?

355
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:34,010
Not as nice as the ones Jing made.

356
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:40,570
I must eat enough

357
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,930
to have the strength to wait.

358
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:49,570

359
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:51,849
I'll wait for you.

00:30:55,369 --> 00:30:56,410
I'll wait for you.

361
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,410
I'll wait for you.

00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,729

(Jing,)

395
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,129
(in this lifetime,)

396
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:23,609
(I waited for my mother
on Xiyan Mountain)

397
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,249
(for six years,)

398
00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:27,410
(but she never came.)

399
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:30,609
(I waited for Cang Xuan and Father)

400
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:32,369
(on Mount Jade)

401
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:34,530
(for seventy years,)

402
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:37,249
(but they never came.)

403
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,050
(I have sworn)

404
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:42,690
(not to wait for anyone)

405
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:44,609
(ever again in this lifetime.)

406
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,329
(Waiting is like putting my heart
on the tip of a knife.)

407
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,170
(I can't be at ease for a moment.)

408
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,810
(This time,)

409
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,570
(I'll wait for you
on Chenrong Mountain.)

410
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,690
(You must come.)

411
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:03,410
(Be it 10 years,)

412
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,249
(20 years,)

413
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:08,169
(100 years or 300 years,)

414
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,010
(I will wait for you.)

415
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,409
(No matter how late you come,)

416
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:14,770
(I'll wait for you.)

417
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,850
Have you checked on Xiaoyao?

418
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:01,090
No.

419
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:08,010
You still can't get over
her wedding ceremony?

420
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,770
It was just a ceremony.

421
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:14,530
Why can't I get over it?

422
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,249
Xiaoyao won't be included

423
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,409
in the genealogy of the Tushan Family.

424
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,689
Everyone thinks that Tushan Jing is dead

425
00:35:24,729 --> 00:35:26,729
and he has nothing to do with Xiaoyao.

426
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:31,370
Have you gotten to the bottom

427
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,050
of Tushan Jing's death?

428
00:35:34,169 --> 00:35:35,810
Tushan Hou colluded with Fangfeng Yiying

429
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,330
and killed Tushan Jing.

430
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,530
Then they turned against each other

431
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,969
and killed each other.

432
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,929
Tushan Jing

433
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,409
was the chief of the Tushan Family.

434
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,810
What about his secret guards?

435
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,330
They were all dead.

436
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:52,489
Tushan Hou

437
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:54,610
was a loser banished by his clan.

438
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:57,090
How could he have had the power

439
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,570
to cultivate

440
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:01,610
such capable assassins
against the Tushan Family?

441
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,610
Perhaps,

442
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:10,330
they were cultivated

443
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:15,249
in secret while Tushan Hou was
in charge of Tushan Family.

444
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:19,344
No.

445
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,770
No.

446
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:23,130
Tushan Jing was merciful,

447
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:24,689
but not foolish.

448
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,330
Since he decided to take out Tushan Hou,

449
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,850
he wouldn't have left him the chance

450
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,010
to seek revenge later.

451
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,850
There was someone

452
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,649
behind Tushan Hou.

453
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:38,570
Throughout Dahuang,

454
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:41,090
very few people were able to confront

455
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:45,130
the Four Great Clans
and dared to assassinate

456
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:47,489
Chief Tushan.

457
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:00,290
What are you trying to say?

458
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,530
Cang Xuan.

459
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,889
Did you do it?

460
00:37:51,684 --> 00:37:55,120
(Medical manuscript)

461
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:30,489
I'll find you the master
of wood attribute

462
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:32,130
to make these manuscripts

463
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:34,130
waterproof, fireproof,

464
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:35,530
and insect proof.

465
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,770
I've been

466
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,810
pondering over what happened

467
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,850
in Qingshui Town.

468
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:49,889
I just can't figure out

469
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:54,889
what exactly went wrong.

470
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,810
It's not your fault.

471
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,249
Then whose fault is it?

472
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,050
Xuan.

473
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,969
I haven't drunk in a long time.

474
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,689
Have a drink with me.

475
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,392
Okay.

476
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,969
This is mulberry wine from Zhaoyun Peak.

477
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,729
His Majesty has been

478
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,090
reserving it for you, Miss.

479
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,850
It just doesn't taste

480
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,370
as good as the wine we stole
when we were little.

481
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:53,090
Something is missing.

482
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,449
What is it?

483
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,889
Your mother's scoldings

484
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:02,449
and my mother's
aggravation of the situation.

485
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:07,169
I bet your mother wouldn't imagine

486
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,169
that her well-behaved son

487
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:10,929
turned out to be a drinker.

488
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,449
I bet Auntie knew that

489
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:13,929
you would become a drunkard.

490
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,770
I know you've always
looked down on Jing,

491
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,449
thinking he's short-sighted,

492
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,649
indecisive,

493
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,449
and much inferior to Fenglong.

494
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:37,169
I saw with my own eyes

495
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:39,130
that he made you vomit blood

496
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:41,050
because of Fangfeng Yiying.

497
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:43,969
Jing has done something wrong.

498
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:46,770
But I have, as well.

499
00:40:49,689 --> 00:40:50,850
I could have

500
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,090
handled this matter well with him.

501
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,729
But I did nothing

502
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,810
and stood there

503
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:00,010
watching.

504
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,130
I didn't know

505
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,770
that it takes
only one person to be in love,

506
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:09,010
but it takes two people

507
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:11,889
to build a shared future.

508
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:15,090
Build a shared future?

509
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,850
Tushan Jing couldn't even
cancel the marriage

510
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,130
with Fangfeng Yiying.

511
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,850
How are you going to build a future?

512
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,010
You only saw that I saved Jing

513
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,169
and he clung to me.

514
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,290
But in fact,

515
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,729
it was Jing who saved me.

516
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:36,729
When I saved Jing,

517
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,729
it was just a whimsical act.

518
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:43,649
I didn't care if he could survive.

519
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:47,090
But I saw his wounds,

520
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,810
and they reminded me

521
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,489
of my past self from years ago.

522
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:54,330
I was deceived,

523
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,570
imprisoned,

524
00:41:59,169 --> 00:42:00,169
tortured,

525
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:01,290
humiliated,

526
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,409
and even slaughtered.

527
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:06,969
At that moment,

528
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:09,850
a strong desire grew in me.

529
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:13,290
I wanted to make

530
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,409
this humiliated man survive.

531
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,130
It's like

532
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:20,610
as long as he overcame
all the difficulties

533
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,249
and the pain,

534
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,130
and lived on well,

535
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,610
then I could hope

536
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,729
to be cured.

537
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:35,010
Xiaoyao.

538
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,929
Tushan Jing was nothing like you.

539
00:42:39,649 --> 00:42:40,290
Xuan.

540
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,770
When you saw me at Qingshui Town,

541
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,770
you thought I was healthy and fine.

542
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:52,449
But I was

543
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,249
seriously ill here.

544
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,409
I may have

545
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,090
escaped from the cage

546
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,010
of the nine-tailed fox,

547
00:43:09,249 --> 00:43:10,130
but my heart

548
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,489
remained locked up

549
00:43:14,889 --> 00:43:17,290
in that dark and cold cage
for hundreds of years.

550
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,249
It's all my fault.

551
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,689
I should have picked you up
from Mount Jade.

552
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:30,330
I've been through such hardship.

553
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,689
So I know how it feels too well.

554
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,850
It's easy to be extreme,

555
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,409
cold-hearted, cunning, and paranoid.

556
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,169
But it's very hard to be warm,

557
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,050
kind, resolute, and trusting.

558
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:49,249
But Jing did it.

559
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,290
He is exactly the opposite of me,

560
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:54,689
His body couldn't be
restored to perfection.

561
00:43:54,689 --> 00:43:55,610
But his heart

562
00:43:57,649 --> 00:43:59,489
remained warm and steadfast,

563
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:02,209
as if he had never

564
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:03,729
been imprisoned in a cage.

565
00:44:05,169 --> 00:44:05,729
Xuan.

566
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:07,610
Do you know?

567
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,370
It was Jing who carried my heart

568
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,969
out of that cage step by step.

569
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,409
He taught me to believe

570
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,169
and to give.

571
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,370
He filled me with hope

572
00:44:22,689 --> 00:44:24,050
so that I could live on

573
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,850
with warmth and love.

574
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:29,610
Xuan.

575
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:32,770
You asked me

576
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,610
if Jing was very important.

577
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:38,850
Yes.

578
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:42,209
He is very important.

579
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,570
To me,

580
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,370
he is very important.

581
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,330
I will keep looking for him.

582
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:02,050
I will never give up no matter what.

583
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:05,489
Aren't you waiting for him?

584
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:07,770
I'll wait with you.

585
00:45:08,729 --> 00:45:09,649
I'll wait with you

586
00:45:09,649 --> 00:45:10,610
no matter how long it takes.

587
00:45:12,689 --> 00:45:13,290
Okay?

588
00:45:43,249 --> 00:45:44,050
Xiaoyao.

589
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:48,770
What's wrong?

590
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:50,929
These days,

591
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:54,330
I have been pondering over

592
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,929
what happened in Qingshui Town.

593
00:45:57,209 --> 00:45:59,090
I don't know what I did wrong.

594
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:02,929
But there is one thing

595
00:46:04,889 --> 00:46:07,090
I just can't figure out.

596
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,409
Tushan Hou might be a vicious tiger.

597
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,130
But Jing removed

598
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:20,449
all his claws and fangs,

599
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:21,810
rendering him powerless.

600
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,130
Where did those faceless assassins
with formidable

601
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,530
spirit power come from?

602
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,290
In Dahuang,

603
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,530
very few people

604
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:35,169
had such formidable spirit power
and dared to kill

605
00:46:35,169 --> 00:46:36,530
Chief Tushan.

606
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,810
Xiaoyao, you are right.

607
00:46:40,689 --> 00:46:42,169
I'll get to the bottom of it.

608
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:47,729
Even I have doubts.

609
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:51,489
Haven't you thought about it?

610
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,209
It was my negligence.

611
00:46:58,610 --> 00:46:59,889
Haven't you said

612
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,370
that I don't like Tushan Jing?

613
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:03,770
Was it you

614
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,610
who helped Tushan Hou

615
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:08,770
set up Jing and killed him?

616
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:13,249
Cang Xuan.

617
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,489
Tell me.

618
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:19,969
Was it you?

619
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:25,929
Cang Xuan.

620
00:47:28,689 --> 00:47:30,649
You are my closest kin.

621
00:47:32,689 --> 00:47:33,850
Answer me.

622
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,850
I want you to tell me.

623
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,249
Was it you?

624
00:47:43,409 --> 00:47:44,649
Don't lie to me.

625
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:47,770
You can't lie to me.

626
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:53,850
Speak.

627
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:56,290
It was me.

628
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,929
I killed Tushan Jing.

629
00:48:03,689 --> 00:48:05,330
Why?

630
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,850
Why?

631
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,330
I didn't want you to marry him.

632
00:48:09,409 --> 00:48:10,330
He was not worthy.

633
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,449
Because of me?

634
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:23,169
You killed Jing because of me?

635
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:25,969
Xiaoyao.

636
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:28,209
When grandmother died,

637
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,489
what did you promise her?

638
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,530
Tell me!

639
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:39,370
I promised that...

640
00:48:41,889 --> 00:48:42,409
I promised...

641
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:43,929
Why?

642
00:48:45,649 --> 00:48:47,889
Why?

643
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:50,929
I tried my best to help you.

644
00:48:51,249 --> 00:48:54,290
I fought for everything you wanted!

645
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,689
I got you everything!

646
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,689
All I want is Tushan Jing.

647
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:03,770
I only want Tushan Jing.

648
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:06,130
Why did you take him away from me?

649
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:09,409
What did I do wrong?

650
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:10,610
You did nothing wrong.

651
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,010
What did I do wrong?

652
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,090
It's not your fault.

653
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,352
I killed Tushan Jing.

654
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,449
It's not your fault.

655
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:17,104
