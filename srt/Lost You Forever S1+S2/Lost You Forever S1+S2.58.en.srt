00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:32,912
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:34,905
Speak.

4
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:37,345
It was me.

5
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:40,985
I killed Tushan Jing.

6
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:46,386
Why?

7
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:48,905
Why?

8
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:50,386
I didn't want you to marry him.

9
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:51,386
He was not worthy.

10
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:58,506
Because of me?

11
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:04,225
You killed Jing because of me?

12
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:07,026
Xiaoyao.

13
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:09,266
When grandmother died,

14
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:11,546
what did you promise her?

15
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,585
Tell me!

16
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:20,425
I promised that...

17
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:23,466
I promised...

18
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:24,986
Why?

19
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:28,945
Why?

20
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:31,986
I tried my best to help you.

21
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:35,346
I fought for everything you wanted!

22
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,746
I got you everything!

23
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:40,746
All I want is Tushan Jing.

24
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:44,826
I only want Tushan Jing.

25
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:47,186
Why did you take him away from me?

26
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:50,466
What did I do wrong?

27
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:51,665
You did nothing wrong.

28
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:53,065
What did I do wrong?

29
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:54,145
It's not your fault.

30
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:55,665
I killed Tushan Jing.

31
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:56,505
It's not your fault.

32
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:58,145
Why?

33
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:26,585
You want to kill me for him?

34
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:29,026
He was my husband.

35
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:37,466
I am your brother.

36
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,266
I don't have a brother like you.

37
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:40,705
Why didn't you dodge?

38
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:44,105
You think you're the lord of Dahuang,

39
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,705
so I won't kill you?

40
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:53,825
Say something!

41
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,705
We shouldn't end up like this.

42
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:05,626
What exactly went wrong?

43
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:09,506
What's wrong

44
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,626
with me liking you?

45
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:20,865
What's wrong
with me wanting to marry you?

46
00:06:23,906 --> 00:06:28,825
What's wrong with me wanting
to be with you forever?

47
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,385
You don't believe it, right?

48
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:54,425
I find it ridiculous too.

49
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:01,305
I allowed you to date another man.

50
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:04,705
I agreed to you marrying another man.

51
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,906
Not only did I agree with a smile,

52
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:11,705
but I also offered the dowry personally.

53
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:15,226
I agreed once

54
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,226
and even agreed again.

55
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:21,105
You wouldn't believe it.

56
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:24,666
The whole world wouldn't believe it.

57
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:25,425
Shut up.

58
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:26,346
Shut up.

59
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,425
Stop talking nonsense!

60
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:30,385
Ever since the day
my mother committed suicide,

61
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:32,705
I have chosen this path!

62
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:35,536
I took advantage of you.

63
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:37,825
I took advantage of myself.

64
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,825
I married one woman after another.

65
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:44,666
Every time I married,

66
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:48,425
I didn't allow you
to say congratulations,

67
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,825
and give me wedding gifts as well.

68
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:53,265
Do you know why?

69
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:57,666
I naively believed

70
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:00,145
that as long as you
didn't congratulate me,

71
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:01,946
I didn't receive

72
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:03,906
your approval.

73
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:06,226
Without your approval,

74
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:08,666
all my marriage wasn't valid.

75
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,626
Stop it.

76
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,226
Believe it or not, I will kill you!

77
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:12,786
If we can't be together
when being alive,

78
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:15,186
let's die together.

79
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,385
You...

80
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:43,760
You...

81
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:45,488
You...

82
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:08,546
Your Majesty.

83
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:09,906
Your Majesty.

84
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,466
Don't pull me.

85
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:17,625
Let go of me.

86
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:19,466
Take His Majesty away.

87
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:20,666
No.

88
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,306
I won't go.

89
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:23,546
I won't go.

90
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:24,745
You know too.

91
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:25,945
I won't go.

92
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,346
You know too.

93
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,585
You all know.

94
00:09:31,346 --> 00:09:33,065
You all know.

95
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,346
Why?

96
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:36,585
Why?

97
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:37,786
Why?

98
00:09:38,106 --> 00:09:39,106
Step back!

99
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:41,106
Whoever harms Xiaoyao,

100
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:43,265
I will kill them!

101
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:44,505
Cang Xuan!

102
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,625
Why are you still here?

103
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:51,786
Are you trying to kill us all?

104
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:54,185
Leave.

105
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:36,306
Xiaoyao,

106
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:39,745
Cang Xuan made a grave mistake

107
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:41,625
in a moment of misjudgment.

108
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:45,026
Don't repeat his mistake.

109
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:51,505
You two are the closest to me,

110
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:52,745
and I trust you two the most.

111
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,385
But one of you killed my husband,

112
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,185
and the other helped him hide the truth.

113
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:04,906
What did I do wrong?

114
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,625
Why did you treat me this way?

115
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:16,666
The dead cannot be brought back to life.

116
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:20,346
Even if you kill Cang Xuan,

117
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,666
Jing won't come back to life.

118
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:27,226
Other than causing
great chaos in Dahuang

119
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:28,866
and plunging it into war again,

120
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:31,185
what else can you get?

121
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,026
I hope you can think about

122
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,745
who you are.

123
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:38,666
Your mother

124
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:41,306
was Xiling Heng,

125
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:42,986
who died for the people of Xiyan.

126
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,426
Your biological father

127
00:12:44,705 --> 00:12:45,666
was Chi Chen,

128
00:12:45,786 --> 00:12:48,786
who would rather die
than give up Chenrong.

129
00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:51,786
Your foster father
was the King of Haoling,

130
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:55,265
who resolutely gave up his power
for his people.

131
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,385
If you cause the collapse of the kingdom

132
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,185
and make the people homeless

133
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,505
for your own sake,

134
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:02,705
you won't be worthy
of being their daughter.

135
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:13,426
Have the guards

136
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:15,385
keep a close watch on her.

137
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:17,106
She must not leave

138
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:18,945
this room.

139
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:22,666
The nine-tailed fox demon
imprisoned me for 30 years.

140
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:24,745
I want to see

141
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,306
how long you intend to imprison me.

142
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:30,786
I was able to escape once,

143
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,065
and I can escape a second time.

144
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,185
If you want to stop me
from taking revenge,

145
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:40,026
you'd better kill me now.

146
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,466
(We shouldn't end up like this.)

147
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:36,065
(What exactly went wrong?)

148
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,265
(What's wrong)

149
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:40,065
(with me liking you?)

150
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:44,145
(What's wrong
with me wanting to marry you?)

151
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:50,145
(What's wrong with me wanting
to be with you forever?)

152
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,625
It is my fault.

153
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,866
It's my fault.

154
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:24,825
My fault.

155
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:31,866
My fault.

156
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,026
Your Majesty,

157
00:16:26,306 --> 00:16:27,306
your wound has burst open.

158
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:28,226
I'll go get Yin.

159
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:33,625
Your Majesty,

160
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:34,585
where are you going?

161
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:36,185
I'm going to see Xiaoyao.

162
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:38,185
Your Majesty.

163
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,265
Move away.

164
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:45,306
Never.

165
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:48,625
Your Majesty.

166
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:49,825
Xiaoxiao.

167
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:51,585
- Move away.
- Xiaoxiao.

168
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:53,185
Let me go!

169
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:54,346
Never.

170
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:57,226
My fault for not stopping you
from going to a dangerous place

171
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,306
like the Xiaoyue Peak.

172
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,026
Please grant me death.

173
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,825
When did the Xiaoyue Peak

174
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:05,826
become a dangerous place?

175
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:08,306
Your Majesty.

176
00:17:08,385 --> 00:17:09,546
The Miss Xiling is in a temper.

177
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:10,225
It's too dangerous.

178
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:10,985
You can't go.

179
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:12,505
You really can't go.

180
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:19,745
Xiaoyao.

181
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,865
Dangerous place.

182
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,345
Miss,

183
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:56,505
the Great Emperor

184
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:58,546
ordered me to prepare
these clothes for you.

185
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,865
This is the wine you want.

186
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:09,392
The Great Emperor said
you can only have this much.

187
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:22,265
This is the iced mulberry
personally made by His Majesty.

188
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:24,105
His Majesty commanded me to give you.

189
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,946
Where is Cang Xuan?

190
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,426
Is he too ashamed to see me

191
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:33,066
or too afraid to see me?

192
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,906
The Great Emperor forbids
His Majesty from coming here.

193
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:39,465
Miss.

194
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:49,946
I'll take my leave.

195
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,946
Thank you for your key.

196
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:33,345
Whether you get a key or not,

197
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:35,946
Grandfather could never trap you.

198
00:23:36,826 --> 00:23:38,666
I've been locked up so often,
and it scares me,

199
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:41,225
so I always carry poison with me

200
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,345
in case I encounter any danger.

201
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:47,786
I don't want to worry
you and Grandfather.

202
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:50,745
I didn't expect...

203
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:53,345
You didn't expect that one day,

204
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,946
you would use it on me and Grandfather.

205
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:00,865
Want to swing?

206
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:02,906
Sure.

207
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:13,345
(Cang Xuan, swing higher.)

208
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:14,666
(Higher.)

209
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,216
(Alright.)

210
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,026
When I was little...

211
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:30,345
Cang Xuan practiced martial arts
in the early morning

212
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:33,345
and would pick
Poinciana flowers with dew

213
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:38,385
for me at the moment of sunrise,

214
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,706
just because I once told him

215
00:24:41,946 --> 00:24:44,465
the nectar at sunrise was sweet

216
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:48,345
and even the dewdrops
in the pistils were sweet.

217
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:55,145
My mother left me to go to war

218
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:56,985
and never returned.

219
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:01,186
My father made me wait
in Mount Jade for 70 years.

220
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:04,906
The nine-tailed fox

221
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:07,985
imprisoned me in a cage for 30 years.

222
00:25:08,745 --> 00:25:10,546
But no matter how hard it was,

223
00:25:11,186 --> 00:25:12,586
as long as I thought of Cang Xuan

224
00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:15,625
on the Zhaoyun Peak,

225
00:25:18,186 --> 00:25:21,426
it brought a sweet and warm feeling

226
00:25:22,706 --> 00:25:24,586
to me.

227
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:30,745
When I was happy,

228
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:33,985
I could laugh together with him.

229
00:25:35,906 --> 00:25:36,865
When I was tired,

230
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,666
I could let him carry me.

231
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,546
When I was angry,

232
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:45,306
I could let him comfort me.

233
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:47,786
In times of danger,

234
00:25:49,026 --> 00:25:51,666
I could entrust everything to him.

235
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,985
People like me

236
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:58,666
hardly trust anyone,

237
00:26:00,345 --> 00:26:03,145
not even trust their own parents.

238
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:06,666
But I only trusted him.

239
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:15,786
You not only killed Jing,

240
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:23,786
but also killed Cang Xuan.

241
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:42,786
I thought

242
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:45,786
when you became an old man

243
00:26:46,745 --> 00:26:48,426
and I became an old woman,

244
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:51,546
we would still be here

245
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:53,345
picking Poinciana flowers

246
00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:54,946
and swinging.

247
00:26:57,026 --> 00:26:58,225
But I didn't expect

248
00:26:59,706 --> 00:27:01,826
this would be the last time.

249
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:10,865
How innocent Jing was.

250
00:27:12,385 --> 00:27:13,546
He should not have died.

251
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,465
Since you have killed Jing,

252
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:22,745
I'm going to kill you.

253
00:27:31,145 --> 00:27:31,745
Okay.

254
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:42,946
I have poisoned

255
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:45,105
all these Poinciana flowers.

256
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:50,985
Are they sweet?

257
00:27:55,145 --> 00:27:55,826
Very sweet.

258
00:27:58,586 --> 00:27:59,865
After I kill you,

259
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:03,265
I will die with you.

260
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,186
That's good.

261
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:14,026
I won't feel at ease leaving you alone.

262
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:17,745
The families hating Chi Chen,

263
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,865
the women in the Zijin Palace

264
00:28:22,586 --> 00:28:24,505
and loyal officials like Yu Jiang.

265
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:30,306
I won't feel at ease leaving you behind

266
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,865
to deal with them alone.

267
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,385
It's best to keep you

268
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:38,145
by my side.

269
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:04,345
(Cang Xuan.)

270
00:29:04,586 --> 00:29:05,906
(Look what I picked.)

271
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:09,706
The Poinciana flower
I picked is so sweet.

272
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:10,946

302
00:31:24,145 --> 00:31:24,786
Xiaoyao,

303
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:29,666
you've been exposed to poison
all year round.

304
00:31:30,745 --> 00:31:32,145
So you should have
a resistance to poison.

305
00:31:33,465 --> 00:31:35,465
Why did your poison
take effect sooner than mine?

306
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,666
You shouldn't have come.

307
00:31:42,946 --> 00:31:45,265
Although I poisoned them,

308
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:49,985
I didn't want you to come.

309
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:56,105
If I didn't come, would you

310
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:58,985
die alone here?

311
00:32:02,946 --> 00:32:04,625
You want me to see

312
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:06,306
what exactly I did wrong.

313
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:08,865
Xiaoyao,

314
00:32:11,745 --> 00:32:12,745
you are really cruel.

315
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:18,786
My grandfather

316
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:22,546
is the founding emperor of Xiyan.

317
00:32:24,306 --> 00:32:25,865
My biological father

318
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:29,426
was a demon feared across Dahuang.

319
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:31,745
My brother

320
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:34,586
is the lord of Dahuang.

321
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:38,105
You are all ruthless,

322
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:41,345
and you still expect me to be kind?

323
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:43,306
That's true.

324
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:48,706
Wolves can't nurture

325
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,985
a rabbit.

326
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:14,105
Xiaoyao,

327
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:19,586
if Tushan Jing killed me,

328
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:23,706
would you do this to him

329
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,225
for me?

330
00:33:28,145 --> 00:33:29,906
He was not like you.

331
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:34,066
He wouldn't hurt you

332
00:33:35,426 --> 00:33:36,706
because he knew

333
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,026
what you meant to me.

334
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:45,345
He would rather suffer himself

335
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:49,706
than let me be in misery.

336
00:33:55,345 --> 00:33:56,105
I'm sorry.

337
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,066
I never have

338
00:34:06,306 --> 00:34:07,546
regrets

339
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:10,786
about what I do.

340
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:17,546
But this time, I was wrong.

341
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,346
Not because I killed Jing,

342
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:22,705
but because I was wrong from the start.

343
00:34:26,786 --> 00:34:29,225
I shouldn't have used you like a pawn.

344
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,626
I shouldn't have pushed you toward Jing

345
00:34:31,626 --> 00:34:33,346
in order to gain the help
of the Tushan Family

346
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:39,465
and the Chishui Family.

347
00:34:47,225 --> 00:34:47,945
Xuan.

348
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:50,985
Xuan.

349
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:54,505
Don't cry, Xuan.

350
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,106
I have already forgiven you.

351
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:10,985
Xiaoyao,

352
00:35:14,665 --> 00:35:16,665
if everything could start over,

353
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:20,945
just when you returned
to Wushen Mountain,

354
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:23,985
I would've watched over you closely.

355
00:35:25,346 --> 00:35:27,786
I would never have given Tushan Jing
a chance to get close to you.

356
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:32,465
Would you choose me?

357
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:04,265
Xiaoyao.

358
00:36:06,225 --> 00:36:08,026
The flowers you gave me
were not poisoned.

359
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:16,146
Fool.

360
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:19,265
I gave you a numbing drug.

361
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:24,026
Because I promised my grandma

362
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,546
and my mother

363
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:30,985
that I would protect

364
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:36,665
you.

365
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:50,146
Xiaoyao.

366
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:54,225
Xiaoyao.

367
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,225
Xiaoyao.

368
