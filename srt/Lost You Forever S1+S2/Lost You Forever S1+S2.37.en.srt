=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,575
=Episode 37=

3
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:38,428
You can't reach, right?

4
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:40,067
Give it to me.

5
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:42,788
Xuan,

6
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:45,627
I just have something to say to you.

7
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:51,428
You must be

8
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:52,947
hiding evil intentions.

9
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:58,587
Xuan,

10
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:00,347
my injury has healed.

11
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:02,148
I want to go to the Xiyan Mountain

12
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:03,387
to see my grandfather.

13
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:05,828
If you're worried,

14
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:07,867
Nian will accompany me.

15
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:11,427
Are you going to plead with him

16
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:12,468
for my sake?

17
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:14,787
That's partly true.

18
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,348
I'll go see Grandfather

19
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:17,908
and say a few words by the way.

20
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:19,787
We can't let your uncles

21
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:20,667
say everything,

22
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,867
and we don't even
have a chance to rebut.

23
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:25,027
I'll go with her,

24
00:02:25,268 --> 00:02:27,427
and we'll try to persuade him
not to revoke your position.

25
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:38,548
I have something to say to you.

26
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:55,548
Xuan,

27
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:58,708
what do you want to say?

28
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:05,667
I'm going to get married.

29
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:11,628
I've already written to Grandfather,

30
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:13,828
asking for his approval.

31
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:17,307
You two don't need to go to Xi...

32
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:22,548
Are you marrying Chenrong Xinyue?

33
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:24,507
No.

34
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:26,947
No?

35
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:31,147
I'm marrying Shen Shuhui.

36
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:34,548
Her family's the strongest
of the six major families

37
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,307
in the Central Plains.

38
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:37,468
Even the Chenrong royal family

39
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:38,708
had to marry them in the past.

40
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,468
The chief of the Shen family...

41
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:50,628
has a very good impression of me,

42
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:54,988
so he's willing
to take a risk to support me.

43
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,147
I don't care what method you use

44
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:11,748
or what you want to do.

45
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:15,307
I just want you to live well.

46
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:24,068
I told you

47
00:04:25,468 --> 00:04:26,628
I'd make Poinciana flowers bloom

48
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,468
all over the Chenrong Mountain.

49
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:33,788
This is my plan

50
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:35,228
for the reconstruction
of the Daming Hall.

51
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:38,468
Please review it, Lord Chenrong
and all the chiefs here.

52
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:44,547
(Zijin Palace, Daming Hall)

53
00:04:44,547 --> 00:04:46,427
Your Highness, your plan

54
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:48,147
is very detailed

55
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,147
with everything taken into account.

56
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,392
(Chief of Shen Clan)

57
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:57,987
The official sent

58
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:59,587
by Grandfather
to take over is almost here.

59
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:01,068
This draft

60
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:02,668
could be shown to him.

61
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:04,867
The envoy from Xiyan has arrived.

62
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:07,628
Xiyan Cang Xuan,
please accept the decree.

63
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:14,867
Xiyan Cang Xuan was careless

64
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,307
and neglected supervision,

65
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:18,668
leading to the collapse
of the Daming Hall.

66
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:21,788
He should have been dismissed
for negligence.

67
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:22,587
However,

68
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:24,628
considering his sincere repentance,

69
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,948
he is specially allowed
to atone for his mistake

70
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:28,468
by rebuilding the Daming Hall.

71
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:30,307
If such negligence happens again,

72
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:32,027
he will be severely punished.

73
00:05:33,027 --> 00:05:34,348
Shen Shuhui from the Shen family

74
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:35,827
is gentle, kind

75
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:37,188
and beautiful.

76
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:39,107
She is specially granted to the prince,

77
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:41,628
Xiyan Cang Xuan, as a secondary wife.

78
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:43,547
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

79
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:46,228
Thank you for your holy grace,
Your Majesty.

80
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:00,307
He made a mistake himself,

81
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:01,508
but without being punished,

82
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:03,267
why is he even granted a marriage?

83
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:06,400
Prince Xiyan Yueliang,
please accept the decree.

84
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:09,427
Xiyan Yueliang

85
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:10,987
acted recklessly.

86
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:12,468
He trespassed the royal tomb,

87
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:13,987
disturbed the sacrifice

88
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:15,508
and disrespected his brother

89
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,147
and his ancestors.

90
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:18,388
He is lacking in virtue.

91
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:20,748
You are ordered to apologize
to the Chenrong family

92
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,788
and the families of the Central Plains

93
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:25,748
and return to Xiyan Town right now.

94
00:06:26,188 --> 00:06:27,668
I obey the decree.

95
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:37,668
I have offended you all.

96
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:39,587
Please

97
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:41,587
forgive me.

98
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:50,427
Lord Chenrong,

99
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:53,948
His Majesty knows
Mr. Fenglong's filial piety,

100
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:55,668
and Prince Cang Xuan also wrote

101
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:57,188
to plead for him.

102
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:58,508
His Majesty said

103
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,307
since the descendants' relationship
is harmonious

104
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:01,547
and grievances have passed,

105
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:03,267
there is no need
to argue right or wrong.

106
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:05,788
So Chenrong Yanzhuan is allowed

107
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:06,788
to enter the royal tomb,

108
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:08,188
enjoy the sacrifice

109
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:09,388
and rank as a famous general.

110
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,628
The matter of building the tomb

111
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:13,508
is handed over to Prince Cang Xuan

112
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:14,827
and Mr. Fenglong

113
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,068
to be jointly responsible.

114
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:17,508
Thank you, Your Majesty.

115
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:18,867
Thank you, Your Majesty.

116
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:21,068
The envoy of Haoling has arrived.

117
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:25,188
By the verbal decree
of the King of Haoling,

118
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:27,587
to express gratitude

119
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:29,867
for Xiyan Cang Xuan's care
for the two princesses,

120
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:31,587
he specially gifts one piece of Jianmu,

121
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:33,468
and 100,000 boxes of Guixu Crystals

122
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,908
to assist Xiyan Cang Xuan

123
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,707
in repairing
the Zijin Palace and the tomb.

124
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:37,908
Thank you, Your Majesty.

125
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:39,748
His Majesty wants you

126
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:41,468
to return to Xiyan Town immediately.

127
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,107
Your Highness, please come back with me.

128
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,587
This time, it was a close call,

129
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:10,987
but we passed safely.

130
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,628
If you marry Miss Shen,

131
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:17,948
it also means

132
00:08:18,068 --> 00:08:19,788
officially declaring war on your uncles.

133
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:24,987
Grandfather is always suspicious
of the families

134
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:26,068
in the Central Plains.

135
00:08:26,628 --> 00:08:28,628
When he used Chenrong Yi back then,

136
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:31,147
he also held the eldest daughter
of the Chishui Clan

137
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:32,227
and his daughter

138
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:33,667
in Xiyan Town.

139
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,307
I know.

140
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:38,188
Although she is not your main wife,

141
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:40,467
she is, after all, the first woman

142
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:41,347
you officially marry.

143
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:43,148
I'm worried

144
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,508
that your uncles
will make a big fuss about this,

145
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:48,028
and the old families of Xiyan

146
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:49,667
will also be dissatisfied.

147
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:52,148
What if Grandfather

148
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:53,708
becomes suspicious of you?

149
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,227
I know,

150
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:57,068
but I have to take this step.

151
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:01,388
I must form an official alliance
with the Shen family.

152
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:03,748
I know.

153
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:05,268
Xiaoyao,

154
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:08,307
don't congratulate me

155
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:12,227
at the wedding.

156
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:20,547
Okay.

157
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,686
(Chenrong Mansion)

158
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:54,107
Greetings, Your Highness.

159
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:55,708
Nian.

160
00:09:58,227 --> 00:09:59,467
Your Highness.

161
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,268
(Xiang Liu,)

162
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:53,307
(why does the poisonous bug
suddenly strike?)

163
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:56,948
Xiaoyao,

164
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:57,987
are you okay?

165
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,148
What's wrong?

166
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:04,467
I'm fine,

167
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:06,547
I'll just go sit over there for a while.

168
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:09,188
Please help her sit over there.

169
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:10,987
My family know some minor healing spells

170
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:12,987
to help relieve the pain.

171
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,588
Thank you, Chief Tushan.

172
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:15,508
Let's go, Xiaoyao.

173
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:16,667
Thanks, Chief Tushan.

174
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:19,667
It's much better now.

175
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,948
The auspicious time has arrived.

176
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:58,816
♪I crossed the mountains and waters,
but I couldn't escape death♪

177
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:03,867
♪I lived through gatherings and parting♪

178
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,307
They say Xinyue likes Xuan.

179
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:07,307
It must be false.

180
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:08,987
If she does,

181
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:10,347
how can she still smile?

182
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:12,708
Xinyue's feelings are real.

183
00:13:13,388 --> 00:13:14,467
But you are heartfelt

184
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:15,828
are pure,

185
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,628
while Xinyue is always

186
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:19,227
considering the situation.

187
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:22,068
Now Cang Xuan is marrying Miss Shen.

188
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:23,907
From a larger perspective,

189
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:25,467

Today is your cousin's wedding day.

228
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,347
You don't go to congratulate him

229
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:58,068
but stand here, sighing.

230
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:01,867
How do you know

231
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:03,508
what I'm thinking?

232
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,748
Other than Tushan Jing,

233
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:07,907
who else could it be?

234
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:08,987
I'm upset.

235
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:11,227
You can feel it?

236
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:13,427
If you're afraid of me feeling it,

237
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:15,828
don't torment yourself.

238
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,107
If your heart doesn't ache,

239
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:21,547
I can feel better.

240
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:23,268
So

241
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:25,148
when I was feeling bad just now,

242
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:27,547
you were feeling so too?

243
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:31,708
That's why you controlled the bug

244
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,467
to make my heart ache.

245
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:36,547
You have nine heads,

246
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:38,867
but you only have one heart.

247
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:40,427
If my body is in pain,

248
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,907
you can only feel

249
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,667
one ninth of the pain,

250
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:45,388
but if my heart is in pain,

251
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:47,427
you'll feel the same pain,

252
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:48,708
won't you?

253
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,148
Yes,

254
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:51,508
I feel just as hurt

255
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:53,667
as you do.

256
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,028
But what about that?

257
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:07,908
Do you want to use this against me?

258
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:14,908
The physical pain

259
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:16,308
can come from stabbing yourself,

260
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:18,467
but the inner emotions,

261
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:20,467
whether happy or sad,

262
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:22,028
cannot be faked

263
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:24,827
or even controlled by yourself.

264
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:28,227
Don't have heartaches anymore.

265
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:29,987
If you give me more trouble,

266
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:31,067
maybe

267
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:33,347
I'll decide to kill you

268
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:35,668
once and for all.

269
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:37,867
I didn't force you

270
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:39,028
to give me the bug back then.

271
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,628
I knew you were useless

272
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:42,388
and would often get hurt,

273
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:46,227
but I didn't expect you
to be too useless

274
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,187
to keep your heart.

275
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:55,827
Did you attend Jing...?

276
00:17:57,707 --> 00:17:59,148
Did you attend Tushan Jing's wedding?

277
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:00,987
Even though I'm a free spirit,

278
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,508
I wouldn't miss
the wedding of my sister

279
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:04,428
and Chief Tushan.

280
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:12,947
Come with me.

281
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:14,428
With you?

282
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:15,987
Anyway, you're not happy here.

283
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:17,987
Why not leave everything behind

284
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:20,268
and follow me to have fun?

285
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:24,628
Are you scared?

286
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:30,428
Why not?

287
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:31,308
Let's go.

288
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,347
You have graced us with your presence.

289
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:45,107
I'm very grateful.

290
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:47,548
(Chief of Fan Clan)

291
00:18:47,548 --> 00:18:49,587
Prince Yuyang is here.

292
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:52,508
How can we not come?

293
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:10,508
Have some more drinks.

294
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,548
Where's Jing?

295
00:19:27,227 --> 00:19:27,788
Where were you?

296
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:28,748
I was looking for you.

297
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:32,067
Where is Xiaoyao?

298
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,628
She went to let off
some steam with Fangfeng Bei.

299
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:37,788
You just watched her

300
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:39,187
be deceived by that playboy

301
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:40,268
and didn't stop her?

302
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:41,908
As a married person,

303
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,827
what right do I have to stop her?

304
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:04,467
Why don't you change your hair back?

305
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,908
The color is dyed with herbs.

306
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:08,467
It's not an illusion.

307
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:10,867
Why did you choose

308
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,028
such a troublesome method?

309
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:14,548
The first time
I impersonated Fangfeng Bei,

310
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:15,668
I was worried,

311
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:16,548
so I dyed it.

312
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:19,388
Afterward, I just got used to it.

I didn't feel any pain.

378
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:47,467
You have nine lives.

379
00:23:47,587 --> 00:23:49,148
You saved me once,

380
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:50,548
and I became like you,

381
00:23:50,668 --> 00:23:52,107
free to go anywhere.

382
00:23:52,227 --> 00:23:53,428
If I die

383
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:54,668
and you save me again,

384
00:23:55,107 --> 00:23:56,668
then do I become like you...?

385
00:23:57,788 --> 00:23:59,148
If you die again,

386
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:00,827
I'll chop you into nine pieces,

387
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:03,668
just enough for one bite per head.

388
00:24:04,587 --> 00:24:05,827
Be gentle.

389
00:24:06,508 --> 00:24:07,748
You've worked hard to save me.

390
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:09,788
What if I really get killed by you?

391
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:11,187
Would you bear it?

00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:18,668

what if you consume

395
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:21,628
too much heart blood?

396
00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:23,067
Would you bear it?

397
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:24,908
Do you want me to prove it to you now?

398
00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:28,028
I know you can afford it.

399
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,227
No matter
how much heart blood you consume,

400
00:24:30,628 --> 00:24:32,107
you can always replenish it, right?

The song of the merfolk.

407
00:24:59,388 --> 00:25:00,148
How do you know?

408
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:03,628
What a lovely sound.

409
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:05,548
Let's move closer and listen.

410
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:07,428
I want to hear what it is.

411
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:09,908
It seems the merfolk are in heat.

412
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,987
That's their courtship song.

413
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:16,428
I'm guessing.

414
00:25:16,707 --> 00:25:17,508
According to rumors,

415
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:19,028
their voice is like heavenly music.

416
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:20,107
In the sea,

417
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,587
with such a wonderful voice,

418
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:22,628
it must be them.

419
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:25,388
Merfolk only sing

420
00:25:25,388 --> 00:25:26,227
when they are courting.

421
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:27,388
It's rare to hear it.

422
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:28,388
You are so lucky

423
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:28,987
to...

424
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:31,347
to encounter them this time.

425
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:36,347
Why are they singing in duets?

426
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:38,268
It means they're together.

427
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:40,788
I can actually hear

428
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:42,067
the love duet of the merfolk.

429
00:25:51,827 --> 00:25:52,308
Let's go.

430
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:54,227
It's not easy to encounter the merfolk.

431
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:55,668
I may not have another chance again.

432
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:56,867
I want to go and see them.

433
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,067
Are you sure?

434
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:16,707
What did you see?

435
00:26:23,308 --> 00:26:24,987
I didn't expect you
to have this kind of foible,

436
00:26:25,187 --> 00:26:26,827
like to spy on couples' private matters.

437
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:27,587
Xiang Liu,

438
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:28,508
it was intentional!

439
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:33,107
Am I a villain now?

440
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,788
This is the poison I prepared for you.

441
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:41,548
It has a strong bouquet

442
00:26:41,987 --> 00:26:43,268
and goes well with seafood.

443
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:51,028
Yuhong grass.

444
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:52,508
It can't be called poison.

445
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,827
It's not very poisonous,

446
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,388
but it tastes good.

447
00:26:57,428 --> 00:26:58,587
You like drinking, don't you?

448
00:26:58,827 --> 00:26:59,987
Put this in wine.

449
00:27:00,148 --> 00:27:01,187
Even if it's bad wine,

450
00:27:01,308 --> 00:27:02,388
it will taste good.

451
00:27:05,788 --> 00:27:07,067
I made it especially for you.

452
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:11,707
Do you remember?

453
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:13,628
This is the second time
I've grilled fish for you.

454
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:15,067
Last time I did it,

455
00:27:15,227 --> 00:27:16,508
I was still Wen Xiaoliu.

456
00:27:18,028 --> 00:27:19,947
At that time,
I felt the world was so big,

457
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:21,987
but I was alone

458
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:23,827
with nowhere to go.

459
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:25,548
But now,

460
00:27:26,107 --> 00:27:27,587
I do have a home

461
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,227
and have someone waiting for me.

462
00:27:30,628 --> 00:27:31,827
But I want

463
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:33,428
to just wander for a lifetime.

464
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:39,987
Just Tushan Jing alone

465
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:41,388
could make you so disheartened.

466
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:48,347
Sometimes I can be a killer.

467
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:51,428
As long as you pay me,

468
00:27:51,788 --> 00:27:53,148
I can help you kill Fangfeng Yiying

469
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:54,508
and her child.

470
00:27:57,628 --> 00:27:59,187
What a bad idea.

471
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:00,908
Do you have any other good ideas?

472
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:05,908
Xiang Liu,

473
00:28:06,508 --> 00:28:07,707
what do you think is over there?

474
00:28:09,508 --> 00:28:10,428
The vast sea.

475
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:13,587
Is there no land?

476
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:17,107
Only scattered islands.

477
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:19,388
What kind of islands are they?

478
00:28:19,987 --> 00:28:21,628
Some islands are barren.

479
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:25,428
Some are as beautiful as a dreamland.

480
00:28:29,347 --> 00:28:30,388
I really want to go to visit.

481
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,548
Go get someone else.

482
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:34,987
I will not accompany you.

483
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:39,467
I don't think about going there for fun

484
00:28:39,748 --> 00:28:41,227
with someone annoying.

485
00:29:00,748 --> 00:29:01,508
Xiang Liu,

486
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:03,508
do you ever feel

487
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:05,908
like these times are borrowed

488
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:08,947
and feel uncertain of tomorrow?

489
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:36,827
You've been

490
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:38,508
working so hard to arrange their wedding

491
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:39,428
these days.

492
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:40,947
The Shen family sent

493
00:29:41,908 --> 00:29:43,508
this generous gift to thank you.

494
00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:51,107
You can go now.

495
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:52,268
Yes.

496
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:54,628
Why bother?

497
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:56,347
You agreed to their marriage

498
00:29:56,347 --> 00:29:57,028
back then.

499
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,028
I did agree,

500
00:29:58,707 --> 00:30:00,467
but I'm upset.

501
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:02,548
You are a descendant
of the Chenrong royal family.

502
00:30:02,908 --> 00:30:03,548
You have no title,

503
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:05,268
but you are a real princess
in the Central Plains.

504
00:30:05,947 --> 00:30:06,748
With our father and me,

505
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:08,347
you can have anything you want.

506
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:09,707
Why should you be miserable

507
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,628
for a man?

508
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:11,508
Forget about Cang Xuan.

509
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:13,308
There are plenty of good men
to choose from.

510
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:14,827
There are many good men,

511
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:17,347
but they're not

512
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:18,668
from the Xiyan family.

513
00:30:18,668 --> 00:30:19,908
It was you who refused to marry him,

514
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,548
and now it's still you
who refuse to let go.

515
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,028
Chenrong Xinyue,

516
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:25,148
why are you being so hard on yourself?

517
00:30:41,947 --> 00:30:42,428
Xuan.

518
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:43,268
Xuan.

519
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:47,268
Sit down for dinner.

520
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:48,028
Okay.

521
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:56,548
Princess.

522
00:30:58,467 --> 00:30:59,587
You don't need to be so formal.

523
00:31:01,107 --> 00:31:02,587
We are all family now.

524
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:03,187
Please, sit.

525
00:31:09,987 --> 00:31:10,467
Nian.

526
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,028
Please don't take offense.

527
00:31:17,347 --> 00:31:18,867
Nian was spoiled by my father.

528
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:20,028
She'll throw a tantrum

529
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:21,107
if the food is not to her taste.

530
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:22,187
I'll go check on her.

531
00:31:27,508 --> 00:31:28,067
It's okay.

532
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,508
Nian's such a girl.

533
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:30,508
It'll pass.

534
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:31,388
Don't mind it.

535
00:31:32,187 --> 00:31:33,107
Sit down and eat.

536
00:32:07,107 --> 00:32:07,867
Nian,

537
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,508
what you did today was inappropriate.

538
00:32:10,947 --> 00:32:12,187
It was disrespectful to Shuhui.

539
00:32:13,268 --> 00:32:14,428
As a princess of Haoling, should I

540
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:15,587
care about saving her face?

541
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:16,707
Is she even worth it?

542
00:32:16,987 --> 00:32:19,148
Shuhui is Cang Xuan's legal wife.

543
00:32:19,308 --> 00:32:20,268
If you don't respect her,

544
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:21,028
others seeing it

545
00:32:21,028 --> 00:32:22,388
will think you are belittling Cang Xuan.

546
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,268
Not only can the Fifth and Seventh Kings

547
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:25,748
of Xiyan give him a hard time,

548
00:32:26,187 --> 00:32:27,227
but even a princess of Haoling

549
00:32:27,227 --> 00:32:28,628
can slap him in the face?

550
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:31,428
You think his situation
isn't difficult enough?

551
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:33,347
Have you ever thought

552
00:32:34,187 --> 00:32:35,628
how much effort he has to put in

553
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,827
to make up for it
every time you lose your temper?

554
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:39,668
I didn't mean that.

555
00:32:39,987 --> 00:32:41,308
I know you didn't mean that,

556
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:42,388
but once you've done it,

557
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:43,628
that's how others see it.

558
00:32:48,987 --> 00:32:49,388
Nian,

559
00:32:50,587 --> 00:32:51,908
in the current situation,

560
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:53,908
we should do everything we can

561
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:55,148
to help Cang Xuan

562
00:32:55,388 --> 00:32:56,827
but not give him trouble.

563
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,268
Respecting Shuhui

564
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:00,347
is respecting him.

565
00:33:00,947 --> 00:33:01,548
I understand.

566
00:33:01,827 --> 00:33:02,467
You really do?

567
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:03,908
Even if I don't understand,

568
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:04,748
you do.

569
00:33:05,187 --> 00:33:06,388
I'll follow you, okay?

570
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:09,788
It's all about being respectful to her,

571
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,268
letting her have her way in everything

572
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:12,467
and giving her face, right?

573
00:33:18,388 --> 00:33:19,268
Xiaoyao,

574
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:21,467
why can Xinyue

575
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:22,628
restrain her temper,

576
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:23,908
but I can't?

577
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:24,947
What can I do

578
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:25,987
to be liked by others

579
00:33:25,987 --> 00:33:26,707
like Xinyue?

580
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:29,308
Nian,

581
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:31,467
I want to ask you again.

582
00:33:31,908 --> 00:33:33,707
Do you still want
to stay with Cang Xuan?

583
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:38,067
If so,

584
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:40,628
then listen to me.

585
00:33:40,908 --> 00:33:42,987
No matter who the woman by his side is,

586
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:44,827
whether it's Xinyue or anyone else,

587
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:46,148
you don't need to care.

588
00:33:46,548 --> 00:33:46,908
What...

589
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:48,227
What if he's enchanted by others

590
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:49,028
and forgets about me?

591
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,347
As long as you're still Nian,

592
00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:51,908
he'll never forget you.

593
00:33:52,788 --> 00:33:54,587
He's always trying to drive you away.

594
00:33:55,107 --> 00:33:56,148
He's not so kind

595
00:33:56,628 --> 00:33:57,508
to other women.

596
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:02,308
Nian,

597
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:03,508
trust me.

598
00:34:04,148 --> 00:34:05,388
You don't need to learn from Xinyue,

599
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,707
and you can't.

600
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:08,907
He already knows

601
00:34:09,187 --> 00:34:10,868
what kind of person you are.

602
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,028
Besides,

603
00:34:13,348 --> 00:34:14,588
he's a man

604
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,907
who was indulgent to you

605
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:17,828
even when he had nothing.

606
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:19,387
So when he has power

607
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:20,748
in the future,

608
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:22,108
he will still indulge you too.

609
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:24,707
The only thing you need to do

610
00:34:24,707 --> 00:34:26,348
is to control your temper

611
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:28,028
and not vent your anger

612
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:29,588
at his women.

613
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:31,508
As for the rest,

614
00:34:32,348 --> 00:34:33,707
leave it to me and Father.

615
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:39,227
Xiaoyao,

616
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:43,548
am I very stupid?

617
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:46,667
You guys always have to worry about me.

618
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,427
Being too smart is not a good thing.

619
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:51,868
Dullness can bring luck.

620
00:34:53,748 --> 00:34:55,187
So, for the sake of good luck,

621
00:34:55,508 --> 00:34:57,308
should I continue to be dull?

622
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,108
Yes,

623
00:34:59,828 --> 00:35:00,788
keep being dull.

624
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,348
I hope

625
00:35:03,588 --> 00:35:05,707
you can be the luckiest girl
in the world.

626
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:33,308
I know I was wrong,

627
00:35:33,627 --> 00:35:34,508
I'm here to apologize.

628
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,028
I hope Your Highness can forgive me.

629
00:35:39,828 --> 00:35:40,508
Xuan.

630
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:45,467
Okay.

631
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:47,548
If you don't want to talk to me,

632
00:35:47,907 --> 00:35:49,108
then I won't bother you.

633
00:35:50,028 --> 00:35:50,707
I'm leaving.

634
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:04,508
Come back.

635
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,348
Sang has opened a new jar
of mulberry wine.

636
00:36:13,508 --> 00:36:14,068
Yes.

637
00:36:14,187 --> 00:36:15,068
The wine you brewed.

638
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:16,788
Today, I won't return until I'm drunk.

639
00:36:23,227 --> 00:36:24,387
I know

640
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:26,828
why you're angry with me.

641
00:36:27,947 --> 00:36:29,028
Because I sneaked away

642
00:36:29,028 --> 00:36:30,108
from your wedding.

643
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:33,427
I just didn't want
to see you forcing a smile.

644
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:36,427
And Tushan Jing.

645
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:38,748
I didn't want to see him.

646
00:36:39,748 --> 00:36:41,907
Especially at a wedding.

647
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:49,187
You still can't forget him.

648
00:36:49,427 --> 00:36:50,308
I thought

649
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,068
everything was under my control.

650
00:36:53,987 --> 00:36:55,268
But I didn't expect

651
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:57,828
that human emotions

652
00:36:59,348 --> 00:37:01,308
can't be controlled at all.

653
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:06,187
Well said,

654
00:37:08,108 --> 00:37:09,788
one can't control one's feelings.

655
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,068
You treated Tushan Jing differently,

656
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:17,907
but he let you down.

657
00:37:20,387 --> 00:37:22,868
He will definitely
regret it in the future.

658
00:37:23,987 --> 00:37:25,667
What's the use of his regret?

659
00:37:28,348 --> 00:37:29,987
Since we can't be together,

660
00:37:30,947 --> 00:37:32,947
it's better to forget
each other completely.

661
00:37:34,147 --> 00:37:35,467
Let's just act as strangers.

662
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:48,748
You're the best.

663
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:55,987
You're the most reliable,

664
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:58,028
and you will never abandon me.

665
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:01,387
Rest assured.

666
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:04,707
No matter what happens in the future,

667
00:38:06,508 --> 00:38:09,348
I will always stay by your side.

668
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:43,113
(Tushan Mansion)

669
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:46,508
I never thought that in my lifetime,

670
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,508
I could see my great-grandson.

671
00:38:49,508 --> 00:38:52,108
I can die without regrets.

672
00:39:01,387 --> 00:39:02,227
Look,

673
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:04,548
who does he look like?

674
00:39:04,788 --> 00:39:07,667
Besides Jing,
who else could he look like?

675
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,828
(Lan Mei)

676
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:12,707
I think he looks more
like the former master.

677
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:20,868
Right, he looks more
like Jing's grandfather.

678
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:24,068
Grandmother,

679
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:26,028
this is your first great-grandson.

680
00:39:26,348 --> 00:39:27,028
What do you think

681
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:28,788
would be a good name for him?

682
00:39:29,227 --> 00:39:31,987
Let's call him "Tian".

683
00:39:41,308 --> 00:39:42,707
Thank you for the name, Grandma.

684
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,467
People say

685
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,868
the greatest happiness for the elderly

686
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:50,987
is to have grandchildren around

687
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:53,068
and a prosperous family.

688
00:39:53,868 --> 00:39:55,828
You are all so filial,

689
00:39:56,308 --> 00:39:58,348
and I have a great-grandson.

690
00:39:58,748 --> 00:39:59,748
It is

691
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:01,667
the happiest...

692
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:11,828
Grandmother.

693
00:40:13,548 --> 00:40:14,387
Grand Madam.

694
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:16,068
Grand Madam.

695
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:17,308
She passed away.

696
00:41:16,828 --> 00:41:17,508
Jing,

697
00:41:18,147 --> 00:41:19,387
have some tea.

698
00:41:25,268 --> 00:41:27,868
I have something
to say to you privately.

699
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:34,268
Lan Mei,

700
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:37,147
bring me a cup of tea too.

701
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,748
I'm going right now.

702
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:11,788
Where are you going

703
00:42:13,068 --> 00:42:14,467
in the middle of the night?

704
00:42:14,707 --> 00:42:16,748
Aren't you keeping vigil for Grandma?

705
00:42:17,387 --> 00:42:17,707
I...

706
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:19,667
I was just about to see you.

707
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:22,508
Really?

708
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:36,907
Princess,

709
00:42:37,907 --> 00:42:39,187
the Grand Madam of the Tushan Family

710
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:41,068
passed away a few days ago.

711
00:42:41,868 --> 00:42:42,828
All their shops

712
00:42:42,828 --> 00:42:44,227
in Dahuang

713
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:46,108
have hung mourning couplets for her

714
00:42:46,387 --> 00:42:47,508
and will be mourning for a month.

715
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,748
It is said that this is the first time
in tens of thousands of years

716
00:42:52,227 --> 00:42:54,387
that their family
has held such a grand funeral

717
00:42:54,387 --> 00:42:55,987
for a woman who is not their chief.

718
00:42:56,868 --> 00:42:58,187
Prepare a condolence gift

719
00:42:58,187 --> 00:42:59,427
and a pair of mourning couplets

720
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:00,627
to express

721
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:02,028
our condolences.

722
00:43:03,268 --> 00:43:04,187
Yes.

723
00:43:06,028 --> 00:43:07,068
And...

724
00:43:10,348 --> 00:43:11,548
Is there anything else?

725
00:43:12,868 --> 00:43:14,947
On the day of the Grand Madam's death,

726
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,467
the wife of Chief Tushan

727
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:21,987
gave birth to a boy.

728
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,828
Chief Tushan has a new son

729
00:43:33,748 --> 00:43:35,788
as their future chief.

730
00:43:36,387 --> 00:43:38,068
We should send a gift
to celebrate it too.

731
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:39,548
You handle

732
00:43:40,227 --> 00:43:41,308
these two matters together.

733
00:43:43,907 --> 00:43:44,348
Yes.

734
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:58,387
(This road is winding and twisting,)

735
00:43:58,987 --> 00:44:00,667
(long as if it has no end,)

736
00:44:02,187 --> 00:44:03,308
(just like life itself.)

737
00:44:05,028 --> 00:44:06,707
(As a deity,)

738
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:08,868
(I am still very young.)

739
00:44:10,828 --> 00:44:12,748
(But I always feel like)

740
00:44:13,147 --> 00:44:15,028
(I'm already someone
nearing the end of her life.)

741
00:44:49,427 --> 00:44:52,707
Xiaoyao!

742
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:57,147
I don't want to be Tushan Jing anymore.

743
00:44:57,788 --> 00:44:58,868
Whether I can be with you

744
00:44:58,868 --> 00:45:00,427
openly and honorably is not important.

745
00:45:00,987 --> 00:45:03,108
Even if I don't get
recognition for a lifetime,

746
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,907
even if I'm your servant for a lifetime,

747
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:07,427
it doesn't matter.
