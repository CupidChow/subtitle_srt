=Lost You Forever S2=

2
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,880
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:41,616
Father.

4
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:46,314
Did you find out anything
on your venture this time?

5
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:47,754
Nothing special.

6
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:51,114
Xiyan Cang Xuan
has just secured the throne.

7
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:52,994
Even if they want to attack us,

8
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:54,793
it still requires time.

9
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:58,714
What's the difference
if it's sooner or later?

10
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,114
When I was young,

11
00:02:02,593 --> 00:02:04,034
the Chenrong Kingdom was powerful.

12
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:09,034
At that time, the King of Chenrong
coveted Wushen Mountain.

13
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:12,034
He sent troops to attack Haoling.

14
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,713
The old King of Haoling was feeble.

15
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:18,633
(Qingshui Town)
Chenrong's army was unstoppable

16
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:19,633
and surrounded the city.

17
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:23,153
The current King of Haoling
took charge amidst the crisis

18
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:24,194
and he halted the Chenrong army

19
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:26,954
by himself,
his white robe stained with blood.

20
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:30,834
I didn't expect

21
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,593
(Qingshui Town)

22
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:33,674
someone like him

23
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:36,394
would surrender without a fight.

24
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:38,433
Tell me.

25
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:41,194
Does our perseverance make sense?

26
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:53,274
No matter the obstacles,

27
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:55,793
I shall go forth.

28
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:08,394
What's the matter?

29
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:10,793
What's eating you?

30
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:13,674
Other than our esteemed queen,

31
00:03:13,674 --> 00:03:14,633
who would offend me?

32
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,954
She pointed at my nose
and told me to scram.

33
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:18,153
I had no choice but to come back.

34
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:20,274
Such a terrible temper.

35
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:21,993
I wonder how it was developed.

36
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:26,233
It was on me.

37
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:29,993
Back then, for the people,

38
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:33,034
I agreed to manage the Central Plains
under the Great Emperor.

39
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:36,114
He feared I would rebel,

40
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,593
so he kept your mother and Xinyue

41
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,674
in Xiyan Town as hostages.

42
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,873
Xinyue lived in fear every day,

43
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:45,114
so she became a narrow-minded girl

44
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:47,233
who coveted power.

45
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:49,954
As her father,

46
00:03:50,073 --> 00:03:51,353
I never provided her with security.

47
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,433
She could only pursue power

48
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:55,873
as a means of self-protection.

49
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:57,513
When Xiaoyao was adrift far from home,

50
00:03:57,873 --> 00:03:59,274
she also lived in fear every day.

51
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:01,073
But why didn't she turn out like Xinyue?

52
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:05,233
How does His Majesty treat Miss Xiling?

53
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:07,353
His Majesty naturally
treats Xiaoyao very well.

54
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:12,272
Yes.

55
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:14,834
I do not treat Xinyue
as His Majesty treats Xiaoyao.

56
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:17,033
But Xiaoyao treats
His Majesty very well too.

57
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:20,033
Xiaoyao took an arrow

58
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,434
and was willing to marry into
our family for His Majesty.

59
00:04:22,793 --> 00:04:23,994
What has Xinyue done for me?

60
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:25,793
Your sister was a hostage

61
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:28,394
for 120 years in Xiyan Town
on your behalf

62
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:31,114
so that you could grow up
without worries.

63
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:34,154
Now you sit here and accuse Xinyue

64
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:36,193
because you haven't suffered

65
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,313
the hardships she has endured.

66
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,714
If you were in her shoes,

67
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:44,193
could you guarantee

68
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:48,913
you would be as upright as you are now?

69
00:04:59,313 --> 00:05:00,274
I'm wrong.

70
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:03,033
In the future, I will be tolerant of her

71
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:04,793
and nicer to her.

72
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:09,874
Fenglong,

73
00:05:11,513 --> 00:05:13,674
you carry the bloodline of the Chenrong

74
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:15,913
and Chishui Families.

75
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:19,994
You are the only brother
Xinyue can rely on.

76
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:23,913
In the future, you must be cautious

77
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:25,674
and watch your manners.

78
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:28,753
The future of both families

79
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:30,554
and your sister's safety

80
00:05:31,313 --> 00:05:33,193
all depend on you.

81
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:43,793
I will bear in mind your words.

82
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,793
I'm not short of such jewels
in the palace.

83
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:52,913
The Chishui Red Lotus grows

84
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:53,954
in the Chishui Cave.

85
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:55,434
Due to its rich spiritual energy,

86
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,193
the stem remains alive
for thousands of years.

87
00:05:58,313 --> 00:05:59,154
This flute

88
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:01,154
is made from the eternal stem

89
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:02,434
of the Chishui Red Lotus.

90
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,233
It's beautiful like jade

91
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:17,114
but not vulgar like jade.

92
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:20,233
It even faintly exudes
the scent of lotus.

93
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,353
If you give it to His Majesty,

94
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:22,513
His Majesty will surely like it.

95
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:24,633
If you accompany him on guqin,

96
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:26,513
you two will play better than before.

97
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:28,513
Thank you, Fenglong.

98
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:32,874
Father has already told me off.

99
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:34,633
It was my fault before.

100
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,793
It's not easy for you in the palace.

101
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:39,594
I will consider more
for you in the future.

102
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,874
Grandfather.

103
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:50,233
You're back.

104
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:51,793
I'm back!

105
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:53,874
Grandfather.

106
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:55,994
I brought back
a lot of local products from Xiyan.

107
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,033
Do you want to look?

108
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:58,154
Okay, no rush.

109
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:01,313
Tell me about your father.

110
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:05,954
My father has fully recovered.

111
00:07:05,994 --> 00:07:07,913
I was worried he might not adapt well.

112
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:09,994
But he opened

113
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,353
a small shop in Xiyan,

114
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,633
and he's living
a leisurely and joyful life now.

115
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:17,834
That's good.

116
00:07:20,753 --> 00:07:22,353
I really admire him.

117
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:24,633
He was a powerful king

118
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:26,633
in court,

119
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,473
but he's also able to live

120
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,114
a simple life away from it.

121
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:33,954
Well,

122
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,674
I underestimated
his open-mindedness and boldness.

123
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:41,193
The people who can understand
the trends of the world

124
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:42,913
are few and far between.

125
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:44,633
Those who act accordingly

126
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:46,594
and willingly give up

127
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:48,913
are even rarer.

128
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:01,353
When His Majesty returns,

129
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:03,274
we will be honored

130
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:05,513
to listen to you
and His Majesty play the guqin

131
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:06,513
and the flute together.

132
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,674
I hope His Majesty will like it.

133
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:11,793
Your Majesty.

134
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:13,954
His Majesty has returned?

135
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:14,704
Yes.

136
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,233
Linglan.

137
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:16,994
Hurry up.

138
00:08:17,114 --> 00:08:17,680
Okay.

139
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:18,994
Your Majesty.

140
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,193
His Majesty went to

141
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,154
the Xiaoyue Peak
to dine with the Great Emperor.

142
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:25,874
You may leave.

143
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,193
Now,

144
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:32,513
I don't even have the chance

145
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:35,513
to present a gift.

146
00:08:36,193 --> 00:08:36,873
Your Majesty.

147
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,113
His Majesty is wholeheartedly filial.

148
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:40,633
He's not neglecting you

149
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:41,474
for any woman.

150
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:42,873
All these years,

151
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:46,594
no matter the weather,

152
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:49,394
as long as His Majesty
is at Chenrong Mountain,

153
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:50,954
he will surely go to the Xiaoyue Peak.

154
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:53,274
Filial piety?

155
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,834
On the Xiaoyue Peak,
the one closest to His Majesty

156
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:00,993
isn't the Great Emperor.

157
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:14,394
If a kingdom can have two queens,

158
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:18,914
can it have three queens?

159
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:20,914
How is that possible?

160
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:23,234
You're a descendant
of the Chenrong royal family

161
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:25,834
The one on Wushen Mountain
was once a princess of Haoling.

162
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:27,474
Which other woman in Dahuang

163
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:28,794
can be compared to you

164
00:09:28,873 --> 00:09:29,914
and share your place?

165
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:31,234
Xiling Jiuyao,

166
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:33,714
the granddaughter of the Great Emperor.

167
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:34,992
Well...

168
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:35,914
Well...

169
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:36,673
No way.

170
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:37,794
No way.

171
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:39,394
You're overthinking it.

172
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:40,714
Am I overthinking?

173
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:43,753
Xiyan Mountain which haunts

174
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:47,433
His Majesty's dreams
still lacks a mistress.

175
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:50,274
If His Majesty wants to,

176
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:51,794
who could stop him?

177
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:53,274
Chief Tushan.

178
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:54,633
Chief Tushan

179
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,193
is sure to marry Xiling Jiuyao.

180
00:09:58,073 --> 00:09:58,753
Back then,

181
00:09:59,193 --> 00:10:00,633
Xiaoyao and Chief Chishui

182
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,993
had already been married in a ceremony,

183
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:03,993
but Tushan Jing could still have

184
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:05,313
Fangfeng Bei seize her.

185
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:06,954
Now,

186
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:09,154
he's a mere chief.

187
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,914
Would His Majesty take him seriously?

188
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:20,993
All of these are without error.

189
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,193
They can be bound into a book now.

190
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:28,034
(Herbal remedies and decocting methods)
People all say your writings

191
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,073
are hard to get.

192
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:30,914
After you became the chief,

193
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:32,394
you wrote less often.

194
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:33,594
People can't even buy it.

195
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:35,394
But have a look.

196
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:36,993
We have boxes.

197
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:39,794
So you put these away.

198
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:41,354
If we run out of money,

199
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:42,914
we'll sell them for money.

200
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:49,394
You just need to have me.

201
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,234
After all, if you want money,

202
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:53,714
I'll give you as much as you want.

203
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:56,993
You're totally wrong.

204
00:10:59,394 --> 00:11:00,193
Wrong about what?

205
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:02,834
Chief Tushan,

206
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:04,354
I will marry into your family.

207
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:05,753
It's you

208
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:07,753
who will have me.

209
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:10,873
Or you want to marry into my family?

210
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:12,633
It's not impossible.

211
00:11:13,113 --> 00:11:14,354
If you are willing,

212
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,474
I will ask Xuan

213
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:17,714
to issue a decree
to have you marry into my family.

214
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:18,513
I am willing.

215
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:36,553
Keep drawing.

216
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:42,714
The cup is full.

217
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,993
What were you thinking about just now?

218
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,274
Grandfather, do you know
Fangfeng Yiying is still alive?

219
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:11,073
Yes, I do.

220
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:16,394
The Tushan Family
announced to the public

221
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:19,234
Fangfeng Yiying died
after a serious illness.

222
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:22,073
People who don't know the inside story

223
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:25,193
think Fangfeng Yiying died of illness.

224
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:27,234
Those in the know

225
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,834
believe Fangfeng Yiying
was secretly dealt with

226
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:33,154
by the Tushan Family.

227
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:34,993
But in fact,

228
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,513
Fangfeng Yiying is living incognito

229
00:12:40,914 --> 00:12:42,553
in Qingshui Town.

230
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:45,193
Fangfeng Yiying tried
to assassinate me several times.

231
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:47,313
I can overlook it.

232
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:51,633
But she has repeatedly plotted
to harm Xiaoyao.

233
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:54,354
And Tushan Jing even does not mind it.

234
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:55,834
Grandfather,

235
00:12:57,794 --> 00:12:58,594
can you really

236
00:12:58,594 --> 00:12:59,873
entrust Xiaoyao

237
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:02,794
to such a weak person?

238
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:11,553
Cang Xuan,

239
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:15,673
for the Chief of the Tushan Family

240
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,433
who has great wealth
and great power in hand,

241
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:20,873
revenge is easy,

242
00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:23,714
but restraint is difficult.

243
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:27,354
Perhaps you cannot understand

244
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:28,873
or agree with Tushan Jing.

245
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:33,594
But a person
who has experienced bloody betrayal

246
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:36,394
still has a pure heart

247
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,633
which is not tainted.

248
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:40,633
Don't you think

249
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:43,594
this is also a kind of inner strength?

250
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:46,993
Whether you or I like him

251
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:48,113
is not important.

252
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:52,274
What's important
is that Xiaoyao likes him.

253
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:16,274
Your Majesty, you asked me here

254
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:18,193
just to let me watch you drink?

255
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:19,513
Even if you want to drink,

256
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:21,474
let me accompany you and drink together.

257
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,313
Why are you in a bad mood?

258
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:47,993
The compilation is almost done.

259
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:51,714
After that,

260
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:57,993
Xiaoyao is going to marry Tushan Jing.

261
00:14:58,394 --> 00:14:59,633
What is there to be unhappy about?

262
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:00,873
This is a joyous occasion.

263
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:01,594
Joyous occasion?

264
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:03,753
How is Tushan Jing worthy?

265
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:07,034
He is indecisive.

266
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,113
He's tender-hearted towards Tushan Hou.

267
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:13,034
He hesitates when he should be decisive
against Fangfeng Yiying.

268
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:15,633
How is Tushan Jing
a good match for Xiaoyao?

269
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:17,513
Your Majesty,

270
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:19,354
Jing is just too kind-hearted.

271
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:22,113
After all, Tushan Hou
is his blood brother.

272
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,034
It's normal that he can't do it.

273
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:25,873
Tushan Jing's kindness

274
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,394
made Xiaoyao heartbroken and spit blood

275
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:29,553
and fall seriously ill.

276
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:30,993
His kindness pleases the enemy

277
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:32,673
and pains the dear ones,
so what good is it?

278
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,633
It's clearly just weakness
and incompetence.

279
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:39,154
Jing doesn't have great aspirations,

280
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:41,113
but he has a discerning eye.

281
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:43,234
He has supported you
from the very beginning,

282
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:44,873
contributing to your ascension.

283
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,193
Tushan Jing supported me

284
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:47,553
in the battle for the throne

285
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:50,513
not due to his own vision.

286
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:53,154
He was just following you

287
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,034
and took advantage.

288
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,914
He's so incompetent.

289
00:15:58,474 --> 00:15:59,834
Without your care,

290
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,193
the Tushan Family

291
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:04,633
would be kicked out
of the Four Great Clans long ago.

292
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:07,673
Your Majesty,

293
00:16:09,513 --> 00:16:10,474
actually...

294
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:13,313
This all...

295
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:14,834
(Fenglong,)

296
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,433
(you carry the bloodline
of the Chenrong)

297
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,753
(and Chishui Families.)

298
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:23,394
(You are the only brother
Xinyue can rely on.)

299
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:26,794
In the future, you must be cautious

300
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:28,914
and watch your manners.

301
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:31,193
The future of both families

302
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:33,073
and your sister's safety

303
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,753
all depend on you.

304
00:16:38,354 --> 00:16:39,633
This is what I should do.

305
00:16:40,193 --> 00:16:41,113
You flatter me.

306
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,073
Hong Jiang leads the Chenrong rebels

307
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,993
to be entrenched around Qingshui Town
for hundreds of years.

308
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:51,873
Truly a great thorn in our side.

309
00:16:52,954 --> 00:16:53,794
Everyone,

310
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:56,474
do you have any solutions?

311
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,594
During my reign,

312
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:06,634
I was unable to resolve this matter.

313
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:08,354
It's been weighing on my heart.

314
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:10,273
Cang Xuan is filial,

315
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,193
so he called you all here

316
00:17:12,393 --> 00:17:13,754
to discuss this matter.

317
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:16,114
Just feel free to say it

318
00:17:16,273 --> 00:17:17,634
without concern for my feelings.

319
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:20,273
I have clashed
with Hong Jiang several times.

320
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:21,874
Well then, I will say it first.

321
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:25,433
For centuries,

322
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:26,793
we've been in conflict with them,

323
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:29,474
but there has never been
a large-scale battle.

324
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:31,234
It's always been guerrilla warfare.

325
00:17:32,273 --> 00:17:33,714
Once the rebels succeed in an attack,

326
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:35,073
they flee far away

327
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:36,273
and split into groups

328
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:37,474
to hide in the mountains.

329
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,433
If we retreat,

330
00:17:39,874 --> 00:17:40,834
we will lose.

331
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:42,193
If we advance,

332
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:44,193
we will expend energy to search.

333
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:45,874
But in the vast deep mountains

334
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,193
with complex terrain,
it's very hard to search.

335
00:17:48,594 --> 00:17:49,994
What about training deity scouts

336
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:51,073
to enhance reconnaissance?

337
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:52,153
We have tried.

338
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:52,913
It didn't work.

339
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:54,913
The high and dense trees

340
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:56,553
make it difficult for mounts to fly.

341
00:17:57,273 --> 00:17:59,153
The deities do not have the advantage.

342
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,634
Ultimately we still rely on our legs
to search everywhere.

343
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:02,954
And the Chenrong rebels

344
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:04,954
just want us to venture deep
into the mountains.

345
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:07,193
Xiang Liu is full of cunning tricks.

346
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:08,874
Before any head-on confrontation,

347
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:10,553
their unpredictable sneak attacks

348
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:12,634
already exhaust our army

349
00:18:12,954 --> 00:18:14,193
and deplete our morale.

350
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:16,193
We can't even find the enemy.

351
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:17,433
It is difficult.

352
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:18,634
What about setting up formations?

353
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,313
Xiang Liu is a top-notch master

354
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,673
of formations in Dahuang.

355
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:26,234
Our formations

356
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:27,874
are often seen through
by him at a glance.

357
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:29,073
One careless move

358
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:30,874
and the opponent takes advantage.

359
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:31,874
Shou,

360
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:33,714
do you have any good ideas?

361
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:37,514
No good ideas.

362
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:39,714
But I do have a silly one.

363
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:42,433
Xiang Liu is a genius
who comes once in a thousand years

364
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:44,073
with nine heads.

365
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:45,193
Comparing wits with him

366
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:46,994
is tantamount to exposing
one's weaknesses.

367
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:49,634
Since Xiang Liu is the type
to outwit brute force,

368
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:51,754
we might as well use
the opposite tactic.

369
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:53,594
Overpower them with sheer strength.

370
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:00,153
Your Majesty,
you're now the ruler of Dahuang

371
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,433
with abundant talents
and ample military strength,

372
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,553
whereas the Chenrong rebels

373
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:06,393
are like water without a source

374
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:07,553
and a tree without roots.

375
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,874
If you are not in a hurry, Your Majesty,

376
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:12,976
(Chenrong Army, Qingshui Town, Slot Canyon)
one word,

377
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:13,994
"besiege".

378
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:17,634
Ru Shou, brilliant.

379
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:20,033
No wonder I can never beat you
on the battlefield.

380
00:19:20,913 --> 00:19:21,714
Not at all.

381
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:22,913
I'm flattered.

382
00:19:25,594 --> 00:19:28,114
Ru Shou is right.

383
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:33,994
Xiang Liu is a genius
who comes once in a thousand years,

384
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,994
and Hong Jiang is a great general.

385
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,874
It'll be a pity to kill them.

386
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:41,673
It would be best
if they could be persuaded to surrender.

387
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:43,673
It's been hundreds of years.

388
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:46,474
You two have repeatedly tried
to persuade them to surrender

389
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:47,754
but never succeeded.

390
00:19:48,393 --> 00:19:49,514
Xiang Liu is determined

391
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:51,474
not to surrender.

392
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:53,153
I know it's very difficult.

393
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:54,514
But let's try once more.

394
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:57,114
Otherwise, there will always be regret.

395
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:58,193
Your Majesty,

396
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:00,393
why not let my father try it?

397
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:05,474
Chenrong Yi is the best candidate.

398
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:08,624
Okay.

399
00:20:09,594 --> 00:20:11,273
I will entrust this task to Mr. Chenrong

400
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:12,634
and he'll go to Qingshui Town.

401
00:20:13,474 --> 00:20:15,393
Wait for my confirmation of the dosages

402
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,714
of the drugs in this prescription

403
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:17,793
before recording it

404
00:20:18,313 --> 00:20:18,864
Okay.

405
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:26,354
Why have you come at this hour?

406
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:27,714
Do you need me for anything?

407
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,634
Hu Zhen has told me
Tushan Tian is seriously ill

408
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:30,994
and crying to see me.

409
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:32,313
I want to go to Qingshui Town

410
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:32,954
to see the child

411
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:35,193
and take a few physicians along
for a consultation.

412
00:20:36,354 --> 00:20:37,714
Even Hu Zhen can't cure the disease.

413
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,393
I guess no other physicians
have a way either.

414
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:42,634
Should I

415
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:44,793
go with you?

416
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,033
That would be great.

417
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:48,994
It's just that Fangfeng Yiying
is also there.

418
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:50,553
I'm afraid you'll be displeased.

419
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:53,954
Of course, I am not happy to see her.

420
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,033
But the child is innocent.

421
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:57,913
And it's a matter of life and death.

422
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:00,553
My mood is not that important.

423
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:01,584
You

424
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:03,114
just make it up to me later.

425
00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:07,313
I'm forever

426
00:21:07,514 --> 00:21:08,673
at your disposal.

427
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:17,712
(Rejuvenation Hall)

428
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:22,754
This time, Jing and the Tushan guards

429
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:24,393
will go with me.

430
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:26,714
You just stay behind and cover for me.

431
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:29,273
The Great Emperor is mild.

432
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:31,114
But if His Majesty asks me,

433
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:32,673
what should I answer?

434
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:35,714
I've also had emergency calls before

435
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,114
without returning to the Xiaoyue Peak.

436
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:38,874
Just tell him I was called away

437
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:39,913
for an emergency consultation

438
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:40,994
to see a patient.

439
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:42,393
I'll be back soon.

440
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:43,874
I'll return by tomorrow morning.

441
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,673
Now, Dahuang is stable,

442
00:21:55,073 --> 00:21:57,393
and His Majesty is wise and benevolent.

443
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:03,313
Please move on from the past

444
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:05,393
and lead our troops to surrender.

445
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:11,474
When the Chenrong Kingdom was destroyed,

446
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:13,033
faced with the surrender offer,

447
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:17,273
my answer was to fight to the death.

448
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:21,474
Today, my answer remains

449
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,033
the same.

450
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:27,994
Why?

451
00:22:29,273 --> 00:22:30,393
The destruction of Chenrong

452
00:22:30,393 --> 00:22:32,313
was centuries ago.

453
00:22:33,193 --> 00:22:35,714
Now, people of the Central Plains
have given birth to descendants

454
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:37,474
and already forgotten Chenrong.

455
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,433
Since you approve of my thoughts,

456
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:44,673
why keep fighting?

457
00:22:45,153 --> 00:22:45,840
Yi,

458
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:48,114
you have your choices.

459
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,313
I have mine.

460
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:13,474
Moss grows close to the ground,

461
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:16,114
while big trees reach for the sky.

462
00:23:17,273 --> 00:23:18,474
One downwards,

463
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:19,954
the other upwards.

464
00:23:19,954 --> 00:23:21,874
The two seem

465
00:23:21,874 --> 00:23:22,754
to go opposite ways,

466
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:25,994
but the one down and the one up together

467
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:29,114
create this world
of interesting contrasts.

468
00:23:34,474 --> 00:23:35,474
In the world,

469
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:39,634
there must be those
who adapt, navigate politics,

470
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:41,313
and go with the flow,

471
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:43,514
and also those
who remain steadfast to their principles

472
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:45,714
and never submit.

473
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:20,273
Lord Chenrong,

474
00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:22,354
the camp's location is a secret.

475
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:25,033
So sorry again.

476
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,793
Please accept my bow.

477
00:24:35,714 --> 00:24:37,673
Uncle Hong Jiang tries to console me

478
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:39,634
by telling me big trees and moss

479
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,594
each finds its place,

480
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:44,793
but over these years,

481
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:49,073
we survivors of Chenrong

482
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:52,073
have let you down.

483
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:06,714
After this bow,

484
00:25:08,913 --> 00:25:10,273
you and I will be mortal enemies.

485
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:54,153
I can't thank you enough
for coming to treat Tian,

486
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:55,433
even after what happened

487
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:56,994
between us.

488
00:25:57,714 --> 00:25:58,994
Let me first examine him.

489
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:14,153
Hu Zhen has prescribed some medicine,

490
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:17,234
but he's not better after taking it.

491
00:26:25,354 --> 00:26:27,033
His illness is quite peculiar.

492
00:26:27,634 --> 00:26:28,954
I shall check his blood.

493
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:44,433
Xiaoyao.

494
00:26:53,354 --> 00:26:54,354
Why have you done this?

495
00:26:54,594 --> 00:26:55,754
Xiaoyao came to save Tian.

496
00:26:57,114 --> 00:26:57,994
Tian is not ill.

497
00:26:58,354 --> 00:26:59,273
He has been poisoned.

498
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:01,313
Someone promised me

499
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,234
if I killed Miss Xiling,

500
00:27:04,433 --> 00:27:05,433
he'd provide the antidote.

501
00:27:05,553 --> 00:27:06,354
If you release Xiaoyao,

502
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:07,913
we will surely cure Tian.

503
00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:09,234
I promise

504
00:27:09,514 --> 00:27:10,553
whatever you want,

505
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:11,754
I can help you get it.

506
00:27:12,153 --> 00:27:15,514
She wants your life.

507
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:21,954
Don't count on reinforcements.

508
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:25,273
From the moment
you stepped into this room,

509
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:26,673
you fell into a trap.

510
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:28,514
The secret guards around you

511
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,793
have been taken care of by my men.

512
00:27:35,874 --> 00:27:36,994
Even a beast loves its cubs.

513
00:27:37,714 --> 00:27:38,673
To plot against me,

514
00:27:39,234 --> 00:27:40,754
you even drugged your own son.

515
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:46,153
It was just an expedient method.

516
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,313
If Tian knew the truth,

517
00:27:52,634 --> 00:27:54,594
he would surely help his father, right?

518
00:27:57,114 --> 00:27:58,073
What do you want?

519
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:03,114
I want a fair duel.

520
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:05,754
Your mother, that vile woman,

521
00:28:05,754 --> 00:28:07,273
constantly says I am inferior to you

522
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:10,114
and even can't compare with your toes.

523
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:12,816
Fine.

524
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,354
Today, we'll duel fairly

525
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:19,954
to see who is truly inferior.

526
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:32,880
Okay.

527
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:34,313
I accept.

528
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:39,874
In the past,

529
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:43,073
Mother always helped you cheat.

530
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:45,273
No matter what I did, in her eyes,

531
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:46,913
I was not as good as you.

532
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,114
Tushan Jing,

533
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:51,874
you owe me a fair contest.

534
00:28:52,994 --> 00:28:53,552
How do we do it?

535
00:28:54,514 --> 00:28:55,313
Only one of us

536
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:56,714
will leave alive.

537
00:28:58,474 --> 00:28:59,634
Surviving is naturally better.

538
00:29:00,193 --> 00:29:01,874
Even if that vile mother sees it,

539
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:04,514
she must admit it.

540
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:17,874
I know you agreed to the duel

541
00:29:17,874 --> 00:29:19,114
as a way to buy time.

542
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:20,393
But dream on.

543
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:23,474
This time, no one will save you.

544
00:29:34,153 --> 00:29:35,114
Tushan Jing,

545
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:37,754
as long as you concede

546
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:40,114
and admit you are inferior to me,

547
00:29:40,594 --> 00:29:42,433
I will grant you a swift death.

548
00:29:48,474 --> 00:29:49,114
Good.

549
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,594
I will tear you apart bit by bit

550
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:55,354
and let you die in the most painful way.

551
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:00,354
Tushan Jing,

552
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:02,594
would you rather have
your organs shattered

553
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,073
than admit

554
00:30:04,073 --> 00:30:05,354
you're not as good as me?

555
00:30:07,714 --> 00:30:09,874
If you were still the brother
I knew before,

556
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:12,834
I would admit immediately

557
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,673
I was not as good as you.

558
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:17,994
But the you now.

559
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:22,033
I can tell you very clearly

560
00:30:25,594 --> 00:30:27,273
I look down on you.

561
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,793
How dare you look down on me?

562
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:45,553
Say it.

563
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:47,514
Who exactly is stronger?

564
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:49,474
Answer me!

565
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:54,114
Who exactly is inferior?

566
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:22,754
Yiying,

567
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:27,153
this is the arrow

568
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:29,594
that I designed

569
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:31,874
and forged

570
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:33,393
for you personally.

571
00:32:05,313 --> 00:32:05,904
You...

572
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:11,474
You made me

573
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:13,714
look like this.

574
00:32:14,793 --> 00:32:16,153
You chose to kill me

575
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:18,874
and save Tushan Jing?

576
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:21,313
If it hadn't been for him,

577
00:32:21,954 --> 00:32:22,754
would we

578
00:32:23,594 --> 00:32:25,033
have ended up like this?

579
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:32,793
Let Tushan Jing leave.

580
00:32:33,714 --> 00:32:34,514
This trap

581
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:37,954
is for you all along.

582
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:40,114
I am

583
00:32:40,754 --> 00:32:43,393
selfish and cruel, and I hold grudges.

584
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:45,793
Those who have let me down,

585
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:48,273
I must have them repay in full.

586
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:53,474
Chief,

587
00:32:54,393 --> 00:32:55,313
I am sorry.

588
00:32:55,994 --> 00:32:57,994
I have deceived and used you once again.

589
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:00,834
I killed all his men.

590
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:02,954
Miss Xiling

591
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:05,634
will wake up in four to six hours.

592
00:33:06,714 --> 00:33:08,553
I also left a letter for Tian

593
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,994
to let him know
what his parents had done wrong.

594
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:15,634
I only hope that when he grows up,

595
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:17,273
he can repay

596
00:33:18,193 --> 00:33:19,793
what I owe you on my behalf.

597
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:33,673
Hou,

598
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:36,033
I just want to know

599
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:40,514
whether you have even
a shred of true feelings for me.

600
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:44,954
I'm about to die.

601
00:33:47,553 --> 00:33:48,913
Does it matter

602
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:53,153
whether I do or not?

603
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:03,153
Whether you love me

604
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:04,954
or not,

605
00:34:05,954 --> 00:34:07,393
you promised me

606
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,474
we would be together forever,

607
00:34:11,474 --> 00:34:14,954
alive or dead.

608
00:34:17,994 --> 00:34:20,113
The man I chose

609
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:23,234
mustn't violate his promise.

610
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:30,994
Tushan Jing,

611
00:34:31,913 --> 00:34:33,913
it's still not fair this time.

612
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:38,034
Someone is still helping you cheat,

613
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:41,673
and this time,

614
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:45,794
it's my wife.

615
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:44,113
I failed my mission,

616
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:46,873
unable to persuade
Hong Jiang to surrender.

617
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:48,274
He said

618
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:51,234
to fight to the death.

619
00:35:58,474 --> 00:35:59,714
This is within expectation.

620
00:36:00,754 --> 00:36:02,234
There is no need
for excessive self-blame.

621
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:06,474
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for your magnanimity.

622
00:36:08,153 --> 00:36:09,034
You've had a hard journey.

623
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:11,113
Go back and rest.

624
00:36:12,113 --> 00:36:14,393
I'll take my leave.

625
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:28,833
Your Majesty,

626
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:29,994
the young lady and Chief Tushan

627
00:36:29,994 --> 00:36:31,153
were attacked in Qingshui Town.

628
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:33,274
Is Xiaoyao in any danger to her life?

629
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:34,954
The young lady is safe now.

630
00:36:36,714 --> 00:36:37,873
What exactly happened?

631
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:39,074
Start from the beginning.

632
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:41,274
Fangfeng Yiying
and Tushan Hou conspired.

633
00:36:41,314 --> 00:36:42,873
They used Tushan Tian's illness as bait

634
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,393
to lure the young lady and Chief Tushan

635
00:36:44,393 --> 00:36:45,353
to Qingshui Town.

636
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:46,554
Tushan Hou took advantage

637
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:47,794
of his knowledge of the Tushan guards

638
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:48,954
to set up a formation

639
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:50,314
and ambush them with hundreds of men.

640
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:51,954
They killed all
of Chief Tushan's secret guards.

641
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:53,794
Fangfeng Yiying and Tushan Hou

642
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,393
killed each other.

643
00:36:55,873 --> 00:36:56,400
But

644
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:58,833
Chief Tushan is missing.

645
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:02,673
Where is Xiaoyao?

646
00:37:02,873 --> 00:37:03,433
In the town.

647
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:32,816
Fenglong.

648
00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:38,113
Your Majesty.

649
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:39,554
Can we find any clues

650
00:37:39,554 --> 00:37:40,314
from these assassins?

651
00:37:51,314 --> 00:37:52,113
All sworn warriors.

652
00:37:52,633 --> 00:37:54,353
Probably secretly trained by Tushan Hou

653
00:37:55,074 --> 00:37:56,353
specifically to deal with Jing.

654
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:58,433
Their faces were removed
since childhood.

655
00:37:58,994 --> 00:37:59,873
They wore the same clothes

656
00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:02,234
and sat and slept
in exactly the same way.

657
00:38:02,954 --> 00:38:03,913
They'd all commit suicide

658
00:38:03,994 --> 00:38:05,554
whether their mission succeeded or not.

659
00:38:06,314 --> 00:38:06,833
Your Majesty.

660
00:38:11,994 --> 00:38:13,034
Have you discovered anything?

661
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:16,554
The spiritual energy here
is rich and mixed.

662
00:38:17,424 --> 00:38:18,034
It's the place

663
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:19,274
where Jing fought with Tushan Hou.

664
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:23,113
Right here,

665
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:25,074
Jing was injured.

666
00:38:31,314 --> 00:38:31,954
Here,

667
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:34,034
Jing was defeated by Tushan Hou.

668
00:38:34,673 --> 00:38:35,794
All his organs were injured.

669
00:38:37,673 --> 00:38:38,913
His life was hanging by a thread.

670
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:47,833
Just at the moment,

671
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:49,673
Tushan Hou was attacked.

672
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:52,754
Jing was out of danger.

673
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,193
How so?

674
00:38:55,514 --> 00:38:57,554
This is Tushan Hou's spirit blood.

675
00:38:58,074 --> 00:38:59,393
This is his vital blood.

676
00:39:01,393 --> 00:39:02,393
According to my conjecture,

677
00:39:02,714 --> 00:39:03,433
since Fangfeng Yiying

678
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:04,833
didn't harm Miss Xiling

679
00:39:05,353 --> 00:39:07,234
but instead, hid her and Tushan Tian

680
00:39:07,234 --> 00:39:08,754
together in a secret room under the bed,

681
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:10,234
Fangfeng Yiying bore no malice

682
00:39:10,393 --> 00:39:11,633
towards Miss Xiling and even intended

683
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:12,913
to entrust her with her son.

684
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:15,754
Fangfeng Yiying
must have dealt with the assassins

685
00:39:15,873 --> 00:39:17,113
and everything in the house

686
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:17,754
and then hurried

687
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:19,954
to kill Tushan Hou with an arrow

688
00:39:20,554 --> 00:39:21,193
and save Jing.

689
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:23,474
Where is Jing then?

690
00:39:25,074 --> 00:39:25,873
Where is Jing?

691
00:39:38,113 --> 00:39:40,314
Fangfeng Yiying intended to save him,

692
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:43,034
but she sacrificed herself to a deity.

693
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:45,274
She was on the verge of collapse,

694
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:48,754
which gave Tushan Hou
a chance to catch his breath.

695
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:56,474
Before dying,

696
00:39:57,754 --> 00:39:59,153
Tushan Hou severely injured Jing again.

697
00:40:00,794 --> 00:40:03,113
Ultimately, Jing fell into the water.

698
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:14,314
Is Tushan Jing alive or dead?

699
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:15,913
It is unknown.

700
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:18,673
Summon the naval forces

701
00:40:19,034 --> 00:40:19,954
and search along the river.

702
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:21,714
Convey my decree.

703
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,074
Any aquatic being

704
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:26,913
who finds traces of Chief Tushan,

705
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:28,593
I will grant their request

706
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:29,794
and give them a big reward.

707
00:40:30,113 --> 00:40:30,736
Yes.

708
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:34,474
Jing fell into the water from here?

709
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:35,593
Yes.

710
00:40:41,616 --> 00:40:42,193
Hurry.

711
00:40:42,393 --> 00:40:43,393
Pull Miss Xiling up.

712
00:40:43,393 --> 00:40:44,034
No need.

713
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:45,633
Everyone, go look for Tushan Jing.

714
00:40:45,954 --> 00:40:47,433
Find him, alive or dead.

715
00:40:48,873 --> 00:40:49,514
Yes.

716
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:58,554
- Chief Tushan.
- Chief Tushan.

717
00:40:58,554 --> 00:40:59,954
- Chief Tushan.
- Chief Tushan.

718
00:40:59,954 --> 00:41:02,113
- Jing.
- Chief Tushan.

719
00:41:02,113 --> 00:41:04,794
- Chief Tushan.
- Chief Tushan.

720
00:41:04,873 --> 00:41:07,673
- Chief Tushan.
- Jing.

721
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,433
Forward. Search carefully.

722
00:41:11,593 --> 00:41:13,193
- Chief Tushan.
- Jing.

723
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:15,353
You guys

724
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:16,034
go over there.

725
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:17,314
Go over there.

726
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:18,353
Chief Tushan.

727
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:18,928
Jing.

728
00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:21,113
- Chief Tushan.
- Jing.

729
00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:22,913
Jing.

730
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:54,234
Had I known this...

731
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,353
Had I known this...

732
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:10,393
Tushan Jing.

733
00:42:27,554 --> 00:42:28,554
How is she? Is it serious?

734
00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:36,353
Struck by the tragic news,

735
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,794
Miss Xiling had pain in her chest.

736
00:42:37,913 --> 00:42:39,113
And she stayed in cold water

737
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:40,393
all night despite low spirit power,

738
00:42:41,034 --> 00:42:41,994
which did harm

739
00:42:42,554 --> 00:42:43,113
to her body...

740
00:42:43,113 --> 00:42:44,393
Just tell me if it's serious and how

741
00:42:44,393 --> 00:42:45,034
to cure her.

742
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:46,554
It's serious but I can treat her.

743
00:42:47,353 --> 00:42:48,314
But the result

744
00:42:48,514 --> 00:42:49,474
depends on her will.

745
00:42:49,474 --> 00:42:50,113
Get the medicine.

746
00:42:50,474 --> 00:42:50,992
Yes.

747
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:52,593
Bring it over as soon as possible.

748
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:54,000
Yes.
