So,

a man forced me to kiss him.

But now I only want to kiss you.

Your kiss

20
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:36,545

Guards.

out of here.

60
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:14,265
There are honored guests present.

61
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:16,226
I don't want to disturb them.

00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:18,066

63
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,106
think of your family and clansmen first.

Xiaoyao.

65
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,305
Don't marry him.

66
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,145
What do you want to do?

67
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:31,745
Don't marry Chishui Fenglong.

68
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:34,226
You are now telling me not to marry him?

69
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:37,265
The ceremony is still not completed.

70
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:39,425
You can choose not to marry.

71
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:40,906
Leave immediately.

72
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:42,226
Do not appear

73
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:43,865
in front of me again.

74
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,185
Ignore him. Let's continue.

75
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:48,626
I don't want
to miss the auspicious time.

76
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:49,424
Okay.

77
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:53,985
Bow to the elders.

78
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:57,008
Xiaoyao.

79
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,506
Do you still remember the oath
you once swore?

80
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:03,265
I swear

81
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:04,865
if Xiang Liu helps me

82
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:06,185
remove the poisonous bug from Xuan,

83
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:07,985
I will do one thing for him.

84
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:09,465
What if you break this oath?

85
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:10,106
I will die

86
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:10,946
miserably.

87
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,226
Forget it.

88
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,346
You're a petty man.

89
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:16,784
So you won't be satisfied with it.

90
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:17,826
Tell me.

91
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,465
What oath do you want me to swear?

92
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:20,946
If you break the oath,

93
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,145
all your pleasures

94
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:25,425
will turn into pain,

95
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:27,786
and all your happiness

96
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:30,465
will turn into sorrow.

97
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:34,736
Xiaoyao.

98
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:50,826
What do you want?

99
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,425
I want you to leave with me now.

100
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,506
Even if you try to destroy me,

101
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:05,865
why do you do it

102
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:08,066
in the most insulting way?

103
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:09,946
You don't need to ask the reason.

104
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:12,585
You just need to do as I say.

105
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:14,145
Come with me.

106
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:15,786
Immediately.

107
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:17,745
Right away.

108
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:23,184
Xiaoyao.

109
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:24,585
It's time for the ceremony.

110
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,226
Xiaoyao.

111
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:33,186
You owe me.

112
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:39,866
I swear

113
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:41,465
if I break this oath,

114
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,065
all my pleasures

115
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:44,945
will turn into pain,

116
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:46,705
and all my happiness

117
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:48,705
will turn into sorrow.

118
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:54,608
Xiaoyao.

119
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:56,546
Don't.

120
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:06,065
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:07,666
Today,

122
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:10,746
I cannot marry you.

123
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,226
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:13,746
What?

125
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,825
She's not marrying him?

126
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,786
You'd rather leave with him

127
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:27,906
than marry me.

128
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:30,065
In your heart,

129
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:30,825
I, Chishui Fenglong,

130
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:31,625
am not better

131
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,426
than an idler?

132
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:34,465
It's not like that.

133
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,186
I...

134
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:36,186
Come with me immediately.

135
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:47,585
I am sorry.

136
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,625
I cannot marry you today.

137
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:51,705
I don't expect your forgiveness.

138
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:54,065
No matter how you punish me
in the future,

139
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:56,426
I will bear it.

140
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:14,825
Let her leave.

141
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:20,986
I said let her go.

142
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,186
Do not stop her.

143
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:37,866
Wait.

144
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:38,480
Xiaoyao.

145
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:44,385
Everyone.

146
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:46,306
The food and drink are ready.

147
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,746
You have all come from afar.

148
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:51,346
Please enjoy the food and drink

149
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:53,786
before leaving.

150
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,385
Your Lordship.

151
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:16,786
Chief Chishui.

152
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:18,385
After I return

153
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:20,065
and report this to His Majesty,

154
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:21,786
we'll give the Chishui Family

155
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,625
and the Chenrong Family an explanation.

156
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,786
Ru Shou, please.

157
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:44,025
It's urgent.

158
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:45,666
There's big trouble.

159
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:47,265
Your Majesty.

160
00:12:48,306 --> 00:12:49,776
The princess ran away from the wedding.

161
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:52,906
What did you say?

162
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:54,426
In the middle of the wedding ceremony,

163
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:55,346
the princess suddenly

164
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:57,025
left Chief Chishui and ran away.

165
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:59,186
It has been widely discussed in Dahuang.

166
00:12:59,186 --> 00:12:59,746
She ran away?

167
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:00,906
The Chishui Clan has lost face.

168
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:01,546
Good.

169
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:03,666
That's good.

170
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:05,945
She should run away.

171
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,216
His Majesty

172
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:14,025
is definitely mad.

173
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:15,025
What did you say?

174
00:13:15,906 --> 00:13:17,465
Xiaoyao dumped my brother

175
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:18,585
and left with Fangfeng Bei?

176
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:21,145
And even in front of all the guests
of Dahuang?

177
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:23,786
Yes, Your Majesty.

178
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:25,505
She ran away from her wedding.

179
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:28,625
How dare she?

180
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:30,426
Please calm your anger.

181
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:32,306
She has made the Chenrong Family

182
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:33,625
and the Chishui Family lose face.

183
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,065
She won't end up well.

184
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:38,546
Her reputation will be ruined,
and she will die alone.

185
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:40,226
The rites and laws
of Haoling are strict.

186
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:41,065
There's no place for her.

187
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:42,465
She has to hide

188
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:44,306
in the Chenrong Mountain

189
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:46,866
and spend the rest of her life
by relying on your support.

190
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:47,625
She has to stay

191
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:50,346
in the Chenrong Mountain for a lifetime?

192
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:51,344
Yes.

193
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:52,346
No man

194
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:53,705
will marry her.

195
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:55,426
And she will die alone.

196
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:56,625
Only His Majesty

197
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,346
will provide her with a place to stay

198
00:13:58,585 --> 00:14:00,186
for the sake of their
childhood friendship.

199
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:02,306
Your Majesty.

200
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:05,705
Haoling Jiuyao.

201
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:09,145
Why did you run away from your wedding?

202
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:10,986
Why?

203
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:26,746
This is Qingshui Town.

204
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:29,705
We will stay here for a while.

205
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,145
I have

206
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:43,786
ruined your wedding
with Chishui Fenglong.

207
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:46,426
Will you hate me?

208
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:51,505
Whether I hate you or not,

209
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:53,945
does it matter now?

210
00:14:55,705 --> 00:14:57,025
After all, I owe you.

211
00:14:58,906 --> 00:14:59,786
When you ask me to repay,

212
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,145
I must repay it.

213
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:08,825
It's good that you understand.

214
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:11,746
When did you know

215
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:12,786
I was to be married?

216
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:17,746
Before you left Haoling.

217
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:35,065
You had enough time

218
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,426
to stop this wedding.

219
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,306
But you did it at the wedding

220
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:42,426
and took me away,

221
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:48,465
making Chenrong and Chishui Family
hold a grudge against me.

222
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,186
Why do you treat me this way?

223
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,346
You dishonored Haoling

224
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:57,625
and ruined my reputation.

225
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:00,346
I will be despised

226
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:01,986
by everyone in Dahuang.

227
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:16,986
Forget it.

228
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:23,786
It happened.

229
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,505
What else can I do?

230
00:16:30,585 --> 00:16:31,346
Perhaps,

231
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,866
I was just born unlucky.

232
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:43,945
I'm tired.

233
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:47,906
You get out.

234
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:38,466
Grandfather.

235
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:40,505
I'm going to issue a decree

236
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:42,706
to give Luoshui to the Chishui Family

237
00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:43,906
as compensation.

238
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:46,066
Such a generous reward.

239
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:47,865
The engagement will be canceled?

240
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:50,992
(Apology Letter)

241
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:54,826
That's fine.

242
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:59,906
When issuing the decree,
you give my apology letter

243
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,505
to them as well.

244
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,145
Yes, Grandfather.

245
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:15,632
Your Majesty.

246
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:17,786
After the princess left
with Fangfeng Bei,

247
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:18,826
she vanished.

248
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:19,786
Vanished?

249
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:21,865
Double the search people.

250
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,265
Look for the princess

251
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:24,666
all over Dahuang.

252
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:25,936
Jun Yi.

253
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,265
You go to the Fangfeng's place

254
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:29,946
and inquire about Fangfeng Bei's news.

255
00:18:30,306 --> 00:18:31,225
- Yes.
- Yes.

256
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:35,826
Where on earth

257
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:38,265
has he taken Xiaoyao?

258
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:40,385
You needn't worry too much.

259
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:43,505
Xiaoyao was stranded in Dahuang
and lived alone

260
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:44,586
at a young age.

261
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:46,586
She knows how to protect herself.

262
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,985
In the current chaotic situation,

263
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:51,546
her disappearance isn't a bad thing.

264
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,625
You're right.

265
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:54,448
Sang.

266
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:56,385
You tell Jin Xuan

267
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:57,625
to have her spies

268
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,265
suspend their current tasks
and spare no effort

269
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:00,426
to look for the princess.

270
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:01,946
Yes.

271
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:05,808
Your Majesty.

272
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:06,706
At the wedding,

273
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:07,786
the princess ran away.

274
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:09,706
It has never happened.

275
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,985
It has not only offended the Chishui
and Chenrong clans

276
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:13,505
but also disgraced Haoling.

277
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,786
I implore Your Majesty
to severely punish the Great Princess.

278
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:16,752
Your Majesty.

279
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:18,546
Fangfeng Bei abducted the princess,

280
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:20,546
damaging the reputation
of Haoling royal family.

281
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:23,186
I earnestly request Your Majesty
to issue a decree

282
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:24,345
to arrest Fangfeng Bei

283
00:19:24,826 --> 00:19:25,786
and sentence him to death.

284
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:28,745
- Please severely punish Great Princess
- Please severely punish Great Princess

285
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:31,440
- and sentence Fangfeng Bei to death.
- and sentence Fangfeng Bei to death.

286
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:32,306
Qin Mang.

287
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:35,786
Send a metallurgist
from the Jintian Family

288
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:36,426
to Chishui.

289
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:37,546
On my behalf,

290
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:40,466
offer apologies
to Chenrong Yi and Mrs. Chishui

291
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:42,466
and cancel the engagement.

292
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:44,466
Yes, Your Majesty.

293
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:47,946
Your Majesty.

294
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:49,546
Now, everyone is talking

295
00:19:49,745 --> 00:19:51,706
about the princess's escape
from the wedding.

296
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:53,345
A decision must be made promptly

297
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:54,666
to calm the situation.

298
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:55,985
Are you suggesting me

299
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:58,865
to kill my daughter

300
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:01,505
because of others' gossip?

301
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:03,888
Your Majesty.

302
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:06,345
Fangfeng Bei is lowly

303
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:07,466
and dissolute.

304
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,865
He is already of ill repute.

305
00:20:08,985 --> 00:20:11,145
Abducting the princess
is a capital crime.

306
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:12,345
In my view...

307
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,426
In my view,

308
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:16,426
Chishui Fenglong is unromantic

309
00:20:16,426 --> 00:20:17,546
and dull.

310
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:19,745
On the contrary,

311
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:23,066
Fangfeng Bei is lively,
bold, and interesting.

312
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:24,706
Since he dared
to take the princess away,

313
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:25,985
just let him

314
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:29,066
marry the princess.

315
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:31,625
What if Fangfeng Bei refuses

316
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:33,586
to marry her?

317
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:38,186
If so, let him

318
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,826
marry into royal family.

319
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,586
Let him make a choice.

320
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:45,265
After all,
Haoling is a nation of etiquette.

321
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,505
Moreover, Your Majesty is reasonable.

322
00:20:50,105 --> 00:20:50,826
Permission granted.

323
00:21:16,306 --> 00:21:19,105
Fangfeng Bei
ruined Chief Chishui's wedding

324
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:21,145
and took away the Princess of Haoling.

325
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:25,025
What will you have him do?

326
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,745
He has made such a grave mistake,

327
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:31,865
so he must pay for it with his life.

328
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:35,145
Fangfeng Bei

329
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:37,786
is dead?

330
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,186
Didn't he tell you?

331
00:21:41,345 --> 00:21:42,625
It was just companionship

332
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,745
and merely a game.

333
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,145
Now that the game is over,

334
00:21:51,105 --> 00:21:52,265
he should die.

335
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:01,145
An insignificant lowly man.

336
00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:03,426
His death means nothing.

337
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:05,385
No need to be sad.

338
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,826
Did you take this game seriously

339
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:14,306
and open your heart to him?

340
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:17,025
Yes.

341
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:18,546
I took it seriously,

342
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:21,025
because Fangfeng Bei is not like you.

343
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:24,066
You have the power of Nine-Headed Demon,
but you have no feelings.

344
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:25,385
Fangfeng Bei

345
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:28,025
is a lowly man with average ability,

346
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,946
but he taught me archery,

347
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:32,505
played with me,

348
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,906
and shared delicious food with me.

349
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:37,306
He brought joy to others.

350
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,826
It's natural to feel sad

351
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,025
for such a friend.

352
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:51,906
Don't worry.

353
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:54,946
When someone like you dies,

354
00:22:56,826 --> 00:22:58,306
I won't shed a single tear.

355
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:05,625
Don't flatter yourself.

356
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:10,826
I've never had any feelings for you.

357
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,306
So I don't worry at all.

358
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:20,865
Right.

359
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,546
We have no feelings

360
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,505
for each other.

361
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:28,225
That's for the best.

to take the medicine.

379

00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:02,385
that your health was seriously weakened.

383
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:04,546
You can't worry too much.

384
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:05,745
You must take more rest.

385
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:06,985
Can't you order us

386
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:09,265
to do it?

387
00:26:09,505 --> 00:26:11,066
You don't have to exhaust yourself.

388
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:13,466
It will be done very soon.

389
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:19,345
We can

390
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:21,145
handle business.

391
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:23,225
Let Hu Zhen take care of it.

392
00:26:23,745 --> 00:26:26,225
Please take the medicine first.

393
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:32,016
(Prepare the Chenrong Army's food
and winter clothing within ten days.)

394
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:35,025
The Chenrong Army?

395
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:44,706
Previously, the Central Plains clans
were against the King of Xiyan,

396
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:46,625
so they socialized
with the Chenrong Army

397
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,946
and secretly supported them.

398
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:49,826
But now, His Majesty

399
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:51,345
is supported
by the Central Plains clans.

400
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:53,025
Even the Central Plains clans

401
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:54,586
have stopped providing assistance.

402
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:57,225
Why do you get yourself involved?

403
00:26:57,546 --> 00:26:59,466
What if His Majesty

404
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:00,306
discovers it?

405
00:27:01,826 --> 00:27:02,466
Therefore,

406
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,426
I must do this on my own.

407
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:07,706
Only then can the plan be flawless.

408
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:11,306
One person alone

409
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:12,745
cannot save the situation.

410
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:14,826
Now everyone is avoiding them.

411
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,186
Relying solely on themselves,

412
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:20,066
they even cannot buy food and supplies.

413
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:22,426
Only you are willing

414
00:27:22,745 --> 00:27:24,385
to take the risk to provide support.

415
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:29,906
I'm not qualified to support others.

416
00:27:34,105 --> 00:27:35,426
Winter is around the corner.

417
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:38,466
There is a lack of clothing
and food in the mountains.

418
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:42,745
They will have a hard time.

419
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,186
I really don't know what they are after.

420
00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:49,808
(Loyalty and Righteousness)

421
00:27:56,852 --> 00:27:59,376
(Loyalty and Righteousness)

422
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:05,505
Then what are you after?

423
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:27,186
You've lived
in Qingshui Town for decades.

424
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:28,505
Don't you plan

425
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:30,466
to go out for a stroll?

426
00:28:33,906 --> 00:28:34,985
I'm not interested.

427
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:37,946
The streets are still the same,

428
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:40,385
but the people have changed.

429
00:28:41,985 --> 00:28:43,025
In that case,

430
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:44,025
it's better not to see them.

431
00:28:44,946 --> 00:28:46,505
So I won't feel sad.

432
00:28:54,186 --> 00:28:55,786
This is strong liquor
that was specially made.

433
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:57,745
One cup of it can get you drunk.

434
00:28:58,466 --> 00:28:59,466
No matter how strong it is,

435
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:03,706
it cannot drown all my sorrows.

436
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:28,625
Xiang Liu.

437
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:31,466
You really

438
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:33,666
are a heartless nine-headed demon.

439
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:36,745
An ungrateful demon.

440
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:40,586
You knew me well

441
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:43,385
from the very beginning.

442
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:49,906
Since you dare to deal with the demon,

443
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:54,186
you should have the guts
to bear the consequences.

444
00:29:59,345 --> 00:30:00,225
Yes, indeed.

445
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,985
Our dealings have always been fair.

446
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:06,466
Even if I could decide again,

447
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:08,826
I would still transfer the poisonous bug

448
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:10,666
in your body.

449
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:15,745
It's all my fault.

450
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:17,946
Are you willing
to marry Chishui Fenglong?

451
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:20,265
Why did I agree to marry him if not?

452
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,265
Xiaoyao.

453
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:34,466
Look into my eyes.

454
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:50,345
Are you willing
to marry Chishui Fenglong?

455
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:51,865
No, I'm not.

456
00:30:53,906 --> 00:30:55,826
Are you willing to marry Tushan Jing?

457
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:08,066
Are you willing

458
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:11,985
to marry Ye Shiqi?

459
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:15,865
Yes, I am.

460
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:18,706
Who do you want to spend your life with?

461
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:27,666
Tell me.

462
00:31:29,025 --> 00:31:31,426
Who do you most wish
to spend your life with?

463
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:37,666
It hurts.

464
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:38,385
Tell me.

465
00:31:39,706 --> 00:31:40,385
Tell me.

466
00:31:43,105 --> 00:31:44,745
It hurts.

467
00:31:55,145 --> 00:31:56,066
I won't ask anymore.

468
00:31:57,786 --> 00:31:58,426
No more questions.

469
00:32:00,706 --> 00:32:01,666
Why?

470
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:14,672
Because...

471
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,145
Have a good sleep.

472
00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:31,105
After you wake up,

473
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:34,786
you will forget what just happened.

474
00:33:44,946 --> 00:33:46,826
The liquor can't make me feel better.

475
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:50,546
It only causes headaches.

476
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:55,826
Great-grandmother.

477
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:57,265
Look at the snowman I made.

478
00:33:57,466 --> 00:33:59,385
Great-grandmother, look.

479
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:04,666
Okay. They are all good!

480
00:34:15,946 --> 00:34:17,706
Come on. Chase me.

481
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:28,865
Stop.

482
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:30,585
Did you hear me?

483
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:32,946
Come here.

484
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,305
You're going to get a hit.

485
00:34:37,266 --> 00:34:38,625
You hurt my waist.

486
00:34:59,585 --> 00:35:00,706
Young lady.

487
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:04,706
You're the new neighbor
who just moved in, aren't you?

488
00:35:06,226 --> 00:35:06,906
Come.

489
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:08,345
Sit here.

490
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:12,345
Have a chat with me.

491
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:31,666
Tian'er.

492
00:35:40,946 --> 00:35:41,506
You...

493
00:35:42,585 --> 00:35:45,585
How do you know my name?

494
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:52,706
Ever since

495
00:35:53,746 --> 00:35:56,385
Skinny passed away,

496
00:35:57,026 --> 00:36:00,785
I have not heard that name for so long.

497
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:03,026
I heard of your name

498
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:06,946
from the elderly in town before.

499
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,666
They must be

500
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:14,226
gossiping about me.

501
00:36:15,145 --> 00:36:17,385
I was a prostitute,

502
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:21,466
unworthy of a good life.

503
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,865
But I spent a lifetime with Skinny

504
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:27,746
and have had

505
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:30,426
four sons

506
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:32,466
and one daughter.

507
00:36:33,426 --> 00:36:36,145
Now I have ten grandsons,

508
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:38,105
eight granddaughters,

509
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,345
and three great-grandsons.

510
00:36:48,385 --> 00:36:49,186
What about Mu,

511
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:51,186
Chuntao,

512
00:36:51,345 --> 00:36:52,466
and Pimply?

513
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:53,785
They passed away.

514
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:57,105
All of them.

515
00:36:59,186 --> 00:37:00,746
I'm the only one who's alive.

516
00:37:04,865 --> 00:37:06,186
Did Mu live a good life

517
00:37:06,865 --> 00:37:07,706
before he passed away?

518
00:37:08,946 --> 00:37:09,785
Yes.

519
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:12,186
Mu

520
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,946
had no children,

521
00:37:17,385 --> 00:37:17,906
but

522
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:20,186
Skinny and Pimply

523
00:37:20,986 --> 00:37:22,666
treated him as their father,

524
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:24,825
Chuntao

525
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,666
and I

526
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:31,145
are good daughters-in-law.

527
00:37:32,865 --> 00:37:34,706
When Mu passed away,

528
00:37:36,345 --> 00:37:37,785
he had no regrets.

529
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:41,385
But he

530
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:45,026
always thought about Xiaoliu.

531
00:37:49,026 --> 00:37:49,906
Luckily,

532
00:37:51,865 --> 00:37:54,345
Shiqi came back.

533
00:37:56,145 --> 00:37:57,266
Shiqi

534
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:02,706
spoke privately to Mu.

535
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:04,545
Well,

536
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:07,746
I don't know what they talked about.

537
00:38:09,105 --> 00:38:09,946
Anyway,

538
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:13,865
Mu finally felt relieved

539
00:38:15,105 --> 00:38:16,946
and passed away peacefully.

540
00:38:18,305 --> 00:38:18,986
Shiqi?

541
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:20,865
Yeah.

542
00:38:21,785 --> 00:38:23,345
Shiqi.

543
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:25,426
Well,

544
00:38:26,226 --> 00:38:29,865
he used to work at Rejuvenation Hall.

545
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,426
Afterwards,

546
00:38:33,026 --> 00:38:36,145
although he left Qingshui Town,

547
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:40,065
he would come back to visit us

548
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:43,865
every few years.

549
00:38:45,145 --> 00:38:49,065
He's like our family.

550
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:53,026
Just like family.

551
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:21,466
You're still in the mood to read?

552
00:39:21,946 --> 00:39:23,825
You're still in the mood to read?

553
00:39:25,506 --> 00:39:27,345
Do you know the Great Princess
of Haoling is missing?

554
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:28,825
Both Their Majesties looked for her

555
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,385
all over Dahuang but failed to find her.

556
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:39,266
I'm talking to you.

557
00:39:40,026 --> 00:39:42,625
Your beloved one has gone missing.

558
00:39:42,785 --> 00:39:44,226
She's missing.

559
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:46,226
Even Their Majesties can't find her.

560
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:48,345
What do you think I can do?

561
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:52,272
That's true.

562
00:39:53,385 --> 00:39:54,746
There is nothing you can do.

563
00:39:59,145 --> 00:39:59,696
No.

564
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:01,506
It's weird.

565
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,266
You look too calm.

566
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:08,466
This is not you.

567
00:40:12,305 --> 00:40:13,226
How's Fenglong doing?

568
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:14,706
What do you think?

569
00:40:16,026 --> 00:40:17,105
At the wedding,

570
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,506
his bride ran off with an impudent man.

571
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:21,345
Nobody can take it,

572
00:40:21,825 --> 00:40:23,466
let alone Fenglong,

573
00:40:23,466 --> 00:40:25,026
who has a smooth life.

574
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:26,226
He must

575
00:40:26,506 --> 00:40:28,506
feel heartbroken.

576
00:40:35,186 --> 00:40:36,345
You go and console him.

577
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:39,266
I'm a man.

578
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:40,186
I can't console a man.

579
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,105
You can do it as the man does.

580
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:48,986
You mean

581
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:51,625
I can be his punching bag

582
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:53,186
to vent his anger?

583
00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:58,746
Are you crazy?

584
00:41:12,906 --> 00:41:14,785
This is what I've gained
from years of doing business.

585
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:18,706
Come on. You don't have to.

586
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:20,145
Cheer Fenglong up, right?

587
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:22,466
I was going to do it anyway.

588
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,506
I'll take him around to clear his mind

589
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:25,625
and be his sparring partner.

590
00:41:26,226 --> 00:41:27,625
Rest assured, I can do it.

591
00:41:40,785 --> 00:41:41,666
I remember

592
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:44,506
I haven't raised your casino's rent
for many years.

593
00:41:44,825 --> 00:41:45,456
Understood.

594
00:41:45,706 --> 00:41:47,305
I'll go to Chishui right now.

595
00:42:01,906 --> 00:42:04,266
Fangfeng Bei took away your beloved one.

596
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,145
Fangfeng Bei, remember?

597
00:42:06,906 --> 00:42:08,385
Don't you go to that place
to look for her?

598
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:10,576
I'm off.

599
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:20,625
You want me to go look for her?

600
00:42:23,145 --> 00:42:24,426
You fear if I don't look for her,

601
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:26,506
she'll be with someone else?

602
00:42:30,946 --> 00:42:31,986
Many years ago,

603
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:36,266
all I wanted was to be with her.

604
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:39,706
So I took advantage of her soft heart.

605
00:42:40,785 --> 00:42:41,906
Between Xiang Liu and me,

606
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:43,466
I didn't give her the chance to choose.

607
00:42:45,186 --> 00:42:46,825
But I failed to make her happy.

608
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,466
Now I'm giving her the chance to choose.

609
00:42:56,266 --> 00:42:57,506
That's what I owe her.
