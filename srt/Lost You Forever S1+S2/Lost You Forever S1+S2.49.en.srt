00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,146
May you have a thriving business.

00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,707
Here is a gift from our master.

5
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:53,146
Physician Yin has always been devoted

6
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:54,186
to medicinal studies.

7
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:56,027
Master thinks highly of him

8
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:56,947
and sends him

9
00:01:57,106 --> 00:01:58,466
to practice medicine here.

10
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,226
Besides,

11
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:01,307
he can discuss
medical practices with you

12
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:02,866
and share what you've learned.

13
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:04,466
I can't refuse this gift

14
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:05,506
from your master.

15
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,627
Thank you.

16
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:09,306
Looking forward to working with you.

17
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:11,867
Congratulations.

18
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,987
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

19
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:15,106
Thank you, everyone.

20
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:16,656
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

21
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:20,746
Congratulations to you.

22
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:22,586
I brought you

23
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:23,707
a modest gift.

24
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,987
Why did you join them in their nonsense?

let's give them a generous gift.

Okay.

60
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:10,507
We will.

00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:23,632
What's wrong?

62
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:24,667
Nothing.

63
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:29,827
Hurry up.

00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:31,227
A nine-tailed fox is best at tracking.

65
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,426
Tushan Jing may notice us.

66
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:34,227
Your Majesty.

67
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:40,026
Miss, you worry too much.

68
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,507
You have great spirit power

69
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:43,306
and you possess the Immortal Net.

70
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:44,586
Besides,

71
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,907
Chief Tushan got injured
and damaged his spirit power.

72
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:47,947
He is no longer

73
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:49,266
the Master Qingqiu he once was.

74
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:50,627
Rest assured, Miss.

75
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:51,586
He won't find out.

76
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,146
You surely babble a lot.

77
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:54,907
I just couldn't stand

78
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:56,146
that Princess of Haoling.

79
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:57,507
She dresses like a man

80
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,827
and acts crazy.

81
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:00,627
Chief Tushan is also shameless.

82
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,706
His wife is seriously ill,

83
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,306
yet he's courting another woman

84
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:05,107
in public.

85
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:06,640
But His Majesty does nothing.

86
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:09,746
His Majesty wants to,

87
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:12,026
but he can't.

88
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:17,547
Miss, did you
leave the palace in disguise

89
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:18,706
just to see the opening

90
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:19,907
of a stupid clinic?

91
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,507
Who are you to question my decisions?

92
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:26,107
I apologize.

93
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:33,852
(Rumor has it that Princess of Haoling
is Chi Chen's daughter.)

94
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:35,792
(We've tried,
but we couldn't trace the source.)

95
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,547
The clamorous words

96
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:48,986
may obscure the facts.

97
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,627
Are they trying to
push Xiaoyao into a corner?

98
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:55,067
I've exhausted all possible means

99
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,787
as you told me, yet I failed

100
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:58,387
to suppress the rumors.

101
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,067
I am incompetent.

102
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:01,586
Please punish me, Chief.

103
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:02,866
I am incompetent.

104
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,026
I couldn't find

105
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:04,746
the mastermind.

106
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:05,827
Please punish me.

107
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:09,227
I know you've done your best.

108
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:10,706
Get up.

109
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,146
Prepare the mounts.

110
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,547
I will go to Gu Shu

111
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,387
and Beiliu to visit

112
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:23,746
Chief Xiling and the Guifang Family.

113
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:24,667
Chief.

114
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:25,627
Please don't.

115
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,466
You haven't fully recovered.

116
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:28,706
You shouldn't travel.

117
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:29,706
Just let

118
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:31,266
Hu Zhen run the errands.

119
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:32,746
That's right.

120
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:33,746
Health comes first.

121
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:35,627
I will do my best to complete

122
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:36,387
the mission.

123
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:41,026
The person slandering Xiaoyao

124
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:43,827
is very likely from
the Chenrong or Chishui families.

125
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:45,146
I need the help

126
00:06:45,146 --> 00:06:46,907
of the Xiling and Guifang families.

127
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:48,466
Such a serious matter

128
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:50,547
requires a personal visit.

129
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:52,746
No wonder we couldn't find anything.

130
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:54,186
If it's someone from

131
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,387
the Chenrong

132
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:57,347
and Chishui families,

133
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:58,426
then it makes sense.

134
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:02,026
So it's either Chief Chishui

135
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:03,347
or the Queen of Chenrong

136
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:04,266
behind this?

137
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:05,907
I know Fenglong.

138
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:07,746
He's not like that.

139
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:08,986
What if it's

140
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:10,547
the Queen of Chenrong...

141
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:12,667
She is the queen.

142
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:13,947
And she's

143
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:16,466
supported by
the Chenrong and Chishui families.

144
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,026
Our Tushan family alone

145
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:21,706
can't deal with her.

146
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:28,627
If Xiaoyao asks,

147
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:30,426
tell her that I have

148
00:07:30,426 --> 00:07:32,266
business matters to attend to

149
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:33,507
and I'll return soon.

150
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:34,907
Tell her not to worry.

151
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,227
Understood.

152
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:48,067
Your Majesty.

153
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:49,627
The 400,000 naval troops

154
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:50,986
have been trained.

155
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,146
All the weapons

156
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,347
and provisions are in place.

157
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:55,586
The army is ready

158
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,347
to follow your orders at any time.

159
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:01,706
You truly live up to my trust.

160
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:02,864
Your Majesty.

161
00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:04,866
The army is having high morale.

162
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:06,306
If we could set off

163
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:07,186
immediately,

164
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:08,507
we would surely win.

165
00:08:11,586 --> 00:08:13,067
You are right, Fenglong.

166
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:15,986
But I still need some time

167
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:16,986
to handle something.

168
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:19,466
Please let me share your burden.

169
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:23,667
No one can help me with this.

170
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:26,466
I must handle it personally.

171
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:30,667
I take my leave.

172
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:53,104
(Rejuvenation Hall)

173
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,066
He must take his medicine on time.

174
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:56,626
Thank you, physician.

175
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,867
Don't mention it. We're neighbors.

176
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:00,826
- Come.
- Take care.

177
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,427
When did you get back?

178
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:14,427
Just now.

179
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,107
The clinic is doing quite well.

180
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:18,032
Are you tired?

181
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:19,427
I'm alright.

182
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:20,586
But you

183
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,187
haven't fully recovered,

184
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,826
yet you're running around for business.

185
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:24,907
You should

186
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:26,706
take good care of yourself.

187
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:42,586
It's good

188
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:44,747
that you're eating properly
and taking medicine.

189
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:52,107
The clinic will be closed

190
00:09:52,747 --> 00:09:54,066
for the Spring Festival, right?

191
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:56,656
That's right.

192
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:59,307
Are you going back
to Qingqiu for the ceremony?

193
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:01,667
I won't stay for more than three days.

194
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:03,266
I'll be back right after

195
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,107
the ceremony.

196
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:06,266
I'm just asking.

197
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:07,506
You make it sound like

198
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,787
I can't go a day without seeing you.

199
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:12,547
I can't go a day without seeing you.

200
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:18,667
Miao Pu.

201
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,026
Check the medicine cabinet

202
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:22,907
for a remedy for glibness.

203
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:25,706
I will check and see

204
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:27,867
if Shan Hu has put away the herbs.

205
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:37,787
After the ceremony

206
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:38,626
and the festival,

207
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:40,826
the elders will announce that

208
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:42,187
Fangfeng Yiying
passed away from illness.

209
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:44,706
For the reputation of the clan,

210
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,386
the elders have to

211
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:47,667
put it that way.

212
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:49,787
I'll follow the customs
of the Central Plains

213
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:50,867
and mourn for a year.

214
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:52,706
Then, we can get married.

215
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:54,987
It's alright.

216
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:56,667
Come back with me

217
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,107
to Wushen Mountain after the festival

218
00:10:58,107 --> 00:10:58,907
to meet my father

219
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:00,547
and tell him everything.

220
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:02,386
As long as your father

221
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,307
doesn't disdain me.

222
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:06,386
My father doesn't
care about the superficial things.

223
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:08,107
There's nothing between

224
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:08,946
Fangfeng Yiying and you.

225
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:10,506
But even if there were something,

226
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:12,307
my father has told me that

227
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:13,506
as long as I want you,

228
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,107
he'd snatch you for me.

229
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:20,826
Back then,

230
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:22,987
it wasn't one person who ambushed you

231
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:24,787
in the plum blossom wood.

232
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,427
There were four.

233
00:11:29,747 --> 00:11:30,427
I know.

234
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:33,107
Apart from Mu Fei,

235
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:34,347
who was executed by my grandfather,

236
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:35,307
there were three others.

237
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,266
Xinyue said that they were

238
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:38,907
secretly executed by my brother.

239
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,026
Because of that,

240
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,826
the Zheng and Fan families

241
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:43,347
turned against my brother.

242
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:47,347
Why did you suddenly bring it up?

243
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:49,187
Someone

244
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,427
has been spreading rumors about it.

245
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:53,466
People are wondering

246
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:54,826
why these four people

247
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:56,026
would risk being retaliated

248
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:58,187
by the Kings of Xiyan and Haoling

249
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:00,187
just to hurt you.

250
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,747
(Chi Chen wiped out your clan.)

251
00:12:03,227 --> 00:12:04,466
(What does it have to do with me?)

252
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:06,826
What does Chi Chen have to do with you?

253
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:08,946
Stop pretending.

254
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,187
Chi Chen killed all our families.

255
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:13,506
Today,

256
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:15,867
we will kill his only daughter.

257
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,826
Are they saying that

258
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:22,066
I'm Chi Chen's vile daughter?

259
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:23,987
Xiaoyao.

260
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:25,787
Don't speak of yourself that way.

261
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:29,787
People can talk.

262
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:33,506
Let them say whatever they like.

263
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:35,586
I can't control it anyway.

264
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:53,107
This has been

265
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:56,386
my worst nightmare since I was young.

266
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:00,826
I'm scared that
I'm truly Chi Chen's daughter.

267
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,146
I would rather wander about

268
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:05,547
and suffer

269
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,227
than see my father on Wushen Mountain.

270
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:13,347
I thought that it was over.

271
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:17,187
But I didn't expect

272
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:20,307
that the nightmare
has caught up with me again.

273
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:26,386
Don't be afraid.

274
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:28,826
Let's face it together.

275
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,266
If everyone believes

276
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:38,747
that I'm the daughter of Chi Chen,

277
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,466
and everyone hates me,

278
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:45,066
will you...

279
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:52,386
Don't be silly.

280
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:54,626
When you saved me,

281
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:56,066
you were just you,

282
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:57,787
not anyone's daughter.

283
00:13:58,667 --> 00:13:59,626
I decided right then

284
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:00,907
to be with you for life.

285
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,266
You're way too honest.

286
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:25,826
Princess offered to take you

287
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,227
to meet her father.

288
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,787
Can't you wait

289
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:30,787
for him

290
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:32,427
to approve of your marriage

291
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:33,506
before telling

292
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:34,907
the princess about the rumors?

293
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:39,026
I failed to suppress the rumor
with all three clans'

294
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:40,227
joint efforts.

295
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,187
We can't conceal it.

296
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:44,266
I'd rather tell Xiaoyao in person

297
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:45,227
than let her

298
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:47,066
hear it from others.

299
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:50,227
Princess may have offended

300
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,826
the Chishui and Chenrong families

301
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:52,987
on the wedding day.

302
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:54,547
But Their Majesties

303
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:56,146
have apologized many times.

304
00:14:56,506 --> 00:14:57,427
And Princess, too.

305
00:14:58,227 --> 00:14:59,386
But the Queen of Chenrong

306
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,626
still held a grudge

307
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:01,547
against her.

308
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,706
I really don't know how

309
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:04,626
it's going to end.

310
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:13,146
I have something to report.

311
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:15,056
Bring it here.

312
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:16,592
Understood.

313
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,280
Your Majesty.

314
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,427
Dahuang is rife with rumors, saying that

315
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:23,026
the Great Princess of Haoling

316
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:24,547
is the daughter of the devil Chi Chen.

317
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:26,026
Everyone in Xi Jiang

318
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:27,347
and the Central Plains

319
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,946
is cursing the Great Princess.

320
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:30,266
We fear the rumors

321
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:32,066
might harm Your Majesty's reputation.

322
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:33,586
We advise Your Majesty

323
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:35,227
to send the Great Princess

324
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:36,946
back to Haoling.

325
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:39,187
- Seconded.
- Seconded.

326
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:40,747
The wise fear calamity.

327
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,026
Fools fear punishment.

328
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:44,466
Words can be used to hurt people

329
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:46,987
as an extreme punishment.

330
00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:50,626
I didn't expect my ministers

331
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:53,626
would also be swayed by rumors.

332
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:54,227
Your Majesty.

333
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:55,506
There's no smoke

334
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:56,586
without fire.

335
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:57,987
If the rumors are false,

336
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:01,706
why should I send the princess back?

337
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,547
If the rumors are true,

338
00:16:03,706 --> 00:16:06,826
then the Great Princess has nothing

339
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,787
to do with Haoling.

340
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:11,386
How could I send her back to Haoling?

341
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:11,987
Your Majesty.

342
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,386
A wise man foresees and mitigates risks.

343
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:16,427
Always prevent disaster in advance.

344
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:18,987
Please expel
the Great Princess of Haoling

345
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:20,266
from Chenrong Mountain.

346
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:26,307
Haoling Jiuyao

347
00:16:26,307 --> 00:16:29,107
is the daughter of the Princess General
of the Xiyan Kingdom.

348
00:16:29,107 --> 00:16:32,547
She is the granddaughter recognized

349
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:34,907
by our most venerable Great Emperor.

350
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:36,266
If she's not allowed

351
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:39,066
to reside in Chenrong Mountain,

352
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:40,826
then are you going to

353
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:42,946
kick me out, too?

354
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,107
- We dare not.
- We dare not.

355
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:46,946
- Please calm down.
- Please calm down.

356
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:50,547
My esteemed ministers,

357
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:52,386
no matter whether Haoling Jiuyao

358
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,386
is the Great Princess of Haoling,

359
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:56,466
she is and will always be

360
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:59,107
the daughter of the Princess General.

361
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:02,107
If anyone dares to harbor ill intent

362
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:04,667
and act recklessly,

363
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:07,067
take the warning

364
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:12,146
from what happened to Mu Fei.

365
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:14,106
- We dare not.
- We dare not.

366
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,146
Princess.

367
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:28,467
All of these are from

368
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:29,547
the King of Haoling.

369
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:32,746
These are all from Father?

370
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:34,266
Yes.

371
00:17:34,707 --> 00:17:35,547
Brocaded satin clothes,

372
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,266
jewelry, spirit herbs,
and spiritual medicine.

373
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,386
And a huge box

374
00:17:38,386 --> 00:17:39,307
of Fusang Tree.

375
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:45,187
There is also a letter to you.

376
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:53,506
(With all the rumors)

377
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,106
(and gossip around,)

378
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:58,986
(I fear you may find it dreadful
and feel uneasy.)

379
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,266
(The rolling ball stops in a pit.)

380
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:04,226
(Gossip stops with the wise.)

381
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:07,667
(One who possesses inner goodness
fears not of slanders.)

382
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:11,947
(One who possesses no inner goodness
won't be praised.)

383
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:14,746
(Think of my words and stay strong.)

384
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:18,266
(Sleep well and eat well.)

385
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:21,680
Jing.

386
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:22,667
Come back with me

387
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:24,746
to see my father after the festival.

388
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:26,000
Alright.

389
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:27,947
When are you leaving?

390
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:29,307
The elders of your family

391
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:30,226
must be expecting you.

392
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:32,707
I'll leave tomorrow morning.

393
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:35,707
See you next year then.

394
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:36,787
Chief Tushan.

395
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,226
See you next year.

396
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:06,986
Your Majesty.

397
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:09,067
Is His Majesty here?

398
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:10,746
Your Majesty.

399
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:12,707
His Majesty sent a message that

400
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,427
he won't wait
for the new year to come with you.

401
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:33,986
I am the queen.

402
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:36,827
If he doesn't

403
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,427
come to me on the Spring Festival's Eve,

404
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:41,986
where can he go?

405
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:43,667
Please don't overthink.

406
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:45,986
His Majesty is not neglecting you

407
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:47,307
and favoring another consort.

408
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:48,907
He went to Xiaoyue Peak

409
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:51,026
to show filial piety

410
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:52,427
to the Great Emperor.

411
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:57,067
Please calm down.

412
00:19:58,547 --> 00:19:59,506
I used to worry

413
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:03,467
that other consorts
would compete with me.

414
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:05,307
Now,

415
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:08,266
I'd be glad if His Majesty

416
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:09,947
could go to the other consorts.

417
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:11,427
At least, I would

418
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:13,067
be able to fight for his love.

419
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,106
Filial piety comes first.

420
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,506
Linglan.

421
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:21,907
His Majesty

422
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,427
doesn't even allow us to compete.

423
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:26,626
Your Majesty.

424
00:20:27,307 --> 00:20:28,346
You may leave.

425
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:31,547
Remove everything out there.

426
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:41,386
Haoling Jiuyao.

427
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:50,626
I toast to you.

428
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:51,667
Okay.

429
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:55,986
I wish you shine as bright as the moon,

430
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:57,307
rise like the sun,

431
00:20:57,707 --> 00:20:59,067
stay as unyielding

432
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:00,587
as the mountain

433
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:02,106
and remain exuberant

434
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:03,346
as eternal green.

435
00:21:04,226 --> 00:21:04,752
Alright.

436
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:06,160
Cheers.

437
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:12,866
Dig in.

438
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:18,986
Have you forgotten

439
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:20,787
something?

440
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:22,226
Not really.

441
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:26,827
I remember now.

442
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:28,067
I wish you...

443
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,667
I wish you

444
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:33,587
an everlasting reign

445
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:34,787
and many beauties.

446
00:21:36,986 --> 00:21:38,266
So insincere.

447
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:39,408
Try again.

448
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:42,187
Grandfather.

449
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:43,707
- Just say...
- Grandfather.

450
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:46,907
Fine.

451
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:49,226
Then I wish you have

452
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:52,346
helpful supporters,

453
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:54,026
an absolute authority,

454
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,307
a great reputation,

455
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,026
and the respect of the people.

456
00:21:58,427 --> 00:21:59,587
That's more like it.

457
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:01,266
Such a fuss.

458
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:06,947
Stop drinking.

459
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:08,467
You're getting drunk.

460
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:12,547
There's no court meeting tomorrow.

461
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:14,346
It's fine if I get drunk.

462
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:24,667
Grandfather.

463
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:28,226
Whose daughter am I?

464
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:40,146
Are you still bothered by the rumors?

465
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:44,506
You are the daughter
of the Princess General of Xiyan.

466
00:22:44,787 --> 00:22:49,266
You are my recognized granddaughter.

467
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:52,907
This will never change.

468
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:00,226
So you don't know, either.

469
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:03,026
If you don't know,

470
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:04,707
then no one

471
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:06,866
would know in this world.

472
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:07,707
Xiaoyao.

473
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:10,106
With me here,

474
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:13,026
no one can harm you.

475
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,266
And Xiyan

476
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,707
will also always be your home.

477
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:19,760
Alright.

478
00:23:43,907 --> 00:23:45,146
No matter what others say,

479
00:23:46,746 --> 00:23:48,547
I will always be Haoling Jiuyao.

480
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:52,827
As long as my father acknowledges me,

481
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:56,907
I will always be his daughter.

482
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,350
(Zhiyi)

483
00:24:11,947 --> 00:24:12,587
Does it

484
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:14,106
remind you of something?

485
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:16,986
Our days in Qingshui Town.

486
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:18,427
That's right.

487
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:19,386
Wen Xiaoliu.

488
00:24:19,587 --> 00:24:20,144
Xuan.

489
00:24:20,307 --> 00:24:20,907
Ye Shiqi.

490
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:22,266
Ye Shiqi.

491
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:24,026
You promised to treat us

492
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:25,026
to a meal.

493
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:26,106
But you haven't done so

494
00:24:26,106 --> 00:24:27,026
in so many years.

495
00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:29,026
He'll make up for it today.

496
00:24:30,506 --> 00:24:31,506
What would you like to eat?

497
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:33,506
It's so cold.

498
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:34,667
Of course, grills.

499
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,827
And some liquor.

500
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:36,866
Wouldn't that be nice?

501
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:39,146
That's a good idea.

502
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:42,707
Where can we find a grill place?

503
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:47,587
Let's ask someone.

504
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:50,866
You two only know about court affairs,

505
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,266
but not daily life.

506
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:53,467
Follow me.

507
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:08,187
It's still here!

508
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:09,827
This grill restaurant

509
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:11,866
is the cleanest and has the best food

510
00:25:11,947 --> 00:25:13,266
among everything I've tried.

511
00:25:13,986 --> 00:25:15,106
But it's been years.

512
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:16,626
I don't know how their food is now.

513
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,986
This place is hidden deep in the alley.

514
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,146
How did you know about it?

515
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:23,346
An old friend once brought me here.

516
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:24,266
Fangfeng Bei?

517
00:25:29,787 --> 00:25:30,307
I'm hungry.

518
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,346
Let's go eat and talk.

519
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:49,667
Coming.

520
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,067
- Go.
- Take care.

521
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:58,667
Dear guests,

522
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:00,067
enjoy the meal.

523
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:10,907
I haven't enjoyed food for a long time.

524
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:13,827
The palace food is too exquisite

525
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:15,386
and loses its fun.

526
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:17,307
We should eat out more often.

527
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:20,106
How can you get to

528
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:21,266
enjoy everything?

529
00:26:21,907 --> 00:26:23,026
A child of wealth

530
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:24,986
won't put himself in danger.

531
00:26:25,947 --> 00:26:27,467
You've made it to the throne,

532
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:29,547
so forget about the commoner's life.

533
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:32,626
But I want it all.

534
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:33,827
Fine.

535
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:34,386
You want it all.

536
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:36,146
Anyway, it's Xiaoxiao and not me

537
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:37,787
who is getting bothered.

538
00:26:39,947 --> 00:26:40,787
What a sharp tongue.

539
00:26:40,787 --> 00:26:41,707
You have to win, huh?

540
00:26:47,427 --> 00:26:48,947
Xiaoyao only talks tough to you.

541
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:51,187
But she always favors you.

542
00:26:51,707 --> 00:26:53,307
She's all smiley to others

543
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:54,506
but she doesn't favor them.

544
00:26:58,626 --> 00:26:59,787
Someone finds me sharp-tongued.

545
00:27:00,226 --> 00:27:00,787
Alright.

546
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:04,626
Thank you.

547
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:08,787
I want some.

548
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:12,067
I have to get fed to remain

549
00:27:12,226 --> 00:27:13,866
sharp-tongued.

550
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:14,866
Do it yourself.

551
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:17,947
I don't grill as well as you do.

552
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:19,312
Do it yourself.

553
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:20,947
This way please.

554
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:23,427
What would you like?

555
00:27:24,106 --> 00:27:26,226
Some lamb with a mix of fat and lean.

556
00:27:26,827 --> 00:27:27,707
And fine wine.

557
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:29,827
Grilled meat can be greasy.

558
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:31,907
Bring some fresh vegetables.

559
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,266
If there aren't any,

560
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:34,067
pickles will do.

561
00:27:34,146 --> 00:27:34,787
Alright then.

562
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:35,626
Be right back.

563
00:27:36,746 --> 00:27:37,427
What's wrong?

564
00:27:37,427 --> 00:27:38,226
What are you looking at?

565
00:27:38,307 --> 00:27:38,947
You know them?

566
00:27:39,947 --> 00:27:40,907
General Liyuan.

567
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,746
Why have they gone silent?

568
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:50,866
Silencing spell.

569
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:52,907
This isn't fair.

570
00:27:53,146 --> 00:27:54,827
We didn't want them to misunderstand.

571
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:57,026
So we didn't cast the spell.

572
00:27:57,346 --> 00:27:59,226
Why did they cast the spell instead?

573
00:28:00,707 --> 00:28:02,746
Wouldn't it be fun if they were

574
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:03,986
badmouthing you in secret?

575
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:06,947
Jing.

576
00:28:06,947 --> 00:28:07,866
Do you have a way?

577
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:09,506
I want to hear them.

578
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:14,026
You placed an order.

579
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,226
I'll have to find a way.

580
00:28:24,626 --> 00:28:25,266
It's good.

581
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,547
Please enjoy.

582
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:28,784
Uncle.

583
00:28:29,587 --> 00:28:30,187
Uncle.

584
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:31,866
Have you heard

585
00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:33,226
the rumors about the princess?

586
00:28:33,427 --> 00:28:33,947
Yeah.

587
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:36,707
You were good friends

588
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:38,787
with the Princess General.

589
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:41,187
Do you know the father

590
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:42,547
of the Great Princess?

591
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:44,226
Brother-in-law.

592
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:47,467
The three of us are close relatives.

593
00:28:47,746 --> 00:28:48,827
Why are you keeping secrets?

594
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:49,712
Exactly.

595
00:28:49,986 --> 00:28:50,947
We're here to

596
00:28:50,947 --> 00:28:51,986
enjoy the meal.

597
00:28:52,346 --> 00:28:53,746
Don't listen to the gossip.

598
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:54,672
Jing.

599
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:00,626
Let's keep listening.

600
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:02,787
Back then,

601
00:29:03,386 --> 00:29:05,707
I only served under Princess General

602
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:07,506
and never talked to her

603
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:08,506
in private.

604
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:10,226
So I don't know

605
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:12,386
who's the father of the princess.

606
00:29:14,106 --> 00:29:14,827
However,

607
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:16,187
one morning

608
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:17,427
while we were on patrol,

609
00:29:17,827 --> 00:29:18,907
we saw Princess General

610
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:20,346
returning with Chi Chen

611
00:29:20,506 --> 00:29:21,467
and hugging him.

612
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:23,427
The soldiers were shocked.

613
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:24,346
We surrounded them

614
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:25,986
and asked what had happened.

615
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:28,626
Princess General confessed to everyone

616
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:31,667
that she was
having an affair with Chi Chen.

617
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,827
We were all very shocked.

618
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:36,067
We thought we had misheard her.

619
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:37,626
But Princess General

620
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:38,746
repeated herself loudly.

621
00:29:39,506 --> 00:29:42,226
"I have liked Chi Chen
for several hundred years."

622
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:43,947
She was shouting as if

623
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:45,547
she wished to be heard by the world.

624
00:29:45,986 --> 00:29:46,800
Why...

625
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,226
Why is that?

626
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:51,506
Chi Chen was a merciless devil.

627
00:29:56,307 --> 00:29:58,226
I know you're asking about it

628
00:29:58,827 --> 00:30:00,746
not just because of the rumors.

629
00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:03,986
I bet someone
with a grudge against Chi Chen

630
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:06,587
is persuading you
to persecute the princess.

631
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:08,707
I warn you.

632
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:10,787
As long as General Yinglong and I

633
00:30:10,787 --> 00:30:11,547
are alive,

634
00:30:11,827 --> 00:30:13,827
we won't allow anyone in the army

635
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:15,707
to hurt the daughter
of Princess General.

636
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:16,707
But Uncle...

637
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:17,787
There are no "buts".

638
00:30:18,547 --> 00:30:19,226
Understood.

639
00:30:19,746 --> 00:30:20,386
Understood.

640
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:23,026
There is too much helplessness

641
00:30:23,106 --> 00:30:23,947
and cruelty

642
00:30:24,547 --> 00:30:26,067
beyond your understanding.

643
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:27,707
You don't know

644
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,427
that the Princess General
has given up everything

645
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:33,187
so that you don't have to experience it.

646
00:30:35,307 --> 00:30:36,907
Chi Chen was our enemy.

647
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:38,746
But Chi Chen deserved

648
00:30:38,746 --> 00:30:40,346
the Princess General's affection.

649
00:30:43,827 --> 00:30:44,912
- Brother-in-law.
- Uncle.

650
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:45,827
- Brother-in-law.
- Uncle.

651
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:46,506
Sir...

652
00:30:46,506 --> 00:30:48,467
Let me explain, brother-in-law.

653
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:49,667
You haven't eaten...

654
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:50,226
Brother-in-law.

655
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:51,667
Xiaoyao.

656
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:15,266
You heard them.

657
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,427
I might really

658
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:20,226
be Chi Chen's daughter.

659
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:21,787
Whoever your father is,

660
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:24,587
you will always be
the person closest to me.

661
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:26,928
Xiaoyao.

662
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:28,187
You are you,

663
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,067
not anyone's daughter.

664
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:31,187
I'm alright.

665
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:32,427
I'm going for a walk.

666
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:33,506
Xiaoyao.

667
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,266
Xiaoyao.

668
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:35,026
Don't follow me.

669
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:36,467
Leave me alone for a while.

670
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:48,667
Xiaoxiao.

671
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:53,067
Send someone after her.

672
00:31:53,552 --> 00:31:54,096
Understood.

673
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:00,707
They will escort her
back to Xiaoyue Peak.

674
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:02,707
Go back and rest.

675
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:04,667
Why did you do it?

676
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:18,386
How did you find out?

677
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:19,907
I once suspected

678
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:21,067
the queen as the mastermind.

679
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,106
I did everything I could

680
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:24,746
but failed to stop the rumors.

681
00:32:25,947 --> 00:32:27,067
So I suspect that

682
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:29,346
the queen is not the mastermind.

683
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:31,587
If you didn't want to

684
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:32,787
spoil the fun for Xiaoyao,

685
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:34,106
General Liyuan

686
00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:35,506
wouldn't even be able to enter.

687
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:38,346
The only explanation is

688
00:32:38,986 --> 00:32:39,787
that you want her

689
00:32:39,787 --> 00:32:41,386
to run into them.

690
00:32:43,346 --> 00:32:45,986
Fenglong keeps saying that you're

691
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:47,106
observant and clever.

692
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:49,266
I didn't believe him.

693
00:32:49,986 --> 00:32:50,866
But now it seems

694
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,346
that you deserve his compliments.

695
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,760
Your Majesty.

696
00:32:56,427 --> 00:32:57,907
Xiaoyao is clever enough
to figure it out.

697
00:32:58,587 --> 00:32:59,467
She just won't believe

698
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:00,307
that you'd harm her.

699
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,707
I did it only to

700
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:02,626
protect her.

701
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:11,427
You have grand ambitions.

702
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:12,787
I dare not say much.

703
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:15,746
But please look after her.

704
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,427
(If I'm not Haoling Jiuyao,)

705
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:41,187
(who am I?)

706
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:45,026
(The daughter of the devil Chi Chen?)

707
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,386
You have sharp eyes, Miss.

708
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:12,907
This lantern adopts exquisite materials.

709
00:34:12,947 --> 00:34:13,826
It's finely crafted

710
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,786
with a unique design.

711
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:17,866
You can't find a second one like it.

712
00:34:18,187 --> 00:34:18,800
Miss,

713
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:20,306
it consists of six pictures,

714
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,707
depicting the great battle between

715
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:24,386
Princess General and Chi Chen.

716
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:25,392
Miss, look.

717
00:34:26,786 --> 00:34:27,667
This first picture

718
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:31,467
depicts the devil Chi Chen
slaughtering his kin.

719
00:34:32,227 --> 00:34:34,947
The second picture
depicts the devil Chi Chen

720
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,907
attacking Xiyan,

721
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:37,907
committing all kinds of crimes.

722
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,907
The devil Chi Chen
massacred people, leaving a trail

723
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:42,106
of dead bodies.

724
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:44,227
This picture

725
00:34:44,546 --> 00:34:47,066
depicts our Princess General
taking command

726
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:48,586
in a crisis

727
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:49,826
and going to war.

728
00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:53,680
Miss.

729
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:54,427
Miss.

730
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:55,507
We can negotiate the price.

731
00:35:05,947 --> 00:35:06,987
Sir.

732
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:08,267
Look at this lamp.

733
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:13,360
Sir.

734
00:35:30,386 --> 00:35:31,386
Is anyone there?

735
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:33,987
Grandpa.

736
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:36,306
Grandpa.

737
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,688
(Tablet of Lirong Ji)

738
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,507
You're the daughter of Princess General?

739
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:18,227
And your father?

740
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:19,586
I am the Princess of Haoling.

741
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:21,346
So, my father is the King of Haoling.

742
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:48,586
Grandpa.

743
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:52,467
They all say that

744
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:55,507
you are Chi Chen's general.

745
00:36:57,346 --> 00:36:59,306
You must be well-acquainted with him.

746
00:37:01,907 --> 00:37:03,667
I wonder if you know my mother.

747
00:37:11,907 --> 00:37:13,987
Actually, I've always wanted

748
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:16,866
to meet you

749
00:37:18,427 --> 00:37:19,546
and talk to you.

750
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:22,066
But I dare not.

751
00:37:24,947 --> 00:37:26,227
I've been avoiding

752
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:28,467
everything about Chi Chen.

753
00:37:32,146 --> 00:37:32,826
Now,

754
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:35,267
I can't escape anymore.

755
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:39,667
I've finally mustered
the courage to come here.

756
00:37:43,707 --> 00:37:45,427
But you're no longer here.

757
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:51,467
Grandpa.

758
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:56,306
I have so many questions to ask you.

759
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:03,667
Am I Chi Chen's daughter?

760
00:38:06,586 --> 00:38:09,306
What happened between
my mother and Chi Chen?

761
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:33,507
Everyone hates him.

762
00:38:36,386 --> 00:38:39,707
Everyone hates him, and I hate him too.

763
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:43,106
I just want someone who doesn't hate him

764
00:38:43,106 --> 00:38:44,386
to tell me

765
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:47,227
what kind of person he was.

766
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,306
I just want you to tell me

767
00:38:50,306 --> 00:38:52,306
not to hate him.

768
00:38:56,786 --> 00:38:58,467
No matter where I go,

769
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,947
everyone is cursing him.

770
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:05,907
Perhaps you are the only one
in this world

771
00:39:05,907 --> 00:39:07,786
who wouldn't curse him.

772
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:12,386
But you're also gone.

773
00:39:15,346 --> 00:39:16,947
You're also gone.

774
00:39:53,146 --> 00:39:53,786
Who is there?

775
00:40:07,586 --> 00:40:08,386
Xiang Liu?

776
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:25,907
Why are you hiding there?

777
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:27,826
Are you laughing at me?

778
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:30,427
Be reasonable, okay?

779
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:32,866
I'm paying respects to a friend.

780
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:34,907
You suddenly came.

781
00:40:36,106 --> 00:40:37,507
You disturbed me.

782
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:39,467
Besides,

783
00:40:41,386 --> 00:40:42,786
what's so laughable about you?

784
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:46,467
Haven't you heard?

785
00:40:47,826 --> 00:40:49,027
I am the daughter of Chi Chen.

786
00:40:54,187 --> 00:40:55,306
So that's what's it about.

787
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:00,346
What's funny about that?

788
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:03,507
Tell me about it.

789
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,826
So the rumors are true.

790
00:41:13,227 --> 00:41:15,667
You really are the daughter

791
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:16,907
of Chi Chen.

792
00:41:17,146 --> 00:41:17,826
Shut up.

793
00:41:30,027 --> 00:41:31,667
You suddenly have a new father,

794
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:35,267
who is an infamous devil.

795
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:39,866
It's indeed hard to accept.

796
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:41,546
Shut up.

797
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:47,027
You don't know Chi Chen.

798
00:41:48,427 --> 00:41:49,987
But you must know your mother.

799
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:52,667
She chose Chi Chen.

800
00:41:53,626 --> 00:41:54,707
Then you should

801
00:41:54,707 --> 00:41:55,667
trust her judgment.

802
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:57,907
I said shut up.

803
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:02,027
No matter what,

804
00:42:04,227 --> 00:42:05,146
at least you know

805
00:42:05,146 --> 00:42:06,427
who your parents are.

806
00:42:07,707 --> 00:42:08,707
You're better than me.

807
00:42:10,546 --> 00:42:11,546
I'm a demonic creature

808
00:42:11,546 --> 00:42:12,987
that crawled out of an egg

809
00:42:14,027 --> 00:42:14,866
and I have no idea

810
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:15,947
who my parents are.

811
00:42:17,947 --> 00:42:18,826
As you know,

812
00:42:20,106 --> 00:42:21,187
I have nine heads.

813
00:42:22,346 --> 00:42:23,667
So I eat more than others.

814
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:27,947
I've been struggling
to make a living since young.

815
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:30,306
My life has been miserable.

816
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,546
People tried to hit me or kill me.

817
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:35,707
Sometimes, my nine heads

818
00:42:37,507 --> 00:42:38,907
fought among themselves.

819
00:42:40,546 --> 00:42:41,826
Once, I was starving.

820
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,027
One of my heads

821
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:46,546
almost

822
00:42:46,546 --> 00:42:48,106
ate another one.

823
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:52,907
Really?

824
00:42:56,987 --> 00:42:57,586
