00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:32,880
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:35,297
- Are you from Haoling?
- Just die.

4
00:01:42,857 --> 00:01:44,537
You are shameless, heartless,

5
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:45,537
and despicable.

6
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:50,818
Our people from Haoling

7
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,857
raised you and taught you skills.

8
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:54,778
You don't feel grateful

9
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:56,418
and betray us.

10
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,738
You lead troops to take over
cities in Haoling

11
00:01:58,738 --> 00:01:59,897
and kill our people.

12
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:00,937
If we had known this,

13
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:02,537
we would have never raised you.

14
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:04,178
A dog is even more loyal than you.

15
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:09,538
And Cang Xuan.

16
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,137
He's also heartless,

17
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:12,378
sly, and shameless.

18
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:14,738
Both of you

19
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:15,818
are shameless.

20
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:24,378
You can insult me.
Show respect to His Majesty.

21
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:25,458
No way.

22
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:30,098
You shrew.

23
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:30,818
I will insult him.

24
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:32,217
Cang Xuan is sly,

25
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:33,697
shameless,

26
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:34,937
and heartless.

27
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:35,600
Shut up.

28
00:02:36,178 --> 00:02:37,057
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

29
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,417
Shameless.

30
00:02:38,497 --> 00:02:39,338
Go ahead.

31
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:40,137
Come on.

32
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:43,057
Kill me.

33
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:44,336
You shrew.

34
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:45,258
Let me go.

35
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:47,098
I'll tie you up.

36
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:55,657
Perfect timing.

37
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:57,057
She's a shrew.

38
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,657
What do we do with her?

39
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:03,258
Why is it her?

40
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:04,178
General, you know her?

41
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:05,378
She is a troublemaker.

42
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:11,057
Are you alright?

43
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:11,937
Are you injured?

44
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:14,217
You deserve to be scolded if you do it.

45
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:15,458
You lackey.

46
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:17,258
Just like your master Cang Xuan,

47
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:18,417
you're heartless,

48
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:19,378
despicable, and shameless.

49
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:20,258
Chief Tushan.

50
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:21,497
Let me gag her.

51
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:23,538
Yu Jiang.

52
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:25,657
Bring it on!

53
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,057
What will you do?

54
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:31,777
Where are you going?

55
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,297
Come back!

56
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:35,018
Yu Jiang!

57
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,297
Come back!

58
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:37,338
Yu Jiang!

59
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,697
I haven't finished scolding yet.

60
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:39,937
Stop.

61
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:41,538
Yu Jiang!

62
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:43,178
Are you going out just like this?

63
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:53,657
Look at where you are.

64
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:55,417
This is Xiyan's military camp.

65
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:56,538
There are men everywhere.

66
00:03:56,657 --> 00:03:57,978
If you go out just like this,

67
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,137
you will disgrace Haoling.

68
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,297
How about I order someone

69
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:07,018
to bring you hot water and clean clothes

70
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,697
to let you freshen up

71
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:09,738
before you curse at them?

72
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:11,777
After all, Yu Jiang can't escape.

73
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:13,338
Alright then.

74
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:21,137
When I catch that bad guy, Yu Jiang,

75
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:22,377
I will kill him.

76
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:24,817
Nian.

77
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:26,297
Nian.

78
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:28,377
Are you alright?

79
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:33,218
Are you injured?

80
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:35,137
Tell me.

81
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:38,257
Cang Xuan.

82
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,058
Are you scared?

83
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:05,857
How could Master allow you to run out?

84
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:08,817
Let me send you back
to Wushen Mountain, okay?

85
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:13,424
Xuan.

86
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,218
Please.

87
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:18,178
Can you please stop attacking Haoling?

88
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:20,018
My father truly suffers.

89
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:21,697
His hair has turned white now.

90
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,097
And his health is getting worse.

91
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:25,218
He even can't walk now.

92
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:27,338
Xuan.

93
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:28,938
Xuan, I'm begging you.

94
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:29,857
Please.

95
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:31,377
I'm begging you.

96
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:32,977
You used to promise me

97
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:34,778
anything, didn't you?

98
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:35,344
This time,

99
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:37,618
can you promise me again?

100
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,080
Xuan.

101
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:43,577
Nian.

102
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,498
This time, I cannot promise you.

103
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:52,857
If Xiaoyao is the daughter

104
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:54,178
of my father,

105
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:55,738
and she begs you,

106
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:56,697
will you also refuse?

107
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:59,697
Ten years ago, Xiaoyao pleaded with me.

108
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:01,458
I made this decision

109
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,297
as the ruler of a nation.

110
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:03,218
I will never change it

111
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:04,417
because of you

112
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:05,857
or Xiaoyao.

113
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:48,297
Nian.

114
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,417
I know you will hate me.

115
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:54,178
I also know that it sounds hypocritical.

116
00:06:54,377 --> 00:06:55,938
But this is truly what I thought.

117
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:58,697
Some matters concern the Xiyan Kingdom

118
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:00,537
and the Haoling Kingdom.

119
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:02,377
Some matters concern me

120
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:04,058
and your father.

121
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:05,738
But for me,

122
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:07,338
you are still Nian.

123
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,697
And I am still your brother.

124
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,778
I can promise you anything

125
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,498
if it doesn't
involve the national interest.

126
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:06,857
You liar.

127
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,257
What are you looking at?

128
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:10,977
You're just like Cang Xuan.

129
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:12,817
Both of you are heartless liars.

130
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,417
I hate you both.

131
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:17,977
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:20,938
When I found out

133
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:22,257
Cang Xuan was going to attack Haoling,

134
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:24,458
the war had already started.

135
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,018
I had a big fight with him

136
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,297
and even hurt him.

137
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:31,498
But he still didn't change his mind.

138
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:38,298
Did you really plead with him
for Haoling?

139
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:39,497
I did.

140
00:08:40,257 --> 00:08:41,937
And we've in a silent standoff
for a while.

141
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:47,937
I never deceived you

142
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:49,298
into treating me as your sister.

143
00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:54,418
I truly wanted to be your sister.

144
00:08:55,257 --> 00:08:56,057
But...

145
00:08:58,817 --> 00:08:59,497
But what?

146
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:01,257
Back then,

147
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:02,658
I didn't know

148
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:04,418
my biological father was Chi Chen.

149
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:06,577
So after you found out,

150
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:07,978
you didn't want to be my sister?

151
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:10,577
Nian.

152
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,377
It's not like that.

153
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:14,257
The King of Haoling

154
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:17,218
revoked my clan membership.

155
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:20,778
He didn't allow me to use Haoling
as my surname anymore.

156
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:28,978
If you can't come to Wushen Mountain,

157
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:31,298
at least you should have told me.

158
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:36,298
I've been waiting for you.

159
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,377
Waiting for me?

160
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:40,658
Of course.

161
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:42,418
You promised to teach me to swim,

162
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:43,898
grill fish for me,

163
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:45,177
and catch crabs with me.

164
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:47,218
You liar.

165
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:48,858
You broke your promise.

166
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:52,937
So you're angry

167
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:55,577
because I broke my promise?

168
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,978
I thought it was

169
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,937
because I am Chi Chen's daughter.

170
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,098
What's wrong with that?

171
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:05,937
Can Chi Chen's daughter deceive others

172
00:10:06,218 --> 00:10:07,257
and break promises?

173
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:13,257
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:16,577
At first,

175
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:18,218
when I learned of my identity,

176
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:20,937
I felt desperate.

177
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:25,098
Everything has been a lie
since I was born.

178
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:27,697
I knew nothing,

179
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:29,817
but everyone hated me.

180
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:31,937
And everyone wanted to kill me.

181
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,137
I really didn't expect you
to wait for me.

182
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:39,098
I thought you would also look down on me

183
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:42,057
and not want to see me anymore.

184
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:47,298
Listen.

185
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:49,577
Since I've seen you as my sister,

186
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,018
you are my sister

187
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:51,898
no matter what

188
00:10:52,257 --> 00:10:53,497
your identity is.

189
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:57,538
So silly.

190
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,098
No wonder you're always bullied.

191
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:08,978
Right.

192
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:11,418
I'm so stupid.

193
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:12,858
Why am I so stupid?

194
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:16,057
Nian.

195
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:18,418
Tomorrow, I will cook grilled fish

196
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,778
and crabs for you, okay?

197
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:21,898
I've also learned new dishes recently.

198
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:22,937
I'll make them for you.

199
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:37,298
Nian, it's time to eat.

200
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:40,858
Nian.

201
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:47,538
Where is she?

202
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:53,177
Miss.

203
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:55,057
The princess has already left.

204
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,018
I missed an appointment once.

205
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:12,737
You also missed an appointment once.

206
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:15,617
We are even now.

207
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:20,418
This is for the best for both of us.

208
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,218
(Haoling's military camp)

209
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:36,458
You went alone into the enemy camp

210
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:38,418
and even attempted
to kill their general.

211
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:40,617
Who emboldened you?

212
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:46,778
Go back to the Wushen Mountain.

213
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:48,538
You must not act recklessly again.

214
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:58,697
Actually, I had the opportunity
to kill Cang Xuan.

215
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,137
He was so close to me,

216
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:03,978
with no guard against me.

217
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:05,778
If I had made a move,

218
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,298
I would have killed him.

219
00:13:12,497 --> 00:13:13,697
But back then,

220
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,298
I didn't have such a thought in my mind.

221
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:21,418
Ru Shou.

222
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:24,098
Am I really

223
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:25,377
completely useless

224
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,098
like the ministers said?

225
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,617
You're kind,

226
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:42,377
not useless.

227
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:44,778
Don't hear their nonsense.

228
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:49,257
You can cry if you want to.

229
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:01,018
I cry out loud

230
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:03,377
because I know someone loves me.

231
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:04,697
But now,

232
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:07,418
Cang Xuan is not here.

233
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,377
And my father is sick.

234
00:14:11,177 --> 00:14:12,617
I should be a bit more sensible

235
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:14,177
and look after my father.

236
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:20,497
I can be your brother,

237
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:21,737
alright?

238
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:22,577
So,

239
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:26,177
do you think

240
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:28,057
I can't take care of you?

241
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:31,617
Look at me clearly.

242
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,497
Right now,

243
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:35,137
I am

244
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:37,418
a powerful general.

245
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:38,778
I'm formidable,

246
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:39,778
right?

247
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:44,778
I know you are very formidable now.

248
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,218
If so,

249
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:50,177
just forget Cang Xuan.

250
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:53,497
Okay?

251
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:01,937
I also want to forget him.

252
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,778
But how?

253
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:10,257
When I don't know what love is,

254
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:12,368
I've experienced unrequited love.

255
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:14,257
When I know what love is,

256
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:17,817
what I taste is the bitterness.

257
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:21,057
I thought
I had tasted enough bitterness.

258
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:23,218
Who knew it went bitter?

259
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:39,257
Cang Xuan, the bad guy.

260
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:43,137
Do you think you can get
whatever you want

261
00:15:43,658 --> 00:15:45,898
after being the King of Xiyan?

262
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:03,280
(Yongzhou)

263
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:09,177
Xiyan's commanding general is Yu Jiang.

264
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:15,697
Is anyone willing to go to battle?

265
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:17,338
- I am.
- I am.

266
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:19,418
Qing Lian.

267
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:22,177
Why are you silent?

268
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:25,057
General, please don't make fun of me.

269
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:27,098
I've requested several times

270
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:28,218
to fight against Yu Jiang.

271
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:29,898
But you always rejected me.

272
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:31,137
Since you won't send me

273
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:32,177
to the battlefield,

274
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,658
I have to keep silent.

275
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:36,137
You will be sent to battle.

276
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,000
What do you say?

277
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:40,898
I'll accept the command.

278
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,737
You and Yu Jiang grew up together.

279
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:44,976
You studied and practiced
martial skills with deep feelings.

280
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:47,057
But on the battlefield,

281
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:48,497
there must be no friendship.

282
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:50,057
Do you understand?

283
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,018
Yes, I do.

284
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:53,697
Yu Jiang was once the pride
of the Xihe Squad.

285
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:55,018
Everyone took pride in him.

286
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:56,458
But he betrayed us

287
00:16:56,658 --> 00:16:57,458
to serve Xiyan.

288
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,896
He even led troops to attack Haoling.

289
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,538
He's the shame of the Xihe Squad.

290
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:01,778
General, trust me.

291
00:17:02,218 --> 00:17:03,817
I will certainly do my utmost

292
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:04,857
with no mercy.

293
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:05,857
Good.

294
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:07,538
Qin Mang.

295
00:17:08,698 --> 00:17:10,377
You will face the Chishui Xian.

296
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:11,818
You cannot lose

297
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:13,418
or win.

298
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:16,097
Cannot lose or win?

299
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:17,097
What are we gonna do?

300
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:19,257
I will accomplish the mission.

301
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:42,818
Your Majesty.

302
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,018
Yu Jiang is even-tempered.

303
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:46,018
He uses troops flexibly,

304
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,377
and has never suffered a defeat.

305
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:49,617
I believe he will win this battle.

306
00:17:50,457 --> 00:17:51,377
Report.

307
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,298
Haoling sends Qing Lian
of the Xihe Squad

308
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:54,457
to fight against Yu Jiang.

309
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:58,960
Your Majesty.

310
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,898
Though Yu Jiang is
half of Xiyan lineage,

311
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:02,578
he grew up in the Xihe Squad.

312
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:04,377
Moreover, Qing Lian is his best friend.

313
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:06,298
Two of them will meet
on the battlefield.

314
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,658
Qing Lian is filled with indignation,

315
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:08,977
while Yu Jiang brims with guilt.

316
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:10,818
Yu Jiang is likely to lose.

317
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:12,377
Sooner or later,
Yu Jiang will face the people

318
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:13,648
from Xihe Squad on the battlefield.

319
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:17,418
If he can resolve his inner conflict
by losing this battle,

320
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:19,898
it might be a good thing.

321
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:23,497
That makes sense.

322
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:26,497
Ru Shou is scheming.

323
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,418
I have been wary of him

324
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:30,337
sending a general
from the Xihe Squad to fight Yu Jiang.

325
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:31,977
But he never did.

326
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,337
I thought he did that as he was worried

327
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:35,312
the general from Xihe Squad
would miss the opportunity

328
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:37,058
to fight out of personal sentiment.

329
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:38,497
Unexpectedly,

330
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:39,698
he sent Qing Lian this time.

331
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:41,778
What a surprise.

332
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:47,617
Ru Shou would rather lose
than send the people from Xihe Squad

333
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:49,617
to the battlefield.

334
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:53,818
But this time,
he sent Qing Lian to the battlefield.

335
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:57,497
Who is fighting against Chishui Xian?

336
00:18:57,617 --> 00:18:58,298
Qin Mang.

337
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,097
It's a trap.

338
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:02,818
Recall Yu Jiang quickly.

339
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:19,898
Yu Jiang.

340
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:23,178
Yu Jiang.

341
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:27,497
- General!
- General!

342
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:28,778
General!

343
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:31,778
Sorry.

344
00:19:31,857 --> 00:19:34,217
We went to look
for the pill-refining equipment.

345
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:34,778
So we're late.

346
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:35,538
Check on Yu Jiang.

347
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:36,578
Okay.

348
00:19:51,617 --> 00:19:53,257
He just can't swallow medicine.

349
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:55,418
But he is still breathing.

350
00:19:57,418 --> 00:19:58,377
Transform the medicine

351
00:19:58,418 --> 00:19:59,698
into breathable air.

352
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:02,018
Then transfer spirit power
into his body.

353
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:04,097
He will be fine after some rest.

354
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:07,457
I never heard

355
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:08,977
of this kind of method.

356
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:10,137
Jing.

357
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:17,658
Miao Pu, is the medicine ready?

358
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:18,658
Yes, it is.

359
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:58,977
The medicine has been absorbed.

360
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:01,538
Don't worry.

361
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:03,217
Yu Jiang is fine now.

362
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:06,778
Thank you, Miss.

363
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:08,457
I'm so grateful to you.

364
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:11,178
From now on, I am at your service.

365
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:12,857
Get up.

366
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:14,457
You assisted me with making medicine.

367
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:15,377
And I treated him now.

368
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:17,137
You've repaid the favor.

369
00:21:22,938 --> 00:21:24,857
Today, in the court, they proposed

370
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:27,178
to have Ru Shou marry Nian

371
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:29,457
and help her govern Haoling.

372
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:33,538
You seem to disagree.

373
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:35,018
If Your Majesty asks Ru Shou

374
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:37,298
to risk his life for Haoling,

375
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:38,857
he will certainly not hesitate.

376
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,538
But if you ask him
to marry the princess,

377
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:43,178
he might refuse you and leave us.

378
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:45,337
My daughter

379
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:47,538
is not good enough for him?

380
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:48,617
Father.

381
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:52,178
Father.

382
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:54,418
I don't want to marry Ru Shou.

383
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:55,898
Don't worry.

384
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:57,578
You don't want to marry him.

385
00:21:58,457 --> 00:21:59,818
And he doesn't want to marry you either.

386
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:03,137
Ru Shou is always unreliable.

387
00:22:03,337 --> 00:22:04,097
Unexpectedly,

388
00:22:04,217 --> 00:22:06,018
we think the same this time.

389
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:10,018
Master, how do you deal with the matter
of appointing a successor?

390
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:12,018
The Baihu and Changxi Tribes
are aggressive.

391
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:13,857
I'm afraid they won't stop.

392
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:19,497
No rush.

393
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:22,977
I'm afraid the Baihu and Changxi Tribes

394
00:22:24,337 --> 00:22:26,457
have already thought of a new strategy.

395
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:27,778
Your Majesty.

396
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:29,298
The Yongzhou City we captured

397
00:22:29,418 --> 00:22:30,217
has low walls

398
00:22:30,377 --> 00:22:31,097
with no defenses.

399
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,137
And there is a shortage of provisions.

400
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:34,977
Two leading generals
are also seriously injured.

401
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:36,938
Defending Yongzhou City is costly.

402
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:38,898
So I have ordered them to withdraw.

403
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:40,457
You're the commander.

404
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:42,778
You have the final say
in military matters.

405
00:22:44,778 --> 00:22:45,578
I'm incompetent.

406
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:47,617
I lost three cities in this battle.

407
00:22:48,377 --> 00:22:49,778
We got nothing in return.

408
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,377
It's not your fault.

409
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:55,857
Ru Shou set up this trap.

410
00:22:56,497 --> 00:22:58,457
He and I learned from the same master,

411
00:22:58,457 --> 00:22:59,778
but even I failed to notice his trap,

412
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:02,097
let alone you.

413
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:09,578
Thankfully, Xiaoyao saved Yu Jiang.

414
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:11,337
He was nearly killed.

415
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:14,898
But it is actually a good thing for him.

416
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:18,178
A good blade will reveal its true edge

417
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:20,857
after being sharpened.

418
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:23,698
Yu Jiang has always felt guilty
about Haoling.

419
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:26,058
This incident can make him understand

420
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,857
that once a choice is made,

421
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:29,058
he can't have any hesitation.

422
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:32,018
Otherwise, he and others

423
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:33,617
will be destroyed.

424
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:34,898
Ru Shou

425
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:37,538
usually looks frivolous.

426
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:39,257
Unexpectedly, he's a difficult man.

427
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:44,018
Master taught Ru Shou personally.

428
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:45,418
If he were easy to handle,

429
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:48,298
the King of Haoling
wouldn't be the king.

430
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:50,898
When will you return
to Chenrong Mountain?

431
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:52,578
After all, you're at war.

432
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,857
I'm concerned for Your Majesty's safety.

433
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,377
I was planning to return.

434
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:59,178
But I always feel
something is about to happen.

435
00:24:00,217 --> 00:24:01,337
I'll stay a bit longer.

436
00:24:01,497 --> 00:24:02,538
Report.

437
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,538
The Changxi Tribe of Haoling
sent a messenger here

438
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:06,377
to see the general.

439
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:11,257
Let him in.

440
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:12,497
Yes.

441
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:17,257
I'm Changxi Feng, the elder
from the Changxi Tribe of Haoling.

442
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:18,497
Greetings, general.

443
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:19,737
No need for formalities.

444
00:24:20,298 --> 00:24:21,178
Rise quickly.

445
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:25,377
I am here

446
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:27,418
on behalf of the Baihu
and Changxi Tribes

447
00:24:27,497 --> 00:24:29,818
to surrender to the King of Xiyan.

448
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,898
(Cheng'en Palace)

449
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:34,578
Report.

450
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:36,112
Your Majesty.

451
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:37,658
The Baihu and Changxi Tribes

452
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,617
betrayed Haoling
and surrendered to Xiyan.

453
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:43,137
They changed sides in a war.

454
00:24:43,257 --> 00:24:44,538
It's utterly shameless.

455
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:45,584
Your Majesty.

456
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,418
The Baihu and Changxi Tribes
betrayed us.

457
00:24:47,698 --> 00:24:48,538
If they're not punished,

458
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,178
I fear others will follow suit.

459
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,538
If this continues,

460
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:52,977
the nation will perish.

461
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:54,778
Yes, Your Majesty.

462
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:56,377
The Baihu and Changxi Tribes

463
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,217
betrayed us and defected to the enemy.

464
00:24:58,418 --> 00:24:59,617
They can't get away with it.

465
00:25:00,018 --> 00:25:01,818
I beseech Your Majesty
to subjugate them.

466
00:25:03,857 --> 00:25:04,497
Currently,

467
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,977
Xiyan's 400,000 troops are stationed

468
00:25:07,337 --> 00:25:08,857
in the northern Haoling.

469
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:10,497
If we send troops

470
00:25:10,497 --> 00:25:11,737
to subjugate the Baihu

471
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:14,178
and Changxi Tribes,
Xiyan's army may seize this opportunity

472
00:25:14,257 --> 00:25:15,298
to advance their forces south.

473
00:25:15,737 --> 00:25:16,737
If we don't subjugate them,

474
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:18,818
are we going

475
00:25:18,938 --> 00:25:20,578
to acquiesce to their actions?

476
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:22,018
Before fighting the enemies,

477
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:22,898
quell the traitors.

478
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:25,137
This battle is inevitable.

479
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:26,818
- Right.
- That's right.

480
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:30,938
Please issue the command
for subjugation.

481
00:25:32,058 --> 00:25:34,898
- Please issue the command.
- Please issue the command.

482
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:38,497
Convey my decree.

483
00:25:40,217 --> 00:25:41,938
The Baihu and Changxi Tribes

484
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,018
betrayed the nation,
which is unforgivable.

485
00:25:45,178 --> 00:25:47,778
I'll lead the troops

486
00:25:48,377 --> 00:25:50,298
to subjugate the Baihu
and Changxi Tribes.

487
00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:52,377
All of you...

488
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:58,418
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

489
00:26:11,097 --> 00:26:12,538
To encourage them to surrender,

490
00:26:12,898 --> 00:26:14,457
Cang Xuan has announced
he will lead the troops

491
00:26:14,457 --> 00:26:16,178
to support the Baihu and Changxi Tribes.

492
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:19,178
If you lead the army
on behalf of His Majesty,

493
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:20,898
you must be ready

494
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:22,217
to confront Cang Xuan.

495
00:26:25,857 --> 00:26:27,097
It's not too late to regret this.

496
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:37,097
I do like Cang Xuan.

497
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:39,217
But as the daughter of King

498
00:26:39,217 --> 00:26:40,217
and the princess of Haoling,

499
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:42,418
I cannot abandon my family

500
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:44,137
and our people for a man.

501
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,337
For my father and the people of Haoling,

502
00:26:48,578 --> 00:26:49,698
I can give up everything,

503
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:51,658
including Cang Xuan.

504
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:52,977
Your Highness.

505
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:54,698
You have grown up.

506
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:02,977
I was spoiled by my father, Ru Shou

507
00:27:03,178 --> 00:27:04,097
and all of you before.

508
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,818
So I could always remain immature

509
00:27:06,337 --> 00:27:08,377
and do whatever I want.

510
00:27:10,217 --> 00:27:11,178
But now,

511
00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:13,658
it's time for me to grow up.

512
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:18,658
I'll take the responsibilities
that I should bear for all of you.

513
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:21,938
Don't worry.

514
00:27:23,097 --> 00:27:24,457
If killing Cang Xuan is the only way

515
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,178
to protect my father

516
00:27:26,698 --> 00:27:28,058
and the people of Haoling,

517
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:31,097
I will kill him.

518
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:38,832
The Baihu

519
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:40,377
and Changxi Tribes

520
00:27:41,137 --> 00:27:42,058
are treacherous

521
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:43,457
and disloyal to the nation.

522
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:47,377
Today, I will take my father's place

523
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:49,137
to subjugate the Baihu
and Changxi Tribes.

524
00:27:54,617 --> 00:27:57,018
Fight to the death and win victory.

525
00:27:57,018 --> 00:27:59,698
- Fight to the death and win victory.
- Fight to the death and win victory.

526
00:27:59,698 --> 00:28:02,217
- Fight to the death and win victory.
- Fight to the death and win victory.

527
00:28:02,377 --> 00:28:04,938
- Fight to the death and win victory.
- Fight to the death and win victory.

528
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:10,337
- Fight to the death and win victory.
- Fight to the death and win victory.

529
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:12,898
Cang Xuan.

530
00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:14,938
Cang Xuan.

531
00:28:15,818 --> 00:28:16,400
Cang Xuan.

532
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,578
I heard that father...

533
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:19,418
I heard the King of Haoling

534
00:28:19,418 --> 00:28:21,418
fainted from sheer anger
in the court due to the betrayal

535
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,257
of the Baihu and Changxi Tribes.

536
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:24,418
Do you know about that?

537
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:25,418
Yes.

538
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:26,818
Do you know

539
00:28:27,217 --> 00:28:29,538
that Nian is the general
leading the troops of Haoling?

540
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:31,857
Yes.

541
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:32,857
Even so,

542
00:28:33,457 --> 00:28:34,538
you still have to go to war?

543
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:35,818
Xiaoyao, calm down.

544
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:36,737
Do you really intend

545
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:38,058
to face Nian in battle

546
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:40,658
for the Baihu and Changxi Tribes?

547
00:28:40,698 --> 00:28:41,698
Calm down.

548
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:43,778
Nian has never learned to deploy troops.

549
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:45,178
How can Master send Nian

550
00:28:45,178 --> 00:28:46,097
to lead the army?

551
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:47,737
I find it very strange.

552
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:49,418
I don't care about your strategy.

553
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:50,617
I don't care about your plan.

554
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:51,898
I have nothing to do

555
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,337
with your grand ambitions.

556
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,418
I only know
that the King of Haoling raised me

557
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,698
and took care of me.

558
00:28:58,377 --> 00:28:59,298
Now he has fallen ill.

559
00:29:00,097 --> 00:29:01,648
I'll go to Wushen Mountain to see him.

560
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:02,737
Xiaoyao, wait.

561
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:03,408
Let go of me.

562
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:06,938
I can't stop you from attacking Haoling.

563
00:29:07,938 --> 00:29:09,698
Nor can you stop me from visiting him.

564
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,056
Xiaoyao.

565
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:12,304
Xiaoyao.

566
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,896
(Cheng'en Palace)

567
00:29:37,938 --> 00:29:38,497
Chief Tushan.

568
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:40,337
His Majesty has agreed to see you.

569
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:41,977
Please follow me.

570
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:43,056
Thank you.

571
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:54,337
Chief Tushan.

572
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:55,137
Please.

573
00:30:03,977 --> 00:30:04,617
Why are you here?

574
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,058
I'll go with you.

575
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:08,658
Are you crazy?

576
00:30:09,178 --> 00:30:11,097
Xiyan is currently at war with Haoling.

577
00:30:11,457 --> 00:30:12,497
As the King of Xiyan,

578
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:13,938
you'll get yourself killed

579
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:15,018
in Wushen Mountain.

580
00:30:15,578 --> 00:30:16,457
Hurry back.

581
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:18,658
I'm already here.

582
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:24,178
Hide your identity well.

583
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:26,377
People at the Cheng'en Palace know you.

584
00:30:27,178 --> 00:30:27,818
Alright.

585
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:29,018
Stop nagging.

586
00:30:29,857 --> 00:30:30,818
I know what to do.

587
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:32,178
Since I dare to come,

588
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:34,497
I'm confident I can get back safely.

589
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:51,097
Heng.

590
00:30:53,178 --> 00:30:53,898
Heng.

591
00:31:00,137 --> 00:31:01,058
Heng.

592
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:41,264
Your Majesty.

593
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:42,818
Chief Tushan has arrived.

594
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:44,058
Did he come alone?

595
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:47,857
With a male and a female attendant.

596
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,737
Let them in.

597
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:52,977
Yes.

598
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:15,938
Greetings, Your Majesty.

599
00:32:16,658 --> 00:32:17,178
No formalities.

600
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:24,337
Xiaoyao.

601
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:27,217
Cang Xuan.

602
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:40,377
Greetings, Master.

603
00:32:49,938 --> 00:32:50,857
Please rise.

604
00:32:57,298 --> 00:32:58,097
Come closer.

605
00:33:11,497 --> 00:33:13,217
I heard that you fainted in the court.

606
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,018
Do you feel better?

607
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:18,538
I fainted deliberately.

608
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:19,737
Why?

609
00:33:22,938 --> 00:33:23,857
These days,

610
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:25,938
I've been plagued by inner demons.

611
00:33:26,778 --> 00:33:28,097
I often dream of Heng.

612
00:33:30,337 --> 00:33:31,137
In my dreams,

613
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:34,457
her blood splattered in the hall.
She swore by cutting her finger

614
00:33:34,457 --> 00:33:36,058
and begged me
to send troops to save Zhongyi.

615
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:39,457
I failed to keep promises

616
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:40,737
and rejected Heng.

617
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:44,377
Your father died in battle at Mount Xun.

618
00:33:44,737 --> 00:33:46,578
Your mother killed herself
before your father's grave.

619
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:50,737
Heng

620
00:33:53,137 --> 00:33:54,418
had to lead the troops into battle.

621
00:33:56,298 --> 00:33:56,898
Master.

622
00:33:58,058 --> 00:33:59,337
It's all in the past.

623
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:01,457
What matters now is your health.

624
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:03,377
Xiaoyao.

625
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:07,698
This was where your mother once lived.

626
00:34:08,138 --> 00:34:09,497
You were born in this palace.

627
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:10,992
Father...

628
00:34:16,578 --> 00:34:17,177
Your Majesty.

629
00:34:17,977 --> 00:34:19,058
Have you always known

630
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,338
I'm Chi Chen's daughter?

631
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:22,977
Yes, I have.

632
00:34:24,058 --> 00:34:25,618
Don't you hate my mother?

633
00:34:27,138 --> 00:34:28,378
She was your wife.

634
00:34:29,578 --> 00:34:31,818
Yet she had Chi Chen's kid.

635
00:34:33,018 --> 00:34:33,818
Your mother

636
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:35,417
and father did nothing wrong.

637
00:34:36,298 --> 00:34:37,058
Instead,

638
00:34:38,298 --> 00:34:39,737
I feel guilty about them.

639
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:44,298
I married your mother

640
00:34:45,298 --> 00:34:47,818
not for love.

641
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:50,578
Then why did you get engaged?

642
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:52,737
Back then,

643
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:54,897
I and Xiyan Qingyang

644
00:34:54,897 --> 00:34:57,378
were both fighting for the position
of crown prince.

645
00:34:58,657 --> 00:34:59,378
It wasn't only

646
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:01,897
about the engagement
between your mother and me.

647
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:03,058
It was also

648
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:05,417
about the alliance
between me and Qingyang.

649
00:35:06,697 --> 00:35:08,217
I never took this marriage

650
00:35:08,217 --> 00:35:09,058
seriously.

651
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:13,257
Centuries later,
when your mother married me,

652
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:15,897
she had already fallen for someone.

653
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:19,138
Chi Chen?

654
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,897
Your mother and I agreed

655
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,578
that we were not a couple but allies.

656
00:35:29,138 --> 00:35:31,058
Once Qingyang
and I were enthroned as kings,

657
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,177
we would divorce and give her freedom.

658
00:35:35,378 --> 00:35:36,048
Sadly,

659
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:38,778
things went athwart.

660
00:35:39,977 --> 00:35:41,977
Xiyan and Chenrong were at war.

661
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:44,378
Your mother

662
00:35:46,058 --> 00:35:47,578
had to arm herself for war

663
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,298
and face your father on the battlefield.

664
00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:55,737
Xiaoyao.

665
00:35:57,578 --> 00:35:59,018
Do not blame your parents.

666
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:09,538
I don't blame them.

667
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:15,578
If they had no relation to me,

668
00:36:16,897 --> 00:36:18,217
I would definitely admire them.

669
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:20,257
They died for the country

670
00:36:20,697 --> 00:36:21,657
and the people.

671
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:24,138
But they are my parents.

672
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:27,138
They gave birth to me
but did not raise me.

673
00:36:28,457 --> 00:36:30,378
Am I supposed to admire them
for abandoning me?

674
00:36:40,538 --> 00:36:41,217
Over the years,

675
00:36:42,058 --> 00:36:42,897
I have not known

676
00:36:42,897 --> 00:36:44,177
who my biological father was.

677
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:47,697
Because of them,

678
00:36:47,977 --> 00:36:49,378
I became an abandoned child.

679
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:50,778
Because of them,

680
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:52,618
I had to escape from being killed.

681
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:54,257
I lost my face

682
00:36:54,737 --> 00:36:55,778
and got locked

683
00:36:56,778 --> 00:36:59,058
in a cage like an animal for 30 years.

684
00:37:00,778 --> 00:37:02,098
When I was helpless and alone,

685
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,257
where were they?

686
00:37:04,217 --> 00:37:05,697
When I was humiliated and tortured,

687
00:37:05,697 --> 00:37:06,897
where were they then?

688
00:37:07,098 --> 00:37:08,657
When they died gloriously,

689
00:37:08,657 --> 00:37:09,937
did they ever think of me?

690
00:37:11,138 --> 00:37:12,737
I don't care whether they were a demon

691
00:37:12,737 --> 00:37:13,818
or a heroine.

692
00:37:14,457 --> 00:37:15,338
In my eyes,

693
00:37:16,177 --> 00:37:17,298
they are just

694
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:18,338
irresponsible people.

695
00:37:18,618 --> 00:37:19,538
They abandoned me.

696
00:37:19,618 --> 00:37:20,657
They're not good parents.

697
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:24,897
Master.

698
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:27,378
When they resolutely faced death,

699
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,897
they didn't seek our consent.

700
00:37:29,657 --> 00:37:30,858
Now things have changed.

701
00:37:30,858 --> 00:37:31,697
It's unnecessary

702
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:32,977
to demand our forgiveness.

703
00:37:46,937 --> 00:37:47,897
I don't blame you.

704
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:52,098
Xiaoyao.

705
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:54,977
I want to take you to a place.

706
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:00,217
What place?

707
00:38:01,497 --> 00:38:02,338
Baili.

708
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:06,098
(Chi Chen Village, Baili)

709
00:38:06,098 --> 00:38:08,417
Your father and mother
were not often together.

710
00:38:09,018 --> 00:38:10,578
Whenever he missed your mother,

711
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:12,457
he would plant a peach tree,

712
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:16,257
watering it with spirit power
amidst the landscape.

713
00:38:16,977 --> 00:38:18,177
After hundreds of years,

714
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:20,778
the peach trees created a large forest

715
00:38:20,937 --> 00:38:22,177
as a barrier.

716
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,618
After tens of millions of years,
the peach forest in Mount Jade

717
00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:30,217
developed the rare weapon,
Rejuvenating Flower.

718
00:38:30,937 --> 00:38:31,818
When you were born,

719
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:35,538
your mother risked her life
to seal the Rejuvenating Flower

720
00:38:36,177 --> 00:38:38,177
within you with her blood.

721
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:40,298
No wonder when I was little,

722
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:42,098
people said I looked like Your Majesty.

723
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:44,697
So it was the effect
of the Rejuvenating Flower.

724
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:52,018
This is your parents' home.

725
00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:55,098
Home?

726
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:03,977
Your father is the general
in charge of Chenrong.

727
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,257
Your mother is the only disciple
of the Lady Xiezu.

728
00:39:07,818 --> 00:39:09,378
But all they desired

729
00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:11,298
was just

730
00:39:12,697 --> 00:39:13,257
a home.

731
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:15,697
Xiaoyao.

732
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:18,338
You are like your mother.

733
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,937
I am content with my destiny.

734
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:24,778
I only want to live well

735
00:39:25,177 --> 00:39:26,177
without thinking far ahead.

736
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:29,858
I'll never try to be a heroine.

737
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:34,937
Just look around.

738
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:37,378
We'll wait for you outside.

739
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:46,138
- Xiaoyao.
- Stop.

740
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:50,338
Chi Chen built this place
for his wife and daughter.

741
00:40:51,138 --> 00:40:52,778
No one can hurt Xiaoyao here.

742
00:41:14,977 --> 00:41:15,578
Who is it?

743
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:18,457
I'm sorry

744
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:20,058
I scared you.

745
00:41:24,018 --> 00:41:24,624
Sorry.

746
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:26,657
I didn't know there was someone else.

747
00:41:26,977 --> 00:41:28,217
I was just shocked.

748
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:31,457
Who are you?

749
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:32,432
I...

750
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:33,897
I am...

751
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:39,697
The caretaker of the house.

752
00:41:45,538 --> 00:41:46,257
Madam.

753
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:49,018
The portraits are...

754
00:41:51,578 --> 00:41:52,417
Chi Chen

755
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:54,977
and Xiling Heng.

756
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:56,378
Have you ever seen them?

757
00:41:58,538 --> 00:41:59,138
Yes.

758
00:42:03,177 --> 00:42:03,977
Back off.

759
00:42:04,937 --> 00:42:07,618
I was injured on the battlefield.

760
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:09,257
I can't meet people.

761
00:42:09,618 --> 00:42:10,138
Okay.

762
00:42:10,457 --> 00:42:11,257
I won't go over.

763
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:12,298
Don't be afraid.

764
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:15,417
I just want to chat with you.

765
00:42:17,257 --> 00:42:20,138
I'd like to talk about the portraits.

766
00:42:21,937 --> 00:42:22,657
Over here,

767
00:42:24,098 --> 00:42:24,937
Chi Chen

768
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:26,937
was not

769
00:42:27,657 --> 00:42:28,977
a ruthless demon

770
00:42:30,378 --> 00:42:31,298
that killed people.

771
00:42:32,018 --> 00:42:34,778
He was the King of Beasts,
protecting the Baili,

772
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:38,457
and being favored by people from Baili.

773
00:42:40,778 --> 00:42:41,818
Xiling Heng

774
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:43,858
was not

775
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:45,417
a high-status,

776
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:49,177
prudent Princess General.

777
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:52,417
She was simply Chi Chen's wife.

778
00:42:53,098 --> 00:42:54,768
She practiced medicine and saved people

779
00:42:55,497 --> 00:42:57,298
and was revered by the people from Baili

780
00:42:58,138 --> 00:42:59,977
as the Xiling Witch.
