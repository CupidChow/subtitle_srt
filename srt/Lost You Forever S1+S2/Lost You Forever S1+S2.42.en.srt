00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:32,688
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,472
(Tushan)

4
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:54,160
(Jing Ye)

5
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:56,258
Mr. Tushan.

6
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:57,499
It is late.

7
00:01:58,258 --> 00:01:59,258
Please rest early.

8
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,008
Sit.

9
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:11,099
You just cried?

10
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,058
Today is the anniversary
of madam's death.

11
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,899
I remembered something.

12
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:18,658
I see.

13
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,259
I remember you and Lan Mei

14
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:24,058
moved in together.

15
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:27,019
Not just madam.

16
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:29,459
Lücong and Lan Xiang

17
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,298
also came with us.

18
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,298
We ate and lived together
when we were children,

19
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,259
like sisters.

20
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:40,979
Later on,

21
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,418
Lan Mei and Lücong
followed the senior master.

22
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:45,459
Lan Xiang and I worked for you.

23
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:49,619
Now,

24
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:53,339
Lan Mei and Lücong are dead.

25
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:55,058
Lan Xiang has left.

26
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,619
I'm the only one left.

27
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,259
Lücong is also dead?

28
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,539
I remember
after Lan Mei married my brother,

29
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:08,498
Lücong became her maid.

30
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:11,339
After Lan Mei was dead,

31
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:13,099
Lücong came back to her home.

32
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,578
When did she die?

33
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,019
Since Lan Mei died,

34
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,498
Lücong had been feeling guilty.

35
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,099
She fell ill from depression.

36
00:03:21,298 --> 00:03:22,138
After returning home,

37
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:24,218
she passed away from her illness.

38
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:27,778
You don't

39
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:29,578
like Qingqiu,

40
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:31,698
so over these years,

41
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:33,218
I've been staying

42
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:34,619
in Zhiyi with you.

43
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:36,819
And Lücong worked for the senior master.

44
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,698
I heard of it after she died.

45
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,138
Lan Mei's death

46
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:43,658
was quite unexpected.

47
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:45,938
Since Lan Mei married your brother,

48
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,019
she has lived in fear.

49
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,058
She became overcautious.

50
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:50,819
Who would have thought

51
00:03:51,138 --> 00:03:52,938
that she would actually kill herself

52
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,179
because your brother slapped her?

53
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,259
She was the most tolerant
among the four of us.

54
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,179
The day before Lan Mei's death,

55
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:01,858
she told me privately

56
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:03,019
that she would talk to you.

57
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:04,619
But...

58
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:06,899
She wanted to talk to me?

59
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:08,498
Lan Mei said

60
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:10,658
she had something to tell you privately.

61
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:12,259
I told her to come find me at night,

62
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:13,418
and I would bring her to you.

63
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:14,899
But

64
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:16,858
she didn't show up.

65
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:19,779
I received news of her suicide.

66
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:23,138
Why didn't you tell me back then?

67
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,779
Back then, you felt

68
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:26,739
distressed.

69
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:28,619
You were very sad about

70
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:29,978
Grand Madam's death.

71
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:31,538
Hu Zhen and I speculated

72
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:32,418
that Lan Mei

73
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:34,578
argued with the senior master

74
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,138
and wanted to ask you for help.

75
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,098
Before too long,

76
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:38,858
she died.

77
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:41,578
Nothing could be changed any more.

78
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:45,739
So I didn't mention it to you.

79
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:50,739
Lan Mei knew she was not well-born

80
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:52,698
and my brother did not like her.

81
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:54,818
So she was always discreet

82
00:04:54,818 --> 00:04:55,659
and compromised.

83
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:57,179
I don't think

84
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:58,258
she would come to me

85
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:00,378
during my grandma's mourning period

86
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:02,418
because my brother had another woman.

87
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,138
You are right.

88
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:05,258
But,

89
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:06,858
if that was not the case,

90
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:08,818
why would she want

91
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,418
to talk to you privately?

92
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:12,339
She repeatedly warned me

93
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:14,298
not to let anyone else know.

94
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:18,384
Jing.

95
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:19,978
Have some tea.

96
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:24,538
I have something to tell you in private.

97
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:26,818
During that period,

98
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,978
aside from grandma's death,

99
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:31,059
another big thing in the residence

100
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:31,739
was...

101
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,219
That

102
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:36,739
your son was born?

103
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:50,320
Return to Qingqiu tomorrow.

104
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:55,059
Young Master.

105
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:56,459
Slow down. Don't run.

106
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:58,578
Young Master.

107
00:05:58,779 --> 00:05:59,339
Young Master.

108
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:01,258
It's your fault.

109
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:02,578
You made me fall.

110
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,378
(Tushan Tian)
I'm going to tell my mother.

111
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:06,059
She will beat you to death.

112
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:08,298
- Spare us.
- Spare us.

113
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:09,019
- Please.
- Please.

114
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:09,538
Get up.

115
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:10,659
It's not your fault.

116
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,578
Father, you're back.

117
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:17,499
Thank you for your mercy.

118
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:22,418
You didn't listen to them

119
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:23,418
and ran so fast.

120
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:24,659
You blamed your fall

121
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:25,459
on them.

122
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:26,698
That's not right.

123
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:28,219
You know?

124
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:30,098
Yes, I do.

125
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:32,059
I dare not do it again.

126
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:37,659
Take him away.

127
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:45,939
Jing.

128
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:49,538
This is Mr. Lirong, an elder of my clan.

129
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:50,538
He has much spirit power

130
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:51,899
and is best at detecting bloodlines.

131
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:53,538
Mr. Lirong.

132
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:54,818
Mr. Tushan.

133
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:55,939
Chief Tushan.

134
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,739
I have prepared everything.

135
00:06:58,179 --> 00:06:59,258
Let's begin.

136
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,298
The owner of the blood and you

137
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,698
are closely related by blood.

138
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:47,499
Can you find out my relationship

139
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:48,339
with him?

140
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:49,939
He's a chosen one,

141
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:51,179
just like you.

142
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,659
He also fully inherits

143
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,418
the nature of the nine-tailed deity fox.

144
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:56,779
As for whether he's your son,

145
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:57,899
brother,

146
00:07:57,939 --> 00:07:58,978
or nephew,

147
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,939
I can't figure it out.

148
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:04,418
Whose blood is this?

149
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,378
Miss.

150
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,818
Your dress is ready.

151
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,258
Would you like to try them on?

152
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:15,418
Put it away.

153
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:18,459
I rarely see His Majesty.

154
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:19,779
I have no chance

155
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,059
to wear that.

156
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:25,459
Sir.

157
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:36,138
Cang Xuan has the whole world
in his heart.

158
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,938
He can't only have eyes for one woman.

159
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,138
If you feel upset,

160
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:42,339
why not marry someone else?

161
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,539
Our parents and I will support you.

162
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,419
My greatest wish

163
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:47,498
is definitely not

164
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:48,899
to have an ordinary husband.

165
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:54,138
Brother.

166
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,178
If you really care about me,

167
00:08:56,498 --> 00:08:58,299
do your best to help me fulfill my wish.

168
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:00,219
The decision
to move the capital has been made,

169
00:09:01,219 --> 00:09:02,539
but for the old clans

170
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:04,498
and those in the Central Plains,

171
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:06,099
it's just the beginning.

172
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:08,299
If you insist on marrying Cang Xuan,

173
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:09,899
there is a chance right now.

174
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:13,178
Right now?

175
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:14,899
I have a chance?

176
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:22,219
Your Majesty.

177
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:35,498
A big number.

178
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:40,258
Three ones.

179
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:41,419
I won again.

180
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,498
Why?

181
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,378
It's because you only bet

182
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:46,219
on big numbers.

183
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,378
Just face it.

184
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:48,099
You have to.

185
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:49,258
Come here.

186
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:54,539
Where should I put this?

187
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:56,698
Well, I can't just bet

188
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:58,339
on small numbers all afternoon.

189
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:03,498
You can't look.

190
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:06,979
The biggest number is three?

191
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:08,058
You're cheating.

192
00:10:08,698 --> 00:10:09,659
Come here.

193
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,618
I'll give you a lesson.

194
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:12,459
Grandfather.

195
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:15,019
You brought this on yourself.

196
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:20,539
You're having a lot of fun.

197
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:23,696
Brother.

198
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:27,408
Grandfather.

199
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:31,578
It's good that you came.

200
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:32,578
Otherwise,

201
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:33,738
Nian would kill me.

202
00:10:34,864 --> 00:10:36,099
Because you made fun of her.

203
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:39,938
Nian.

204
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:42,339
Your hair is messy.

205
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:45,178
You look bad now.

206
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:47,299
It's Xiaoyao's fault.

207
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,578
I'll go and comb it.

208
00:10:51,498 --> 00:10:52,618
As for relocating the capital,

209
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:54,299
how is it progressing?

210
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:56,299
It's going smoothly.

211
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:57,818
Old clans

212
00:10:57,818 --> 00:10:58,779
like the Huhe clan

213
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,459
and Guliang clan have moved
to the Central Plains.

214
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:04,178
Are they getting along well

215
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,058
with the clans in Central Plains?

216
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:07,698
So far, so good.

217
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,138
The country cannot be without a ruler.

218
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:17,419
The harem cannot be without a queen.

219
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,058
Cang Xuan.

220
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:21,099
It's time

221
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:22,779
to coronate the queen.

222
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:27,818
Xuan.

223
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:29,818
Who do you want to make queen?

224
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:30,698
You...

225
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:43,378
What do you think?

226
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:46,498
It's your queen.

227
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:47,738
You decide.

228
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:49,019
Why do you ask me?

229
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,539
Xuan.

230
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:56,299
Well,

231
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,539
your queen must be Chenrong Xinyue.

232
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:01,779
Grandfather.

233
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:10,779
Cang Xuan.

234
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:12,738
You have made up your mind

235
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:15,818
to change the landscape
of tens of thousands of years,

236
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:18,779
making the old clans
in Xi Jiang of the North integrate

237
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:21,099
with the ones in Central Plains.

238
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:23,859
But they've been against each other
for tens of thousands of years.

239
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:26,378
It's very hard to change.

240
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:29,138
You are from the Xiyan clan,

241
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,779
representing the old clans.

242
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,378
Xinyue is from the Chenrong Family,

243
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:38,378
representing the clans
in Central Plains.

244
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,698
As long as you make her queen,

245
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:42,178
the other clans

246
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:45,019
will naturally follow suit
with marriage alliances.

247
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,899
Over time,

248
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:49,618
the bloodlines will blend.

249
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:52,339
And that is the true integration.

250
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:55,339
I disagree.

251
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:09,419
I'm not against making Xinyue the queen.

252
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:11,299
But what about Nian?

253
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:13,539
It's not fair to Nian.

254
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:22,539
If he makes Nian the queen now,

255
00:13:23,618 --> 00:13:26,219
the Chenrong clan will be dissatisfied.

256
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,099
So will be the Chishui Family.

257
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:30,938
All the clans
in Central Plains will think

258
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:34,058
that Cang Xuan is burning bridges.

259
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:41,779
Xiaoyao.

260
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,578
Do you want

261
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:47,339
to cause great chaos again
for a queen position?

262
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:55,979
The old clans
and the clans the Central Plains

263
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:59,258
are like two groups of fierce beasts,

264
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:03,539
living on two mountains
without interfering with each other.

265
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:05,258
But Cang Xuan

266
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,738
has driven them into a cage.

267
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:10,979
It's more dangerous than before.

268
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:14,659
Once something happens,

269
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:16,659
it's very likely

270
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:18,659
that they will pounce on each other.

271
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:20,659
If Cang Xuan wants

272
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:24,019
to integrate the old clans
and the clans in the Central Plains,

273
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:28,659
he must lead by example.

274
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:41,419
Cang Xuan.

275
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,419
There is no turning back.

276
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:03,779
Xuan.

277
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:07,138
Do you want to make Xinyue

278
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:09,219
or Nian the queen?

279
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,659
You pick the one you like.

280
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:32,979
I don't care.

281
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:42,539
After all, I have no choice in my life.

282
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:50,979
What do you mean?

283
00:15:51,698 --> 00:15:52,899
You don't care?

284
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,258
Xuan.

285
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:57,219
Xiaoyao.

286
00:15:58,498 --> 00:16:01,099
Leave him alone.

287
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,299
Alright.

288
00:16:25,378 --> 00:16:26,498
Don't cry anymore.

289
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:28,779
Do you want

290
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,938
to weep away all your tears?

291
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,539
You look terrible now.

292
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:41,859
I'll be fine after crying.

293
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:43,378
Don't worry about me.

294
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:44,979
Grandfather will take my side.

295
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:46,378
What exactly did he say

296
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:47,378
to you?

297
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,938
Cang Xuan is about to marry a queen.

298
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:51,899
How will he stand up for you?

299
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:54,099
This is a secret
between grandfather and me.

300
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:55,378
I can't tell you.

301
00:16:56,698 --> 00:16:57,459
Anyway,

302
00:16:58,099 --> 00:16:59,219
thank you

303
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:01,339
for fighting for the position for me.

304
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:02,899
Please.

305
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:04,978
What do you plan to do?

306
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,019
I will return to Haoling tomorrow.

307
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:15,138
The Zijin Palace will have a hostess.

308
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:17,098
You know

309
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:19,338
this hostess

310
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,738
does not welcome me to live here.

311
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,458
I am the Princess of Haoling.

312
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,819
I can do anything for Xuan.

313
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:28,458
But I can't let Haoling lose face

314
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,699
because of me.

315
00:17:31,338 --> 00:17:31,899
Xiaoyao.

316
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:34,458
Come back with me to Wushen Mountain.

317
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:36,138
Wushen Mountain?

318
00:17:37,978 --> 00:17:39,179
I know you well.

319
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,019
Even if Xinyue becomes the queen

320
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:42,699
and the hostess of Zijin Palace,

321
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,179
you will not please her.

322
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:45,819
In that case,

323
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:46,858
she will start

324
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,098
to hate you gradually.

325
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:51,539
That makes sense.

326
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:52,944
However,

327
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,179
I don't return to Wushen Mountain.

328
00:17:57,338 --> 00:17:58,858
You don't return to Wushen Mountain

329
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,579
and you can't stay here.

330
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:03,059
Then there's the only way left.

331
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:04,978
What is it?

332
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,098
Get married.

333
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:11,258
But it's troublesome for you.

334
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,779
As Chief Chishui's wife,
you'd have to be socially adept

335
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,378
and good at dancing.

336
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:17,939
Sadly,

337
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,579
you don't know the ways of the world.

338
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:21,939
You're inarticulate
and don't know how to dress up.

339
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:23,458
What will you do in the future?

340
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:25,458
Stop it.

341
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:26,899
If you go on,

342
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,858
I'll feel like
my life is a complete failure.

343
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:30,819
There's not a shred of hope
for the future.

344
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:33,699
It's okay.

345
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,659
Father and I will support you.

346
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:38,939
I know.

347
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:42,738
Go to sleep early.

348
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:45,738
Tomorrow I will return
to Wushen Mountain with you.

349
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:48,019
Aren't you unwilling to go back?

350
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:49,498
How come you changed your mind?

351
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,378
I think what you said makes sense.

352
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:54,258
If I reduce my contact with Xinyue,

353
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:55,579
at least she and I

354
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:56,539
could stay friends.

355
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:58,258
If we live under the same roof,

356
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:00,338
seeing each other very often,

357
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:03,138
the past friendship
will eventually be worn away.

358
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:04,939
It's better to leave early.

359
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:07,539
So you've taken my words to heart.

360
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:10,218
Of course.

361
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:11,699
Speaking of the life in the palace,

362
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:13,098
you have more experience than I do.

363
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:14,659
Naturally, I should listen to you.

364
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:16,659
That's more like it.

365
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:19,579
Go to sleep.

366
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:45,819
(The old clans
and the clans in the Central Plains)

367
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:48,218
(are like two groups of fierce beasts,)

368
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,939
(living on two mountains
without interfering)

369
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,419
(with each other.)

370
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:53,419
(But Cang Xuan)

371
00:19:53,498 --> 00:19:55,699
(has driven them into a cage.)

372
00:19:55,939 --> 00:19:58,498
(It's more dangerous than before.)

373
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:01,819
(Once something happens,)

374
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:03,059
(it's very likely)

375
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,939
(that they will pounce on each other.)

376
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,019
(Please consider it carefully.)

377
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,458
(Back then, Princess General)

378
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:10,939
(and Chi Chen were in love.)

379
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:12,858
(Princess General)

380
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:14,819
(personally told all the generals)

381
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:15,899
(and soldiers)

382
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:17,539
(that she liked Chi Chen.)

383
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:18,978
(On Zhaoyun Peak,)

384
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:20,939
(only you and Xiaoyao are left.)

385
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,819
(When I'm not here,)

386
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,138
(you must protect yourself.)

387
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:25,779
Auntie.

388
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:27,579
(You must also protect Xiaoyao.)

389
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:30,218
I want Xiaoyao to be my queen.

390
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,659
(Do you really want)

391
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,258
(to cause great chaos again
for a queen position?)

392
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:36,218
(Cang Xuan.)

393
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:38,498
(Xiaoyao is not you.)

394
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:39,899
(In the future,)

395
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,858
(you must keep her safe.)

396
00:20:49,858 --> 00:20:51,498
Don't you want to see His Majesty?

397
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:53,338
Why not go find His Majesty?

398
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:56,579
It's late.

399
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:57,978
I won't disturb His Majesty.

400
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,299
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

401
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,179
His Majesty will be happy to see you.

402
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:04,419
Besides,

403
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:06,299
you used to visit His Majesty
so late, didn't you?

404
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:09,458
Things change.

405
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:11,659
Now, not just he and I live

406
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,338
in the Zijin Palace.

407
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:15,338
There are many other concubines.

408
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:17,378
His Majesty must be staying

409
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,699
in one of his concubines' rooms.

410
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:24,299
Even if I rush over

411
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,258
there now

412
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:26,618
and he doesn't mind,

413
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,019
it's still not proper.

414
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:45,899
When I was little,

415
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:48,659
my mother and aunt were too busy

416
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:50,618
to care for us.

417
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:52,338
Xuan and I

418
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:53,978
always stayed together.

419
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:56,258
When I caused trouble,

420
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:57,978
he would take the blame for me.

421
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:00,059
While he studied,

422
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:01,539
I would make trouble with him.

423
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:03,539
I sat on the swings,

424
00:22:04,218 --> 00:22:05,258
and he pushed the swings.

425
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,258
He picked flowers,

426
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,059
and I tasted the nectar.

427
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:21,858
Why do people have to grow up?

428
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:24,019
Is growing up not good?

429
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:26,699
The more we grow

430
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:29,458
and the wider the sky gets,

431
00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:31,899
the narrower the paths

432
00:22:32,378 --> 00:22:33,539
we take

433
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:35,659
and the fewer choices

434
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:37,258
we can make.

435
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:43,098
Let's go back.

436
00:22:58,506 --> 00:23:00,656
♪You are in my mind♪

00:23:00,656 --> 00:23:02,730

♪Not on a cloud♪

448

Yes.

449
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:39,539
The more power I have,

450
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,338
the fewer choices

451
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,498
I can make.

452
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:45,939
Xiaoyao.

453
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,978
I just want to push the swing

454
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:53,779
and pick flowers for you

455
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:57,098
like when we were kids.

456
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:01,200
♪You appear as the smoke rises♪

457
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,800

(Chenrong Mansion)

461
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:21,299
Father.

462
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:23,338
His Majesty has decided
to make Xinyue the queen.

463
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:24,858
Soon someone will be sent here

464
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:25,819
to discuss the marriage.

465
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:28,458
Before the ceremony,

466
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,019
someone needs to manage home affairs.

467
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:30,768
Father.

468
00:24:30,858 --> 00:24:32,579
Please bring my mother back
as soon as possible.

469
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:33,098
Okay.

470
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,179
I will send someone to Chishui

471
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:36,059
to take her back.

472
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:37,179
Time is so pressing.

473
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:38,832
I need to prepare in advance.

474
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:39,344
Father.

475
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,048
Brother.

476
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:42,218
I'll take my leave.

477
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:53,539
Father, no need to worry about her.

478
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:55,138
You and I are her family.

479
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:56,458
Even if something happens,

480
00:24:57,218 --> 00:24:57,899
His Majesty

481
00:24:57,899 --> 00:24:59,858
will treat Xinyue kindly for our sake.

482
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:01,779
I hope so.

483
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:11,939
Congratulations, Miss.

484
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,179
There are already many women

485
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:19,258
in the Zijin Palace,

486
00:25:19,738 --> 00:25:20,978
but His Majesty

487
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,539
has not forgotten his affection for me.

488
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,179
You met His Majesty
when you were little.

489
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:27,699
Back then, His Majesty didn't know

490
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:28,738
those women at all.

491
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:30,738
You're going

492
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:31,899
to be the queen.

493
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,098
Those women
in the Zijin Palace may be favored.

494
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:36,019
But they can't compete with you.

495
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:39,899
I know they can't.

496
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:42,299
But what about Nian?

497
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:44,858
Her status does not allow her
to become a concubine.

498
00:25:45,258 --> 00:25:46,458
Now, you're going to be the queen.

499
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:47,458
So,

500
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,138
she should go back
to where she came from.

501
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:51,059
You're right.

502
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:53,179
I'm the only queen.

503
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,539
She has to leave.

504
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:07,338
Grandfather.

505
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:09,618
My sister and I will return to Haoling.

506
00:26:10,098 --> 00:26:11,299
You take good care of your health.

507
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:13,520
Okay.

508
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:14,819
Grandfather.

509
00:26:15,098 --> 00:26:16,059
You should go to bed early,

510
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:18,019
get up early, and take medicine on time.

511
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:19,539
No alcohol.

512
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:23,419
Got it.

513
00:26:28,432 --> 00:26:29,008
Xuan.

514
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:31,539
I'm leaving.

515
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:32,659
After you arrive,

516
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:33,579
send me a message.

517
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:35,258
Give my regards to Master.

518
00:26:35,618 --> 00:26:36,299
I will.

519
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:41,299
Come back early.

520
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,779
It's getting late. Let's go.

521
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:11,338
Xiaoyao.

522
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:12,699
I have something to say.

523
00:27:15,824 --> 00:27:16,458
Nian.

524
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:17,539
Wait for me in the carriage.

525
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:26,218
When will you come back?

526
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:27,699
I haven't

527
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:29,019
decided yet.

528
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,179
I want to spend more time with father.

529
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:33,059
Will you come back after a month?

530
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:34,978
Impossible.

531
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:36,978
After two months?

532
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:37,978
No.

533
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:40,579
Three months?

534
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:41,699
No.

535
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:42,738
Four months?

536
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:43,568
Xuan.

537
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:44,819
I want

538
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:46,019
to stay longer this time.

539
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,258
For one year?

540
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:51,899
Then 13 months?

541
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,699
No.

542
00:27:58,699 --> 00:27:59,498
I don't know.

543
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:00,272
Alright then.

544
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:01,939
After 13 months,

545
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:03,498
I will send someone to fetch you.

546
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:05,899
No need.

547
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:08,419
Whenever I want to come back,

548
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:09,498
I will naturally return.

549
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:10,579
After 13 months,

550
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:12,579
I will send someone to fetch you.

551
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:14,059
I already

552
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,378
know the roads very well.

553
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:16,498
No need to fetch me.

554
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:17,458
Besides,

555
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:19,138
what if after 13 months I still...?

556
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:22,899
I...

557
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:25,218
If I don't want to come back,

558
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:26,779
your people will come for nothing.

559
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:27,738
Forget it.

560
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:29,019
If you don't come back,

561
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:31,939
I'll personally bring you back.

562
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:35,779
You are now a ruler of a nation.

563
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,419
How can you leave?

564
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:38,258
Alright.

565
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:39,539
It's getting late.

566
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:40,659
I have to go.

567
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:41,858
Xuan.

568
00:28:42,218 --> 00:28:43,819
Take care of your own affairs.

569
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:09,378
Xinyue.

570
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:11,539
Have you really thought it through?

571
00:29:11,978 --> 00:29:13,419
If you regret it now,

572
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,579
your father and I

573
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:15,579
will make His Majesty

574
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,939
(Chishui Xiaoye)
revoke the decision appointing you

575
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:20,978
as the queen at any cost.

576
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:22,498
You can choose the one

577
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:24,179
who truly loves you.

578
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:24,819
Mother.

579
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:27,378
I'm about to become the Queen of Xiyan

580
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:29,258
and move into Zijin Palace.

581
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:31,378
It's been my wish since I was little.

582
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:33,338
How could I possibly give up now?

583
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:34,258
Since

584
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,218
you insist on taking this path,

585
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:38,338
I will not stop you.

586
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:42,098
But you must always remember

587
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:43,458
that as a queen,

588
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:44,858
you're responsible

589
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:46,258
for managing the royal harem

590
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,579
and leading by example.

591
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:49,978
Do not focus on vying for favor.

592
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:52,779
What you need is His Majesty's respect

593
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:54,498
rather than his love.

594
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:56,179
Like you and father?

595
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:58,458
That's not what I want.

596
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,016
You only care about interests
and family.

597
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:04,179
I wish to be in love

598
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:05,458
with His Majesty

599
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:06,699
and be together forever.

600
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:08,738
You want the highest status

601
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:11,738
as well as romantic love.

602
00:30:11,858 --> 00:30:12,498
Sometimes,

603
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:14,699
you can't get the best of both worlds.

604
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,338
Nothing is impossible.

605
00:30:17,378 --> 00:30:18,458
If I don't fight for it,

606
00:30:18,978 --> 00:30:20,138
who knows what will happen?

607
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:27,019
The auspicious time has arrived.

608
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:29,059
The ceremony begins.

609
00:31:08,624 --> 00:31:10,512
(Concubine Lirong)

610
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:32,498
Kneel.

611
00:31:46,498 --> 00:31:49,218
Proclaim the imperial edict
for the queen.

612
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,659
According to the King of Xiyan,

613
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,218
The governance of the nation is rooted

614
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:56,819
in human relations.

615
00:31:56,978 --> 00:31:58,258
By the order of Heaven,

616
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,258
following the rites of the nation,

617
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,858
I enthrone Chenrong Xinyue
as the queen of Xiyan,

618
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,419
who should

619
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:05,858
manage the imperial harem,

620
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,579
observe ancestral ceremonial rites

621
00:32:07,978 --> 00:32:09,218
and act by virtue.

622
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:10,899
That's all.

623
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:21,299
Present the imperial seal.

624
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:55,019
Your Majesty.

625
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:56,939
Please bestow the queen's seal.

626
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:07,779
Your Majesty.

627
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:51,098
- Wish Your Majesty
- Wish Your Majesty

628
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:52,738
- a long life.
- a long life.

629
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:54,978
- Wish Your Highness
- Wish Your Highness

630
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:56,699
- a virtuous life.
- a virtuous life.

631
00:33:57,978 --> 00:33:59,659
(I have ascended to the apex of power.)

632
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:02,458
(Yet, the one standing by my side)

633
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:04,618
(is not the person)

634
00:34:04,618 --> 00:34:06,179
(who has supported me)

635
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:08,978
(and shared weal and woe with me.)

636
00:34:32,258 --> 00:34:33,498
The auspicious time is passing.

637
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:35,299
Why has His Majesty not been here yet?

638
00:34:35,779 --> 00:34:36,539
How about

639
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:38,898
I send someone to inquire

640
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,218
where His Majesty is now?

641
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:41,099
Go quickly.

642
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:49,099
His Majesty must have

643
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:50,898
been held back by something else.

644
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,019
Your Highness, look.

645
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,539
There are gifts

646
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:55,258
from His Majesty.

647
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:56,859
Evidently,

648
00:34:57,539 --> 00:34:58,258
His Majesty

649
00:34:58,258 --> 00:34:59,698
is deeply concerned about Your Highness.

650
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:01,498
You are right.

651
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:05,498
Tomorrow, Your Highness
will wear the queen's dress

652
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:08,059
and put on these jewels bestowed
by His Majesty

653
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,218
to meet the concubines in the harem.

654
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,619
About those women in the harem,

655
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:14,059
regardless of who they are,

656
00:35:14,218 --> 00:35:16,218
and whether or not they preceded you
into the palace,

657
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:18,498
they have to kneel
and pay respects to Your Highness.

658
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:23,418
Is Her Highness inside?

659
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:00,539
Greetings, Your Highness.

660
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:02,698
Your Highness.

661
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:03,738
His Majesty is drunk.

662
00:36:03,898 --> 00:36:05,059
He's afraid to disturb your rest,

663
00:36:05,258 --> 00:36:06,579
so he will sleep elsewhere tonight.

664
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:07,819
Please rest early,

665
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:08,698
Your Highness.

666
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:10,099
His Majesty has one day off tomorrow.

667
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:11,938
He will accompany you
to meet with the concubines

668
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,019
and show you around.

669
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,339
Your Highness?

670
00:36:34,898 --> 00:36:36,258
Where is His Majesty now?

671
00:36:37,218 --> 00:36:39,059
Is he in another concubine's room?

672
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:42,139
Your Highness.

673
00:36:42,379 --> 00:36:44,258
His Majesty did not go
to any other concubine's place.

674
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:46,299
I hear

675
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,738
he is walking alone
in the Poinciana Wood.

676
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:01,738
This is our wedding night.

677
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:05,619
He'd rather walk in the Poinciana Wood

678
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:07,139
than come to my room.

679
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:39,498
Am I not worth more than a tree?

680
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:40,498
Please calm your anger.

681
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:41,698
His Majesty did not come,

682
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:43,658
but he did not see any other concubine.

683
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:46,218
And tomorrow,
he will specially accompany you

684
00:37:46,218 --> 00:37:47,218
and show you around.

685
00:37:47,258 --> 00:37:48,859
It shows he cares about you.

686
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:52,139
If Your Highness gets mad

687
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,779
and makes other concubines think

688
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:55,059
that you and His Majesty have issues,

689
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:56,336
then...

690
00:37:58,498 --> 00:37:59,258
Yeah.

691
00:38:08,258 --> 00:38:09,178
You are right.

692
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:13,779
This is not Chenrong Mansion.

693
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:16,658
Many people are watching me.

694
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:18,379
Today,

695
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,539
I can't be the laughingstock

696
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:21,178
of other women

697
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,418
in this harem.

698
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:29,898
Clean up this place.

699
00:38:30,498 --> 00:38:31,059
Yes.

700
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:03,658
Your Majesty.

701
00:39:03,938 --> 00:39:04,898
I have conveyed your message

702
00:39:04,898 --> 00:39:06,019
to Her Highness.

703
00:39:07,738 --> 00:39:08,339
Good.

704
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,658
Today is your wedding day.

705
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:16,498
Why don't you go to the queen's palace?

706
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:17,139
Why do you stay

707
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:18,498
in this Poinciana Wood?

708
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:29,218
It is exactly the same.

709
00:39:29,738 --> 00:39:30,579
It makes me feel

710
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:32,178
as if I've returned to Zhaoyun Peak.

711
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:37,819
Sadly,

712
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:40,938
it is not Zhaoyun Peak.

713
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:52,619
Today is your wedding day.

714
00:39:53,498 --> 00:39:54,779
The old clans are very happy.

715
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,619
The clans
in Central Plains are also happy.

716
00:39:58,819 --> 00:39:59,859
This is the first time

717
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:02,859
that all the clans feel happy

718
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:04,339
about the same thing.

719
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:07,539
Lady Xiezu.

720
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:08,579
Your parents.

721
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:09,779
Your aunt.

722
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:11,978
They will all be very happy.

723
00:40:13,418 --> 00:40:14,619
I am also very happy.

724
00:40:18,178 --> 00:40:19,418
Because I am getting married?

725
00:40:21,738 --> 00:40:23,178
Because you protected Zhaoyun Peak

726
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:24,819
and Lady Xiezu's mulberry forest.

727
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:27,418
I was worried

728
00:40:27,418 --> 00:40:28,458
before

729
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:30,178
that my kin

730
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,099
would be uprooted

731
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:32,258
and abandoned in the wild.

732
00:40:56,258 --> 00:40:57,498
Everything is worth it, right?

733
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,298
(Yingzhou)

734
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:07,539
It's alright.

735
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:08,938
If you take your medicine on time,

736
00:41:08,978 --> 00:41:09,619
you will recover

737
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:10,658
after a while.

738
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:13,059
Thank you, doctor.

739
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:13,978
Here is your medicine.

740
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:15,539
Thank you.

741
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:17,938
Here you are.

742
00:41:18,698 --> 00:41:19,218
This way.

743
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:19,888
Take care.

744
00:41:32,978 --> 00:41:33,738
Haitang.

745
00:41:34,178 --> 00:41:36,099
Change all the bedding in the house.

746
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:38,059
This place is so dirty.

747
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:39,698
And your patients

748
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:40,779
are smelly fishermen.

749
00:41:41,218 --> 00:41:42,258
Even if you practice medicine,

750
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:43,498
can't you do it in a better place

751
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:44,779
and treat the men of noble families?

752
00:41:45,978 --> 00:41:47,819
Illness doesn't discriminate
between rich and poor.

753
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:48,539
For a doctor,

754
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,938
treating any patient is the same.

755
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,099
Illness doesn't discriminate
between rich and poor.

756
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:53,552
But patients are of different classes.

757
00:41:53,698 --> 00:41:55,178
I don't know why father allowed you.

758
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:56,299
What are you doing

759
00:41:56,299 --> 00:41:57,619
in this place?

760
00:41:58,992 --> 00:41:59,600
Haitang.

761
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:01,898
Put a zither here.

762
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:03,819
And put an incense burner over there.

763
00:42:04,379 --> 00:42:04,944
Yes.

764
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:06,059
Why does this place

765
00:42:06,418 --> 00:42:08,218
look like the one you live

766
00:42:08,218 --> 00:42:09,258
in Qingshui Town?

767
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:13,872
Xiaoyao.

768
00:42:14,258 --> 00:42:16,258
Are you missing the days
when you pretended to be Wen Xiaoliu

769
00:42:16,738 --> 00:42:18,019
in Qingshui Town?

770
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:25,019
You want to be Wen Xiaoliu,
not the princess?

771
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:29,859
How did you figure it out?

772
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:31,099
Don't ask me how.

773
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:31,938
I won't allow it.

774
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:33,139
Neither will father.

775
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:35,418
Alright.

776
00:42:35,418 --> 00:42:36,299
I'll do as you say.

777
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:38,819
I'm just thinking about it.

778
00:42:42,658 --> 00:42:43,258
Give me a hand.
