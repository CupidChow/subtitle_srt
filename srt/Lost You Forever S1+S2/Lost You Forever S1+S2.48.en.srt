=Episode 9=

3
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:52,282
Have a look.

4
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:54,202
Pick what you like.

5
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:06,683
I have the same hairpin.

6
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,042
Her Highness gave it to me.

7
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:11,642
It seems

8
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:14,363
you don't fancy these accessories.

9
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:23,243
This gem is transformed

10
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:25,323
from the inner core
of a ten thousand-year-old coral.

11
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:27,482
It's not precious but rare.

12
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:28,963
I intended to keep it.

13
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:30,803
If you like it,

14
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:33,363
you can set it on your accessory.

15
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,202
No need.

16
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:38,762
It's getting late.

17
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:40,243
I have to go.

18
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,282
It seems

19
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:49,963
you like gems, don't you?

20
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:56,003
Yes.

21
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:57,562
If you have no more precious gems

22
00:02:57,562 --> 00:03:00,363
than this one,
there's no need to show me more.

23
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:02,042
Did Jing

24
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:04,402
give you this purple fish core?

25
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:06,243
Yes.

26
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:17,642
Do you have time tomorrow?

27
00:03:20,523 --> 00:03:22,523
There will be
some raw gemstones tomorrow.

28
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,402
Are you interested in seeing

29
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:26,402
the original state of the gems?

30
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:29,883
You know that Jing likes me.

31
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:33,042
If you're determined to marry Jing,

32
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:35,243
I'll take back what I just said.

33
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:39,402
Fangfeng Bei taught me archery.

34
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:41,642
And in the end, he died from an arrow.

35
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:43,122
If you're not afraid of death,

36
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:47,083
I'd like to watch you extract the gems.

37
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,523
Then it's settled.

38
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:52,523
Tomorrow at noon,

39
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:54,562
I'll wait for you here.

40
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:59,888
(Tavern)

41
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:23,003
That woman

42
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:24,682
is indifferent to you.

43
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:27,242
But she looks nice to Tushan Hou.

44
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:28,842
How dare she?

45
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:29,962
How dare she?

46
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,203
It infuriates me.

47
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:33,362
I'm pissed off.

48
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:39,664
Jing.

49
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:40,883
I have an idea.

50
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:43,603
I will find a chance

51
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:45,682
to castrate Tushan Hou secretly.

52
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:50,323
Don't be silly.

53
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:52,082
We're in Zhiyi.

54
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:55,003
Even Their Majesties
on Chenrong Mountain don't step in.

55
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,282
It's not what you can intervene in.

56
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:00,682
No wonder that princess acts absurdly.

57
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:02,643
Turns out she is spoiled.

58
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:03,984
Jing.

59
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:05,443
I don't get it.

60
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:07,242
She doesn't like you

61
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:08,323
and Fenglong.

62
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:10,122
And Fangfeng Bei died because of her.

63
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:12,603
In the end, she hooked up

64
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,203
with Tushan Hou, that bad man.

65
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:15,402
So,

66
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:18,802
what will you do?

67
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:20,242
Just tell me.

68
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:22,203
I can do anything for you.

69
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:26,082
You go back.

70
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:28,203
I'll make a long trip

71
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:29,522
to deal with something.

72
00:05:29,682 --> 00:05:31,562
Where are you going?

73
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:32,323
I'll go with you.

74
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:33,402
No need.

75
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:36,003
I'm going to Qingshui Town.

76
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:37,883
What for?

77
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:39,824
That's the territory
of the nine-headed demon.

78
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:41,242
I need

79
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:43,763
to figure out something.

80
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:55,163
What can I do for you, Chief Tushan?

81
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,242
I want to ask you

82
00:05:58,242 --> 00:05:59,962
about Fangfeng Yiying and Tushan Tian.

83
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:03,603
They are your wife and child.

84
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:04,723
Why do you ask me?

85
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:07,163
I suspect Tushan Tian is not my son.

86
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:09,520
I've investigated it for long
but found nothing.

87
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:11,562
If you know anything,

88
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:12,723
please tell me.

89
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,802
I can buy information from you.

90
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:16,163
Why bother?

91
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:17,802
Name your price,

92
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,362
and I'll kill them for you.

93
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,840
No need.

94
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:23,203
I'll find another way.

95
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:26,362
You're so indecisive.

96
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:31,323
I have yet to thank you.

97
00:06:32,163 --> 00:06:33,122
Thanks for having Xiaoyao

98
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:34,082
come to Qingqiu to see me.

99
00:06:34,522 --> 00:06:36,203
I just made a deal with you.

100
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:39,763
She decided to go
to Qingqiu to find you.

101
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,323
I didn't help.

102
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:53,962
I don't know whose son Tushan Tian is.

103
00:06:56,923 --> 00:06:57,962
But Fangfeng Yiying

104
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:01,362
indeed has an affair with Tushan Hou.

105
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:04,883
Wait a minute.

106
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:05,643
Could you...

107
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:06,723
Fangfeng Bei is already dead.

108
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:09,082
Do you expect a dead person
to testify for you?

109
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:13,203
I knew it.

110
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:56,122
Sir.

111
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:26,242
Thank you.

112
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:41,802
(The princess is enchanting and unique.)

113
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:45,602
(No wonder Tushan Jing
can't forget her.)

114
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,242
I have a gift

115
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:01,802
for you.

116
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:04,283
I don't want anything.

117
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:16,963
Red fish core?

118
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:18,562
It's for you.

119
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:22,643
However,

120
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:25,843
you can only wear one necklace.

121
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:29,283
If you take this red fish core,

122
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,042
you can't have the purple fish core.

123
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:35,443
No need.

124
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:36,602
I'm not interested.

125
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,922
If you don't want
to exchange it, then don't.

126
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:49,083
Keep this red fish core if you want.

127
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,003
Discard it if you don't like it.

128
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:58,643
Well,

129
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:00,682
I don't like being forced by others.

130
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:03,083
Otherwise, no matter how good it is,

131
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,283
I won't take it.

132
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:29,283
I've got it.

133
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:31,162
I've got it.

134
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:33,883
Shan Hu, I've got it.

135
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:36,443
What is making you so happy?

136
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:40,443
I've got the bait
that will hook the fish.

137
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,003
I can't believe this.

138
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:52,042
Disgusting.

139
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,763
They have gone too far.

140
00:10:58,162 --> 00:10:59,482
Even though Fangfeng Yiying

141
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:02,602
has an affair with Tushan Hou,

142
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:04,682
it can't prove

143
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:06,042
Fangfeng Yiying set you up that night.

144
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:11,763
Tushan Tian might still be your child.

145
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:16,403
I hear

146
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:18,643
that your sister will
host a birthday banquet.

147
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:20,682
All the invitees are ladies.

148
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:22,448
Right.

149
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:25,162
I almost forgot it.

150
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,523
My eldest sister

151
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:27,643
also invited Fangfeng Yiying.

152
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:30,288
No way.

153
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:33,203
I have to tell her
to withdraw the invitation

154
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:34,922
and not to be nice to that bad woman.

155
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:37,482
Wait.

156
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:41,242
Will Xiaoyao go?

157
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:42,416
Yes.

158
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:43,802
My elder sister said

159
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,602
His Majesty's confidant
especially told her

160
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:46,843
that a princess would come.

161
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:52,763
You did it all

162
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:54,602
just for me?

163
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:56,963
Don't say that.

164
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,722
I haven't done anything yet.

165
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:01,722
Don't be too moved.

166
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:05,283
Don't get involved

167
00:12:05,722 --> 00:12:06,722
with the banquet

168
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:08,643
lest you ruin Xiaoyao's plan.

169
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,203
What is it?

170
00:12:14,122 --> 00:12:15,323
Look, red koi over there.

171
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:19,883
When I catch a fish,

172
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:20,682
I will grill it for you.

173
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:23,523
My barbecuing skill is not inferior
to that of the imperial chef.

174
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:25,883
So we can enjoy food today.

175
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:28,682
Your Highness.

176
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:30,003
Your Highness.

177
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,523
What flavor do you like?

178
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:33,456
Any flavor is fine.

179
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:34,064
Okay.

180
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:39,643
There's a fish.

181
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,602
Let me help.

182
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:46,256
Okay.

183
00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:55,682
Your Highness, madam, forgive me.

184
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:57,843
Why are you so clumsy?

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,362
You can't carry a basin
without spilling.

186
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:01,200
Forget it.

187
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,242
She didn't mean it.

188
00:13:02,362 --> 00:13:03,122
It's okay.

189
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:04,403
I'll go get changed.

190
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,682
Take the princess and Lady of Tushan
to change clothes.

191
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:10,843
I don't like this dress.

192
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:12,042
You go and change it.

193
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:14,643
Yes, Your Highness.

194
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:33,963
What's wrong?

195
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:35,042
Is there anything?

196
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:40,283
Your red fish core is really beautiful.

197
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,362
Can I have a look?

198
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:43,362
Of course.

199
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:51,083
There's no need to be nervous.

200
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,523
It's just a common one.

201
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:53,802
It's okay if it gets broken.

202
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:56,643
It's beautiful.

203
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:01,403
Where did you buy it?

204
00:14:01,922 --> 00:14:03,162
A friend of mine gave it to me.

205
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:04,883
I wear it for fun.

206
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:12,112
Madam.

207
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:13,482
You haven't got changed yet.

208
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,602
Return to Qingqiu immediately.

209
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,552
(Zhiyi, Tushan Mansion)

210
00:14:37,283 --> 00:14:38,242
I've been waiting for you.

211
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:58,283
I have

212
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:00,203
been frequently seeing Tushan Hou

213
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:01,523
because...

214
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:02,122
Xiaoyao.

215
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:04,083
No need to explain.

216
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:05,523
I trust you.

217
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:10,283
Once I learned Concubine Lirong
invited Fangfeng Yiying to her banquet,

218
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:11,482
I guessed your intention.

219
00:15:12,802 --> 00:15:14,482
But I don't want
to bother you with this.

220
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:18,763
Anyway, I have already done it.

221
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:20,403
I don't care about what you think.

222
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:22,682
I've sowed enmity

223
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:24,682
between Fangfeng Yiying and Tushan Hou.

224
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:26,283
They will surely mess up.

225
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:28,722
You go back to Qingqiu right now,

226
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:31,443
and take advantage of their conflicts
to find out the truth.

227
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:32,242
Okay.

228
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:34,362
I will find out the truth

229
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:36,323
and not let you down.

230
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,283
It's getting late.

231
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:45,722
I have to go.

232
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,963
I can't let others know I'm here

233
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:49,883
for fear of alerting them.

234
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:51,643
I'll see you out.

235
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:03,203
I have to return to Qingqiu.

236
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:06,128
I can't take the begonia flower
back with me.

237
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:07,763
Would you like to have it?

238
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:11,883
I want to trade it
for something with you.

239
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:43,202
Didn't we have a deal?

240
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:45,962
Before Jing's death,

241
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:47,403
we will not meet in private anymore.

242
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:49,883
Why are you forcing me

243
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:50,722
to see you again?

244
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,763
Do you bring the red fish core

245
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:03,242
you gave me?

246
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:07,643
I forgot to bring it.

247
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:17,722
What's wrong?

248
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,003
You forgot to bring it?

249
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:22,722
Or you gave it
to the Great Princess of Haoling?

250
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,362
Let me explain.

251
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:34,442
I gave the red fish core to Xiaoyao.

252
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:36,283
That's just a stopgap measure.

253
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:38,563
I really haven't taken a fancy to her.

254
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:41,563
In my eyes, she is nothing but prey.

255
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:44,683
She's Tushan Jing's woman,

256
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:45,923
so I want to take her away from him.

257
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:48,163
Yiying, you know
how much I hate Tushan Jing.

258
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:50,523
I wish he lost everything.

259
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:53,322
The Princess of Haoling is your prey.

260
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:56,082
What about me?

261
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:58,403
What am I to you?

262
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:00,803
Are you with me

263
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:02,003
because of the loser Tushan Jing?

264
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:03,643
In your eyes,

265
00:19:03,803 --> 00:19:05,968
I'm just a tool for you
to humiliate him,

266
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:06,563
right?

267
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:07,283
No.

268
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:08,763
Of course not.

269
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:11,322
You are different from the others.

270
00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:14,003
- You're my only beloved one.
- Back off.

271
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:19,242
Look into my eyes.

272
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:21,082
Tell me.

273
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:23,842
I am different from other women

274
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:27,803
because you truly like me?

275
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,202
Or is it because

276
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:32,763
Tushan Jing did nothing,

277
00:19:32,842 --> 00:19:34,482
but I used your child

278
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:35,602
to help trap him?

279
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:41,883
Of course, it's because
I truly like you.

280
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:01,202
You're lying.

281
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:05,082
Yiying.

282
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:13,962
Tushan Hou is too cautious.

283
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:15,523
I was almost discovered by him.

284
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:16,683
To avoid alerting him,

285
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:17,722
I didn't follow further.

286
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:20,043
Fangfeng Yiying is also heavily guarded.

287
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,362
I can't get close to her.

288
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:24,602
Chief.

289
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,683
Next time, I will get something on them.

290
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:29,602
Pack up your bags.

291
00:20:30,722 --> 00:20:32,016
Return to Zhiyi tomorrow morning.

292
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:32,962
- Yes.
- Yes.

293
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,722
Be careful with your hands.

294
00:20:48,283 --> 00:20:48,803
Great Emperor.

295
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:50,643
Chief Tushan is here.

296
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:00,242
I'll go inside.

297
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:01,482
You chat.

298
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,136
Please.

299
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:17,602
Wipe your sweat.

300
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,362
Have Fangfeng Yiying and Tushan Hou met?

301
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:35,643
Did you hear what they said?

302
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:39,442
The people I sent
to follow lost track of them.

303
00:21:43,322 --> 00:21:44,643
Luckily, I traded the begonia flower

304
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:45,722
for the Ape Mirror with you.

305
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:49,563
I hid the Ape Mirror
in the place where they met.

306
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:51,883
And it recorded their secret meeting.

307
00:21:58,563 --> 00:21:59,242
And then?

308
00:22:00,283 --> 00:22:01,322
What did they say?

309
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:04,003
Nothing happened
between me and Fangfeng Yiying.

310
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:05,923
Tushan Tian is my nephew,

311
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:06,962
not my son.

312
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:22,523
Xiaoyao.

313
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,082
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

314
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:27,683
Nor will I hurt you.

315
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,202
Please give me another chance.

316
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:42,442
Can you give me

317
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:46,883
another chance?

318
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:01,163
Yes, I can.

319
00:23:28,763 --> 00:23:29,403
Xuan.

320
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:33,322
I have good news to tell you.

321
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:34,883
What good news?

322
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,242
I set up Fangfeng Yiying and Tushan Hou

323
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:38,842
to make them reveal the truth.

324
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:41,523
Tushan Tian is not Jing's son.

325
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:43,523
There is nothing between Jing

326
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:44,683
and Fangfeng Yiying.

327
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,283
Are you listening to me?

328
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:54,082
Xuan.

329
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,482
So,

330
00:24:01,082 --> 00:24:03,763
you'll make up with Tushan Jing?

331
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:10,602
I will deal with my relationship

332
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:11,643
with Jing

333
00:24:11,643 --> 00:24:12,842
after he gets all things done.

334
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:20,602
Anyway,

335
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:21,883
thank you for your help.

336
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:23,803
Without you,

337
00:24:24,442 --> 00:24:26,923
Fangfeng Yiying and Tushan Hou

338
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,923
Nor would Jing and I

339
00:24:28,923 --> 00:24:30,122
have found out the truth so quickly.

340
00:24:31,683 --> 00:24:32,442
Thank you, Xuan.

341
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:37,043
As long as you're happy.

342
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:39,242
I will go and see grandfather.

343
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,322
Okay.

344
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:43,202
We'll dine after you finish talking.

345
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:49,482
Grandfather, why can't you

346
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:50,923
stop Tushan Jing and Xiaoyao?

347
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,082
Cang Xuan.

348
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:56,482
This is Xiaoyao's choice.

349
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,962
She's not a woman from the Zijin Palace.

350
00:25:00,923 --> 00:25:02,163
She does not want power,

351
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:03,202
fame,

352
00:25:03,923 --> 00:25:05,563
or wealth.

353
00:25:06,163 --> 00:25:07,482
She just wants a man

354
00:25:08,362 --> 00:25:09,602
who's devoted to her

355
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:12,003
and spends the rest of her life with.

356
00:25:14,242 --> 00:25:15,082
She's met the right man.

357
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:23,242
It's been a long time

358
00:25:23,242 --> 00:25:24,602
since I saw Xiaoyao this happy.

359
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:29,322
Why can't I

360
00:25:29,322 --> 00:25:30,643
be the one

361
00:25:32,842 --> 00:25:33,683
who makes Xiaoyao happy?

362
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:38,283
If you don't want Xiaoyao

363
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:40,163
to drift apart from you,

364
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:46,563
then don't try to control her life.

365
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:56,482
I see.

366
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:27,202
Chief,

367
00:26:28,763 --> 00:26:29,872
why do you want to see me?

368
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,442
My mother made a mistake back then.

369
00:26:39,082 --> 00:26:39,923
What she did

370
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:41,803
brought evil consequences.

371
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:48,362
If I spare you and Fangfeng Yiying,

372
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:51,482
and allow you and Tian to reunite

373
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,283
and live the rest of your lives
with enough wealth,

374
00:26:54,683 --> 00:26:55,442
can you accept it?

375
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:00,803
You...

376
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:05,722
You colluded with that princess

377
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:06,722
and conspired against me.

378
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:16,048
You...

379
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:18,763
You actually fooled me.

380
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:30,202
Hou.

381
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:31,842
Please stop.

382
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:33,482
Why can't you stop holding grudge

383
00:27:33,842 --> 00:27:35,722
and live a good life
with your wife and child?

384
00:27:36,202 --> 00:27:37,163
If you're dead,

385
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:38,722
I'll stop.

386
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:47,962
Stop!

387
00:27:51,763 --> 00:27:52,523
Tushan Hou.

388
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,442
The Chief persuaded us
to spare your life.

389
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,602
But you're not grateful

390
00:27:57,923 --> 00:27:59,523
and even trying to kill the Chief.

391
00:27:59,722 --> 00:28:00,403
Guards!

392
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,163
Take Tushan Hou down!

393
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:03,322
Chief.

394
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:06,563
Chief.

395
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:09,082
Hou acted on impulse.

396
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:10,523
Please have mercy

397
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,683
and forgive him.

398
00:28:13,163 --> 00:28:14,442
Shame on you.

399
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,523
So shameless.

400
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:16,683
Don't waste words on her.

401
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:18,523
Just surrender

402
00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:20,523
and await your punishment.

403
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,122
It was her.

404
00:28:26,962 --> 00:28:27,842
She seduced me.

405
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:35,242
This woman

406
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:37,122
shamelessly seduced me.

407
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:48,043
She's behind it all.

408
00:28:50,482 --> 00:28:51,482
I couldn't

409
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,763
resist her seduction.

410
00:28:53,763 --> 00:28:55,082
That's why I made a huge mistake.

411
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:12,683
Chief.

412
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:15,883
What should we do with them?

413
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,442
I'll leave the judgment to you.

414
00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:50,842
(Yiying. Do you remember)

415
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:53,722
(the Dragon Boat Festival that year?)

416
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:55,602
(When we first met,)

417
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:58,602
(you couldn't)

418
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:00,923
(swim at all.)

419
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:02,643
(Once you fell into the water,)

420
00:30:03,442 --> 00:30:05,202
(you forgot to use your spirit power
in panic.)

421
00:30:06,403 --> 00:30:09,883
(Then you got more panicked.)

422
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:12,163
(Since then,)

423
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:13,442
(in my heart,)

424
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:16,003
(you've been the only one I love.)

425
00:30:29,322 --> 00:30:29,923
(It was her.)

426
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:32,482
(She seduced me.)

427
00:30:33,563 --> 00:30:36,442
(This woman shamelessly seduced me.)

428
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:45,242
I thought it was mutual affection

429
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:47,003
and we loved each other.

430
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:54,482
How did he say that I seduced him?

431
00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:57,763
I seduced him?

432
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,283
The elder says you remained silent.

433
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:46,043
Why didn't you defend yourself?

434
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:48,722
Now the elders are convinced

435
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:50,322
that it's all your fault.

436
00:31:52,602 --> 00:31:54,202
The man I love has betrayed me

437
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,403
and hoped that I can die immediately

438
00:31:58,602 --> 00:31:59,643
to absolve him.

439
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:03,883
My family is afraid
of offending your family.

440
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:06,722
They not only severed ties with me,

441
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:10,643
but also offered to severely torture me.

442
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:18,242
It's better for everyone

443
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:20,883
if a bad woman like me is dead.

444
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:22,643
Even if not for yourself,

445
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:25,403
you should think of Tian.

446
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:35,242
I deserved it.

447
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:37,122
I'm inexcusable.

448
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:39,602
But Tian is innocent.

449
00:32:40,442 --> 00:32:41,643
I implore you to take care of him.

450
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,322
I am willing to use all my blood

451
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:46,563
to nourish the spirit
for the Tushan Family.

452
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,008
Okay.

453
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:59,202
I will take good care of Tian.

454
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:01,122
Thank you, Chief.

455
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:09,202
Fangfeng Yiying
tarnished the Tushan Family's reputation

456
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:13,322
and repeatedly attempted
to kill the Chief.

457
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:15,643
She's shameless,

458
00:33:16,242 --> 00:33:17,962
(Altar)
malicious,

459
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:19,842
and inexcusable.

460
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:23,803
From now on, confine her to the altar

461
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:27,683
to nourish the spirit with her blood.

462
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:30,842
She will suffer pain forever.

463
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:35,242
(Tushan Mansion)

464
00:33:35,242 --> 00:33:38,883
Tushan Hou, as a member
of the Tushan Family,

465
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:41,442
is disloyal, unrighteous,

466
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:43,242
and ruthless.

467
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:45,842
He repeatedly attempted
to kill the Chief.

468
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,842
(Tushan Mansion)
Considering he was instigated

469
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:51,242
and repentant,

470
00:33:51,883 --> 00:33:53,362
his punishment shall be lenient.

471
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:56,643
He will be exiled to Haoling

472
00:33:57,082 --> 00:33:59,602
and never return to the Central Plains

473
00:33:59,962 --> 00:34:03,683
and Qingqiu again.

I am celebrating

497
00:36:46,722 --> 00:36:48,603
that Wen Xiaoliu
has found Ye Shiqi again.

498
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:58,083
I'm happy for her.

499
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:06,803
Grandfather, Jing.

500
00:38:06,922 --> 00:38:07,803
It's time to eat.

501
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:16,642
In the past few thousand years,

502
00:38:17,482 --> 00:38:19,003
you're the second one to dare

503
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,363
to be absent-minded
while playing chess with me.

504
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:27,123
I'm sorry.

505
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:28,482
Grandfather.

506
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:29,922
What happened?

507
00:38:30,962 --> 00:38:33,202
He's not concentrating on playing chess.

508
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:36,843
Grandfather.

509
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:38,482
It's just a game.

510
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:40,922
The Great Emperor's chessboard
represents the nation

511
00:38:41,523 --> 00:38:42,523
and its people.

512
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:44,402
I shouldn't be distracted.

513
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:45,843
I will concentrate next time.

514
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:49,763
You have no mood to play chess with me.

515
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:52,442
How can you focus on it?

516
00:38:57,424 --> 00:38:58,064
You have

517
00:38:59,323 --> 00:39:00,682
no ambition for it.

518
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:01,872
Right.

519
00:39:03,482 --> 00:39:04,922
I have no intention
of making achievements.

520
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,642
All right, grandfather, don't be angry.

521
00:39:07,962 --> 00:39:09,003
It's time to eat.

522
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:19,563
I am not angry.

523
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:21,162
He's thinking of you.

524
00:39:21,283 --> 00:39:23,722
So he doesn't take my game seriously.

525
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,003
Very good.

526
00:39:26,523 --> 00:39:27,043
Let's eat.

527
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:28,162
Give me a hand.

528
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:35,922
Time to eat, grandfather.

529
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:36,560
Let's go.

530
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:51,682
Are you still up?

531
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:54,843
Can't you do it tomorrow?

532
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:56,283
Almost done.

533
00:40:21,482 --> 00:40:22,603
Herbal Encyclopedia.

534
00:40:27,682 --> 00:40:29,563
You've written the entire book
from memory.

535
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:32,363
I memorized it well when I was little,

536
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,402
but my medical skills
were not proficient.

537
00:40:34,402 --> 00:40:36,682
So I dared not write it for fear
of making mistakes or omissions

538
00:40:36,922 --> 00:40:37,763
and endangering lives.

539
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,363
Finally,

540
00:40:39,363 --> 00:40:40,642
I have fulfilled a wish of mine.

541
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:42,283
Please have someone send it

542
00:40:42,402 --> 00:40:43,843
to the medical hall

543
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,043
and hand it over to those physicians.

544
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:47,722
After they review
and correct its content,

545
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:49,523
they can open classes

546
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:50,442
to deliver the knowledge.

547
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:53,563
The Herbal Encyclopedia
is life's work of the master.

548
00:40:54,482 --> 00:40:55,363
Even without my order,

549
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:57,482
the physicians will also do their best.

550
00:40:58,642 --> 00:40:59,962
Why don't you deliver it yourself?

551
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,123
I simply want

552
00:41:02,283 --> 00:41:04,882
to eat and drink well
and live peacefully.

553
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:07,043
Fame means nothing

554
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:08,523
to me.

555
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,123
But you are different.

556
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:11,482
You must know

557
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:13,283
the people are like the armor

558
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,763
and weapon that can protect you.

559
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:17,323
I thought

560
00:41:17,323 --> 00:41:18,763
you were busy meeting with Tushan Jing

561
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:20,603
and had long forgotten about me.

562
00:41:20,962 --> 00:41:22,123
How dare I?

563
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:23,123
Your Majesty.

564
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:24,123
I will take it.

565
00:41:24,603 --> 00:41:25,323
Thanks.

566
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:27,024
Jun Yi.

567
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:29,840
Your Majesty.

568
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,682
Send this book to the medical hall.

569
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:34,283
Convey my oral decree.

570
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:36,603
Transcribe and send it
to the medical offices in Xiyan.

571
00:41:36,682 --> 00:41:37,482
Whether rich or poor,

572
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:39,043
anyone aspiring to learn medicine

573
00:41:39,242 --> 00:41:40,882
may borrow and study it.

574
00:41:41,456 --> 00:41:42,032
Yes.

575
00:41:45,242 --> 00:41:46,523
What are your plans next?

576
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:51,682
I plan to open a clinic in Zhiyi.

577
00:41:52,162 --> 00:41:53,083
I'll treat illnesses

578
00:41:53,523 --> 00:41:54,682
and learn from medical practice

579
00:41:55,123 --> 00:41:56,442
to improve my medical skills.

580
00:41:56,922 --> 00:41:57,962
I'll continue

581
00:41:58,402 --> 00:42:00,202
to perfect the medical notes left
by the master.

582
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:03,642
That's excellent.

583
00:42:17,523 --> 00:42:18,283
Your Highness.

584
00:42:18,482 --> 00:42:19,962
We'll open for business like this?

585
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:22,763
Do you have any idea

586
00:42:23,283 --> 00:42:24,523
We used to do the same thing

587
00:42:24,563 --> 00:42:25,402
in Haoling, right?

588
00:42:27,603 --> 00:42:28,642
I thought

589
00:42:28,642 --> 00:42:29,962
it would be different this time.

590
00:42:30,363 --> 00:42:31,603
I didn't expect it to be so quiet.

591
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:45,803
Congratulations on your grand opening
