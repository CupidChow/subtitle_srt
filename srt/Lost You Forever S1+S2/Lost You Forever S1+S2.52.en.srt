00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,944
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:52,481
You have so many faces.

4
00:01:53,642 --> 00:01:55,322
Which one shows the real you?

5
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:58,082
I'm Xiang Liu with Nine Lives.

6
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,322
So all my faces are real.

7
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,241
What's the point
of having so many faces?

8
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,762
Even if you have 81 faces,

9
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:08,842
I can recognize you at a glance.

10
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:11,922
Miss Xiling,

11
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:14,521
what do you want

12
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,202
by recognizing me?

13
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:18,721
I want you...

14
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,402
To remove the poisonous bug.

15
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,521
Name the price.

16
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:30,122
I can't.

17
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:33,202
Why not?

18
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:35,122
You did it for Cang Xuan back then.

19
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:36,601
Why can't you help me?

20
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,441
The poisonous bug is alive.

21
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,721
Times have changed.

22
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,721
If you're able to kill

23
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:43,922
a newborn tiger cub,

24
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:45,762
does that mean you can

25
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:47,521
kill a millennium-old tiger demon?

26
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:49,361
I can't.

27
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:51,282
But can't you do that?

28
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:52,881
If you don't trust me,

29
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:54,962
why bother asking?

30
00:02:58,562 --> 00:03:00,042
What are you doing in Zhiyi?

31
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:01,402
When are you leaving?

32
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:04,322
If you didn't hold me back,

33
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,682
I would have left.

34
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:12,682
What exactly are you here for?

35
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,081
Tushan Jing offered me

36
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:19,402
a great deal to help him
remove the poisonous bug.

37
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:22,042
It's not that I don't want to help.

38
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,801
I simply can't do it.

39
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:25,202
Jing?

40
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:28,521
Is Jing also at the casino?

41
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:30,202
He's right behind you.

42
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:37,282
I distracted the informant.

43
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:38,922
Leave from the side door.

44
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:39,962
Thank you.

45
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,682
I couldn't have gotten away without you.

46
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,001
Let's go as well.

47
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:06,128
I...

48
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:12,562
I don't want to see Cang Xuan.

49
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:14,521
That's why I wandered around

50
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:17,481
and ended up at the underground casino.

51
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:20,201
I didn't know Xiang Liu was there too.

52
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:23,521
I talked with Xiang Liu

53
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:25,201
and we left separately

54
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:26,321
to avoid attention.

55
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,682
But I saw you there,

56
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:28,562
so I followed you

57
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:30,602
and led Miao Pu elsewhere.

58
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:35,321
Don't worry about the bug.

59
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:36,921
Things will work out.

60
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:38,921
We'll figure something out for sure.

61
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:40,336
Alright.

62
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:20,801
Of course, it's nice.

63
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:28,962
Your Majesty.

64
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:29,722
We are family.

65
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:30,842
Spare the formalities.

66
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:31,761
Understood.

67
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:34,384
Xiaoyao.

68
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:37,361
You're out so late.

69
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:38,041
I was worried

70
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:39,521
so I came to pick you up.

71
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:44,361
I'll go home now.

72
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:46,160
Okay.

73
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:56,402
(Fortunately,
Cang Xuan and Xiaoyao are close.)

74
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:58,962
(If the day comes)

75
00:05:58,962 --> 00:05:59,801
(and the bug still)

76
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,282
(hasn't been removed,)

77
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:04,282
(Cang Xuan should show mercy)

78
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:06,521
(to Xiang Liu for Xiaoyao's sake.)

79
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:23,641
Don't drink cold water.

80
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:48,842
Xiaoyao.

81
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:51,201
You don't need to

82
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:53,162
stay out late to avoid me.

83
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:55,682
This is your home.

84
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:58,041
If you don't want to see me, then don't.

85
00:06:58,921 --> 00:06:59,761
I'll leave once I see

86
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:00,761
Grandfather.

87
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,521
I won't disturb you.

88
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,162
I heard you ordered a truce.

89
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:13,321
Yes.

90
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:15,602
It's the rainy season.

91
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:18,162
If we get carried away with the war,

92
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,041
there might be floods

93
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:21,962
that hinder the harvest.

94
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:24,041
The people would starve.

95
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:29,761
Rest early.

96
00:07:30,602 --> 00:07:31,562
I'll go back now.

97
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:33,521
Wait.

98
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:49,722
Aren't you leaving?

99
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:51,842
I'm leaving now.

100
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:17,122
Your Majesty.

101
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:19,321
Our army hasn't won a single battle

102
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:20,402
against Xiyan.

103
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:22,602
We've lost six cities in succession.

104
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:24,481
Now that the rainy season is over

105
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:25,682
and the truce has ended,

106
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:26,882
if you don't take

107
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:27,842
decisive measures,

108
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:30,921
I'm afraid that
the fall of Haoling is imminent.

109
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,208
What...

110
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:34,681
What do you mean by that?

111
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:36,001
His Majesty hasn't

112
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:37,121
made any wrong decisions

113
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:38,722
since the beginning of the war.

114
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:40,802
It's just that Xiyan came prepared

115
00:08:40,802 --> 00:08:42,081
while we weren't.

116
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:43,602
That's why we were losing.

117
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:45,521
Losing a battle or two

118
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,402
can be attributed to that.

119
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:48,441
But we haven't

120
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,521
won a single battle so far,

121
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:54,001
which inevitably raises doubts

122
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,561
about His Majesty's strategy.

123
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:57,881
In your opinion,

124
00:08:58,482 --> 00:09:01,402
where has my strategy gone wrong?

125
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:05,201
Your Majesty's decisions
have always been

126
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:06,441
accurate and prudent.

127
00:09:06,521 --> 00:09:09,042
Then win a battle, and let's see.

128
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:11,842
Report!

129
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,561
Report.

130
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,201
Your Majesty.

131
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:15,042
Good news.

132
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,641
General Ru Shou defeated

133
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:17,681
Chishui Fenglong at Bailing.

134
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:19,681
The enemy has retreated to Yao City.

135
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,201
Heaven blesses Haoling.

136
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:23,441
What were you saying?

137
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:24,602
Haven't we just won?

138
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:28,681
That's it.

139
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:29,842
Court adjourned.

140
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:34,096
Your Majesty.

141
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:46,722
Ru Shou appears frivolous.

142
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,362
But his command in battle

143
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:49,242
is rather fine.

144
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:51,362
Since he's won a battle for Haoling,

145
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:53,042
let's be nicer to him.

146
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:54,362
You're right.

147
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:56,842
I remember that

148
00:09:56,842 --> 00:09:58,521
someone presented a batch of fine gems.

149
00:09:59,042 --> 00:09:59,641
Yes.

150
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,881
You used some of those

151
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:02,561
for hair ornaments and jewelry.

152
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:03,761
There are many left.

153
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:05,881
Reward them to Ru Shou

154
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:07,761
to decorate his armor and weapons.

155
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,042
Our commanding general

156
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,242
must not look shabby.

157
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,922
You're truly thoughtful.

158
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:13,602
Lord Ru Shou will be grateful

159
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:15,121
when he receives them.

160
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,441
That's unnecessary.

161
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:18,482
I only hope that

162
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:19,881
he'll stop opposing me.

163
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:47,201
You didn't tell me you'd come.

164
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:51,201
You are not feeling well.

165
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:52,482
Have you summoned a physician?

166
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:53,561
Yes.

167
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:54,881
It is just a cold.

168
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:56,521
I'll just take some medicine.

169
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:01,641
Why are you still

170
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:03,001
reading these when you are ill?

171
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,722
Some matters need prompt handling

172
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,081
and can't wait.

173
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:10,441
Let me help you.

174
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:17,761
The Xiyan Army
is garrisoned in the city,

175
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:21,121
commanding the people to sow the fields.

176
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:27,482
They are obviously
taking our fields for themselves.

177
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:37,081
Their provisions come from our citizens.

178
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:38,722
Do you understand it?

179
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:42,321
I can read it.

180
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:43,922
But I don't really know

181
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,641
what it's saying.

182
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:47,321
Let me try again.

183
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:49,321
I'm afraid...

184
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:51,001
The memorials are dull

185
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:52,842
and hard to understand.

186
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:55,001
Forget it.

187
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:58,001
Father.

188
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,482
Am I useless?

189
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,521
You always take care of me.

190
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,001
Now that you're overwhelmed,

191
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:05,402
I can't share your burden.

192
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:06,842
I can't even read the memorials.

193
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:09,521
Who says you don't share my burden?

194
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:11,321
You came to see me

195
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:13,081
and care for me.

196
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,681
That makes me happy

197
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,162
and forget about the troubles.

198
00:12:23,761 --> 00:12:24,521
Your Majesty.

199
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:25,201
Time for medicine.

200
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:26,201
I'll do it.

201
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:37,761
Father.

202
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:39,121
Here.

203
00:12:56,282 --> 00:12:56,842
Father.

204
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:01,761
You have more grey hair.

205
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:06,201
My daughter has grown up.

206
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:08,201
Naturally, I've grown old.

207
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,681
And my hair has turned grey.

208
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,201
You are not old at all.

209
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:18,842
You are the most handsome
and valiant father

210
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,561
throughout Dahuang.

211
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:44,001
Father.

212
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:46,482
A patient gets better with medicine

213
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:47,561
and rest.

214
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:49,321
So don't be anxious.

215
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:50,321
Rest well.

216
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:52,802
Ru Shou is mature and prudent,

217
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:53,962
capable and decisive.

218
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:55,962
He will surely defeat the Xiyan army.

219
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:57,362
Alright.

220
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:59,162
I'll do as you say.

221
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:04,441
I've lost this game.

222
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:08,881
Your mind is not on the chess game.

223
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:15,521
In the battle of Bailing,

224
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:19,042
Xiyan suffered its first defeat.

225
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:25,201
The loss of a city and a battle

226
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:27,881
wouldn't worry you so much.

227
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:34,922
I'm not worried about this battle.

228
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:37,162
I'm worried about Fenglong.

229
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:41,681
He's highborn

230
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:42,962
and highly talented.

231
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,081
He grew up being praised by everyone.

232
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,802
He is brave

233
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:50,162
but he lacks resilience.

234
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,042
Ru Shou is also

235
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:53,641
born into a great clan.

236
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:56,042
But he's been tempered to be

237
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,242
resilient by his master.

238
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:58,681
I'm just worried

239
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:01,722
that losing this battle would

240
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:03,681
traumatize Fenglong and undermine

241
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:05,602
the morale of the troops.

242
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:08,162
Nothing is so hard,

243
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:09,922
except for hyping the morale.

244
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:11,881
Once the troops lose morale,

245
00:15:13,441 --> 00:15:15,001
they'll start to lose.

246
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:19,681
Your worries are quite reasonable.

247
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:23,922
Grandfather.

248
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:27,922
I plan to go to Xiyan for a secret visit

249
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,482
to the military camp

250
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:31,482
under the pretext of inspection.

251
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:33,321
Even if I say nothing

252
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:35,482
and only drink with Fenglong,

253
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:37,242
he's smart enough

254
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:39,321
to get over it very soon.

255
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:42,602
Go ahead.

256
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:44,081
With me here,

257
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:46,282
Chenrong Mountain won't be in chaos.

258
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:49,681
Thank you, Grandfather.

259
00:15:58,121 --> 00:15:59,881
You nine-tailed foxes have sharp noses.

260
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:01,482
That spiritual herb

261
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:03,242
was so remote.

262
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:04,641
But you managed to find it.

263
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:07,042
I have to take you with me

264
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:07,842
to find herbs.

265
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:10,001
You can take me along

266
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:11,121
no matter what you do.

267
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:12,842
I don't just collect herbs.

268
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:16,042
I'll also take you with me for weaving.

269
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:17,776
Okay.

270
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:21,162
In ordinary households,

271
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:22,722
men till the land and women weave.

272
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:25,201
But here, I till the land and weave.

273
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:28,482
You only eat.

274
00:16:29,482 --> 00:16:30,402
Tushan Jing.

275
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:32,080
I'm here.

276
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:34,121
Shameless.

277
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:39,282
You collected herbs?

278
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:42,288
Your Majesty.

279
00:16:43,162 --> 00:16:43,761
Xiaoyao.

280
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:47,282
I will be away for a while.

281
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:51,282
To inspect Xiyan Mountain?

282
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,922
That's what I claim to do.

283
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,201
In fact, I'm visiting the army.

284
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:57,641
It will take about a month.

285
00:16:58,641 --> 00:16:59,681
Will it be dangerous?

286
00:17:00,962 --> 00:17:02,081
It's always dangerous.

287
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:03,482
We have come through

288
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,522
the most difficult days.

289
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:06,242
What can be

290
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:07,762
more dangerous than those days?

291
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,762
I'll go with you.

292
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:12,801
Okay.

293
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:19,441
Wait.

294
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:21,681
You are going to Haoling.

295
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:23,921
I'd better not go.

296
00:17:24,722 --> 00:17:26,522
That place doesn't welcome me.

297
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,081
And the people there detest me.

298
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:31,161
I won't disturb them.

299
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,642
Didn't you say that

300
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:36,642
some herbs grow in Haoling

301
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:37,762
and you hadn't seen them

302
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:39,281
to record them in the book?

303
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:41,242
Don't you want to

304
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:42,401
accompany me to Haoling

305
00:17:42,642 --> 00:17:44,281
and see those herbs in person?

306
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,362
I'd rather not go.

307
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,242
Jing.

308
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:59,201
There's something

309
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:00,642
I'd like to discuss with you.

310
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:03,002
Xiyan and Haoling have different

311
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:03,801
products.

312
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:05,801
There have been exchanges before,

313
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:08,321
but it was limited to
items favored by the nobles

314
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:09,962
and did not benefit the people.

315
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:11,882
Your business covers the entire Dahuang.

316
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,801
You know all kinds of products.

317
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,041
Will you accompany me to Haoling

318
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:17,362
and pick some products

319
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,561
to import to the Central Plains?

320
00:18:19,002 --> 00:18:20,722
Isn't it the job of the officials?

321
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,602
Product circulation relies on demand.

322
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:25,201
It can't be done

323
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,362
by just a few officials.

324
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:29,002
It wouldn't be well executed.

325
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:35,602
The exchange of products

326
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:36,722
allows mutual benefit

327
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:37,722
between the kingdoms.

328
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:39,801
It's a great thing for the people.

329
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:41,801
And my family can profit from it.

330
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:43,882
I will follow Your Majesty to Haoling.

331
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:46,192
Alright.

332
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:49,002
Xiaoyao.

333
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:51,362
Will you come along?

334
00:18:58,801 --> 00:18:59,401
Xiaoxiao.

335
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:01,242
Pack up the luggage.

336
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:03,561
For Xiaoyao as well.

337
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:04,784
Understood.

338
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:12,441
He who is adept in war

339
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:14,002
needs not a large army.

340
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:17,602
He who is adept in ridding troubles
acts in advance.

341
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,002
He who is adept in winning

342
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:22,122
seizes unpredicted victory.

343
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,242
Adept in war...

344
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:27,642
Princess.

345
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:29,441
Have some tea.

346
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:44,201
A fight doesn't sound
so different from a battle.

347
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:45,842
It's about fighting someone.

348
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,122
You either fight a few people

349
00:19:48,242 --> 00:19:49,642
or tens of thousands of people.

350
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:51,522
It should be quite the same.

351
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:56,681
I figure it's about the same.

352
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:03,602
I've memorized the art of war.

353
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,002
So I can fight...

354
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:08,122
I mean, lead a battle?

355
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:09,882
You memorized it all?

356
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:12,321
Try and ask me

357
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:13,041
something.

358
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,321
A king leading his troops

359
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:19,242
must have strong supporters

360
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:21,041
to constitute his authority.

361
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:22,321
How can we do that?

362
00:20:22,602 --> 00:20:24,762
Whenever there is a battle,

363
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:26,161
the general is the key

364
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:27,201
and has to know everything

365
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:28,321
instead of a single tactic.

366
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:29,482
He should assign positions

367
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:30,882
to the talented

368
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:32,281
and adapt to changes

369
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:33,762
as a guiding principle.

370
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,081
Therefore, a general should

371
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:38,441
have 60 powerful supporters...

372
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,002
Seven... Seventy.

373
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:47,122
Seventy... How many supporters?

374
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:48,801
Seventy-two.

375
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:51,842
I memorized it just now.

376
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:53,201
Why did I forget it so fast?

377
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:55,842
It must be because

378
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:56,842
you're exhausted.

379
00:20:57,002 --> 00:20:58,002
It's really late.

380
00:20:58,201 --> 00:20:59,441
Call it a day and rest.

381
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:00,080
No way.

382
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:01,081
I have to

383
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:02,081
memorize it tonight.

384
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:04,201
Princess.

385
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,201
I know I'm not bright.

386
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:09,122
And I don't understand the thoughts

387
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:10,482
of those ministers.

388
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,602
But thanks to my father and Cang...

389
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,762
Thanks to my father,

390
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:17,801
I have fine spirit power
and cultivation.

391
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:19,842
I can fight some battles

392
00:21:20,002 --> 00:21:21,321
and share Father's burden.

393
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:22,681
I'm sure you can.

394
00:21:28,281 --> 00:21:29,762
Prepare in accordance.

395
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,242
Understand the principles.

396
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:34,321
Possess unique abilities.

397
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:37,882
Then everything is in place.

398
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:42,602
Prepare in accordance.

399
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:45,362
Understand the principles.

400
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:02,384
Careful.

401
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:16,801
This city was only taken
by Xiyan a few years ago.

402
00:22:17,722 --> 00:22:19,362
Why is it so peaceful

403
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:20,642
as if there has

404
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:21,762
never been a war?

405
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:24,041
His Majesty regulated

406
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:25,522
that whoever dared to

407
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:26,321
disturb the people

408
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:27,882
shall be killed.

409
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:29,401
Every flooding season,

410
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,002
the soldiers would help

411
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:31,921
maintain the dikes

412
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:32,962
and divert the water.

413
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:35,321
Without wars,

414
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:37,921
the people of Haoling
do not harbor hatred

415
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,281
towards the soldiers of Xiyan.

416
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:42,201
I see.

417
00:22:44,882 --> 00:22:46,762
The soldiers of Xiyan are stationed here

418
00:22:48,002 --> 00:22:49,081
and miss their families.

419
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:50,842
His Majesty encourages them

420
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:52,201
to settle down here.

421
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:53,722
This act of His Majesty

422
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:54,882
not only calms them,

423
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:56,561
but also makes them

424
00:22:56,602 --> 00:22:58,401
more cautious while patrolling,

425
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:00,681
because they are not

426
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:02,242
protecting a random city,

427
00:23:02,962 --> 00:23:04,441
but their own home.

428
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:08,122
This is different from the wars

429
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:09,842
I have imagined.

430
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:11,041
His Majesty

431
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,401
and the King of Haoling

432
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:14,161
are not like the Great Emperor

433
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:16,041
and the Great General Chi Chen.

434
00:23:16,882 --> 00:23:17,762
Most importantly,

435
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:20,041
today's Xiyan Kingdom

436
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:21,801
is different from what it used to be.

437
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,362
Freshly made Baihua cakes.

438
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:36,401
I waited in line for a long time.

439
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,122
The sky was black, and the earth yellow.

440
00:23:57,522 --> 00:23:58,882
The world came into being.

441
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:01,362
Dahuang was originally one family.

442
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:04,081
There was no Chenrong Family,

443
00:24:04,362 --> 00:24:05,681
Haoling Family,

444
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:07,681
or Xiyan Family.

445
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,882
Civilians from Haoling
in the Central Plains,

446
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:13,242
the North, and the South,

447
00:24:13,842 --> 00:24:17,561
are all descendants
of the Great Emperor Fuxi and Nüwa.

448
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:20,681
From the deities

449
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:22,201
to the mortals,

450
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,122
they revered one emperor.

451
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:26,962
The kingdom was stable and orderly.

452
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:30,041
The people led a peaceful life.

453
00:24:30,962 --> 00:24:31,522
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

454
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:32,722
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

455
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:39,882
You asked that storyteller

456
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:41,002
to say that, didn't you?

457
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:43,362
"The world is one family."

458
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,441
He sounded convincing.

459
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:47,722
Even I was influenced,

460
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,002
let alone the commoners.

461
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:51,522
He was telling the truth.

462
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:53,842
I just want the commoners

463
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,602
to face the truth.

464
00:24:58,281 --> 00:24:59,722
I hope the truth won't

465
00:25:00,722 --> 00:25:01,962
cost them their lives.

466
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:06,602
I've lived in Haoling
for over 200 years.

467
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:09,561
(I have been a fisherman,)

468
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:11,441
(working hard to catch fish)

469
00:25:11,602 --> 00:25:12,722
(from day to night.)

470
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:16,522
(I have also been a peddler,)

471
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,401
(buying cheap liquor
with hard-earned money)

472
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:20,642
(and drinking heartily with my friends.)

473
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:22,482
(I have also been a soldier,)

474
00:25:23,242 --> 00:25:25,242
(fighting alongside Haoling's troops)

475
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:27,122
(and killing bandits.)

476
00:25:29,002 --> 00:25:30,962
When I was forced to leave Xiyan

477
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,321
and wandered all over Haoling,

478
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:36,561
it was the people here

479
00:25:36,642 --> 00:25:38,602
who accompanied me through

480
00:25:39,722 --> 00:25:41,681
those lonely and confusing days.

481
00:25:42,602 --> 00:25:44,122
They have long passed away.

482
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:46,962
But their descendants

483
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:49,522
still live on this land.

484
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:51,842
They still work hard to support

485
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:53,122
their families,

486
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:55,762
buy liquor with their hard-earned money,

487
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:58,002
dance under the moonlight

488
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:00,921
to pursue the girls they fancy,

489
00:26:01,842 --> 00:26:03,882
and still risk their lives

490
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:05,882
to fight off bandits.

491
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:08,201
I know their hardships.

492
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,681
And I know their joy.

493
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:15,842
For 200 years,

494
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:19,681
you have lived among them.

495
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:25,722
Xiaoyao.

496
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,842
When it comes to
affection for this land,

497
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:29,722
mine can only be deeper,

498
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:32,321
and not shallower than yours.

499
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:37,482
I feel ashamed.

500
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,722
I was once the Princess of Haoling,

501
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:45,362
but I hardly know this place at all.

502
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:47,762
You are the one who has trekked

503
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:49,122
through every inch

504
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:51,962
of its land and rivers.

505
00:26:55,122 --> 00:26:55,722
I admit that

506
00:26:56,921 --> 00:26:58,362
I have lofty ambitions.

507
00:26:59,122 --> 00:27:00,842
But I will act in accordance

508
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:03,041
with the tide of the era.

509
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:06,201
A unified Dahuang
is good for all the people.

510
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:10,002
But war is inevitable.

511
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:13,362
There will be bloodshed.

512
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:16,842
But I have done my utmost

513
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:18,482
to avoid harming the innocent.

514
00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:22,681
Xiaoyao.

515
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:25,681
I don't expect you

516
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,002
to agree with my actions.

517
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:27,882
But at least,

518
00:27:30,602 --> 00:27:32,441
please see my efforts.

519
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:39,056
Okay.

520
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:57,362
Try the shrimp.

521
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:03,321
It's grilled just right.

522
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,401
It's perfect.

523
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:10,482
I made this sweet and sour lotus root.

524
00:28:10,642 --> 00:28:11,561
Try it.

525
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:13,762
It's also nice.

526
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:17,921
Try the grilled fish too.

527
00:28:21,642 --> 00:28:22,801
This is duck meat with taro.

528
00:28:24,842 --> 00:28:26,002
Boiled river snails.

529
00:28:29,722 --> 00:28:30,681
Stir-fried wild rice stems.

530
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:32,041
That's enough.

531
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:34,041
I can't finish these.

532
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:43,122
This is newly brewed green plum wine.

533
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:45,081
River delicacies

534
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:47,201
go better with mulberry wine.

535
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:51,642
I'll drink both, alright?

536
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:57,602
Let's camp out here tonight.

537
00:28:58,762 --> 00:28:59,401
Sure.

538
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:19,161
This tent fends off
wild beasts and insects.

539
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:20,242
It's very safe.

540
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:21,921
So pretty.

541
00:29:22,522 --> 00:29:24,321
Only the Tushan Family is

542
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:25,522
luxurious enough

543
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:27,482
to craft something so fancy.

544
00:29:29,722 --> 00:29:30,384
Do you like it?

545
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:32,400

I slept outdoors many times.

568
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:28,882
But camping in the wilderness

569
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,041
was never

570
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,401
something amusing.

571
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:34,522
It meant that I was homeless

572
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,281
and in constant danger.

573
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:38,921
I had to stay vigilant

574
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:41,002
even in my sleep.

575
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:42,602
It's all in the past.

576
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,081
Those days of

577
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:46,602
wandering about in danger

578
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,642
are in the past.

579
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:49,872
That's right.

580
00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:51,962
It's in the past.

581
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,576
♪Steer through this bumpy road♪

582
00:30:54,992 --> 00:30:59,024
♪Love often brings difficulties♪

583
00:30:59,642 --> 00:31:00,201
That's right.

584
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:02,722
Camping here is completely different

585
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:05,482
from my past experience.

586
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:07,921
Xuan.

587
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:10,122
Jing.

588
00:31:11,522 --> 00:31:12,642
Thank you.

589
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:16,401
I'm really happy tonight.

590
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:34,000
(Xiyan Military Camp)

591
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,722
I think I'll stay out.

592
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:44,081
Fenglong just lost.

593
00:31:44,122 --> 00:31:45,161
He must be in a bad mood.

594
00:31:45,722 --> 00:31:47,642
Won't I annoy him more if I visit?

595
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:49,161
It's been twenty years.

596
00:31:49,161 --> 00:31:50,482
Will you hide for a lifetime?

597
00:31:50,602 --> 00:31:52,081
You fled a marriage.

598
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:53,962
Neither Fenglong nor Jing minds it.

599
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:55,522
Why can't you let it go?

600
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:03,401
Your Majesty.

601
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:04,962
Fenglong.

602
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:05,801
Hurry.

603
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:07,962
Tell her now.

604
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:10,081
Do you even have time

605
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:11,642
to think about her running away?

606
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:13,921
From the moment I open my eyes

607
00:32:14,242 --> 00:32:15,321
to when I go to bed,

608
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,281
I'm thinking about Ru Shou.

609
00:32:17,642 --> 00:32:18,962
I even dream about him.

610
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:21,321
I ponder methods all day and night

611
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:22,642
of how to defeat him.

612
00:32:23,762 --> 00:32:25,242
I don't have time for anything else.

613
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:26,122
Jing.

614
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:28,801
Do you mind that
she ran away from the wedding?

615
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,561
Not in the least.

616
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:32,041
You hear that?

617
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,122
One has forgotten about it.

618
00:32:34,122 --> 00:32:35,242
The other doesn't mind it.

619
00:32:35,362 --> 00:32:36,962
Can you let it go now?

620
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:41,281
General.

621
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,602
Miss Xiling.

622
00:32:50,281 --> 00:32:51,602
Why did you come with His Majesty?

623
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:52,882
I thought no one

624
00:32:52,882 --> 00:32:54,201
could beat you in your lifetime.

625
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:55,602
But Ru Shou

626
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,321
defeated you three times in a row.

627
00:32:57,722 --> 00:32:59,002
I have to come for fun.

628
00:33:00,482 --> 00:33:01,081
Your Majesty.

629
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:02,041
Listen to him.

630
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:03,522
What is he saying?

631
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:07,561
Your Majesty.

632
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:08,496
Jing.

633
00:33:08,842 --> 00:33:09,842
Let's talk inside.

634
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:12,242
Your Majesty.

635
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:16,482
Please rise.

636
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:20,161
Jin Xuan has been

637
00:33:20,161 --> 00:33:21,842
collecting intelligence about Haoling

638
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:23,561
and is very familiar with

639
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:24,522
their products.

640
00:33:24,522 --> 00:33:25,441
She will

641
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:26,962
show you around.

642
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:28,321
We'll discuss

643
00:33:28,722 --> 00:33:30,122
how to proceed later.

644
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:30,768
Understood.

645
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:32,482
Report.

646
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,081
Haoling launched a surprise attack.

647
00:33:35,122 --> 00:33:37,081
General Xian lost to
the enemy General Qin Mang.

648
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:37,921
Our army lost

649
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:38,921
and retreated to Lishui.

650
00:33:42,201 --> 00:33:43,002
Pass my orders.

651
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,081
Tell Chishui Xian

652
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:46,122
to join the main force
at the northern bank of Lishui.

653
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:46,896
Understood.

654
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:55,888
Your Majesty.

655
00:33:56,522 --> 00:33:57,762
I told Chishui Xian to retreat

656
00:33:58,081 --> 00:33:59,801
not because I wanted to
keep my people safe,

657
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:01,122
but because...

658
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,081
I understand.

659
00:34:02,242 --> 00:34:04,441
Preserving our troops
is the top priority.

660
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:07,642
Territories can be gained or lost.

661
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:10,482
But the deceased
can't be brought back to life.

662
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,201
If you let Chishui Xian press on alone,

663
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:15,242
and end up losing the right-wing army,

664
00:34:15,242 --> 00:34:17,242
that would be an irreversible defeat.

665
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:19,401
As long as they're alive,

666
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:23,401
I believe we'll keep
gaining territories.

667
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,242
Thank you, Your Majesty.

668
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:26,601
I'm incompetent.

669
00:34:27,522 --> 00:34:28,881
I have failed you.

670
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:31,282
It's the fourth defeat.

671
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:33,802
I am truly too ashamed to face you.

672
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:40,242
If you feel ashamed to face me,

673
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:42,322
should I ask the court officials

674
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:44,002
to wear masks to the court meetings

675
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:45,802
from now on?

676
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:49,562
From the secret military training

677
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:51,441
to the formation of a plan

678
00:34:51,962 --> 00:34:54,482
and the capture of six Haoling cities,

679
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:57,482
you've made great contributions.

680
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:00,322
Do you remember our agreement?

681
00:35:00,562 --> 00:35:01,282
Yes, I do.

682
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,361
We agreed to fight side by side.

683
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:05,762
Are you going to back down

684
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:07,441
after a few losses?

685
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:08,121
No,

686
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:09,681
I won't ever back down.

687
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:10,681
In that case,

688
00:35:10,921 --> 00:35:11,921
shake off

689
00:35:11,921 --> 00:35:13,322
that defeated look.

690
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:15,401
Victory and defeat are common.

691
00:35:15,802 --> 00:35:16,962
Who gets to win

692
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:19,322
in all the military affairs?

693
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:22,161
I won't let you down.

694
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:23,121
Alright.

695
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:26,992
(Cheng'en Palace)

696
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:29,940
(Sunlight Hall)

697
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:30,576
Your Majesty,

698
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:32,082
our army won another battle

699
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:34,401
against the Xiyan Army
in the south of Lishui.

700
00:35:34,562 --> 00:35:36,841
Please reward our troops to boost

701
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:37,722
their morale.

702
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:40,082
Convey my decree.

703
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:42,562
Reward the troops

704
00:35:42,762 --> 00:35:43,762
based on merits.

705
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:45,441
Yes, Your Majesty.

706
00:35:53,802 --> 00:35:54,401
Your Majesty,

707
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:57,282
I believe the top priority

708
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,002
is not giving out rewards,

709
00:35:59,482 --> 00:36:01,722
but naming an heir.

710
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,282
We'll discuss it another day.

711
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:06,201
Your Majesty.

712
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:08,762
It's a time of war.

713
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,681
You have to name an heir
to stabilize the troop's morale.

714
00:36:13,282 --> 00:36:14,762
Your Majesty has no sons

715
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:16,002
and only a daughter.

716
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:18,601
I suggest Your Majesty
make the princess the Crown Princess.

717
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:23,762
Make the princess the Crown Princess?

718
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:28,601
Your Majesty.

719
00:36:28,802 --> 00:36:30,282
Princess is good.

720
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:31,681
But it's a matter

721
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:32,762
of great importance.

722
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:33,962
It may require

723
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:35,361
further discussion.

724
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:38,441
I disagree with appointing her

725
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:39,681
as the Crown Princess.

726
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:41,562
Cultivating heirs to secure the kingdom

727
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:43,441
is Your Majesty's responsibility.

728
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:45,921
But among the two princesses,

729
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:46,962
one is a fake

730
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,161
and a disgrace to Haoling
whose real bloodline

731
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:50,762
remains questionable.

732
00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:51,962
The other one...

733
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:53,722
Forgive my frankness.

734
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:55,841
Your Majesty failed to

735
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:56,962
teach her well

736
00:36:57,121 --> 00:36:59,042
and spoiled her, which made her ignorant

737
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:00,161
and incapable.

738
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:03,201
If the princess can't be my successor,

739
00:37:04,082 --> 00:37:07,201
who do you think
can live up to the title?

740
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:09,841
I suggest you select the heir

741
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:11,082
from your nephews.

742
00:37:12,282 --> 00:37:13,522
Seconded.

743
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:15,322
My nephews?

744
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:19,681
Do you remember

745
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:22,161
whose sons they are?

746
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:23,482
- I object.
- I object.

747
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:29,002
Your Majesty has only one daughter.

748
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:30,802
But you disagree with

749
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:32,282
making her the heir.

750
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:34,121
Now, do you have any solutions

751
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:35,121
other than choosing

752
00:37:35,242 --> 00:37:36,562
from His Majesty's nephews?

753
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:37,401
Your Majesty.

754
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:41,082
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

755
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:46,042
These two old rascals

756
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:46,881
from Baihu and Changxi

757
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:47,962
have gone too far.

758
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:49,482
They're outrageous!

759
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:53,962
It's all my fault.

760
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,002
If I were more capable,

761
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,082
Father wouldn't

762
00:37:57,082 --> 00:37:58,002
suffer such humiliation.

763
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,282
Please don't say that.

764
00:38:00,082 --> 00:38:01,722
They were obviously picking on you.

765
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:02,841
No.

766
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:05,522
It doesn't suit me

767
00:38:05,522 --> 00:38:06,361
to put up with it.

768
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:07,401
I can't bear it.

769
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:08,042
I must show them

770
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:08,641
what I've got.

771
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:10,601
You finally decided to take action?

772
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:13,522
That's great.

773
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,881
You should have taught

774
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:16,762
those two old men

775
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:17,802
a lesson long ago.

776
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:31,161
This is the Fusang Bracelet

777
00:38:31,161 --> 00:38:33,282
forged by the Jintian Family for you.

778
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:34,681
With this rare weapon,

779
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:36,161
you will surely make them

780
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:37,161
cry and beg for mercy.

781
00:38:58,322 --> 00:39:01,082
Make His Majesty go for
Chenrong instead of Xiyan Mountain.

782
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:02,562
His Majesty still believes

783
00:39:02,562 --> 00:39:03,601
that it was my idea.

784
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:06,601
He thinks I came up with the plan

785
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:08,282
to secure the victory.

786
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:09,722
His Majesty has always

787
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,121
held gratitude and trust toward me.

788
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:13,522
That's why I hold a prominent position

789
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,522
as His Majesty's friend.

790
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:16,042
Jing.

791
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:18,322
Why don't you ever compete with me?

792
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:20,121
But I have.

793
00:39:20,722 --> 00:39:22,881
I've only given up
the things I don't want.

794
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,681
I never gave you

795
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:27,282
anything I truly care about.

796
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,522
Are you talking about Xiaoyao?

797
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:30,608
That's right.

798
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:33,762
I do not seek fame and fortune.

799
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,082
What I want

800
00:39:36,681 --> 00:39:37,962
is just that one person.

801
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:41,681
You see me as a brother.

802
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:44,641
But I haven't been fair to you.

803
00:39:45,562 --> 00:39:47,161
I knew you had feelings for Xiaoyao

804
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:50,562
yet I snatched her away from you
in your house.

805
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:53,242
And I had Fangfeng Bei help me

806
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:55,921
take her away from the wedding.

807
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:58,841
I've never done anything guilty,

808
00:39:59,762 --> 00:40:00,881
except for these things

809
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:02,881
against you.

810
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,441
I always thought
you were composed and generous,

811
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:14,522
acting with clear and noble intent.

812
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:16,722
I always feel humble whenever I see you.

813
00:40:17,002 --> 00:40:19,522
But it turns out that
you are just a selfish man

814
00:40:19,722 --> 00:40:20,762
with dark intentions.

815
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:22,601
Fenglong.

816
00:40:24,282 --> 00:40:26,242
I want your sincere blessings.

817
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:28,042
Do you care?

818
00:40:28,082 --> 00:40:29,082
Yes, I do.

819
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:30,881
You know.

820
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:32,082
I won't ever get

821
00:40:32,082 --> 00:40:33,322
my older brother's blessing.

822
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:36,201
I don't want to miss yours.

823
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,282
Since you're sincerely asking,

824
00:40:39,441 --> 00:40:40,441
I'll think about it.

825
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:42,242
Okay.

826
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:44,121
Take your time.

827
00:40:45,282 --> 00:40:46,401
I should feel fortunate

828
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:47,921
that you want Xiaoyao.

829
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:48,962
If you want

830
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:50,161
the same thing I want,

831
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,641
we'll become competitors.

832
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:53,441
Then we can't be buddies.

833
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:54,681
I'm also glad that

834
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:58,082
you haven't taken a fancy
to my loved one.

835
00:40:59,522 --> 00:41:00,762
Or I'd have to duel with you.

836
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:11,641
Princess.

837
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:14,401
Aren't we going to teach those two

838
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:15,441
old men a lesson?

839
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,921
Why did we come to

840
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:17,641
the Xiyan army?

841
00:41:17,762 --> 00:41:18,681
We'll be in trouble

842
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:19,681
if we're caught.

843
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:20,681
Let's just go.

844
00:41:20,841 --> 00:41:21,441
Let me kill

845
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:22,562
that treacherous man.

846
00:41:22,921 --> 00:41:24,201
I have to show those old men

847
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:25,441
that I'm not spoiled

848
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,121
and useless.

849
00:41:27,082 --> 00:41:28,361
Princess, think twice.

850
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:30,082
He has a noble identity

851
00:41:30,482 --> 00:41:31,802
and is heavily guarded.

852
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:33,242
And he possesses greater spirit power.

853
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:35,201
It won't be easy to kill him.

854
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:38,201
That's enough.

855
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:39,522
Distract the guards.

856
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:40,802
I must kill him today.

857
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:43,762
Hurry up.

858
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:44,562
Princess.

859
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:46,242
Play it by ear.

860
00:41:46,562 --> 00:41:47,641
Don't push yourself.

861
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:48,161
Enough.

862
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:48,976
Right.

863
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:50,562
Escape once you distract them.

864
00:41:50,722 --> 00:41:51,401
Be careful.

865
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:58,802
Who is there? Stop!

866
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:47,881
Who are you?

867
00:42:54,722 --> 00:42:55,242
Traitor.

868
00:42:56,082 --> 00:42:56,962
You're shameless.

869
00:42:57,921 --> 00:42:58,681
You are from Haoling?

870
00:42:58,802 --> 00:42:59,562
