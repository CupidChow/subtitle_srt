=Episode 8=

3
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,090
If it hadn't been for Chi Chen,

4
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,291
Auntie wouldn't have...

5
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:44,331
Xiang Liu is way too bold.

6
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,331
How dare he approach Xiaoyao?

7
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,490
Cang Xuan.

8
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,051
Rest assured.

9
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,530
Xiaoyao is not like your Auntie.

10
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:57,891
She has always

11
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,571
and will always

12
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,651
put you first.

13
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,410
What worries you will not happen.

14
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,170
Xuan.

15
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:34,090
I saw you smiling.

16
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:36,170
Does it mean you're not angry anymore?

17
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,051
Am I right?

18
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,611
I wasn't angry, anyway.

19
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,730
As for Fenglong...

20
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:51,851
As for Fenglong,

21
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,131
I will compensate him.

22
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:57,570
From now on, just think of him

23
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,411
as a total stranger.

24
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,411
I have caused you

25
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:04,810
so much trouble,

26
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,051
offending the Chenrong Family

27
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:08,971
and the Chishui Family at the same time.

28
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:10,491
I thought

29
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,851
you would at least teach me a lesson.

30
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,771
Even if I was upset,

31
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:16,131
it would be because

32
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:17,810
you went to Qingqiu

33
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:18,891
without telling me.

34
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:24,611
Xuan, don't be mad at me.

35
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,810
I was so lost at that moment

36
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:29,851
and didn't know how to contact you.

37
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,290
I only know Yu Xin in the Qingshui Town.

38
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:34,370
So I had him take me

39
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,730
to Qingqiu on an impulse.

40
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,090
Is that so?

41
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:42,851
Of course.

42
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:44,650
Xuan.

43
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,170
I caused so much trouble.

44
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,211
Of course, I would think of you first.

45
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:51,891
Is it nice?

46
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,691
Enough, stop acting nice.

47
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,496
Sit down and chat with me.

48
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,051
I'll go back to Wushen Mountain

49
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,472
and apologize to Father tomorrow.

50
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:08,272
Alright.

51
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,211
I will have Xiaoxiao go with you.

52
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:16,931
What I did

53
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:19,771
was a huge disgrace to Father

54
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:22,331
and almost ruined his reputation
in Dahuang.

55
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,811
I'm sure

56
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:26,531
the ministers of Haoling loathe me

57
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:27,970
to their guts.

58
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,771
If you can't stay in Haoling,

59
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,170
stay on Xiaoyue Peak forever.

60
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,730
My reputation is tarnished
and everyone shuns me.

61
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:42,771
Thank you for taking me in.

62
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,491
Actually, you can keep me company

63
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,970
if you don't ever get married.

64
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,531
If no one marries me,

65
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,331
you'll have to keep me company.

66
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:54,811
Of course, I will.

67
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:57,771
You can practice medicine.

68
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,611
Once I'm done with the court affairs

69
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:01,570
every day,

70
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:02,970
I will come here

71
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:05,250
to talk and have meals with you.

72
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,250
Once the court affairs

73
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,531
get on the right track,

74
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,690
I will be freer.

75
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,371
I can teach you to brew wine.

76
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:15,771
You can teach me medical skills.

77
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,371
If you find it

78
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:19,371
boring on Chenrong Mountain,

79
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:21,331
we can go back to Xiyan Mountain.

80
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,491
Or

81
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,531
we can travel throughout Dahuang.

82
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:29,250
That sounds

83
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:30,931
quite nice.

84
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,450
Didn't you promise the princess

85
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,450
to rest well?

86
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,690
I will naturally keep my promise to her.

87
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:54,544
(Accounts of Tushan Family)

88
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:57,091
I'll entrust these accounts to you.

89
00:05:57,611 --> 00:05:58,290
Yes.

90
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,211
Chief.

91
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:04,690
Chief, it's time to take the medicine.

92
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,371
Why are there two bowls?

93
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,931
Chief asked for it.

94
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:30,570
It's a bait.

95
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,410
A bait?

96
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:36,891
As you predicted,

97
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:38,211
the Chief is increasing

98
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,491
the dosage day by day.

99
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,491
He must be getting worse.

100
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:43,651
Can you tell how long he may stay alive

101
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:44,811
from the dosage?

102
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,371
I'm afraid not.

103
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:47,970
Three years to five years.

104
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,690
Or ten years to twenty years.

105
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,410
No way.

106
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:52,211
I can't wait anymore.

107
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,970
But the senior master said...

108
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:54,931
Keep him in the dark.

109
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,250
Once Tushan Jing dies,

110
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,730
Hou won't be able to blame me.

111
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:22,730
Father.

112
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:23,730
Welcome home.

113
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:24,850
Are you tired?

114
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:27,010
No.

115
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:35,371
I have caused so much trouble

116
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:36,931
for you and Haoling.

117
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,450
Why is everyone acting like

118
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:41,051
nothing has happened?

119
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,290
Have you forgotten

120
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,450
what I've told you?

121
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,091
You can act recklessly

122
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,130
because your father is a powerful king.

123
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:50,931
My daughter gets to act recklessly.

124
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:53,091
Now you know that I am the obedient one.

125
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,010
My sister only looks obedient.

126
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,250
But once she

127
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,170
causes trouble,

128
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,651
it's something shocking.

129
00:07:59,250 --> 00:07:59,891
Indeed.

130
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:02,531
You must never learn from me, okay?

131
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:04,450
Great Princess.

132
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:06,570
I want to ask about Fengfeng Bei...

133
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,290
Actually, I don't have anything

134
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,371
to ask about Fangfeng Bei.

135
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:16,891
I suddenly remember

136
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,771
that I still have

137
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:19,771
work to do.

138
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,528
I will

139
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,051
take my leave.

140
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:23,376
Go ahead.

141
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:26,931
I also need to consult

142
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,211
with the Second Princess.

143
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,120
What?

144
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,291
I'm not going. Let go of me.

145
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,128
Hurry up.

146
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:53,250
I heard you went to the Tushan Mansion.

147
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,171
Right.

148
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:57,050
I went to see Tushan Jing in Qingqiu.

149
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,651
Do you need me to do something?

150
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,010
I told you I could

151
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,291
send troops to wipe out
the Fangfeng Family

152
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,490
and snatch

153
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,690
Tushan Jing for you.

154
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,091
I meant it.

155
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:09,010
Thank you, Father.

156
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:12,411
But I want to handle it myself.

157
00:09:13,731 --> 00:09:14,531
I want to face it

158
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:16,610
instead of avoiding it.

159
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:18,651
Alright.

160
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,490
But remember,

161
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,810
your father

162
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,610
is a formidable king.

163
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:27,130
You can always ask me

164
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:28,690
for anything.

165
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,370
I get it, Father.

166
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,050
Father.

167
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,091
Actually, I want to use your help

168
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:36,570
on one thing.

169
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:37,570
May I have

170
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,930
the key to your private treasury?

171
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,610
I want to explore
your cherished treasures.

172
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:42,651
Making pills again?

173
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,091
That's right.

174
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:46,171
But it's different this time.

175
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,810
I'm not making poison.

176
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,411
I'm making a remedy.

177
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,370
Done.

178
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,130
(I just killed a fish demon underwater.)

179
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,851
This is its fish core.

180
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,091
Hou,

181
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,731
may I have it?

182
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:05,370
Xinyue,

183
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:07,050
I need this fish core.

184
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,570
I'll ask someone next time

185
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,731
to get another one for you.

186
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,610
(Among the three women on the boat,)

187
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,211
(only Fangfeng Yiying)

188
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:16,331
(showed no interest
in the red fish core.)

189
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:18,411
(Maybe she knew)

190
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,130
(that Tushan Hou)

191
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:21,490
(would give it to her.)

192
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:24,130
(Jing may be very careful,)

193
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:26,171
(but he can be negligent,)

194
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,450
(allowing Tushan Hou
and Fangfeng Yiying)

195
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,331
(to set him up.)

196
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,010
(The best solution is)

197
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,531
(to nip the crisis in the bud.)

198
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:36,211
I sense your murderous intent.

199
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:40,731
Where does it come from?

200
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,331
I want to kill two people.

201
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,651
But death won't solve the problem.

202
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,531
So what's the solution?

203
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:50,771
The truth.

204
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:55,531
I want to know the truth.

205
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,010
Since ancient times,

206
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:01,810
it's always been easy
to conceal the truth

207
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:02,930
but hard to reveal it.

208
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:06,130
Especially in courts and major clans,

209
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,731
death

210
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,531
can easily silence and wipe out

211
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,651
everything.

212
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,211
On the contrary, finding the truth

213
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,610
and revealing it to all is difficult.

214
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,411
I know it's hard.

215
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,891
But I don't want to be fooled.

216
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,050
I must figure out

217
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,851
what exactly happened.

218
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,296
I'm going back

219
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:31,331
to the Central Plains.

220
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:35,184
Alright.

221
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:36,690
Just remember.

222
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,771
I am always here.

223
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,211
Don't put up with anything

224
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:42,731
that upsets you.

225
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,490
Come back to me.

226
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,211
As you expected,

227
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,731
this herb is called Zhuhuang.

228
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:03,050
It can treat heart diseases,

229
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:04,291
but it's poisonous.

230
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,731
One must be very careful

231
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:07,211
with the dosage.

232
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,450
I discovered that someone had

233
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,411
increased its dosage

234
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,010
in your medicine,

235
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,891
turning the remedy into poison.

236
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:16,010
If you take it for one month,

237
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,450
you'll die from a severed

238
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:18,490
heart meridian.

239
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,010
Fortunately, you noticed it.

240
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:21,731
Or you'd be in grave danger.

241
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:27,771
Anything?

242
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,570
Chief.

243
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:31,771
The poisoner has committed suicide.

244
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,450
But I followed the lead

245
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,810
and found the person behind her.

246
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,291
It's Xuanzhou, the lady's maid.

247
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:42,211
I knew it.

248
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:45,810
Bring them here.

249
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,490
Yes.

250
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:23,690
How dare you

251
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:26,570
poison Chief Tushan?

252
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,851
Confess now!

253
00:14:37,171 --> 00:14:38,610
Xuanzhou is your maid.

254
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:41,851
What do you have to say?

255
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:44,450
I...

256
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,130
I...

257
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,930
I poisoned Chief because of the lady.

258
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:50,731
She is the mastermind.

259
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:51,651
You...

260
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:52,930
Stop talking nonsense.

261
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,930
Chief has been seriously ill.

262
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,370
The lady has been upset

263
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,731
and often taken it out on me.

264
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,891
I was enraged

265
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:01,010
and retaliated against her

266
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,771
by tampering with Chief's medicine.

267
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:05,731
How dare she?

268
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,651
Unacceptable!

269
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:11,851
At this point,

270
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,971
I have nothing to say.

271
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:15,450
I'll bear the consequences.

272
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:18,211
Please do not implicate my family.

273
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,450
Xuanzhou is my maid.

274
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,250
I can't shirk responsibility
for her behavior.

275
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:01,570
Please punish me.

276
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,610
You only care about Xuan

277
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,810
and not me.

278
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,930
She's not concerned about Xuan.

279
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,411
I bet she's

280
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:15,610
concerned about the owner of the pill.

281
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:18,651
So that's how it is.

282
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,891
Xiaoyao, tell me.

283
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:20,731
Who is it?

284
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:22,010
It's getting late.

285
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:22,851
I have to go.

286
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:27,536
Xiaoyao.

287
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,512
You are sensitive to cold.

288
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:31,930
So come back in winter.

289
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:33,411
We will stay warm and cozy

290
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,610
on Wushen Mountain.

291
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:36,771
Okay.

292
00:16:37,211 --> 00:16:38,450
I'll teach you to swim.

293
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,424
I'll catch crabs in the sea
and grill fish for you, alright?

294
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,096
Alright.

295
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:42,930
I'll wait for you.

296
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,610
Father.

297
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:45,971
I'm leaving.

298
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:47,728
Go ahead.

299
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:28,970
I thought we could

300
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,411
capture Fangfeng Yiying,

301
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,210
but she got away again.

302
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,850
What a cunning woman.

303
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,811
Xuanzhou is dead.

304
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,291
Fangfeng Yiying got away with it.

305
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:40,210
It might be hard

306
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,771
to catch her in action in a short time.

307
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,051
It's pointless for you
to stay in Qingqiu.

308
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,891
You might as well set off for Zhiyi.

309
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,090
I can't leave before I solve

310
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:52,571
this issue thoroughly.

311
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,010
Chief, Princess sent you a letter.

312
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,288
(Jing. I'm going back to Chenrong
Mountain. See you at Zhiyi. Xiaoyao)

313
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:04,850
Jing Ye.

314
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,610
Pack up.

315
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,811
We'll go to Zhiyi tomorrow.

316
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:08,651
I'll pack up now.

317
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,210
What did Princess say?

318
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,970
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

319
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,090
Xiaoyao is returning
to Chenrong Mountain

320
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,891
and asks to meet me in Zhiyi.

321
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:23,952
Your Majesty.

322
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,811
The combat power

323
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:27,651
of the naval forces has been

324
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:28,610
greatly improved.

325
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,850
Here is the result of the drill.

326
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,370
Please review it.

327
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:34,291
Bring it here.

328
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,130
Princess is back.

329
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,730
Your Majesty.

330
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,090
Princess is back.

331
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,931
Your Majesty, Princess is back.

332
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,651
Fenglong will stay.

333
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:56,330
The rest of you may leave.

334
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,451
I take my leave.

335
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,610
Fenglong.

336
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,171
Are you still holding a grudge?

337
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:15,811
To be honest,

338
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:17,771
I may pretend

339
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:19,051
to not care at all,

340
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:22,130
but whenever someone mentions Xiao...

341
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:24,250
Princess,

342
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:26,850
I feel uncomfortable

343
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:28,610
and even irritated.

344
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,090
What are you doing?

345
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:42,370
I apologize to you

346
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:44,010
on behalf of Xiaoyao.

347
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,291
Your Majesty,

348
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:49,051
I don't deserve it.

349
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,571
If I think about it,

350
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,010
I don't have

351
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,451
deep feelings for Princess.

352
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:54,811
Her withdrawal

353
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:56,610
damaged more

354
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,010
of my self-esteem

355
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,010
rather than my feelings.

356
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,490
What makes me embarrassed

357
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:05,010
is the others' comments and gossip.

358
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,096
Sorry for what you endured.

359
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,811
I swear I will make it up to you.

360
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:16,411
That's unnecessary.

361
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:18,451
You've given me so much.

362
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,171
People feel sorry for me, saying that

363
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:23,451
the Princess of Haoling changed her mind

364
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,931
because I wasn't outstanding enough.

365
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:27,411
I'm confident.

366
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,051
One day,

367
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,370
I will make people

368
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,171
feel sorry for the princess

369
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:34,531
for missing such an outstanding man.

370
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:38,811
Well said.

371
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:53,970
Xuan.

372
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:06,610
How do you have the patience for this?

373
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,010
This is for Jing.

374
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:17,291
You two have made up again?

375
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:21,850
No.

376
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,010
Then what is this?

377
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,970
I'm embroidering this sachet

378
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,771
for medicine pills.

379
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:30,210
The last time I went to Qingqiu,

380
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:32,171
I found him seriously ill.

381
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:34,571
If not treated in time,

382
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,850
he may die young.

383
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,931
I'm only his physician.

384
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,250
Only his physician?

385
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,051
Make one for me too.

386
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,210
Make a Poinciana flower.

387
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:50,010
Our favorite flower.

388
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:51,291
Okay.

389
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,811
I'll start once I'm done with this.

390
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:54,736
Wait...

391
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:56,250
Start with mine.

392
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,691
Fine.

393
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,891
But I don't have
much talent in painting.

394
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,330
Draw me some patterns.

395
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:06,411
I won't.

396
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,490
Did you ask Tushan Jing

397
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,330
to draw this pattern for you?

398
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:13,691
A gift for me

399
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:15,610
must be made from scratch

400
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:16,850
to show sincerity.

401
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:17,771
You are

402
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,171
really picky.

403
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,171
Fine.

404
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:23,610
I'll draw the pattern, okay?

405
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:45,691
You are so clumsy.

406
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,010
Can't you relax a little?

407
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,811
Relax your wrist.

408
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,210
Be gentle.

409
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:52,771
It's a Poinciana flower,

410
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:54,051
not a phoenix tree.

411
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:55,571
If you're so picky,

412
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,691
do it yourself.

413
00:22:59,451 --> 00:23:00,250
Look at you.

414
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,171
You're always like that.

415
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:03,210
You just won't

416
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,051
accept any criticism.

417
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,891
Yeah, you're so capable.

418
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:18,090
How come you're mad?

419
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,850
Weren't we having fun?

420
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,330
Alright.

421
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,691
You can draw on my face too.

422
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,970
I won't resist.

423
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:30,370
Just don't be mad.

424
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,771
Come on, I'm letting you.

425
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,051
Happy now?

426
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:00,970
No.

427
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,531
I want

428
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,520
more.

429
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,051
So petty.

430
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:08,730
What did you say?

431
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:10,691
Cang Xuan is so petty.

432
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,411
What did you say?

433
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:11,931
How dare you?

434
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:12,816
Cang Xuan is so petty.

435
00:24:13,531 --> 00:24:14,250
No.

436
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:18,811
Give it to me.

437
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:20,210
Great Emperor.

438
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:21,691
His Majesty

439
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,051
can only be happy and relaxed

440
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,651
when he's with Princess.

441
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:29,451
That's right.

442
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,490
No one can have

443
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:35,250
everything they desire.

444
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,010
Chief.

445
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,512
Here is newly brewed green plum wine.

446
00:24:55,451 --> 00:24:56,090
Let me try it.

447
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:06,064
Not bad.

448
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,130
Xiaoyao will like it.

449
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:09,970
You've been bustling about

450
00:25:10,171 --> 00:25:11,210
the entire morning

451
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,090
to welcome Princess.

452
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:13,411
All of these

453
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,171
are her favorites.

454
00:25:19,771 --> 00:25:20,850
Is it too dark in here?

455
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:22,531
Shall we go to the corridor?

456
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,490
Chief, Princess is here.

457
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,370
Chief Tushan.

458
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:37,970
Greetings, Princess.

459
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,330
Princess.

460
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:42,531
Have some snacks first.

461
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,291
Chief prepared these for you.

462
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,330
No need.

463
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,490
I'm here to treat Chief Tushan.

464
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:49,691
Let me take your pulse.

465
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:51,370
But...

466
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:08,210
You've gotten better.

467
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:10,730
Stick to the previous prescription.

468
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,171
But halve the dosage.

469
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,712
Okay.

470
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,250
I'm off then.

471
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:22,000
Okay.

472
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:33,411
I need a favor from Miss Jing Ye.

473
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,411
My two maids aren't good at

474
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,811
managing accounts.

475
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,451
So they are so disorganized.

476
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:42,090
Could you please organize my accounts

477
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:43,610
and also instruct

478
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,811
my maids for me?

479
00:26:45,051 --> 00:26:45,811
What do you say?

480
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:47,171
Jing Ye...

481
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:48,451
Managing accounts

482
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,730
is what our chief does the best.

483
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:51,811
There are

484
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,651
no accounts he can't sort out.

485
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,704
Right?

486
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:55,451
Chief.

487
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,291
Just do as the princess says.

488
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:06,411
Yes.

489
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,010
Princess.

490
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:19,891
Shan Hu.

491
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,411
Where are the accounts?

492
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,811
I have something to ask you.

493
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:36,811
Answer honestly.

494
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,771
Don't hide anything.

495
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:41,771
Yes.

496
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,090
Has Tushan Hou

497
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,891
ever shown affection towards you?

498
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:48,850
Has he given you gifts?

499
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,210
You suspect that I'm a traitor?

500
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:52,531
I'm not.

501
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,490
Just answer my questions.
Tell me the truth.

502
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,970
Have you ever
had feelings for Tushan Hou?

503
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:03,051
I've always suspected him

504
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,771
ever since Chief went missing.

505
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,730
Why would I have feelings for him?

506
00:28:06,891 --> 00:28:07,531
Besides...

507
00:28:08,451 --> 00:28:10,010
I'm already in love with someone.

508
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:12,051
I would never like Tushan Hou.

509
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,571
Who are you in love with?

510
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,051
Hu Zhen.

511
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,891
(Tushan Hou is actually)

512
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:21,771
(trying to prove himself
better than Jing)

513
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:23,891
(by conquering Jing's women.)

514
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,171
I see.

515
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:29,850
Don't tell Jing

516
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,610
about what we said.

517
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,291
If Jing knows that Tushan Hou

518
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,571
has been pestering you,

519
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:37,811
he will get irritated.

520
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:40,010
He is barely getting better.

521
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,051
He can't afford any mood swings.

522
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:43,250
Alright.

523
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,771
I will keep it a secret.

524
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:45,891
Also,

525
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,330
bring two items

526
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:48,850
back to Jing.

527
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,811
Princess asked me to bring these to you.

528
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,850
She emphasized

529
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:01,330
that this is a life-saving pill.

530
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,250
You must carry it everywhere

531
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,730
and take it in crisis.

532
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:14,800
(Jing,)

533
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,130
(starting today,)

534
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,811
(I won't see you again.)

535
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,330
(Rest and recover.)

536
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:22,330
(Promise me one thing.)

537
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:24,090
(No matter what happens,)

538
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,130
(trust me unconditionally.)

539
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,970
(No matter what you see)

540
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,970
(or hear,)

541
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,931
(close your eyes)

542
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:32,891
(and listen to your heart.)

543
00:29:42,811 --> 00:29:43,610
(I promise you.)

544
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,090
(I've failed)

545
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,130
(to do so once.)

546
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:49,370
(But this time,)

547
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,010
(I will keep my promise.)

548
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,090
(I won't let you down.)

549
00:29:58,051 --> 00:29:59,130
I've finished the sachet.

550
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,531
See if you like it.

551
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:01,891
There is

552
00:30:01,891 --> 00:30:03,291
a poison-avoiding bead I made for you.

553
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,691
Suddenly so attentive.

554
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:09,931
I bet you need a favor.

555
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,171
Tell me what you want.

556
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:16,010
I want to host a banquet.

557
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:18,090
Xiaoxiao.

558
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:22,490
The begonia flowers near Dajing Lake

559
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,210
are in full bloom.

560
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:25,490
We can ask Lady Shangyang
to hold a banquet

561
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,811
to enjoy the flowers.

562
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:28,090
Alright.

563
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,090
Let's do it.

564
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,130
Who will you invite?

565
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,210
Xiaoxiao will work on it.

566
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:32,624
Jing.

567
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:33,850
Fangfeng Yiying.

568
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,771
Tushan Hou.

569
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:35,571
Lirong Chang.

570
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,370
The others don't matter.

571
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,811
But these four must be there.

572
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,171
Do as she says.

573
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:42,571
Yes.

574
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,771
You wanted to invite Fangfeng Yiying.

575
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:47,691
What are you up to?

576
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,090
Doing bad deeds.

577
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:51,970
One can only

578
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:53,651
do bad deeds in secret.

579
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,210
Others must not know.

580
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:10,210
We have many guests today.

581
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,850
You might be disturbed.

582
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,411
I have set up another seating

583
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,651
in the pavilion ahead.

584
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,090
Apart from the guests

585
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,571
Miss Xiaoxiao asked for,

586
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:19,811
I only seated
a few close acquaintances there.

587
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,250
This is for the best.

588
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:25,136
(Lady Shangyang)

589
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,051
Her Highness is truly clever.

590
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,051
Greetings, Your Majesty.

591
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,610
Lady Shangyang
is hosting a banquet at Dajing Lake.

592
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:46,850
Xiaoyao is also there.

593
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:48,850
Come with me.

594
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:50,610
Lady Shangyang

595
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,691
didn't invite us.

596
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,970
Isn't it improper to go uninvited?

597
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,010
Keep burying your head in the sand.

598
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,370
I'll go alone.

599
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:10,171
Wait, Your Majesty.

600
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:11,490
I will go with you.

601
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,451
His Majesty bestowed me
this begonia flower tea.

602
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:16,850
Try it.

603
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,912
Thank you, Your Highness.

604
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,130
His Majesty truly dotes on you.

605
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:49,104
Let's go.

606
00:32:49,811 --> 00:32:50,370
Go.

607
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:53,771
Princess.

608
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,411
Will you reconsider my buddy?

609
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,531
Chang.

610
00:32:59,291 --> 00:32:59,891
You see.

611
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,531
You abandoned Fenglong.

612
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:03,330
And Fengfeng Bei ruined your reputation.

613
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:04,931
It's hard to find

614
00:33:04,931 --> 00:33:06,490
a reliable man now.

615
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:07,490
My buddy

616
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,330
has deep feelings for you.

617
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,811
Just go with him.

618
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:11,891
Lirong Chang.

619
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:13,411
Don't talk nonsense.

620
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,970
Deep feelings?

621
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:16,771
How come I didn't notice?

622
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,531
What else do you want him to do

623
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:19,370
to prove it?

624
00:33:22,571 --> 00:33:24,130
I want a begonia flower.

625
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,210
That's easy.

626
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:32,891
But you can't use spirit power

627
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,250
or magic.

628
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,970
I want it hand-picked.

629
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,330
I want it right now.

630
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,728
Princess.

631
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,730
Jumping in the lake in public

632
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,210
is a bit embarrassing.

633
00:33:51,451 --> 00:33:53,210
Dignity matters to men.

634
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,251
Here you are.

635
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:00,770
Thank you, Chief Tushan.

636
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,770
Everyone thought the Princess
was deeply in love with Fengfeng Bei.

637
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,130
Who could have known

638
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:39,011
that only a few months

639
00:35:39,491 --> 00:35:41,931
after he passed away,
she was already feasting

640
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:44,411
and seducing others
to fall for her charm?

641
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:45,520
Fenglong.

642
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,731
You should feel lucky

643
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,171
that heaven blessed the Chishui Family

644
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,491
and didn't let you

645
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,251
marry such a woman.

646
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,211
Mind your words, Your Majesty.

647
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,290
Chief Tushan,

648
00:35:58,451 --> 00:35:59,651
if you really like her,

649
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,491
take her home

650
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:03,290
and make her a concubine.

651
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,770
No decent man would want her anyway.

652
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:06,610
However,

653
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:07,891
watch her closely.

654
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,011
Otherwise, who knows

655
00:36:10,011 --> 00:36:11,810
with whom will she run off again?

656
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:12,688
You...

657
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:17,971
Lady of Tushan,

658
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,130
you're so magnanimous.

659
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,731
They're displaying affection
in front of you.

660
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,330
Yet, you don't say a word.

661
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,850
Do you really intend

662
00:36:25,931 --> 00:36:27,770
to share a husband with the woman

663
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:28,931
who killed your elder brother?

664
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,451
You're the lady of the clan.

665
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,090
Show some spirit.

666
00:36:32,411 --> 00:36:32,976
Your Majesty.

667
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,971
My queen is going to show some spirit.

668
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:37,691
What for?

669
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:41,488
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

670
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:42,290
Your Majesty.

671
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:47,600
Did you like the begonia flowers?

672
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:49,040
Yeah.

673
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:50,251
Thank you

674
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,651
for arranging this banquet.

675
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:52,850
As long as you like it.

676
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:54,864
Xiaoyao, come here.

677
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:07,731
Pretty.

678
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,411
Thank you, Your Majesty.

679
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:12,850
Xuan.

680
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:14,211
I have a slight headache.

681
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,370
I will take my leave.

682
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,530
It happens
that I want to visit Grandfather.

683
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:18,810
I'll go with you.

684
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:30,704
Okay.

685
00:37:31,491 --> 00:37:33,011
Keep enjoying the flowers.

686
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:42,192
- We see you off, Your Majesty.
- We see you off, Your Majesty.

687
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:47,971
Chang.

688
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:50,610
Your Highness.

689
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,651
Your Majesty truly dotes on you.

690
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:54,931
He only had eyes for you

691
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:56,251
and no one else.

692
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,370
I told you

693
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,211
not to come.

694
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,370
You wouldn't listen.

695
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,411
Now that we're here,

696
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,610
we can't leave.

697
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:08,610
If you run away,

698
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,050
the others will make fun of you.

699
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,090
If you act as if nothing happened,

700
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,971
others will think

701
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:17,971
that no matter how much
His Majesty dotes on another woman,

702
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,770
you're the queen

703
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:21,651
who doesn't need to vie for favoritism.

704
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,651
His Majesty has work to do.

705
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:31,570
Let's not miss out on the fun.

706
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,330
Linglan.

707
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:35,050
Bring the fine wine that I have brought

708
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,451
to share.

709
00:38:37,251 --> 00:38:37,808
Yes.

710
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,592
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

711
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,530
Don't think

712
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,090
that His Majesty treated me that way
because of you.

713
00:38:50,491 --> 00:38:51,971
No matter what,

714
00:38:52,491 --> 00:38:54,050
it happened because

715
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,451
what I did won his heart.

716
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:56,810
As a consort,

717
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,411
I have to share His Majesty's burden.

718
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,770
Making His Majesty

719
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,050
displeased for personal gain

720
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,971
defies the rules.

721
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:10,530
Xuan.

722
00:39:12,171 --> 00:39:12,971
Xuan.

723
00:39:13,491 --> 00:39:14,610
Wait for me.

724
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,651
When did you become so dumb?

725
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,330
Don't you know

726
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,491
how to talk back at Xinyue?

727
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,090
If you want to be nice and sweet,

728
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,491
do it to me and Grandfather.

729
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:25,411
Will you?

730
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,211
Why haven't you been nice to me?

731
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:30,491
Whenever I scold you,

732
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:31,891
you talk back at me right away.

733
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:33,011
But in front of her,

734
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:35,290
you're so compliant and quiet.

735
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:36,211
Let me tell you.

736
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:38,090
Next time, I'll deal with

737
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,050
you disappointing one, first.

738
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:43,810
Say something.

739
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:45,610
Didn't you say

740
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,251
that I have a sharp tongue?

741
00:39:47,731 --> 00:39:49,451
Here I am, being compliant

742
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,570
and listening to you.

743
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:54,411
If you can talk back at me,

744
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:56,290
can't you talk back at her?

745
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,810
I've wronged Fenglong.

746
00:40:02,211 --> 00:40:04,290
Let Xinyue scold me if she wants

747
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:05,810
to make up to Fenglong.

748
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,530
Your father and I have

749
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,810
made amends.

750
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,472
You don't have to worry.

751
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:12,891
Alright.

752
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,451
Just this once.

753
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:18,011
If Xinyue bothers me again,

754
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,370
I will fight back.

755
00:40:21,891 --> 00:40:22,691
Jing gave it to me.

756
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:23,451
I know.

757
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:25,850
Stupid flower.

758
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:26,610
My flower.

759
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:32,090
Begonia flowers are too tacky for you.

760
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:32,976
Wear this.

761
00:40:45,931 --> 00:40:49,050
That demoness was obviously teasing you.

762
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:51,330
And you seemed to enjoy it.

763
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,251
You're totally asking for it.

764
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:55,171
She just said

765
00:40:55,171 --> 00:40:56,731
that she liked the flower,

766
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,171
and you swam to get it

767
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,411
without dignity.

768
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,011
Now you're even

769
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,691
transplanting it at home.

770
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:10,570
Stop.

771
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,530
What are you doing?

772
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,931
Using your spirit power?

773
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,731
Are you suicidal?

774
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,251
Just a little bit.

775
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:19,251
It's harmless.

776
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:20,931
Stop.

777
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:23,610
Let me do it.

778
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:42,090
I've never seen anyone like you.

779
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:43,570
You keep

780
00:41:44,011 --> 00:41:45,850
risking your life for her.

781
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:48,050
Why bother keeping the flower?

782
00:41:48,731 --> 00:41:50,090
Do you really expect her

783
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,211
to enjoy it with you?

784
00:42:08,411 --> 00:42:09,731
Why are you suddenly interested

785
00:42:09,731 --> 00:42:10,850
in these things?

786
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:19,891
Welcome again.

787
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,251
We have some new jewelry.

788
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,050
See if there's anything you like.

789
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:41,931
They dare not take out

790
00:42:43,411 --> 00:42:45,011
the real good stuff.

791
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:52,330
