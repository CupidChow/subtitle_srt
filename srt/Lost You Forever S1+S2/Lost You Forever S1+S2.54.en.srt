3
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:35,027
Xiling Heng

4
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:37,067
was not

5
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:38,626
a high-status,

6
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:42,387
prudent Princess General.

7
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:45,626
She was simply Chi Chen's wife.

8
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,506
As a physician, she saved people

9
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:50,506
and was revered by the Baili Tribe

10
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:53,186
as the Xiling Witch.

11
00:01:56,707 --> 00:01:58,626
In this painting, they look very close.

12
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,707
Yet outsiders think they were enemies.

13
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:03,586
They fought to the death

14
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:06,266
and died together.

15
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:23,427
Chi Chen

16
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:26,947
made this cradle for his daughter
with the finest wood

17
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,266
on the mountain.

18
00:02:33,347 --> 00:02:34,826
He could make this?

19
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:37,106
Originally he couldn't.

20
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:38,867
But for his daughter,

21
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:40,186
he had to

22
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:42,666
learn to make it.

23
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:51,856
These are

24
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:53,906
the toys he made

25
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:55,707
for his daughter.

26
00:02:57,707 --> 00:02:58,266
Looks ugly.

27
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:01,106
After all,

28
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:03,626
he was a first-time father.

29
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:05,546
What he made

30
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,466
is already pretty good.

31
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:14,546
Did Xiling Heng

32
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:17,266
make these clothes for her daughter?

33
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:41,746
Inside it

34
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,307
are the toys

35
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:45,587
Chi Chen made for his daughter.

36
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:00,826
Heng.

37
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:01,744
Look.

38
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,288
Heng.

39
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:09,707
Heng.

40
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:29,867
These toys are all brand new.

41
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:32,707
Their daughter never played with them.

42
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:35,786
They cared about their girl.

43
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:38,187
But when faced with a choice,

44
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,226
they still heartlessly

45
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:41,506
abandoned their daughter.

46
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,506
They did not let down the world

47
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,907
or the people.

48
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:50,386
Yet they let down their daughter.

49
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:54,147
They do not deserve to be parents.

50
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:57,747
How dare you speak ill

51
00:04:58,427 --> 00:04:59,946
of my parents

52
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:01,187
and talk nonsense.

53
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:15,066
Who are you?

54
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:19,747
Back off.

55
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:20,707
Stay back.

56
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,066
Stay back.

57
00:05:27,946 --> 00:05:30,386
The Solar Flame incinerates everything.

58
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:32,747
It can even make the deity

59
00:05:33,027 --> 00:05:35,106
with high spirit power turn to ash.

60
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:41,786
Stay back.

61
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:43,346
Who exactly are you?

62
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,826
Why are you stopping me?

63
00:05:46,786 --> 00:05:48,147
You can't stop me.

64
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,027
I must go near you.

65
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,346
I won't give up.

66
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:53,106
Xiaoyao.

67
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:57,266
Do what I say.

68
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,328
Mother.

69
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:21,840
Mother.

70
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,307
Yes.

71
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:37,066
Stay back.

72
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:42,346
Stay back, Xiaoyao.

73
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:44,208
Mother.

74
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:46,707
I won't go near you.

75
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:48,427
I won't.

76
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:52,106
I just want to see you.

77
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:54,707
Can you

78
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:56,666
let me

79
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,666
see you?

80
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:25,147
Mother.

81
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:27,427
Mother.

82
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:33,427
Are you in pain?

83
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:38,707
It doesn't hurt.

84
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:41,587
I'm used to it.

85
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:45,147
I look a bit strange.

86
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:48,147
It really doesn't hurt.

87
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:54,066
You're lying to me again.

88
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:55,987
Mother.

89
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,627
I have grown up.

90
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,546
Why are you still lying to me?

91
00:08:03,907 --> 00:08:05,546
I've grown up.

92
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:07,587
You're lying to me again.

93
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:10,346
How can it not hurt?

94
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:13,386
How can it not hurt?

95
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:16,066
Xiaoyao.

96
00:08:17,546 --> 00:08:18,666
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:27,266
Mother.

98
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:28,368
Mother.

99
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,106
I've read all the medical books

100
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:32,208
you left

101
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:33,867
for me.

102
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:35,987
My medical skills

103
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:39,507
are particularly exceptional.

104
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,187
I can

105
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:43,706
certainly cure you.

106
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:45,146
And Cang Xuan.

107
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:46,387
Cang Xuan

108
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:47,586
is already the King of Xiyan.

109
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:48,906
He's incredibly powerful.

110
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:51,307
Regardless of any rare medicine,

111
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:53,026
he can find it for you.

112
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,747
We'll find the Ice Crystal.

113
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:56,507
It can suppress the Solar Flame.

114
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:57,040
Mother.

115
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:57,666
Mother.

116
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,546
Xiaoyao.

117
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:00,586
Xiaoyao.

118
00:09:01,987 --> 00:09:04,987
I just want to talk
with you for a while.

119
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:17,867
All your father and I wanted

120
00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:19,987
was to let go of everything

121
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:23,786
and bring you

122
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:25,947
back here.

123
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:28,106
So we could watch you grow up

124
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:31,947
and see you marry and have children.

125
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:33,947
But fate

126
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:36,187
did not give us that chance.

127
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:38,947
He couldn't abandon Chenrong.

128
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:42,666
And I couldn't abandon Xiyan.

129
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:44,627
Xiaoyao.

130
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:46,827
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:48,987
I lied to you.

132
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:52,267
When leaving you in Xiyan,

133
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,106
I had already prepared to die.

134
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:05,666
Xiaoyao.

135
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:08,307
Over the years,

136
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:12,827
you must have had a hard time.

137
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:20,146
No.

138
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:22,906
I've been living well.

139
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:25,666
I...

140
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:27,187
I...

141
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:31,507
It was a bit tough.

142
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:35,627
But,

143
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:37,947
look at me now.

144
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,827
I have grown up well.

145
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:44,546
Look at me.

146
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:47,507
I'm quite well now.

147
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,307
Don't worry.

148
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:53,827
What about Cang Xuan?

149
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:56,546
Cang Xuan has also grown up well.

150
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:57,906
Cang Xuan.

151
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,146
Cang Xuan is right outside.

152
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:01,187
Mother.

153
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:03,226
I will get him here.

154
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:04,146
Xiaoyao.

155
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:04,784
Mother.

156
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:07,226
I've waited here for you for 400 years.

157
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:11,586
I just want to say sorry

158
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,026
to you face to face.

159
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:17,146
In my life,

160
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:20,827
I haven't failed the nation
and its people.

161
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:25,867
But I have failed you and your father.

162
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:28,146
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:36,747
Mother.

164
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:38,987
Where is my father?

165
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:40,706
Your father

166
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:43,387
has been waiting for you with me.

167
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:45,627
Where is he?

168
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,106
Where is my father?

169
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,387
To defeat the Chenrong army,

170
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,267
I used the Solar Flame.

171
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:56,627
It burnt all things to ashes.

172
00:11:57,987 --> 00:11:59,666
I was burned

173
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:02,026
into a senseless monster.

174
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:05,267
Your father sacrificed himself

175
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:06,666
and turned to ashes

176
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:09,507
to preserve a trace of my consciousness

177
00:12:10,026 --> 00:12:11,226
and seal it here,

178
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:14,106
so we could meet again.

187

I have let go of my obsession.

188
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:54,187
I'm leaving.

189
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:01,232
Don't.

Mother.

191
00:13:02,627 --> 00:13:03,786
Mother, don't leave.

196
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:17,226
Mother.

197
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,867
Mother, don't go.

198
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:23,747
Mother.

199
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,226
Don't leave.

200
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:27,146
Don't leave.

201
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:29,267
Mother.

202
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:30,466
Don't.

203
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:32,827
Stay.

204
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:33,666
Stay.

205
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,987
Don't leave.

206
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:38,586
Don't leave.

207
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:39,987
Don't.

208
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:45,146
Mother.

209
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:47,146
Mother.

210
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:49,187
Mother.

211
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,226
Mother, don't go.

212
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:52,827
Mother.

213
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:55,507
Mother.

214
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,427
Mother, please.

The Rejuvenating Flower is a rare weapon
made by heaven and earth.

244
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,146
Now that your spirit power is weak,

245
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,786
you can't harness its power to attack.

246
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:58,067
But you can control the power
of changing faces.

247
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:00,507
You can use it to protect yourself.

248
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:01,827
I can

249
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:04,546
change my appearance again?

250
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:14,307
With the help of your parents,

251
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:18,827
you can use the Rejuvenating Flower
as you want.

252
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,507
It's your face.

253
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,187
It's your face.

254
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,027
It's you.

255
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:29,907
I can control the Rejuvenating Flower.

256
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:32,346
Xuan, I can control it now.

257
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,066
Who are you?

258
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:04,946
How dare you intrude
into the Chi Chen Village.

259
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:06,987
We don't welcome strangers.

260
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:07,826
If you don't leave now,

261
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:09,066
we'll choose violence.

262
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:16,752
Seize him.

263
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,256
Leave us.

264
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:31,106
This bone token

265
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:35,387
belongs to the King of Beasts, Chi Chen.

266
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:36,496
Where

267
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:40,466
did you get it?

268
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:44,186
My foster father knows Chi Chen.

269
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:46,706
They were not close friends,

270
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,066
but they used to fight side by side.

271
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:51,987
So, an old friend of the King of Beasts.

272
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:55,706
Whoever has his bone token

273
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:58,507
can command Baili

274
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:00,027
to do one thing for them.

275
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:01,787
What can we do

276
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,667
for you then?

277
00:19:09,826 --> 00:19:10,706
I want to know

278
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:13,547
how to remove the poisonous bug of love.

279
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:43,306
(This is really Chi Chen's home.)

280
00:19:43,507 --> 00:19:44,667
It's a surprise, huh?

281
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,907
The devil Chi Chen's home

282
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:48,867
looks so ordinary.

283
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:51,147
There's no bed made of human bones

284
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:53,106
or walls painted with human blood.

285
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:01,027
I just didn't expect

286
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:04,867
that Chi Chen
and the Xiling Witch would have a home.

287
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:16,027
The King of Beasts

288
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:19,426
built this home for the Xiling Witch.

289
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:22,306
Then they left and never returned.

290
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:25,787
They lived here only for a short time.

291
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:47,826
Who exactly are you?

292
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:50,426
Why are you paying respect
to the King of Beasts

293
00:20:51,027 --> 00:20:52,267
and the Xiling Witch?

294
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,306
Instead of fighting each other,

295
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:22,106
it's better to forget each other.

296
00:21:52,387 --> 00:21:54,946
I remember
you were wearing this bone ring

297
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:57,066
when I visited you at a young age.

298
00:21:58,387 --> 00:21:59,787
Was it made
of my Auntie's severed finger?

299
00:22:03,987 --> 00:22:05,826
Why did you make it into a ring?

300
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,627
I use the past mistakes

301
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:12,627
to discipline myself.

302
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:17,106
Master.

303
00:22:19,627 --> 00:22:20,747
Don't push yourself too hard.

304
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:25,346
You and Xiaoyao should hate me.

305
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:27,226
I have thought

306
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:32,147
about what would happen
to Xiaoyao and me

307
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,507
if my mother and Auntie were alive.

308
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:37,907
But there are no ifs.

309
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,267
I've made it this far,

310
00:22:43,306 --> 00:22:45,346
but I also understand there are things

311
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:47,066
that I have to do.

312
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:49,680
Master.

313
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:52,747
I don't hate you.

314
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:55,787
Xiaoyao won't hate you either.

315
00:23:07,747 --> 00:23:08,426
Your Majesty.

316
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:09,186
Your medicine.

317
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:24,304
Master.

318
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:39,027
You just have a mental problem.

319
00:23:40,507 --> 00:23:41,706
Take good care of yourself,

320
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:43,387
and you will recover soon.

321
00:23:44,226 --> 00:23:45,787
Will you call me Your Majesty forever?

322
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:57,466
Father.

323
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:06,547
Master.

324
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:10,106
Why did you pretend to be ill?

325
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,426
If you hadn't done that,

326
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:14,586
the officials wouldn't have

327
00:24:14,747 --> 00:24:16,426
been so concerned about the succession.

328
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:18,426
And Baihu and Changxi

329
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:19,826
wouldn't have fought

330
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:21,147
and betrayed Haoling.

331
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:23,066
As the ruler of a nation,

332
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:25,867
a wise monarch praised by the people,

333
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:27,826
how could I possibly

334
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:29,466
not think of the wellbeing of the people

335
00:24:30,306 --> 00:24:32,667
and the nation and have no successor?

336
00:24:36,027 --> 00:24:37,747
I have long cultivated an heir.

337
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:42,946
Who is it?

338
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:45,706
I've cultivated an heir

339
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:47,346
and good ministers for Haoling.

340
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,346
I taught three children.

341
00:24:52,027 --> 00:24:53,907
Qin Mang can be a right-hand man.

342
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,547
Ru Shou is trustworthy.

343
00:24:58,306 --> 00:24:59,186
Cang Xuan

344
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:03,066
is capable of ruling the world.

345
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:12,147
I don't understand.

346
00:25:15,106 --> 00:25:15,787
Son.

347
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:18,186
You are the Crown Prince

348
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:20,186
I have cultivated for Haoling.

349
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:23,826
But I...

350
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:26,667
I am not from Haoling.

351
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:27,987
I am from Xiyan.

352
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:29,667
Who decides

353
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:30,627
that Xiyan's king

354
00:25:30,627 --> 00:25:31,987
can't be the king of Haoling?

355
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:34,867
Aren't you promoting to the common folk

356
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,066
that Dahuang should be united?

357
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:38,667
Why did you say that today?

358
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:48,426
Your officials will oppose it.

359
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:50,066
You attack Haoling

360
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:51,787
to incorporate Haoling
into Xiyan's territory.

361
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:54,066
Do you think they will agree to that?

362
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:55,106
It's not the same thing.

363
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:04,586
Why not?

364
00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:08,627
When Father didn't give it to you,
you took it by force.

365
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:09,826
Now Father is giving it to you,

366
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,547
but you are hesitating.

367
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:12,826
Why?

368
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:14,346
Do you have to snatch what you want?

369
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:15,826
Or do you want more war?

370
00:26:17,466 --> 00:26:19,466
No, I didn't mean that.

371
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:27,267
I think it's a mean thing to do.

372
00:26:29,306 --> 00:26:30,466
I feel guilty about it.

373
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:39,186
Father.

374
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:41,826
You've long decided
to pass the throne to him.

375
00:26:42,027 --> 00:26:43,426
Why didn't you tell him?

376
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:46,186
I understand

377
00:26:46,826 --> 00:26:48,667
that Haoling and Xiyan

378
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:49,867
can share mountains,

379
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,946
water, land, and people of this world.

380
00:26:52,907 --> 00:26:54,387
The people of Haoling will accept it.

381
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,106
No matter who becomes the king,

382
00:26:56,306 --> 00:26:57,867
so long as they can bring peace,

383
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,027
they will be a good ruler.

384
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:02,186
But what Cang Xuan just said is true.

385
00:27:03,106 --> 00:27:04,426
The officials will not agree.

386
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:05,826
I can't change their minds

387
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:06,787
by myself.

388
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:07,946
So,

389
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:09,547
Cang Xuan has to threaten their lives

390
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:11,186
by force.

391
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,106
Of course,

392
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:14,426
they will give in

393
00:27:14,627 --> 00:27:15,627
if they get tangible benefits.

394
00:27:16,946 --> 00:27:18,507
Baihu and Changxi

395
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:21,226
have already accepted Cang Xuan

396
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,346
as their king to get benefits, right?

397
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:29,186
Why are you hesitating?

398
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:30,706
Say yes, quickly.

399
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,186
Say yes.

400
00:27:59,186 --> 00:27:59,946
I will not

401
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:03,226
let down your trust.

402
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:28,176
Xiaoyao,

403
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:29,787
quickly help him up.

404
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:33,547
Get up.

405
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:54,346
The succession is settled.

406
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:56,747
Let's talk about something private.

407
00:28:57,907 --> 00:28:58,747
What is it?

408
00:29:03,627 --> 00:29:04,706
Push hard.

409
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:06,747
I can't push it.

410
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:11,867
Stop.

411
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:39,747
Haitang.

412
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:42,706
Push harder.

413
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:43,706
Okay.

414
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:11,946
Nian really worries me.

415
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:13,987
Cang Xuan.

416
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:16,826
Who should I let her marry?

417
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,106
I thought you wanted Ru Shou
to marry Nian.

418
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:21,706
Ru Shou?

419
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:24,946
He would rather go to war

420
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:26,267
than marry Nian.

421
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:28,226
Even if he's willing to marry her,

422
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:29,667
Nian will not marry him.

423
00:30:43,186 --> 00:30:44,106
She'll find the right man.

424
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:46,826
I've been searching since you left.

425
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:49,987
But I've searched all over Haoling,
and I still can't find the one

426
00:30:49,987 --> 00:30:50,907
Nian likes.

427
00:30:52,547 --> 00:30:53,426
She's harder

428
00:30:54,147 --> 00:30:54,706
to deal with

429
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:56,466
than Baihu and Changxi.

430
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,267
I've tried to reason with her

431
00:30:59,547 --> 00:31:00,706
and even pressured her.

432
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,306
I wanted to use your attack on Haoling

433
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:04,747
to make her forget you.

434
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:06,547
But I didn't expect

435
00:31:06,987 --> 00:31:08,066
that she still couldn't

436
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,226
get over you.

437
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:11,426
Tell me.

438
00:31:12,387 --> 00:31:13,586
What should I do with her?

439
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:26,907
Xiaoyao.

440
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:27,946
Tell me.

441
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,027
What should I do?

442
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:31,226
What does Nian want?

443
00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:33,466
She wants to marry Cang Xuan.

444
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:34,867
Do you not object?

445
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,226
Can I?

446
00:31:37,787 --> 00:31:39,346
I have opposed it for decades.

447
00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:40,627
It is tiring.

448
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:44,826
Now I've come round.

449
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,106
Time flies fast

450
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:52,066
in one's long life.

451
00:31:52,586 --> 00:31:54,147
Why not fulfill her wish?

452
00:31:56,507 --> 00:31:57,027
Xiaoyao.

453
00:31:57,747 --> 00:31:59,027
Do you think I'm right?

454
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:01,987
I think you're very right.

455
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:03,507
So is Cang Xuan willing

456
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:04,787
to marry my daughter?

457
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:06,306
I'll ask him for you.

458
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:19,027
Are you willing

459
00:32:19,027 --> 00:32:20,186
to marry my father's daughter?

460
00:32:24,147 --> 00:32:24,987
I'm asking you.

461
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:34,027
Are you willing
to marry my father's daughter?

462
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,267
Haoling's court is now a mess.

463
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:44,147
It's easy

464
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:45,066
for you

465
00:32:45,306 --> 00:32:46,747
to handle Baihu and Changxi.

466
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:48,426
If they don't submit,

467
00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:49,306
just fight them.

468
00:32:50,627 --> 00:32:52,106
However, Qinglong and Xihe

469
00:32:52,466 --> 00:32:54,426
are loyal to Father.

470
00:32:54,426 --> 00:32:55,186
They're the toughest.

471
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:58,066
Making them accept you
as the king of Haoling

472
00:32:58,066 --> 00:32:59,267
can be difficult.

473
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:01,426
If you marry Nian,

474
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:03,667
it will quell many disputes.

475
00:33:27,147 --> 00:33:28,507
As long as you don't object,

476
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,706
I will marry Nian.

477
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:35,387
Nian is a princess.

478
00:33:35,907 --> 00:33:37,186
And I already have a queen.

479
00:33:38,627 --> 00:33:39,946
A country can have only one ruler.

480
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,346
But it can have two queens.

481
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:43,907
Chenrong Xinyue can be your queen.

482
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:46,066
So can Nian.

483
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:47,147
I agree.

484
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:49,667
My sister must also be a queen.

485
00:33:56,507 --> 00:33:57,106
What?

486
00:33:58,267 --> 00:33:59,066
Am I wrong?

487
00:34:02,586 --> 00:34:03,466
You're right.

488
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,226
I will marry Nian as a queen

489
00:34:10,386 --> 00:34:13,386
and make her status equal
to that of Xinyue.

490
00:34:18,987 --> 00:34:19,547
Xiaoyao.

491
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,226
I'm a bit hungry.

492
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,107
Fetch something for me to eat.

493
00:34:24,347 --> 00:34:24,866
Okay.

494
00:34:28,547 --> 00:34:29,547
I will go with Xiaoyao.

495
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:02,787
You don't want to marry Nian?

496
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:08,067
I don't want to lie.

497
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,587
Nian is not the woman I love.

498
00:35:12,906 --> 00:35:14,027
Just like Consort Jing'an

499
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:17,067
is not the woman you love.

500
00:35:19,226 --> 00:35:21,307
But I will keep Nian safe

501
00:35:23,027 --> 00:35:26,226
like you did to Consort Jing'an.

502
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,146
Remember what you said today.

503
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:31,787
Yes.

504
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:39,906
Master.

505
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:43,347
How does it feel

506
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:45,386
to marry the woman you love?

507
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:52,987
I don't know.

508
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,626
You married my Auntie.

509
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:58,827
I did not love her when I married her.

510
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:00,987
But when I fell in love with her,

511
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:04,226
she already saw herself
as Chi Chen's wife.

512
00:36:12,827 --> 00:36:14,426
Turns out you don't know either.

513
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:18,666
No.

514
00:36:20,186 --> 00:36:21,267
I don't know either.

515
00:36:29,747 --> 00:36:31,666
Sometimes I feel ridiculous about it.

516
00:36:32,987 --> 00:36:35,027
It's like I've brought the entire garden

517
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:36,386
home.

518
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:38,547
Yet, there isn't the flower

519
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:39,747
I like.

520
00:36:41,146 --> 00:36:42,666
Sadly, there isn't.

521
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:46,507
But what I want is not the garden

522
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:49,747
but the one flower I like.

523
00:36:53,307 --> 00:36:54,866
Sitting in this chair,

524
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:57,666
you seem to have everything.

525
00:36:58,747 --> 00:36:59,626
But in reality,

526
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:03,787
you can't even decide your marriage.

527
00:37:05,107 --> 00:37:06,787
If I had compromised

528
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:08,067
like you back then,

529
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:11,587
Haoling's four tribes

530
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:14,827
would not have come to this,

531
00:37:15,987 --> 00:37:17,027
putting themselves

532
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:19,946
in life-or-death struggle.

533
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:25,226
You're better for this throne than I am.

534
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:46,547
Soldiers.

535
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,587
Fight to the death.

536
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:04,107
No victory, no return.

537
00:38:21,587 --> 00:38:22,267
Report.

538
00:38:22,827 --> 00:38:23,946
Your Majesty, news of victory.

539
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:24,987
The princess led the forces

540
00:38:25,027 --> 00:38:26,347
and defeated Baihu and Changxi Tribes.

541
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:29,267
That's great.

542
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:31,146
I'm not dreaming, am I?

543
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:34,386
The princess actually won.

544
00:38:38,827 --> 00:38:39,747
Why are you pinching me?

545
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:41,827
You're not dreaming.

546
00:38:42,507 --> 00:38:43,626
The princess really

547
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:45,267
defeated Baihu and Changxi.

548
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:47,827
That's great.

549
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:48,747
Yes, indeed.

550
00:38:49,347 --> 00:38:51,946
Your Majesty, Chishui Fenglong
of Xiyan is here.

551
00:38:56,866 --> 00:38:57,507
Summon him.

552
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:03,666
Greetings, Your Majesty.

553
00:39:04,146 --> 00:39:04,706
Please.

554
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:08,426
What brings you here?

555
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:10,906
On behalf of the King of Xiyan,
I am here to propose a marriage

556
00:39:11,386 --> 00:39:12,626
with the Princess of Haoling

557
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:14,067
and bring peace to both countries.

558
00:39:15,027 --> 00:39:15,987
It is well known

559
00:39:16,507 --> 00:39:18,347
that the King of Xiyan has a queen.

560
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,426
Now, the King of Xiyan intends

561
00:39:20,426 --> 00:39:21,507
to marry our princess.

562
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,507
Is the King of Xiyan going

563
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:26,027
to make our princess a concubine?

564
00:39:28,547 --> 00:39:29,946
What does he want?

565
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:31,747
I'm sorry I didn't make things clear.

566
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:34,466
The Princess of Haoling is
of noble status.

567
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:35,987
How could she be a concubine?

568
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:38,186
If Your Majesty consents
to the marriage,

569
00:39:38,706 --> 00:39:40,987
the King of Xiyan will marry her
as the queen.

570
00:39:43,787 --> 00:39:45,626
A country cannot have two kings.

571
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,946
But it can have two queens.

572
00:39:55,906 --> 00:39:56,626
What?

573
00:39:58,386 --> 00:40:01,866
His Majesty will
marry the Princess of Haoling?

574
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:04,827
And my brother

575
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:06,987
proposed this marriage for His Majesty?

576
00:40:07,747 --> 00:40:08,336
Yes.

577
00:40:08,827 --> 00:40:09,787
Your Highness.

578
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:12,307
The King of Haoling
has consented to the marriage.

579
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:15,347
Two queens?

580
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:20,466
How could you do this to me?

581
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:22,386
The Princess of Haoling

582
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:24,866
disciplined Baihu and Changxi Tribes

583
00:40:25,587 --> 00:40:28,027
and preserved the dignity of Haoling.

584
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:29,547
His Majesty intended

585
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,107
to fight back to appease

586
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,107
the two tribes.

587
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,946
But if His Majesty
marries the Princess of Haoling,

588
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:40,787
the war will end.

589
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:43,466
Baihu and Changxi

590
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:44,987
will have nothing to say.

591
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:46,906
His Majesty has avoided a war

592
00:40:46,906 --> 00:40:48,426
through a marriage alliance.

593
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:52,027
It's beneficial for the people.

594
00:40:53,107 --> 00:40:54,866
As the queen of a nation,

595
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:56,906
please consider the national interests.

596
00:40:56,906 --> 00:40:57,626
Enough.

597
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:00,547
Stop lecturing me.

598
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:03,347
I don't care about the common folk
or family interests.

599
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:04,827
In your eyes,

600
00:41:05,307 --> 00:41:07,226
they're more important than me.

601
00:41:08,027 --> 00:41:10,626
Back then, you abandoned me for them.

602
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:12,987
And now, you actually want

603
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:14,507
to sacrifice me once again.

604
00:41:17,946 --> 00:41:19,146
I don't want

605
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:20,547
to hear any excuses from you.

606
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:22,027
Leave.

607
00:41:22,027 --> 00:41:22,787
Xinyue.

608
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:24,107
Leave!

609
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:28,666
I don't want to see you again.

610
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:32,706
After all, I am always less important

611
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:37,386
than the kingdom and the people.

612
00:41:40,987 --> 00:41:42,226
Leave!

613
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:44,787
I'll take my leave.

614
00:41:56,827 --> 00:41:58,666
Why are you drinking alone here?

615
00:42:02,747 --> 00:42:03,666
Are you drunk?

616
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:08,946
Tomorrow, I'm going

617
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:11,626
to marry the Princess of Haoling.

618
00:42:12,587 --> 00:42:14,866
At the border, there will be

619
00:42:15,787 --> 00:42:17,507
over a million troops
from both kingdoms.

620
00:42:17,587 --> 00:42:18,747
It's huge.

621
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,547
How can I get drunk?

622
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:30,866
I thought

623
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:32,507
it would be different this time.

624
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,906
I thought you would be happy
to marry Nian.

625
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:39,706
After all, you watch her grow up.

626
00:42:41,146 --> 00:42:42,186
In your heart,

627
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,186
she should be different
from the other women

628
00:42:45,186 --> 00:42:45,827
in Zijin Peak.

629
00:42:46,226 --> 00:42:47,866
Nian is different from them.

630
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:49,107
But it doesn't mean

631
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:51,267
I want to marry her.
