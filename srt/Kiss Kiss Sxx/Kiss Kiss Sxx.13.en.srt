1
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,430
Yes, Mom.

2
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,723
Hyunsoo.

3
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,475
How’s the academy?

4
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,352
It’s fine.

5
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,230
Don’t skip your meals.

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,649
Eat properly, okay?

7
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,279
You’ve quit smoking, right?

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,197
Yeah.

9
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,452
I still don’t get why you always mess up on exam day.

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,955
But you’ll do well this time.

11
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:39,914
Got it.

12
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:53,386
Classroom 1 – Study here before you go!
Let’s head toward success together!

13
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,140
Alright, let’s stop here. Enjoy your lunch, everyone.

14
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,308
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,743
Hey, it’s lunchtime.

16
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,496
Ah… I’m not eating!

17
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,372
You’re not eating lunch?

18
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,638
Something sweet [1/2]

19
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,439
You’re awake?

20
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,858
I don’t think you had lunch earlier.

21
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,027
So I brought you something sweet.

22
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,071
Try it.

23
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,280
Something sweet?

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,532
Yeah, sweet stuff.

25
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,326
I don’t like sweets.

26
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,703
Huh? You don’t like sweets?

27
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,622
Come on, sweets are great!

28
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,915
When you eat them,

29
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,208
it relieves stress,

30
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,668
and helps you study better.

31
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,378
This one’s candy,

32
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,712
this one’s chewy taffy,

33
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,381
and this is jelly!

34
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,133
Try it, it’s really sweet!

35
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,262
Alright, alright.

36
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,266
Hey, class is still on. Where is everyone?

37
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,392
Sit down, too.

38
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,643
Yes!

39
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,410
Ah…

40
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,911
Ah…

41
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,502
Miracle morning!

42
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,665
Did you… eat the candy I gave you yesterday?

43
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,627
No.

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,046
Why not? It’s good!

45
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,052
We’re both retakers, let’s get along!

46
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,179
I’m not a retaker.

47
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,138
Huh?

48
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,515
I’m twenty-one.

49
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,392
Oh!

50
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,061
Then this is your third try?

51
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,437
Ah, Hyunsoo’s older!

52
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,189
I thought we were the same age.

53
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,190
Hyunsoo.

54
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,484
This one’s not that sweet.

55
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,694
Try it, it’s good.

56
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,280
Make sure you eat it!

57
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,042
I brought some sweets again.

58
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,419
Hyunsoo, aren’t you eating lunch?

59
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,546
Sweets?

60
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,884
You’ll faint if you skip meals!

61
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,386
Yeah, something sweet!

62
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,104
Eating sweets helps relieve stress and study better!

63
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,067
This is good.

64
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,368
Do I have something on my face?

65
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,079
You really enjoy eating.

66
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,584
You look like a squirrel.

67
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,295
Hey, why are you teasing me?

68
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,881
Maybe because you eat sweets all the time?

69
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,341
I’m not fat, okay?

70
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,634
I’m just built this way!

71
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,850
It’s good.

72
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,019
Make sure you eat it.

73
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,186
Promise!

74
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,897
Everyone, your mock exam results are out.

75
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,274
Come up and get them.

76
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,650
Kim Sunghyun.

77
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,359
Yes!

78
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,656
Kim Seokhyun.

79
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,699
Yes!

80
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,784
Kang Jinhyun.

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,869
Yes!

82
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,789
Park Hyunsoo.

83
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,584
Park Hyunsoo!

84
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,209
Yes!

85
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,133
KISS KISS SXX
