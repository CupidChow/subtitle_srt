1
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,031
Wait a sec.

2
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,159
Why?

3
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,077
Are you shy?

4
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,830
It’s not that...

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,709
It’s okay.

6
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,600
I can’t do this.

7
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,939
What do you mean, you can’t?

8
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,284
Hey, Song Jio.

9
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,453
What are you doing?

10
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,840
I’m sorry.

11
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:32,967
Sunwoo!

12
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,061
I’m sorry, Sunwoo.

13
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,437
Can you handle this instead?

14
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,774
Will that be okay?

15
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,152
Song Jio.

16
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,446
Go grab some new chocolate sticks.

17
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,376
Manager.

18
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:11,673
I apologize for the disruption—our new recruit hasn’t been fully trained yet.

19
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,091
We’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again.

20
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,969
It’s fine. Things happen during work.

21
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,937
Still, Minju, you need to train your rookie properly.

22
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,694
Why don’t you show us how it’s done, Manager Sunwoo?

23
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,613
Song Jio!

24
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,240
Didn’t I tell you to bring the chocolate sticks?

25
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,961
Not a BL [1/2]

26
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,547
Behold, that angelic beauty!

27
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,467
Shining like sunlight in the middle of the night!

28
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,353
Oh treasure as precious as heaven itself, light that appeared out of nowhere!

29
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,274
I cannot close my eyes to such beauty.

30
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,613
I never truly knew what beauty was...

31
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,577
Have I ever even loved before?

32
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,749
Have I ever... loved?

33
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,504
Thank you.

34
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,057
Minju!

35
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,517
Hey, good job out there.

36
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:47,769
Hi!

37
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,148
Hey, I saw your act earlier—you were pretty good!

38
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,858
Oh, no way.

39
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,777
I’ve still got a long way to go to catch up to you.

40
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,570
Oh, come on.

41
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,656
Call me Minju, not “senior.”

42
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:00,657
Really?

43
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,324
Yeah.

44
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,286
Minju.

45
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,121
Jio...

46
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,040
Minju!

47
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,208
Jio!

48
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,669
Oh, right—

49
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,379
Wanna take a part-time job?

50
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,421
Seriously?

51
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,506
What kind?

52
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,508
Could use some cash anyway.

53
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:25,765
Song Jio.

54
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,979
Hey, Jio!

55
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,778
What was that back there?

56
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,363
What do you mean?

57
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,949
You know exactly what I mean.

58
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,076
I just don’t think it’s for me.

59
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,206
You think actors only get to play roles that fit them?

60
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,293
Even if it’s awkward or hard—you make it real. That’s acting.

61
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,420
You call that acting?

62
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,632
You told me this job was acting experience and a paycheck.

63
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,009
But this? This is just...

64
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,428
...pretending to date for tips!

65
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,178
Pretending?

66
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,769
Yeah.

67
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,814
Then what does that make you, if you can’t even pretend?

68
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,400
This café’s a stage too.

69
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,154
If you can’t satisfy even one customer here,

70
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,072
what kind of great actor do you think you’ll become?

71
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,576
No matter how much you hate your role,

72
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,871
to the audience—it has to feel real.

73
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,538
No—

74
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,124
For that moment, it has to be real.

75
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,419
So what, you’re saying you can just touch people casually for the act?

76
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,297
Am I the crazy one here?!

77
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,303
I’m done.

78
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,808
Guess you’re right. I can’t satisfy anyone—not even one person.

79
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:57,899
What?

80
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,943
Do I disgust you?

81
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,445
Let go!

82
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,696
Didn’t you say you needed the money?

83
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,114
You gonna quit already?

84
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,242
You think I’m here just for money?

85
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,244
I’m here because—

86
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,209
Then...

87
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,670
Do it. One last time.

88
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,228
It’s just the two of us now.

89
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,355
No audience.

90
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:44,237
Put your whole heart into it. Make your first audience—me—believe it.

91
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,740
Then I’ll let you go.

92
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,869
You mean...

93
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,413
do it for real?

94
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,337
KISS KISS SXX
