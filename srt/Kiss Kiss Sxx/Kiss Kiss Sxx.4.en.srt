1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,334
Folding? You! [2/2]

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,378
There’s so much I want to show you at my house.

3
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,172
Not just Brachiosaurus, but Spinosaurus too,

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,716
and even Tyrannosaurus—

5
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:08,550
Oh, right!

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,719
You do know the basics of origami, right?

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,636
Of course!

8
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,221
Perfect, that’s great!

9
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,932
Ah, there’s so much I want to show you—where should I start?

10
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:16,599
Oh, right.

11
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,350
Was it here?

12
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,226
No, wait...

13
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,896
I had a Brachiosaurus I was folding... where did it go?

14
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:22,939
Ah, here it is!

15
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,776
Here, Brachiosaurus...

16
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,614
The key point is this long extended neck line. That’s the highlight.

17
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,702
See? The line goes straight all the way like this.

18
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,119
Hey...

19
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,953
Yeah?

20
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,329
You can speak casually with me.

21
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,290
Just say, “Woonhee.” Like that.

22
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,666
Ah...

23
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:42,792
Really?

24
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,211
Woonhee?

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,505
Yeah, just like that.

26
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,133
So...

27
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,802
Since you said you know the basics of origami—

28
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,097
There’s the staircase fold, the door fold,

29
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,391
and then the cushion fold, the ice cream fold...

30
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,268
Of course, you can also do the square pocket fold—

31
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,352
What’s your hobby, Jin?

32
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,980
My hobby?

33
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,193
You’re seriously... asking me that?

34
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:09,944
Ah...

35
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,946
What’s your favorite food?

36
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,364
Folded kimbap.

37
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,285
What do you watch on YouTube?

38
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,329
Hmm...

39
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,290
UNCLESQUARE, Origami Lab—

40
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,293
and sometimes lectures by Master Kim Young-man.

41
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,462
Do you go to university?

42
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,755
Yeah, of course I do.

43
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,590
Why do you ask?

44
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,804
Don’t tell me if I open your bag, it’s just full of origami paper?

45
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,765
Wait, hang on.

46
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,099
Wanna see my origami paper collection?

47
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,518
I don’t take the expensive ones to university.

48
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,186
But I still have to catch people’s attention.

49
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,938
So I pick the flashy ones.

50
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:48,233
Look here—there’s silver, gold, even neon colors.

51
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,194
Some are glittery, some have hearts or star patterns…

52
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,779
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

53
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,281
Wow, that’s… impressive.

54
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,784
Right? I’m totally amazing, huh?

55
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,036
Have you ever dated anyone?

56
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,164
Dated?

57
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,295
You haven’t… ever, have you?

58
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,381
Uh...

59
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,051
I have.

60
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,137
Oh, really?

61
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,140
How was it?

62
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:23,935
Wh-what do you mean?

63
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,436
Ugh...

64
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,105
I said, how was it?

65
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,360
...Jealous, maybe?

66
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,655
Forget it. I know you’re not jealous at all.

67
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,031
So, what do you think about me?

68
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,368
S-sorry, but...

69
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,538
I honestly have no idea what you’re talking about.

70
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,001
You really don’t know?

71
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:55,258
Do you seriously think I came to your house just because of origami?

72
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,262
Wait, don’t tell me...

73
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,431
Don’t tell you what?

74
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,393
You came to steal my origami techniques, didn’t you?

75
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:07,729
What?

76
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,772
Gotcha!

77
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,607
You!

78
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,066
Which university are you from?

79
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,027
No, that’s not it! Really!

80
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,612
Then why are you here?

81
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,406
And why are you so interested in me?

82
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,949
Because I fell for you.

83
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,451
I fell for you at first sight!

84
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,079
You...

85
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,457
You fell for me?

86
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,543
Yeah... I did.

87
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:37,592
We literally met for the first time today.

88
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,762
Jin.

89
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,847
You’re insanely handsome.

90
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,276
S-so, uh... should we get back to talking about origami?

91
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,863
There’s actually something I’ve been researching lately...

92
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,656
Oh...

93
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,452
While I was folding, I started thinking...

94
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,662
Hmm?

95
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,123
What if you fold paper with something other than your hands?

96
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,377
Yeah, like using another body part — wouldn’t that be fun?

97
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:13,962
Watch this!

98
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,475
How is it?

99
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,310
Whoa!

100
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,442
Hey, Jin...

101
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,654
Did you know you can fold paper with your mouth too?

102
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,405
What?

103
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:41,864
With your mouth?

104
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,533
Seriously?

105
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:44,534
Yeah.

106
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,619
Wanna see?

107
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,288
Yeah! I’m so curious!

108
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,877
But...

109
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,298
This isn’t something you can do alone.

110
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,102
W-wait a second.

111
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,230
Something about this feels weird.

112
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,401
Weird?

113
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,778
Yeah, weird.

114
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,240
I don’t think this is how you’re supposed to do it.

115
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,325
Huh?

116
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,702
Let me try.

117
00:05:59,192 --> 00:05:59,859
Ah!

118
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,736
S-s-sorry!

119
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,156
I got a little... too into it.

120
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,158
I liked it.

121
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,077
Huh?

122
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,956
I mean— for a first try, it wasn’t bad!

123
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,958
I’ll join your origami club.

124
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,001
Ah!

125
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:20,588
Now that I’m a member, I should start practicing.

126
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,718
So that means...

127
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,808
You wanna practice again, right?

128
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,143
You mean the mouth origami thing!

129
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,439
Uh... yeah?

130
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,857
Good.

131
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,026
I’m really ready this time.

132
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,278
I know I can do way better now!

133
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,696
Let’s do it!

134
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,243
Jin!

135
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,285
Woonhee!

136
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,331
Hey, Woonhee!

137
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,125
You’re really giving it your all, huh?

138
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,252
You look totally obsessed with origami.

139
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,130
I didn’t think it’d be this fun at first,

140
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,340
but once you start, it’s actually fun.

141
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,967
Oh, I learned something new recently—

142
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:07,718
Woonhee!

143
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,890
I’ll get going first.

144
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,600
Woonhee.

145
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,310
I practiced that thing really hard.

146
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:17,770
What thing?

147
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,188
The one you taught me.

148
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,398
Mouth origami!

149
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,360
Ah, actually, that’s not a real thing— I just made it up...

150
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,986
Watch!

151
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:25,820
Ta-da!

152
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:37,748
Huh?!

153
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,083
How’s that?

154
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,835
Pretty awesome, right?

155
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:41,919
That’s amazing!

156
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,298
With this, we’ll get new club members in no time!

157
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,799
Oh, you’re right!

158
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,343
Yeah, this’ll totally attract new members fast!

159
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,636
Wait, what am I doing here?

160
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,013
I’ll go buy more origami paper!

161
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,269
We could’ve stayed together a little longer...

162
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,313
Woonhee!

163
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,529
Buy the crane paper at Daiso!

164
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,532
It’s more expensive at stationery stores!

165
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,329
It’s the same price no matter where you buy it!

166
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,003
That’s... not what I wanted to say.

167
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,561
KISS KISS SXX
