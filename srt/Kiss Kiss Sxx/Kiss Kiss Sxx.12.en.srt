1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,087
Not a BL [2/2]

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:06,965
Yeah.

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,009
Then what does that make you, if you can’t even pretend?

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,595
This café’s a stage too.

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,349
If you can’t satisfy even one customer here,

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,268
what kind of great actor do you think you’ll become?

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,771
No matter how much you hate your role,

8
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,066
to the audience—it has to feel real.

9
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:25,734
No—

10
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,319
For that moment, it has to be real.

11
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,614
So what, you’re saying you can just touch people casually for the act?

12
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,492
Am I the crazy one here?!

13
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,498
I’m done.

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,004
Guess you’re right. I can’t satisfy anyone—not even one person.

15
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,094
What?

16
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,139
Do I disgust you?

17
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,640
Let go!

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,892
Didn’t you say you needed the money?

19
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,310
You gonna quit already?

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,438
You think I’m here just for money?

21
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,440
I’m here because—

22
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,404
Then...

23
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,866
Do it. One last time.

24
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,423
It’s just the two of us now.

25
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,550
No audience.

26
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:39,432
Put your whole heart into it. Make your first audience—me—believe it.

27
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,936
Then I’ll let you go.

28
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,065
You mean...

29
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,609
do it for real?

30
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,131
Satisfied now?

31
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,858
Manager Kang...

32
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,735
Kang Minju.

33
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,488
You haven’t been focused on work lately.

34
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,407
Something wrong?

35
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,035
No, sir.

36
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,872
And the new recruit’s still untrained...

37
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,499
When’s this report getting submitted?

38
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,920
I’ll finish it right away and have it reviewed.

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,922
You’d better. Don’t make this a habit.

40
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,632
Yes, sir.

41
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,553
I’m sorry...

42
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,932
If you’re sorry...

43
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,061
Then you’ll accept your punishment.

44
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,986
Stand straight.

45
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,703
Well, well.

46
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,379
Straighten up.

47
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,759
Now, I’ll give you your punishment.

48
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,637
Take it sweetly.

49
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,483
Minju didn’t do anything wrong!

50
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,026
Song Jio...

51
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:49,080
Minju...

52
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,000
I kept telling myself it was just acting.

53
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,963
It helped me stay calm... helped me not fall for it.

54
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,382
But every time you came closer—

55
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,510
—I kept thinking, what if it’s real?

56
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,180
That’s all I could think about.

57
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,432
Then...

58
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,977
That’s what acting is. Believing it’s real.

59
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,104
You did great last time, remember?

60
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,691
That kiss—that was just acting, right?

61
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,483
No!

62
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,610
That’s why I pulled away.

63
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,656
I wasn’t scared I couldn’t get into it— I was scared I’d fall too deep.

64
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,283
Then...

65
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,412
That time, you—

66
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:34,959
Yeah, Minju.

67
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,551
KISS KISS SXX
