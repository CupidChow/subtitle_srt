1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Craving You [1/2]

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:09,926
Hot, isn’t it?

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,679
Ah.

4
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,973
That’s refreshing…

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,602
Drink while you work.

6
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,147
Thanks.

7
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,074
Is it really hot?

8
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,038
Ugh, it’s hot!

9
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,665
So damn hot!

10
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,889
Looks like they’re about to roll.

11
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,558
They said we get a twenty-minute break!

12
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,985
And…

13
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,656
I have a favor to ask.

14
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,494
A favor?

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,788
Yeah…

16
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,831
I can’t quite get into it.

17
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,750
Can you read the lines with me?

18
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,420
You’re fine doing it alone.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,422
It’s not even that hard.

20
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,716
Just help me match the tone.

21
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:32,884
Please?

22
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,472
How am I supposed to do a melodrama with you?

23
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,350
What, like we haven’t done romantic stuff before?

24
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,645
You’ve always helped me run lines, right?

25
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,819
Ugh, fine!

26
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,779
Forget it, I’ll just do it myself!

27
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,905
I’ll run it alone!

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,836
Don’t go.

29
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,381
Why do you keep trying to leave me?

30
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,638
You know you’re all I have.

31
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,310
Aren’t you gonna read the lines?

32
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,564
Put that down.

33
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,440
Just reading lines…

34
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,652
doesn’t feel real.

35
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,419
Let’s stop.

36
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,964
Don’t go.

37
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,842
You’re all I’ve got.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,730
If I disappear…

39
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,652
you’ll finally be happy.

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,451
Taeyoon.

41
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,665
Hey…

42
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,169
Jeha, we’re ready!

43
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,133
You should get going.

44
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,781
Yes, you can switch right away.

45
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,616
Okay.

46
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,499
You worked hard today.

47
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,459
- Thank you!
- Thank you

48
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,840
Yes, the sooner, the better.

49
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,220
It’s nothing serious…

50
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,139
Jeha can handle things on his own now.

51
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,684
It’s better if I take a rookie instead.

52
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:30,937
Yes.

53
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,815
He’s the face of the company, though.

54
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,149
Taeyoon.

55
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,697
Please assign him a good manager.

56
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,951
Not someone too new.

57
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,827
What are you doing?

58
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,040
I’ll call you back.

59
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,463
A “good manager”?

60
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,384
And what’s that about him “handling things alone”?

61
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,887
I can’t just stick with you forever.

62
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:07,390
Why not?

63
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,521
There are plenty of rookies to look after at the company.

64
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,857
You’re doing fine on your own—

65
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,691
Don’t go!

66
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,904
What if someone sees us?

67
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,865
So what if they do?

68
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,910
Jeha.

69
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,955
Throwing a tantrum won’t change anything. There’s protocol.

70
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,457
You’re the one who said you were leaving.

71
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,670
We’ve been together for seven years since debut.

72
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,338
And now suddenly…

73
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,717
You must have a reason for asking to switch.

74
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,011
There’s no reason.

75
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,932
I just want to work with someone else for a change.

76
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,812
Someone else, huh?

77
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,774
You really expect me to believe that?

78
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,360
Did I do something wrong to you?

79
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,612
No, you didn’t.

80
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,781
It’s just that…

81
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,992
I can’t work with you anymore.

82
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,705
Did I ask you to date me?

83
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,500
Or to kiss me, maybe?

84
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,292
Jeha!

85
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,001
Just—

86
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,173
Just stay by my side.

87
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,844
Is that really so hard?

88
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,388
Jeha.

89
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,141
Let’s stop this.

90
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,950
Guess that gives you a reason to leave now.

91
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,039
Do whatever you want.

92
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,377
Hey, Jeha!

93
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,719
What do you think you’re doing?

94
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,682
You knew, but pretended not to.

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,018
You knew I liked you!

96
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:16,811
I didn’t know!

97
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,065
And I won’t ever know.

98
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,528
Taeyoon…

99
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,114
You’ll have a new manager tomorrow.

100
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,328
Let’s pretend none of this happened.

101
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,166
You can just do that, huh?

102
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,460
Fine.

103
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,729
KISS KISS SXX
