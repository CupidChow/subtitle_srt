A Killer Recipe [1/2]

2
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,542
Yeonhui-dong intersection.

3
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,587
Choe Yeongjun eliminated.

4
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,848
As promised, I handed over something worth more than my life—

5
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,434
so our deal ends here.

6
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,149
Is this the client who booked the home-care service?

7
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,069
Ah… what do I do? I can’t stay in here forever.

8
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:20,914
Huh?

9
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,501
This is the lighter I gave Taerim!

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,508
Shut up…

11
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,011
If the body’s handled, clean up the guys Jiwon planted beside you!

12
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,721
My name…?

13
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:37,931
Otherwise, Chairman Joo…

14
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,475
You’re next.

15
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,926
Ah… screw it!

16
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,434
Who are you?

17
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,811
Did Chairman Joo send you?

18
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,437
No, no, no…!

19
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,065
I’m Song Jiwon, home-care master from Big Mama Co.!

20
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,067
I’m sorry for facing the client directly!

21
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,735
I—I didn’t see anything!

22
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,653
[Big Mama Service Home Care Master Song Jiwon]
No, I mean—

23
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,946
[Big Mama Service Home Care Master Song Jiwon]
I didn’t hear anything either!

24
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,156
Song Jiwon…

25
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,036
Why are you…

26
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,706
Taerim?

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,417
Taerim!

28
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,084
Ah…

29
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,509
Ah! What are you doing?

30
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,218
Ahh!

31
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,308
Taerim...

32
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:05,852
What… happened to you…

33
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,104
Let’s get you to a hospital first.

34
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:08,897
Go.

35
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:10,690
What?

36
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,692
If your job’s done…

37
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,862
clock out.

38
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,782
Clock out?

39
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,746
You ghosted me and drove me crazy…

40
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,957
and after a year you show up like this and say—

41
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,042
what?

42
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:29,959
“Clock out”?

43
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,835
Please, just go!

44
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,419
No!

45
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,505
You want me to just walk away again not knowing anything?

46
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,845
Even if it’s a stranger who’s hurt, I can’t leave like this.

47
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,598
So let’s treat you first—

48
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,022
I don’t want to see you.

49
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,441
Get out.

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,319
Taerim, seriously…

51
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,528
Please…

52
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,781
Song Jiwon.

53
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,243
Taerim!

54
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,204
Taerim…

55
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,580
Hey, are you okay?

56
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,331
Taerim…

57
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,049
No hospital…

58
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,176
no…

59
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,177
Huh?

60
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,182
Over there…

61
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,496
I’m fine.

62
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,179
What about the restaurant?

63
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,475
Home-care was just a side gig, right?

64
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,563
After you disappeared, I threw myself into this work.

65
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,275
Thinking maybe I’d run into you again…

66
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,947
Back then, it was the only way to survive.

67
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,620
Then this company scouted me.

68
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,047
What happened to you?

69
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,511
Athletes don’t get hurt like this.

70
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,061
And bodies, and…

71
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,398
you said someone was watching me—what’s that about?

72
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,206
I…

73
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,253
I kill people.

74
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,133
What are you talking about?

75
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,176
I’m not an ath—

76
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,182
I mean,

77
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:18,938
I’m not

78
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,567
a fighter—

79
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,903
I’m a killer.

80
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,197
A… kil—

81
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,117
A killer?

82
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,251
I never meant to deceive you.

83
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,753
Back then I—

84
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,629
Wait, wait, wait!

85
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,884
So you’re saying—

86
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,012
like the kind of killer in movies—

87
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,598
you actually kill people?

88
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,526
You don’t have to forgive me.

89
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,156
You don’t have to see me again.

90
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,912
Just for today,

91
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,040
just for tonight,

92
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,543
stay with me.

93
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,769
You still keep a diary…

94
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,400
KISS KISS SXX
