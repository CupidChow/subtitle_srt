1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,377
Folding? You! [1/2]

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,879
Hey, how many first-period classes do you have this semester?

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,840
I must’ve been insane in the past.

4
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,800
All of them except today are first period.

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,802
Hey, you commute, right?

6
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:11,928
Can you even handle that?

7
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,431
I wake up at seven every morning.

8
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,516
I seriously wanna kill my past self...

9
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,477
Hey, look at that guy!

10
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,896
Join the Origami Club — Now Recruiting!!!

11
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,189
What’s with him?

12
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,619
Doesn’t the school keep weird people like that from coming in?

13
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,131
Come on, let’s just go.

14
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,926
What are you doing? Let’s go already!

15
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,222
Fine, do whatever you want. I’m leaving.

16
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,445
I like you...

17
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,280
What?

18
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,326
I mean, what I’m trying to say is...

19
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,911
Origami!

20
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,709
Do you know how to fold a Brachiosaurus?

21
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:25,752
Yes...

22
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,544
Huh?

23
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:27,712
Oh!

24
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,589
Of course! I can fold anything!

25
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,633
Uh, have you seen Jurassic World?

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,260
I can fold Mosasaurus and Titanosaurus—

27
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,055
And even Quetzalcoatlus!

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,640
Uh...

29
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:43,061
I haven’t seen Jurassic World though...

30
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,522
Anyway...

31
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,106
I can fold them.

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,862
So, you’re saying you can fold a Brachiosaurus, right?

33
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,572
Yes.

34
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,244
Then that’s good enough!

35
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,958
These days, origami dinosaurs are all the rage.

36
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,627
But everyone just goes for the simple ones,
no one really bothers with the famous ones anymore.

37
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,379
He’s seriously handsome...

38
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,090
How is someone like that not street-cast?

39
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,050
Are his eyes the best feature?

40
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,385
No, maybe his nose?

41
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,595
Wow, even his lips are pretty!

42
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,806
Wow... God, thank you!

43
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,523
I’d give anything just to date him for three seconds.

44
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,736
- His body’s great too. Damn!
- I have a bunch of origami brachiosauruses at home...

45
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,489
Say that again.

46
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,366
Huh...?

47
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,036
Memorizing the ten basic origami folds is more important than multiplication—

48
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:42,954
No, not that!

49
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,081
Didn’t you just say something about your house?

50
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,958
Oh, that?

51
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,169
I just meant I’ve got tons of folded Brachiosauruses at home...

52
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:51,963
Let’s go.

53
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,755
Huh?

54
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,091
Your place. Let’s go.

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,676
You...

56
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,344
Don’t tell me...

57
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,559
You lied about knowing how to fold a Brachiosaurus just to look better than me, didn’t you?

58
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,604
Ah? You caught me.

59
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,858
Ha! I knew it! I’m the only one who can fold that!

60
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,067
Follow me.

61
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,319
Come to my place.

62
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,950
There’s so much I want to show you at my house.

63
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,745
Not just Brachiosaurus, but Spinosaurus too,

64
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,288
and even Tyrannosaurus—

65
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,122
Oh, right!

66
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,291
You do know the basics of origami, right?

67
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,208
Of course!

68
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,793
Perfect, that’s great!

69
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,504
Ah, there’s so much I want to show you—where should I start?

70
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,172
Oh, right.

71
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:34,923
Was it here?

72
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:35,798
No, wait...

73
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,469
I had a Brachiosaurus I was folding... where did it go?

74
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,511
Ah, here it is!

75
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,349
Here, Brachiosaurus...

76
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:49,187
The key point is this long extended neck line. That’s the highlight.

77
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:53,274
See? The line goes straight all the way like this.

78
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:53,691
Hey...

79
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,525
Yeah?

80
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,902
You can speak casually with me.

81
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,862
Just say, “Woonhee.” Like that.

82
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,238
Ah...

83
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,365
Really?

84
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:02,784
Woonhee?

85
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,078
Yeah, just like that.

86
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,705
So...

87
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,375
Since you said you know the basics of origami—

88
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,670
There’s the staircase fold, the door fold,

89
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,964
and then the cushion fold, the ice cream fold...

90
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,840
Of course, you can also do the square pocket fold—

91
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,925
What’s your hobby, Jin?

92
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,552
My hobby?

93
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,765
You’re seriously... asking me that?

94
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,517
Ah...

95
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,519
What’s your favorite food?

96
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,937
Folded kimbap.

97
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,857
What do you watch on YouTube?

98
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,901
Hmm...

99
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,862
UNCLESQUARE, Origami Lab—

100
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,865
and sometimes lectures by Master Kim Young-man.

101
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,034
Do you go to university?

102
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,327
Yeah, of course I do.

103
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,162
Why do you ask?

104
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,376
Don’t tell me if I open your bag, it’s just full of origami paper?

105
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,337
Wait, hang on.

106
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,672
Wanna see my origami paper collection?

107
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,090
I don’t take the expensive ones to university.

108
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,758
But I still have to catch people’s attention.

109
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,510
So I pick the flashy ones.

110
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,805
Look here—there’s silver, gold, even neon colors.

111
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:08,766
Some are glittery, some have hearts or star patterns…

112
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,351
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

113
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,854
Wow, that’s… impressive.

114
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,356
Right? I’m totally amazing, huh?

115
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,608
Have you ever dated anyone?

116
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,737
Dated?

117
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,868
You haven’t… ever, have you?

118
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,953
Uh...

119
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,623
I have.

120
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,710
Oh, really?

121
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,713
How was it?

122
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,507
Wh-what do you mean?

123
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,009
Ugh...

124
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,677
I said, how was it?

125
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,727
KISS KISS SXX
