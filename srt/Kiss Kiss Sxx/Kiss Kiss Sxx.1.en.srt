1
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,515
Are you okay?

2
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,058
Yes.

3
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,352
I really appreciate it.

4
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:20,895
Sure.

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,650
Is this Gamdong, the one you’ve raised for seven years?

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,278
You’ve taken great care of it.

7
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,029
How did you know...?

8
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,490
Strawberry.

9
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,993
I’m the one you’re supposed to meet here.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,369
Ah...

11
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,288
“Mongmong”?

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,914
And you’re “Leon”?

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,875
Huh?

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,877
You don’t know the movie Léon?

15
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,296
The guy in the black suit carrying a plant...

16
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:47,964
Wait a second.

17
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,009
Yes.

18
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,512
Ah... I’m around the area right now too.

19
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,681
Then I’ll head over there.

20
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,768
No, it’s okay, really.

21
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,729
Alright, got it. Yes.

22
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,147
Excuse me...

23
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,149
I don’t have much time right now...

24
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,694
Please take good care of it.

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,864
Wait!

26
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,499
It’s my first time raising a plant...

27
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,960
Raise Me? [1/2]

28
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,048
Gamdong, 2 years old
Proud 4 years old

29
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:35,929
Strawberry!

30
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,101
Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of it.

31
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,024
Last time, the profit ratio was 70:30,

32
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,693
but for this contract, I’m proposing 80:20.

33
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,402
Please review it and—

34
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:51,903
Strawberry!

35
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,654
Oh no!

36
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,407
I’m sorry!

37
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,955
Thank you!

38
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,504
I watered it, but it’s wilting even more.

39
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,840
How much and how often should I water it?

40
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,842
Once a week, 100ml.

41
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,843
Mr. Seokmin!

42
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:15,885
Yes!

43
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,267
Strawberry!

44
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,768
Mr. Seokmin!

45
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,143
Yes!

46
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,311
Did you finish what I asked?

47
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,146
It’ll be done within ten minutes!

48
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,439
Strawberry!

49
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:30,984
Strawberry!

50
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,573
I gave it just that much water, but it seems to wilt more.

51
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,491
Should I keep it in sunlight,

52
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,076
or in the shade?

53
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,872
Should I open the window a bit so the air can circulate?

54
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,291
What?

55
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,751
Ask ChatGPT?

56
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,462
Are you really Gamdong’s dad?

57
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,594
Wouldn’t Gamdong’s father know best?

58

Carrot Market

59
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,315
It prefers bright, indirect light in semi-shade,

60
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,526
and direct sunlight can burn or yellow its leaves.

61
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,534
The ideal temperature is 18–27°C, and it’s weak to cold.

62
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,038
The watering cycle may vary depending on humidity indoors.

63
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,292
Water thoroughly when the soil surface dries,

64
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,502
and water again when the leaves droop.

65
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,506
But be careful not to overwater.

66
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,258
Gamdong!

67
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,136
Grow strong and healthy.

68
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,516
Strawberry!

69
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,396
Thanks to you, the little one’s full of energy again!

70
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,407
It even looks taller now!

71
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,262
Don’t let Gamdong get rained on.

72
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,472
Please bring it inside.

73
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,017
Oh no, Gamdong almost got caught in the rain!

74
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,531
Strawberry!

75
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,507
I’ve never seen it bloom in seven years,

76
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,093
but now, thanks to you, it has.

77
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,012
You raised it so well.

78
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,681
Thank you so much.

79
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,692
The photo doesn’t do it justice.

80
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,653
It’s much prettier in person...

81
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,364
Would you like to come see it?

82
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,331
Wait!

83
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,946
Sorry for keeping you waiting!

84
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:04,864
Oh, not at all.

85
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,491
I just came early.

86
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,701
Come on in!

87
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,411
Thanks for inviting me.
