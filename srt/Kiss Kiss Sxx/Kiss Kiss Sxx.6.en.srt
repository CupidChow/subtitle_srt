00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,087
Sweet Mischief [2/2]

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,013
They say three coincidences make a destiny.

3
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,390
- This isn’t fate—
- Then what?

4
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,225
Lovers?

5
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,912
Hey, did you hear?

6
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,167
- Hear what?
- Sunhoo changes his look every day like a model.

7
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,252
Is he debuting or something?

8
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,215
So? Looks good, right?

9
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,592
My masterpiece.

10
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,636
Look at your face... you’re that happy?

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,054
It’s fun.

12
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,890
Still, not bad, huh?

13
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,018
Yeah, he looks way more natural now.

14
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,520
Before, he was so uptight.

15
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,107
Perfect looks, and his personality was just as strict—

16
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,526
Ugh, I could barely breathe around him!

17
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,364
Anyway, what are you holding?

18
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,287
Ah... it’s nothing.

19
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,248
Ah! I’ll head out first!

20
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,506
Hey, if you tease someone you like too much, they’ll run away.

21
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,715
Be careful.

22
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,384
Wow, look at you, relationship expert.

23
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,636
Just go already!

24
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,480
Third wish— take a four-cut photo together.

25
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,031
Fourth wish— do an apple hairstyle.

26
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,661
Fifth wish is...

27
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,139
Hasn’t Sunhoo been acting strange lately?

28
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:25,019
He’s been pushing himself too hard... it was bound to happen.

29
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,730
They say a late bloomer’s scary— have you seen him?

30
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,192
I even heard he’s dating someone these days.

31
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:48,543
He looks way better now. Seriously, he’s so handsome it’s dangerous.

32
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,796
Exactly. He finally seems human.

33
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,366
That’s enough.

34
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,078
Go ahead and tell everyone if you want.

35
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,790
What’s wrong all of a sudden?

36
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,794
I don’t like this anymore.

37
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,465
I’m tired of being part of your game.

38
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,344
It’s not a game.

39
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,556
Not a game?

40
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,768
Making me dress up and look ridiculous isn’t?

41
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,271
Forget it.

42
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,816
Stop playing with me already.

43
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,864
Hey, that’s harsh.

44
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,453
Yeah, I mean—

45
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,082
I did tease you, sure.

46
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,961
But that’s not what this is about.

47
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,257
Maybe I just couldn’t stand fighting with you at every meeting.

48
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,429
If your wish was to make me fall apart...

49
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,061
Then you succeeded, so just stop now.

50
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,441
Sunhoo...

51
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,360
Everything must be easy for you.

52
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,116
Not for me.

53
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,788
I hate feeling like I’m not myself anymore.

54
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,418
You keep catching my eyes more and more,

55
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,837
and I hate that I don’t know what to do about it...

56
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,096
Sunhoo, I swear, it wasn’t just for fun.

57
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,643
Okay, I did tease you—

58
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,896
but your reactions were too cute.

59
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,400
What did you just say?

60
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,447
And it’s not all easy for me either.

61
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,157
Look at me now.

62
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,451
I can’t even confess to the person I like,

63
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,579
and I’m being accused of playing with them instead.

64
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,207
The person you like?

65
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,178
I like you, Sunhoo.

66
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,658
Let’s stop the wish game...

67
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,786
and just go on a date.

68
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,469
You think this is fun?

69
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,347
You think I’m doing it for fun?

70
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,599
It helps my résumé, that’s why.

71
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,354
Then why did you join if it’s not fun?

72
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,732
Because you did.

73
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,778
Didn’t you hate me at first?

74
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,239
What are you talking about?

75
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,324
I joined because of you.

76
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,119
Because I like you.

77
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,288
That’s why—

78
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,874
I went around looking for you everywhere.

79
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,837
Since when did you start liking me?

80
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,802
Would you believe me if I said it was love at first sight?

81
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,637
Why?

82
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,433
Because you’re beautiful.

83
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,587
KISS KISS SXX
