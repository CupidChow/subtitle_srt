1
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:20,729
Sleep Around, Still Mine [1/2]

2
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,040
You’re up early.

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,001
I’m usually a light sleeper.

4
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:47,130
Guess I drank too much last night.

5
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,466
Blaming the alcohol, huh...

6
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,885
But it wasn’t bad, was it?

7
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,596
No, it wasn’t bad.

8
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,057
I usually don’t make mistakes like that.

9
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:03,354
I’m not even sure why I did that last night, but... I just...

10
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,606
Yeah?

11
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,735
I’ve been wondering since the moment I met you.

12
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:17,535
What’s hiding behind that calm face of yours.

13
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,377
Uh...

14
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,590
What... are we, exactly?

15
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,800
What are we?

16
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,343
Well...

17
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,262
For now, I’d say...

18
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,264
two people who fit perfectly last night.

19
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,058
Is that all?

20
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,310
Hajun, don’t get the wrong idea.

21
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,229
It was just one night of fun.

22
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,817
You’re not thinking about dating me, are you?

23
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,027
What if I am?

24
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,362
Hajun...

25
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,990
I’m not good at serious relationships.

26
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,158
Actually...

27
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,701
I don’t do them.

28
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:01,913
Why not?

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,166
Nothing changes or breaks as easily as feelings.

30
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,670
I don’t plan to waste time or emotions on that.

31
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,671
Then...

32
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,298
last night was just...

33
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,927
- a mistake?
- A mistake...

34
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,346
It felt good, didn’t it?

35
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,265
Isn’t that enough?

36
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,271
You...

37
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,982
seem like you were expecting me to say we should date.

38
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,441
Sorry.

39
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,735
That’s not really possible.

40
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,949
But how about I make you an offer?

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,159
An offer?

42
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,203
Let’s keep seeing each other.

43
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,706
Whenever we need a body.

44
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,418
You mean...

45
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,212
be friends with benefits?

46
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,714
Yeah, partners.

47
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,133
But there are rules.

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,384
First,

49
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,429
don’t ask about each other’s private lives.

50
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,764
No matter who we meet or what we do.

51
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,641
Second,

52
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,686
never contact each other during the day.

53
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,772
And lastly,

54
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,068
I’ll be the one to reach out first.

55
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,201
I’ll take your silence as a yes.

56
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,788
I’ll call you.

57
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,590
How do I end this story?
What should happen to the characters...

58
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,594
'Sunwoo'
Today?

59
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,768
How do I end this story?
What should happen to the characters...

60
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,109
Ending, Part 1? Part 2? Character setup, villain X personality
Incident... setting, time, story, protagonist—how should it be...
Lead role, costume...

61
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,364
What’s wrong?

62
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:48,287
I’m stuck on this new character design. Nothing’s coming out right.

63
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,415
Want me to model for you?

64
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,125
What?

65
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,002
Seriously?

66
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,129
You’d really model for me?

67
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,006
Why not? I could.

68
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,215
But...

69
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,425
Is that okay?

70
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,051
Our rules...

71
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,638
This isn’t about needing a body.

72
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,310
It’s Sunwoo and Hajun as artist and model.

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,438
Business doesn’t count as breaking the rules.

74
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,691
Thank you, really.

75
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,110
When can we do it? Can we start right away?

76
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,322
When do you need me?

77
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:22,947
Today...

78
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,866
Ah, never mind.

79
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,119
Can you come here tomorrow at 2 p.m.?

80
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,120
Sure.

81
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:30,747
Okay.

82
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:35,209
Didn’t know being a model would make you smile that big.

83
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,338
Uh...

84
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,300
Tilt your chin down a little.

85
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,303
Yeah, look out the window.

86
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,723
Good, hold that pose.

87
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,771
My arm’s gonna fall off. How long is this gonna take?

88
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,481
Almost done.

89
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,527
Let’s try leaning this way now.

90
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,042
Huh?

91
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,127
We’re not done yet.

92
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,463
Oh, sorry.

93
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,340
Modeling’s harder than I thought.

94
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,888
All done.

95
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,264
It’s finished.

96
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,433
Wow, that was exhausting.

97
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,560
Thanks.

98
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,146
You really helped me break through that block.

99
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,982
I’ll definitely repay you somehow!

100
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,110
Forget it.

101
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,445
Just buy me some expensive drinks later.

102
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,823
D-drinks?

103
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,324
Yeah, come by my bar sometime.

104
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:56,415
We were artist and model, now we can be owner and customer.

105
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,251
Ah...

106
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,212
Is that really okay?

107
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,552
Oh, right.

108
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,805
I just remembered I have plans.

109
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:11,973
Sorry.

110
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,559
Drop by sometime.

111
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,726
Sure...

112
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,574
Sunwoo, please...

113
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,367
It’s all my fault.

114
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,288
I... I can’t live without you.

115
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,707
We were good together.

116
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,251
Let’s start over, please?

117
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,338
Lee Minjun.

118
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,966
We’re already over.

119
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,886
Did you forget what you did to me?

120
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,388
It was a mistake. It’ll never happen again.

121
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,514
I...

122
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,100
I really have no one but you.

123
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,560
You still love me.

124
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,062
I can see it even if you deny it.

125
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,231
That’s why you came running when I said I’d come.

126
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,608
That’s...

127
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,157
Hajun!

128
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,330
Where are you going?

129
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,457
Who the hell is that guy?

130
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,458
Don’t tell me...

131
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,377
You’re seeing another guy behind my back again?

132
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,469
KISS KISS SXX
