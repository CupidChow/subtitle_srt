1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,044
Where the hell did he go?

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,839
He’s usually so punctual.

3
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,299
Think something happened to him?

4
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:14,013
Sweet Mischief

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,183
I like you.

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,064
I’m sorry, Sunbae.

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,527
I don’t see you that way.

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,573
But thank you for your feelings.

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,744
Oh? That’s Sunhoo!

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,047
Hey, did you find Sunhoo?

11
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,132
Yeah, I did!

12
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,550
Hang up already.

13
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,051
We’ve got a meeting, hurry—

14
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,220
Okay, okay! I’m hanging up!

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,901
What the...

16
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,156
No way... a kiss?

17
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,633
What are you doing?

18
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,346
What about you? It’s meeting time.

19
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,597
Mind your own business.

20
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:57,826
What are you doing?

21
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,495
Nothing.

22
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,749
So, what’s today’s meeting about?

23
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,210
I told you already — the literature trip.

24
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,505
Hmm... okay.

25
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,970
Department of Korean Literature Student Council
Literature Field Trip

26
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,017
Are you a YouTuber or something?

27
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,146
I’m filming a vlog for the literature trip.

28
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,523
You’re going for fun?

29
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,194
We’ll leave a record that the council did this,

30
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,613
and it’ll be good promotion for the literature trip too.

31
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,325
We’ll be busy running the event and looking after students.

32
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,035
Who’s got time for a vlog?

33
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,206
Did I tell you to do it?

34
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,624
Why so uptight?

35
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,626
I’ll just film on the way there.

36
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,064
Oh, was that Sunhoo’s first kiss?

37
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,859
First kiss? Please. He kissed two guys in one day—

38
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,322
Wanna hit the snack bar?

39
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,629
That’s a little different from kissing in front of everyone at school.

40
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,172
It wasn’t a kiss.

41
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,633
You’re flustered, aren’t you?

42
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,344
Even if it was a kiss, don’t you dare tell anyone.

43
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:43,765
What? Make up your mind — are you confident or embarrassed?

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,314
It’d be a shame to just let this slide.

45
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,191
Are you blackmailing me?

46
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,444
Blackmail? Wow, that’s a scary word.

47
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,077
Alright, I’ll be generous...

48
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,041
How about granting my wishes for a week?

49
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,460
What kind of childish nonsense is that?

50
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,963
Childish or not, you don’t really have a choice.

51
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,215
Or should I go tell everyone?

52
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,676
Is this fun for you?

53
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:22,971
No.

54
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,764
But...

55
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,393
I think it’s going to be fun.

56
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,567
So what do I have to do?

57
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,201
First wish—

58
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,662
Come to school exactly as you wake up.

59
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,833
Don’t fix your hair.

60
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,562
No point hiding, I already have proof.

61
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,335
Song Jio – Senior, I’ll be joining the literature trip. See you then.

62
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,088
What the—

63
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,892
Second kiss.

64
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,279
Second wish—

65
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,365
Wear the clothes I pick out for you.

66
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,247
What?

67
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,916
You can write something like this too?

68
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,719
Put it on.

69
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,896
Turn your head.

70
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,845
Still, that’s unexpected.

71
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,389
I thought you’d make me wear something weird.

72
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,437
This suits you better.

73
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,743
They say three coincidences make a destiny.

74
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,120
- This isn’t fate—
- Then what?

75
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,955
Lovers?

76
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,092
KISS KISS SXX
