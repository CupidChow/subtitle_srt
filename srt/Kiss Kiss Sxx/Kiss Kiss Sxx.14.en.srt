1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,087
Something sweet [2/2]

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,174
I brought some sweets again.

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,552
Hyunsoo, aren’t you eating lunch?

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,679
Sweets?

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,016
You’ll faint if you skip meals!

6
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,518
Yeah, something sweet!

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,236
Eating sweets helps relieve stress and study better!

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,199
This is good.

9
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,500
Do I have something on my face?

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,211
You really enjoy eating.

11
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,717
You look like a squirrel.

12
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,428
Hey, why are you teasing me?

13
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,014
Maybe because you eat sweets all the time?

14
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,474
I’m not fat, okay?

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,767
I’m just built this way!

16
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:05,982
It’s good.

17
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,151
Make sure you eat it.

18
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,319
Promise!

19
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,030
Everyone, your mock exam results are out.

20
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,406
Come up and get them.

21
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,783
Kim Sunghyun.

22
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,492
Yes!

23
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,789
Kim Seokhyun.

24
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,831
Yes!

25
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:23,917
Kang Jinhyun.

26
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,001
Yes!

27
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,922
Park Hyunsoo.

28
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,716
Park Hyunsoo!

29
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,342
Yes!

30
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,763
Hyunsoo, what are you looking at?

31
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,431
Hm? Nothing.

32
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,601
Hey!

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,561
Oh, your mock exam results!

34
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,813
Hey, stop it!

35
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,147
You got top marks in Korean History!

36
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,857
- Give it back!
- Perfect score!

37
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,984
You got top marks in Korean too?

38
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,319
Well, just barely—

39
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,362
Ah...

40
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,116
Hyunsoo, are you okay?

41
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,827
Ah… you think this is funny?

42
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,330
No, I was just joking around...

43
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,044
Hyunsoo!

44
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,340
There’s an empty seat.

45
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,175
Guess Hyunsoo didn’t come today...

46
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,885
Is he feeling sick?

47
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,180
Guys, taking care of your health is part of your skill set too.

48
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,849
We don’t have much time left,

49
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,559
so take good care of yourselves.

50
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,563
Where did we stop yesterday, number 23? Or...

51
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,898
Ah, number 24—let’s take a look at that one.

52
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:29,816
Yes, sir.

53
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:30,775
Yes.

54
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:35,905
Who is it?

55
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,157
Seongyoon?

56
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,285
Hyunsoo, are you okay?

57
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,453
How did you even find this place...?

58
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,290
Hyunsoo, here—

59
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,167
It’s porridge, good for your stomach. Eat some.

60
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,501
Porridge?

61
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,214
Your face is all red!

62
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,136
And you’ve got a fever too.

63
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,682
I’ll heat up the porridge for you. Come on.

64
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,072
I’ll do it.

65
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,242
Hyunsoo, just lie down.

66
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,703
Mm… I’ll eat by myself.

67
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,246
You never do, though.

68
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,836
See? You threw it out again.

69
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,590
My stomach’s just a bit upset...

70
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,800
It’s okay.

71
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,054
Still, you have to finish your porridge.

72
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,604
Hyunsoo, the porridge is ready!

73
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,243
You look so gentle when your eyes are closed,

74
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,162
but you’re so prickly when you’re awake...

75
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,477
The porridge is done.

76
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,270
I’ll get going now.

77
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,960
Whoa! Even the porridge is sweet.

78
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,136
Not bad.

79
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:12,729
Hyunsoo!

80
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,231
Are you feeling better?

81
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,066
Yeah, thanks to you!

82
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,317
That’s a relief.

83
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,612
Thanks for the porridge.

84
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,323
What? You actually know how to say thank you?

85
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,118
Sorry, I was a bit sensitive.

86
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,911
Why are you sorry?

87
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,664
My mock exam scores dropped a bit...

88
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,129
Smoking’s bad for you anyway.

89
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,756
Instead of smoking,

90
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:40,923
have this.

91
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,427
If you don’t like that one, pick something else.

92
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,679
No,

93
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,014
it’s fine now.

94
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,265
Huh?

95
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,394
I mean the sweets.

96
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,446
What are you two doing here?

97
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,698
We were eating something sweet!

98
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,248
KISS KISS SXX
