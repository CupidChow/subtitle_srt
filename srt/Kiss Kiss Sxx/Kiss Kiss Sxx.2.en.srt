1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,254
Raise Me? [2/2]

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,716
I’ve never seen it bloom in seven years,

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,301
but now, thanks to you, it has.

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,220
You raised it so well.

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,889
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,900
The photo doesn’t do it justice.

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,862
It’s much prettier in person...

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,573
Would you like to come see it?

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,540
Wait!

10
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,155
Sorry for keeping you waiting!

11
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,072
Oh, not at all.

12
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,699
I just came early.

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,910
Come on in!

14
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,620
Thanks for inviting me.

15
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:24,709
Ah!

16
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,379
Are you okay?

17
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:29,964
Yeah, I’m fine.

18
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,382
Want me to blow on it?

19
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,802
No, really, it’s fine.

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,095
Sorry.

21
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,223
I kind of burned the pancakes...

22
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,601
I’m still new to living alone, so I’m not good at cooking.

23
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,978
But pancakes are my specialty!

24
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,731
Oh, well...

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,776
Even restaurants that serve one dish are the best, right?

26
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,452
Do I have something on me?

27
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,830
There, it’s gone.

28
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:02,914
Ah...

29
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,624
Oh?

30
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,924
Wow, it really bloomed.

31
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,052
Amazing.

32
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,637
Right?

33
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:18,888
Isn’t it lovely?

34
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,517
It’s not easy for it to adjust like that.

35
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,227
Exactly.

36
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,730
Work, living alone... all of it.

37
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,402
Thank you.

38
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,487
Really.

39
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,408
I didn’t think you’d take such good care of it.

40
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,005
Mmm!

41
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,591
You’re really good at making pancakes.

42
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,259
Oh, thank goodness!

43
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,262
It’s been a while, so I wasn’t sure about the mix.

44
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,098
I was a bit nervous today, too.

45
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,850
Mmm, it’s really delicious!

46
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,277
Do I... have something on my face?

47
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,363
No, you just look nice.

48
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,241
You’re actually the first person I’ve invited over!

49
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,452
Didn’t you say it’s your first time living alone?

50
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,620
Yeah!

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,998
It feels so good to cook for someone at my place.

52
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,127
Now I get what they mean by “just seeing you makes me full.”

53
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,430
Since when was washing dishes this attractive?

54
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,726
What do you do with food waste?

55
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,519
I’ll take care of it.

56
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,313
You should rest now!

57
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,272
I’m fine.

58
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,779
Hey, you know what?

59
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,573
We...

60
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,951
don’t even know each other’s names.

61
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,328
Oh, wow.

62
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,082
Sorry for the late introduction.

63
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,877
I’m Jung Seokmin.

64
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,754
I’m Park Jaeho.

65
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,339
I’m twenty.

66
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,342
Ah, that explains it...

67
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,302
No wonder you’re so cute.

68
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,475
Are you...

69
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,686
a lightweight drinker?

70
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,646
Ah...

71
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,564
Yeah.

72
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,608
I can’t handle alcohol well.

73
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,777
People say I look like I can drink a lot...

74
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,488
But I have no idea why.

75
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,322
Hmm...

76
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,827
You’re really warm.

77
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,547
But you’re even warmer than me.

78
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,216
Can’t hold your liquor?

79
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,427
No.

80
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,806
Then why—?

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,850
Oh, it’s just...

82
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,063
At first, I only meant to drop the plant off.

83
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,692
But, you know...

84
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,236
I wanted to stay and have a drink with you.

85
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,247
Oh, it’s already ten.

86
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,207
Already?

87
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,920
I’d love to stay longer, but I should get going.

88
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,089
I have work tomorrow.

89
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,729
Um...

90
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,570
Would you... like to stay over?

91
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,493
I mean, your place isn’t far anyway...

92
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,162
You could just go in the morning.

93
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,290
We could spend a little more time together...

94
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,793
KISS KISS SXX
