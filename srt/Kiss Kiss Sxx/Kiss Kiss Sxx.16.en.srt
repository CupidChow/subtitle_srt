A Killer Recipe [2/2]

2
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,624
You still keep a diary…

3
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,806
As expected…

4
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,601
Warm things don’t suit me.

5
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,814
Jiwon…

6
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,444
You haven’t left yet?

7
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:18,990
What are you doing…

8
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,665
Uh… I mean…

9
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,467
You said it was your dying wish.

10
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,023
Who writes a will in their diary?

11
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,194
It was just in case…

12
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,279
If that knife went one centimeter deeper—

13
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,700
or hit an artery by mistake—

14
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,038
By now, I bet you’ve made yukgaejang instead of mille-feuille nabe.

15
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,499
Yukgaejang...?

16
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,750
I’m fine.

17
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,961
Do you know how many fever shots you took last night?

18
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,970
Just boil the broth and you’re done.

19
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,180
Take your medicine.

20
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,781
Was disappearing a year ago because of me?

21
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,163
Did they threaten you with my life?

22
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,042
Jiwon, listen—

23
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,168
Who asked you to protect me?

24
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,380
Who just gives in to threats like that?

25
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,299
Why risk your life for me?

26
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,592
Why would you?!

27
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,635
Because even for one day—

28
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,514
I wanted to live like a human being with you.

29
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,809
Couldn’t you have just told me?

30
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,686
We could’ve faced it together!

31
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,480
Why do you always decide everything alone?!

32
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,898
Why always you?!

33
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:20,903
I’ll—

34
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,447
I’ll explain everything.

35
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,908
So please…

36
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,458
let’s calm down first.

37
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,547
And I had no idea…

38
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,306
Do you know how much I cursed you for the past year?

39
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,561
I hoped you’d trip and break an arm.

40
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,481
I wished…

41
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,651
you’d just die.

42
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,697
I…

43
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,117
I…

44
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,069
Don’t ever disappear again.

45
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,488
Okay.

46
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,866
And no more secrets.

47
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:31,909
Okay.

48
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,215
I’m hungry.

49
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:56,976
Hot!

50
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,354
Ah… it’s been so long!

51
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,234
Finally, I feel alive again.

52
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,113
No way. Stop eating.

53
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,156
Why not?

54
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:12,825
Jiwon,

55
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,702
should we open a restaurant?

56
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:18,122
With what money? Thanks to you, I’m about to get fired.

57
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:19,290
Why?

58
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,250
Company policy.

59
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,713
Our VIP clients prefer privacy—no face-to-face contact.

60
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,256
Ah…

61
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,300
So that’s why you hid in the closet?

62
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,177
Don’t worry—

63
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,679
I’ve got plenty of danger pay saved up.

64
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:34,639
What?

65
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,766
Even after buying this house, I’ve got lots left.

66
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,309
Must be nice.

67
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,736
How about “The Killer’s Table”?

68
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,363
Killer’s?

69
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,491
Why plural?

70
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,119
You’re the housework killer,

71
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,664
and the only one who can kill me.

72
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,207
So, killers.

73
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,710
You’re unbelievable.

74
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,837
What? It’s true!

75
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,216
Fine then—

76
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,135
I’ll kill you today!

77
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,763
How you gonna do that, huh?

78
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,973
How?

79
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,057
Go on, try.

80
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,725
Ahh!

81
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,310
You okay?

82
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:22,812
Why?

83
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,938
You’re faking it!

84
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,648
I’m not!

85
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,616
Hyung, how did you even know about my company?

86
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,452
Saw an ad on the street.

87
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,163
So you knew I worked here?

88
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,957
Not exactly…

89
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,875
But I hoped I might.

90
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,794
Fate, huh?

91
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,671
Yeah. Fate.

92
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,110
KISS KISS SXX
