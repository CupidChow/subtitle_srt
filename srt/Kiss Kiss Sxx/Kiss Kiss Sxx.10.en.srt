00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Craving You [2/2]

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,224
Yes, I’ll take care of Eunji’s schedule myself.

3
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,601
Jaehyung, please head to her house first.

4
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,186
Ah… I’m sorry.

5
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,856
Jeha insisted on filming even though he lost his voice…

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,234
How long was she out in the rain?

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,863
They kept shooting before she even dried off.

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,824
No, it’s my fault.

9
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,285
It’s not your fault either.

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,579
We barely managed to fit the ad shoot in.

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,666
She was so stubborn about not postponing it, so I called the director.

12
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,504
Just make sure Eunji’s schedule wraps up smoothly.

13
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,426
Still hates bothering others, just like before…

14
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,067
No way…

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,114
Jeha.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,242
Shim Jeha!

17
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,667
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,421
You knew the passcode.

19
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,428
How could you film in that condition?

20
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,433
Did you take your medicine?

21
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,435
You’re not my manager anymore.

22
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:45,647
Leave.

23
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:47,857
Go.

24
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,818
Do you know how hard I worked to land that ad?

25
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,487
Listen to me.

26
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,329
Why do you even care?

27
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,376
Then why are you pushing yourself like this?

28
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,880
You think I’m doing this because I want to?

29
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,468
You think the company can’t adjust your schedule for you?

30
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,680
I have to work.

31
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,517
That’s the only way…

32
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,522
I can hold myself together.

33
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,152
Jeha.

34
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,496
Don’t worry about me. Just go.

35
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,626
Jeha!

36
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,794
Shim Jeha!

37
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,942
Do you know how hard it’s been holding myself back?

38
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,739
Why did you hide it from me?

39
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,131
I’m right here.

40
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,094
I’m not going anywhere.

41
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,847
I’ll get your medicine.

42
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,912
I don’t think he can shoot today.

43
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:15,213
He won’t go to the hospital, but please let the crew know.

44
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,132
Yes, I’ll call once he wakes up.

45
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:20,969
Okay.

46
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,112
Take your medicine and rest.

47
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,281
You need to bring your fever down.

48
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,620
Water…

49
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,743
Why are you hesitating?

50
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,664
If you’re gonna do it, do it right.

51
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,584
Jeha.

52
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,925
I’m not stupid—I know exactly what you’re thinking.

53
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,848
I’m not gonna ask you to be with me or anything like that.

54
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,360
I’m not good for you.

55
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,740
Did I ever ask you to be?

56
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,204
I’ll handle my feelings myself.

57
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,005
You just…

58
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,467
Stay by my side.

59
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,309
Can you do that for me?

60
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,652
How could I ever win against you?

61
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,216
They said they’re ready, so we can head out.

62
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,884
Yeah, let’s go.

63
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,239
KISS KISS SXX
