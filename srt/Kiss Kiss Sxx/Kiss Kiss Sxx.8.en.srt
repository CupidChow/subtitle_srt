00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,087
Sleep Around, Still Mine [2/2]

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,715
We’re already over.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,634
Did you forget what you did to me?

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,137
It was a mistake. It’ll never happen again.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,263
I...

6
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,849
I really have no one but you.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,308
You still love me.

8
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,811
I can see it even if you deny it.

9
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,980
That’s why you came running when I said I’d come.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,356
That’s...

11
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:30,905
Hajun!

12
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,078
Where are you going?

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,205
Who the hell is that guy?

14
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,206
Don’t tell me...

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,126
You’re seeing another guy behind my back again?

16
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,045
Oh, for god’s sake, stop it!

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,007
You think you saw me with another guy?

18
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:49,841
Didn’t you?

19
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,136
Just admit it—you’ve been with someone else, haven’t you?!

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,597
You didn’t even see it yourself, did you?

21
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,351
You know I’d never meet anyone else. You know you’re the only one for me!

22
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:02,729
It wasn’t me.

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,148
I said it wasn’t me! How many times do I have to tell you?!

24
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,401
Then why’ve you been so hard to reach lately?

25
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,986
Why’ve you been coming home late?!

26
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,864
You think I’m doing this because of what someone else told me?

27
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:13,823
Huh?!

28
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,492
I told you I was busy!

29
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,119
I said I’ve been busy with work at the bar!

30
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,622
And I’m supposed to believe that?

31
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,623
Hey.

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,751
If you’re gonna lie, at least make it sound believable.

33
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,506
You’re not even listening to a word I’m saying, are you?

34
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,257
Hey, let’s just stop.

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,676
I’m so tired of this same fight.

36
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,055
Stop it.

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,558
You should be begging right now, not yelling!

38
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,687
Let’s just break up.

39
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,023
It’s over.

40
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,861
No.

41
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,446
I’m not breaking up with you.

42
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,782
You think I’ll let you go that easily?

43
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,536
Let go of me.

44
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,124
Are you really doubting me again?

45
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,460
We’re already done, you and me.

46
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,379
And...

47
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,966
If you ever talk about Hajun like that again...

48
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,510
you’ll regret it.

49
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,144
Hajun...

50
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,815
Seo Hajun, open the door!

51
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,528
It’s all a misunderstanding, I can explain! Please open the door!

52
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:36,990
Hajun!

53
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:40,952
Seo Hajun!

54
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,539
I shouldn’t have fallen for you.

55
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,667
I shouldn’t have expected anything.

56
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,836
We’re just...

57
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,464
partners, that’s all.

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,802
Then why does it hurt so much?

59
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,571
Sunwoo.

60
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,158
Everything was a first for me.

61
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,911
Sleeping with someone I’d just met...

62
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,497
having a purely physical partner...

63
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,250
having someone become the model for my art.

64
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,754
But I think I was glad it was you.

65
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,759
I want to stay longer within the rules you made.

66
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,598
I want to be where your hands touch and where your eyes fall.

67
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,227
So... I’ll be in your care from now on.

68
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,073
I had a good time today. Get home safe!

69
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,134
Hajun, open the door.

70
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,345
Seo Hajun!

71
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,194
There’s nothing left to say between us.

72
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,406
There is. Why haven’t you been answering me?

73
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,782
I’ve been busy.

74
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,868
Who was that guy earlier?

75
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,037
Does it even matter who he was?

76
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,747
Did you forget already?

77
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,208
The first rule you made.

78
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,545
Don’t ask about each other’s private lives.

79
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,088
That damn rule...

80
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,340
It doesn’t matter anymore.

81
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,594
It matters to me.

82
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,557
Because of you, I learned something.

83
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,312
Relationships should be clean and clear.

84
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,232
So as I learned...

85
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,360
I’m cleaning you out of my life completely.

86
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:22,947
I...

87
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,117
I was a fool.

88
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,787
I was a coward, and I was stupid.

89
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,544
I was just too scared of getting hurt again to be honest with you.

90
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:42,258
Do you know what it was like for me to stay by your side?

91
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:46,262
Even inside those damn rules, I was happy just being near you.

92
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,015
Even though I knew it would destroy me.

93
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,101
Do you know how hard that was?

94
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,144
I know.

95
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,521
I know how you feel.

96
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,608
- I understand now.
- No, you don’t!

97
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,693
I should’ve told you sooner.

98
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,114
At the bar, I should’ve pushed that guy away and run straight to you.

99
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,575
I’m sorry.

100
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,453
I’m sorry, Hajun.

101
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,502
This relationship you made...

102
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,339
and the rules you made...

103
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,551
You acted like they could never be broken.

104
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,262
I just...

105
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,517
don’t want to get hurt like you did.

106
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,626
From now on...

107
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,795
I’ll take responsibility.

108
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,131
For us.

109
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,508
For those damn rules.

110
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,761
I’ll break them all.

111
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,600
I’ll stay by your side now, so please...

112
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,729
Please look at me, Hajun.

113
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,736
You really know how to make people weak.

114
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,193
Didn’t you say you’re a light sleeper?

115
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,987
I’ve been watching you this whole time.

116
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,449
Yeah...

117
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,661
Guess I sleep better next to you.

118
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,372
You talk...

119
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,376
But who was that guy yesterday, really?

120
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,045
That guy?

121
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,090
Ah...

122
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,303
He’s my middle school friend.

123
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,640
He came to congratulate me on finishing my series.

124
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,643
Congrats on finishing it.

125
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,271
If you ever need a model again, just tell me.

126
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,024
You said “anytime,” right?

127
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,070
I...

128
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,073
have something to ask.

129
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,199
Something to ask?

130
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:54,909
We...

131
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,287
what are we?

132
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,588
Well...

133
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,132
You set the rules this time.

134
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,594
So, what are we now?

135
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,939
KISS KISS SXX
