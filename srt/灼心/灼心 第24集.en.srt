175
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,680
Why do I always lose to you?

176
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,410
Qin Ziyu,

177
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,920
you didn't lose to me.

178
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,160
Let Yan go.

179
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,010
We can settle the scores

180
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,780
between us.

181
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,580
Don't move!

182
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,680
Okay.

183
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,420
You hate me, right?

184
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,960
You want to kill me, right?

185
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,680
Let Yan go,

186
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,090
and you can have my life!

187
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,890
Qin Ziyu!

188
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,160
Gu Jingyuan is not

189
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,080
Qin Mian's biological son!

190
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,720
You are!

191
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

192
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,250
I have proof.

193
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,640
Hello? Yes.

194
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,640
Hello.

195
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
I want to report a case.

196
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,760
There's a kidnapping
in the suburban villa district.

197
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,480
Hurry up!

198
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,280
Look.

199
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,650
[DNA Comparison Between Salivary Samples
of Qin Mian and Qin Ziyu]

200
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,760
[Test result]

201
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,570
[The probability is 99.9249%]

202
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,950
Qin Mian married into the Song family

203
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,750
for money,

204
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,240
but he found out his lover was pregnant.

205
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,410
So he figured

206
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,690
if the two babies were the same gender,

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
he could swap them

208
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,490
and raise his biological child

209
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,320
by his side.

210
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,880
So,

211
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,120
Song Xinyue is my mother.

212
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,200
No.

213
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,410
That's impossible.

214
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,650
Qiao Yan,

215
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,010
don't think you can trick me

216
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,360
with a made-up story.

217
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,850
I want it to be a lie more than you do.

218
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,540
That is what you've wanted
your entire life,

219
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,100
but it would hurt Jingyuan again.

220
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,240
You took over

221
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,280
his place.

222
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,840
In your place,

223
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,260
he had been abused and abandoned,

224
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,740
always living in pain.

225
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,440
I found the letter

226
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,300
you hid behind the rose painting.

227
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,530
Qin Mian said

228
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,810
he knew you ordered Feng

229
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,000
to kill my parents long ago.

230
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,780
[If anything happens to me,
I'll leave Qin's to you]

231
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,280
He also said
you were his most beloved son.

232
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,410
[I saw what you hid]

233
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,920
[Forget everything you've done]

234
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,760
Actually,

235
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,730
[I'll take all the responsibility for you]

236
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,750
he already told you back then

237
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,730
[Don't avenge me. Remember to be patient]

238
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,370
you are his biological son.

239
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,920
Everything I have now

240
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,250
will all be yours in the future.

241
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,520
Remember,

242
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,080
everything I'm doing now

243
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
is all for you.

244
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,920
So I'm my dad's biological son.

245
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,400
Dad.

246
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,810
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

247
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,220
If you had told me earlier,

248
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,560
I wouldn't have gone

249
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,640
this far.

250
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,680
Are you okay?

251
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,120
Yan.

252
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,600
Mom is not my mother.

253
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,680
Then who is my mother?

254
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,320
Who truly loves me?

255
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,040
Who?

256
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,040
Qin Ziyu.

257
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,760
Qin Ziyu, calm down!

258
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,840
There's no turning back.

259
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,930
I'll just take you to the grave with me.

260
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,050
Gu Jingyuan,

261
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
you are my mother's biological son.

262
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,440
If you die here,

263
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,370
my mother would probably be happy.

264
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,610
Qin Ziyu.

265
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,400
Qin Ziyu!

266
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,720
Song Xinyue already knew the truth

267
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,880
before she died.

268
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,120
She came to the welfare house for me.

269
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,570
She asked me
if I wanted to go home with her.

270
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,330
But she also said...

271
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,520
Yuan.

272
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,480
I...

273
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,300
already have a son.

274
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,760
Um, he's about your age.

275
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,360
If I suddenly bring you home,

276
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:04,960
when

277
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,160
he sees you,

278
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,780
he might feel like he's being abandoned.

279
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,640
Wait for me.

280
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,130
Let me think about how to explain to him

281
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,800
that he has an older brother.

282
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,370
Then I'll come take you home, okay?

283
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,520
But before

284
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,300
she could arrange all of this,

285
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,460
she died suddenly.

286
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,160
She knew you weren't her biological son,

287
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,520
but she still loved you.

288
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,650
Qin Ziyu,

289
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,920
before Luo Qian died,

290
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,480
she called your name.

291
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,170
Although she and Qin Mian did that,

292
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,160
they always protected you,

293
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,000
just to make sure you can live well.

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,930
Every one of them

295
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,160
loved you in their own way!

296
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,580
So you already got
everything you want long ago!

297
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,640
It's too late.

298
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,080
Qin Ziyu!

299
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,610
Gu Jingyuan!

300
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,000
Hurry!

301
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,240
The suspect is inside!

302
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,760
Stretcher.

303
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,240
Keep up!

304
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,040
Jingyuan.

305
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,520
Yan.

306
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,640
Yan!

307
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,920
Jingyuan.

308
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,560
Boss!

309
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,880
Get him on the stretcher!

310
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,440
Boss!

311
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,240
Hurry!

312
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Are you okay, Yan?

313
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,079
Be careful.

314
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,480
Hurry!

315
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
It's been so long.

316
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,920
Why hasn't Boss come out yet?

317
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,130
I don't know.

318
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,160
There.

319
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,240
Doctor.

320
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,410
How is he?

321
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,600
The patient's injuries are severe.

322
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
Acute hemorrhagic shock

323
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,920
has led
to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

324
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,580
We've done everything we can,

325
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,560
but his condition is critical.

326
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,440
He cannot regain consciousness for now.

327
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,970
Maybe...

328
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,460
he'll remain in a coma indefinitely.

329
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,120
I know

330
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,600
you won't leave me alone,

331
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,680
right?

332
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,400
I'll stay here,

333
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,500
waiting for you to wake up.

334
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,680
Jingyuan.

335
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,480
Yan...

336
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,680
won't eat anything

337
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,200
or go back with us.

338
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,740
If this continues,

339
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,810
I'm afraid she'll collapse first.

340
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,320
What exactly happened?

341
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,400
Who did Boss and Miss Qiao Yan

342
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,860
offend to end up like this?

343
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,960
Stop crying.

344
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,980
At a time like this,

345
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,040
we should be even stronger.

346
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,300
Otherwise,

347
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,380
