Don't act unusual at all.

I'm worried he might harm you.

You rose from the misfortune
of losing your parents

I guess

No, I didn't.

91
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,960
Is there any secret in Mr. Qin's studio?

92

I have no idea either.

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,000
He never allows anyone
to enter the studio.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,120
I was just wondering

95
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,050

96

Don't mention it.

169

Scum like that deserved
to be taught a lesson.

170

Actually, my mom

171
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,960
was already pregnant with me

172
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,780

you should have another child

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,530
Qin Mian.

350
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,260
You never let go of your hatred for the Gu family.

351
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,800
You resented my brother

352
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,400
for taking away your former lover, Qiao Yuling.

353
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,800
So you ordered Feng
to cause an car accident

354
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,360
to kill them mercilessly.

355
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,600
Nonsense!

356
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,530
That's all just your speculation.

357
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,850
I didn't tell the police

358
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,660
that you ordered me
to cause the car accident

359
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,420
to kill Gu Hai and Qiao Yuling.

360
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,400
You've been working for me
for so many years.

361
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Thank you so much.

362
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,880
Take these things...

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,440
Dad.

364
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,440
This must be a misunderstanding.

365
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,400
Explain to them!

366
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,440
I

367
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,160
killed them.

368
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,930
Qin Mian.

369
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,640
You're a suspect in a murder case.

370
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,570
Please go with us

371
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,930
for investigation.

372
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,520
Qin Mian.

373
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,760
If you hate the Gu family,
you could have targeted me.

374
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,020
Why did you kill Gu Hai?

375
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,560
He had cut ties with me for over 20 years.

376
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,720
He deserved a better ending.

377
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Gu Hai was your only biological son,

378
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,900
with Gu family blood running through his veins.

379
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,240
Shouldn't the debts of the Gu family

380
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
be paid by him?

381
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,320
You...

382
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,920
And he stole my Yuling from me.

383
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,780
He deserved to die!

384
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,680
Shut up!

385
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,400
Yan.

386
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,520
You have no right to say my mother's name.

387
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,240
My mom

388
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,720
and my dad

389
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,720
loved each other deeply.

390
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
We were a happy family.

391
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,760
My mom never mentioned you.

392
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,880
Yuling and I were in love.

393
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,800
We just had a small disagreement

394
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,100
and parted for a while.

395
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,400
Gu Hai took advantage of the situation

396
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
and took her away,

397
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,720
making it impossible for me to find her.

398
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,980
Gu Hai deserved to die!

399
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,320
The reason for
the so-called small disagreement

400
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,800
was that you wanted to marry Song Xinyue

401
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,930
for the Song family's fortune, right?

402
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,850
Qin Mian.

403
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,040
It was you who made that choice.

404
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,840
Why did you have to blame others?

405
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,770
That's not true,

406
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,380
I loved Yuling.

407
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,800
You can only

408
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,880
use your fake love to deceive yourself.

409
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,690
Even saying those words

410
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,400
is insulting my mom!

411
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,920
You loved her?

412
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,250
Then how could you kill her?

413
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,440
You don't love anyone!

414
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,120
You're just a lunatic!

415
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,320
Qin Mian.

416
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,000
Take your hypocritical and dirty love
with you

417
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,370
and spend the rest of your life
atoning for your sins.

418
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,560
Dad.

419
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,240
Did you

420
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,520
never truly love my mother?

421
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,440
What about me?

422
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,480
I failed her.

423
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,680
Ziyu.

424
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,730
The Qin's from now on

425
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,400
will depend entirely on you.

426
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
You must remember

427
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,160
what I told you before.

428
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,240
Live well.

429
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:29,840
Go.

430
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:30,840
Dad.

431
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,080
Dad!

432
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Dad!

433
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,860
It's okay now, Yan.

434
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,050
I'm here.

435
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,980
It's all right now.

436
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:54,410
[Xijiang]
[In Memory of My Son Gu Hai,
and My Daughter-in-law Qiao Yuling]

437
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,720
Dad.

438
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,280
Mom.

439
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,380
The real murderer who killed you
has been found.

440
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,720
You can rest in peace now.

441
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,240
After all,

442
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,840
this is the karma I created.

443
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,480
Hai.

444
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,600
Yuling.

445
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,880
I failed you.

446
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:20,960
Dad.

447
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,640
Yan.

448
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,200
It's good that Qin Mian has been arrested.

449
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,160
Don't be too sad.

450
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,760
Take care.

451
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,160
Yan!

452
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,520
Yan!

453
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,000
Yan!

454
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,360
Yan!

455
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:34,920
Yan!

456
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,600
Hurry.

457
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh no.

458
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,440
Dad.

459
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,170
Grandpa.

460
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,280
Uncle.

461
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,210
Don't leave.

462
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,810
I'm here.

463
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,140
Your uncle is here.

464
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,730
Don't be afraid.

465
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,520
The doctor said you had caught a cold

466
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,980
and that's why you had a fever
and collapsed.

467
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,200
Would you like something to eat?

468
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,570
Here.

469
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,040
It's okay.

470
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,040
Don't cry.

471
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,160
Okay?

472
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,580
Have something to eat.

473
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,200
When I was sick in the past,

474
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,240
my mom would always stay with me,

475
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,460
and my dad would make
all kinds of delicious food for me.

476
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,280
So

477
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,880
I actually used to

478
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,440
kind of enjoy being sick.

479
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,720
Because

480
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,840
when I was sick,

481
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,160
I didn't have to go to school,

482
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,920
and I could stay home

483
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,580
and be pampered by my parents.

484
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,160
Uncle.

485
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,680
I miss them so much.

486
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,920
Yan.

487
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,280
stop crying, okay?

488
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,810
Stop crying.

489
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,940

Yan was missing her parents,

523
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,970
so I was comforting her.

524
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,530
Good.

525
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,560
Hmm.

526
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,000
Yan.

527
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,370
How are you feeling?

528
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,360
Should we

529
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,560
have a doctor check on you again?

530
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,640
No need.

531
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm feeling much better now,

532
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,480
I just need some more rest.

533
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,200
Your uncle has been with you all day.

534
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,450
Let me keep you company now.

535
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,000
Jingyuan.

536
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,850
Yes, Dad.

537
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,920
Go back now

538
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,480
and

539
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,050
ask Yue to come here.

540
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,600
Tonight,

541
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,840
she can stay with Yan overnight.

542
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,120
Okay.

543
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,200
All right.

544
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,740
Drink your porridge later

545
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,680
and take the medicine.
