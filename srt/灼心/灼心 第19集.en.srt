[Episode 19]

3
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,930
You two are married,

4
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,730
yet he is not telling you anything.

5
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,289
It seems like

6
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,000
he doesn't trust you that much.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,280
He clearly doesn't think

8
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,410
you are worthy of standing by his side.

[Yan]

10
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,650
By Grandpa's birthday,

11
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,850
I hope you'll have made a decision.

12
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,240
If you don't want me

13
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,880
to face everything with you,

14
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,240
maybe

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,960
we should

16
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,690
reconsider our relationship.

17
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,079
Take off the pink one.

18
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,360
Change to another one.

19
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,800
This one.

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,079
Oh.

21
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,760
It's hard to get if off once it's on.

22
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,820
Change to this one.

23
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,360
Yan.

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,120
That's enough.

25
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
No, Grandpa.

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Today is the first birthday

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,640
after we got married.

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,480
Otherwise, you'll say that

29
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,680
I forget about you once I have a husband.

30
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,079
Jingyuan.

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,440
Did you hear that?

32
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,040
You should handle your wife.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,240
Dad.

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,080
Yan.

35
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,280
I have something to tell you.

36
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,200
I…

37
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,040
I’m Qin Mian’s son.

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,530
What did you say?

39
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
You are Qin Mian’s son?

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,720
I'm not going to marry a murderer's son.

41
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,450
Gu Jingyuan,

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,610
I want a divorce.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,440
You have nothing to do with the Gu family.

44
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,680
Yan.

45
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,520
Dad!

46
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,680
Yan!

47
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,680
Yan!

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Yan!

49
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Look how fast I am.

50
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,570
Are you going to do this all day?

51
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,360
Mr. Gu.

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,410
You look so busy.

53
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,880
Mr. Gu.

54
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,010
Grandpa!

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,080
Uh...

56
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm going out.

57
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
I'll be back soon.

58
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,600
Hey.

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,520
I'll get the car.

60
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,200
Wait for me.

61
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,720
No need.

62
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,480
You

63
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,440
help Yan.

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,050
Grandpa.

65
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,560
Let Uncle Xu go with you.

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,800
I feel better knowing he's going with you.

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,159
I'm not a kid.

68
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,780
I'll be right back.

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,280
Okay?

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,280
Wait.

71
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,450
And you say you're not a kid?

72
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,840
You forgot the medicine.

73
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,250
Grandpa,

74
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
come back early today.

75
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,760
We'll celebrate your birthday with you.

76
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,220
Grandpa is the lead today.

77
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,640
Okay.

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,960
Thank you.

79
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,490
Come back early.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,730
You found it?

81
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,120
Yes.

82
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,280
Miss Qiao Yan had a fight with Jingyuan.

83
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,680
Maybe it's related to Qin Ziyu.

84
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,680
Qin Ziyu?

85
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,080
He seems to like Miss Qiao Yan.

86
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,810
Chairman Gu.

87
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,580
Why did you ask me to come here?

88
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,160
What?

89
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,940
Are you scared?

90
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,040
I know.

91
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,400
I can't repay no matter what I do.

92
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,720
But I sincerely

93
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,480
want to repent for my dad.

94
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,400
As long as you and Qiao Yan want it,

95
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
I can do anything.

96
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,360
Fine.

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,640
Now,

98
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
swear in front of Yan's parents

99
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,370
that you will stay away from her

100
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,850
and stop pestering her.

101
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,409
I don't understand.

102
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,090
What do you mean?

103
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,880
Qin Ziyu.

104
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,080
Don't play dumb with me.

105
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,520
You know best about

106
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,170
your true feelings for Yan.

107
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:08,880
Yes.

108
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,200
I like Qiao Yan.

109
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,320
Although my dad did something wrong,

110
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,880
I really like her.

111
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,400
I never hurt her.

112
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,880
She's married.

113
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,680
She likes Jingyuan now.

114
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Your father

115
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,640
caused a disaster

116
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,500
because of his stubbornness.

117
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,500
I hope this tragedy will never happen again.

118
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,720
If you want to protect the Qin's,

119
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,960
stay away

120
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,330
from Yan.

121
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,370
Are you threatening me?

122
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
I’ve been out of business for years.

123
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,810
But I, Gu Changfeng,

124
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,480
am not an ordinary man.

125
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,760
Don't force me to go after the Qin's,

126
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,659
including your father

127
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,080
who's serving time in prison.

128
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,520
How dare you touch my father?

129
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,960
Why not?

130
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,040
For my children,

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,120
I can do anything.

132
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,660
Gu Jingyuan

133
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,010
is just a bastard, isn't he?

134
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,840
Why are you protecting him?

135
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,640
Who are you to call him a bastard?

136
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,840
What?

137
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,159
Song Xinyue found you a good father.

138
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,480
You don't know

139
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,200
where you came from?

140
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
Don't say that about my mom.

141
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,600
You have no right to talk to me like that.

142
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,800
Remember.

143
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,360
The Qin family

144
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,680
owes Gu family two lives.

145
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,490
You should know your place.

146
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,360
Stop dreaming about

147
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,760
things that don't belong to you.

148
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,460
Otherwise,

149
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I'll ask you to pay

150
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,920
for this blood debt.

151
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,860
What are you doing?

152
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,960
You are really protecting Gu Jingyuan.

153
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,220
Do you know who his biological father is?

154
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,760
He's the one

155
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,130
who owes the Gu family blood debts.

156
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,530
In that case,

157
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,760
I should call him brother.

158
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,010
What are you talking about?

159
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,920
My dad

160
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,880
met a waiter in the ballroom.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,460
He just wanted to have fun.

162
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,490
But she was pregnant

163
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,340
and insisted on giving birth to the baby.

164
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,760
My dad would never accept

165
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,400
a bastard like that.

166
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,580
Unexpectedly,

167
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,020
he was adopted by the Gu family

168
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,610
and became your family.

169
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,120
Isn't this funny?

170
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,740
Do you think

171
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,060
I would believe

172
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,720
your nonsense?

173
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,850
Why don't you

174
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,000
ask that good son of yours?

175
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,360
If what I said is true,

176
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
then he has a share

177
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,840
in this blood debt.

178
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
Even if Jingyuan is Qin Mian’s son,

179
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,000
he is still one of the Gu family.

180
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,000
Don't you hate my father so much?

181
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,300
Why don't you hate his son?

182
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,340
Those who share

183
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,960
the same blood

184
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,170
can only be related.

185
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,040
To truly become a family,

186
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,170
it's what's here that matters.

187
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
These things are something

188
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,800
you and Qin Mian

189
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,280
don't understand.

190
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,400
Actually,
my dad killed Gu Hai and Qiao Yuling

191
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,000
and stole Qiao Yan's model.

192
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,600
He did it all to help Gu Jingyuan

193
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,560
inherit the Gu's Group in the future.

194
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,520
Gu Jingyuan is well aware of all this

195
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,280
but still kept it from everyone.

196
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,210
He had you marry Qiao Yan off to him.

197
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
After what he did,

198
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,120
would you still let him be your family?

199
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,720
The model.

200
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,880
You...

201
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,240
How do you know about that model?

202
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,160
Tell me.

203
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,840
How do you know about that model?

204
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,000
You...

205
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,240
Yan.

206
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,840
I'll tell you

207
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,320
everything tonight.

208
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,140
Wait for me.

209
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,900
What are you doing?

210
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
I want to see Luo Qian.

211
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
Since Mr. Qin didn't tell me otherwise,

212
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
I can't let you in.

213
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,320
Wait.

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,600
Let him in.

215
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,660
Well...

216
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,440
I'll tell Qin Ziyu.

217
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,200
Fine.

218
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,760
Please.

219
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,560
-I’m looking for my son.
-Come down! It's dangerous!

220
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,560
How come this happened?

221
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,600
What's going on?

222
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,160
I went to do some cleaning.

223
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,240
She was clearly asleep,

224
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,680
but in the blink of an eye, she was gone.

225
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,160
C-Come down.

226
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,240
I want to find my son.

227
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
What should we do?

228
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,370
It's too dangerous.

229
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,360
I want to find my son.

230
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,560
Hurry.

231
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,880
Auntie, come down!

232
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,560
Watch out!

233
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,600
I want to find my son.

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,600

235
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,160
Ms. Luo.

Come down.

237
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,680
-Yes, Ms. Luo. Come down.
-I want my son.

238
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,360
Come down!

Mom.

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,720
Mom, what's wrong?

Mom, it's okay.

It's okay, Mom.

258

It's okay.

Uncle Xu.

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,130
where grandpa might go?

264
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
He didn't tell me.

265
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,220
I-I'll call him again.

266

in the garden.

272

where Mr. Gu went.

Slow down.

Slow down.

A patient named Gu Changfeng

Mr. Gu had a heart attack.

According to the rescue records,

299

he wasn't found until two hours

300

00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,580
What are you doing?

354
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,360
Qiao Yan.

355
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,280
I’m sorry.

356
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,260
I just want to pay my respects
to Chairman Gu.

357
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,540
I’d better go back.

358
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,440
Thank you.

359
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,530
Qin Ziyu.

360
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,240
Tell me.

361
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,360
How do you know about that model?

362
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
Give me the medicine.

363
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,800
Give me the medicine.

364
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,640
Give it to me.

365
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,280
Gu Changfeng,

366
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,600
you can only blame yourself

367
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,440
for adopting Gu Jingyuan.

368
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,210
Qiao Yan.

369
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,690
I’m sorry for your loss.

370
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,880
Take care.

371
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,880
We're all worried about you.

372
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,880
If you

373
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
need anything,

374
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,770
you can come to me

375
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
anytime.

376
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,930
Gu Jingyuan.

377
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,620
How long are you going to keep doing this?

378
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:57,960
Yan.

379
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,720
Can't you let grandpa

380
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,960
leave in peace?

381
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,500
Thank you for sending grandpa off today.

382
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,800
You should go.

383
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,120
Okay.

384
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,180
[In Memory of Mr. Gu Changfeng]

385
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,420
You got beaten?

386
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,820
If it weren’t for Qiao Yan,

387
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,690
I wouldn’t have tolerated him.

388
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,160
I can't help but feel you actually

389
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,080
have some feelings for Qiao Yan?

390
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,880
What’s so good about Qiao Yan?

391
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,640
You all

392
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,840
fall in love with her.

393
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,160
Qiao Yan is good.

394
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,420
More importantly,

395
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,100
she was taken away by Gu Jingyuan.

396
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,680
So I must get her back.

397
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,740
Don't you think so?

398
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,640
You are crazy.

399
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,240
Same to you.

400
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,140
Since you're here,

401
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,940
aren't you going to see Mr. Gu off?

402
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,600
The former Director Lu

403
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,640
from Gu's Group.

404
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,610
Do you want me to end up like you?

405
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,260
What you asked for.

406
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,610
[Wang Jingchao's Seal]
[Tang Xizhong's Seal]

407
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
How did you get it?

408
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,610
I helped Yuan

409
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,220
pick up Luo Qian from the sanatorium.

410
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,940
He started trusting me again,

411
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,860
thinking I was working for you as a spy

412
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,400
to help him deal with you.

413
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
I haven't settled this with you yet.

414
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
If I don't do this,

415
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,460
how can I get it for you?

416
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,690
Don't forget

417
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,160
what you promised me.

418
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,530
Don't worry.

419
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,290
I look forward to working with you.

420
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,170
Grandpa.

421
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,320
We're home.

422
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,400
Thank you.

423
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,170
Go back and rest.

424
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,560
Dad.

425
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,080
I'm sorry.

426
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,120
Yan.

427
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,260
I've got something to say.

428
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,450
Go ahead.

429
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,320
I kept avoiding you before

430
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
because I was too afraid to face you.

431
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,400
I was afraid that

432
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,680
after you find out the truth,

433
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,610
you will hate me.

434
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,200
What truth?

435
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,800
Yan.

436
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,880
I’m Qin Mian’s son.
