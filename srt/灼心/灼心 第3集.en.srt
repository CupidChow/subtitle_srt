Yan has been back for a long time.

10

Oh.

But

are you ready to face it?

Are you saying I might

38

I'm talking about that uncle of yours

The business world is a battlefield.

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,760
I'm worried that

51
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,080
in the future,

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,200
he won't want to hand over the company.

53
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,720
My uncle has indeed

54
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,920
made great contributions to the Gu's.

55

But after all,

Gu's Group belongs to my grandfather.

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,880
As long as my grandfather is here,

I'm not afraid of anything.

59

I have to start from the beginning.

90
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,600
I wonder if Miss Qiao is willing to start

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,930
from the bottom, working in sales?

92

this is inappropriate.

94

how will shareholders and partners

103

think of Gu's Group

104
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,640

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,840
You’re right.

165

I'm fear that kindness and love

I'm sorry.

526
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,520
I'll get you a doctor.

527
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,840
Why?

528
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,080
Why did you save me?

529
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,360
If I died,

530
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,160
no one will investigate you anymore.

531
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,860
That way, you'll have every right to
inherit the Gu family.

532
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,080
Qiao Yan.

533
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,960
I didn’t hurt your parents.

534
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,400
In fact, brother reached out to me

535
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,400
half a year before
your grandfather found you.

536
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,760
It was because

537
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,250
your mother was sick

538
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,210
and needed funds for medical care.

539
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,280
In the company,

540
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,840
Chen Shi and the others found the evidence

541
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,900
of me transferring assets overseas.

542
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,480
Actually, that was what I gave
for your mother's treatment.

543
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
When the accident happened to them,

544
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,090
I was in Germany.

545
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,920
Because your grandfather found you,

546
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,450
I went to see you in advance.

547
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,810
Brother.

548
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,400
Dad found you.

549
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,490
He'll come to Germany soon.

550
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,400
I know.

551
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,210
Don't worry.

552
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,400
I'll take Yuling and Yan away immediately.

553
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,800
No. No.

554
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,170
That's not what I meant.

555
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,840
I've always hoped that

556
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,770
you can return to the Gu family,

557
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,760
so that our family can be reunited.

558
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,720
I won't go back.

559
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,720
Jingyuan.

560
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,400
As you've seen, all these years,

561
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
our family has been living happily.

562
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,600
I don't want my wife and daughter

563
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,930
to return to the cage
that is the Gu family.

564
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,970
Brother.

565
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,970
It's been over 20 years.

566
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,540
Thank you for taking care of Chairman Gu.

567
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,680
You've fulfilled filial duty for me.

568
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
From now on, that family

569
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,820
depends on you.

570
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,200
But I

571
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,020
want to protect my family.

572
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,530
Tomorrow night,

573
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,260
we will leave Germany.

574
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,610
Hello, Brother.

575
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,810
I noticed someone is watching you.

576
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,820
But I don't know

577
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,680
if the Old Mr. Gu arranged it.

578
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,960
It doesn't matter.

579
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,020
No matter who it is,

580
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,000
when Yan is done with her competition,

581
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,240
we'll leave Germany tomorrow.

582
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,680
Okay.

583
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,480
Be careful.

584
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,280
At that time...

585
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,880
I'm sorry.

586
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,520
I followed him

587
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
to your school.

588
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,080
I saw you playing the violin.

589
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,970
Brother didn't want you to know
about Gu's Group,

590
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
so I had to pretend I didn't know you.

591
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,660
That person was asking around about you.

592
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,520
When the accident happened,

593
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,840
he was also at the scene.

594
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,400
Dad.

595
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,000
Dad.

596
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,680
Later,

597
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,620
he attacked you

598
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,440
and stole your model.

599
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,090
I was protecting you in secret,

600
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,240
yet I was still one step behind.

601
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,770
Qiao Yan.

602
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,440
Qiao Yan.

603
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,480
Dad suddenly got sick.

604
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,320
The company was in a mess,

605
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,140
so I had to come back to solve everything.

606
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,440
I figured that

607
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,890
after he got better,

608
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,180
I'd head to Germany and bring you back

609
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,260
once I wrapped up everything.

610
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,410
I didn't realize

611
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,820
it would lead to a misunderstanding.

612
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,050
Why didn't you explain it to me sooner?

613
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,320
At first, you were very guarded.

614
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,400
I was afraid that even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

615
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,600
I was even more afraid

616
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,100
that you had been targeted by the killer.

617
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,060
So I wanted to find out the truth
before telling you.

618
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,740
My position in Gu's Group is awkward.

619
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,940
Many people want to make money

620
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,410
while you come back.

621
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,320
I don't care what happens to me.

622
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,160
But I can't let ill-intentioned people

623
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,220
stay in Gu's Group,

624
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,380
or remain close to you and Dad.

625
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,280
The business world is a battlefield.

626
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,080
I wanted to see if you could adapt

627
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,400
before taking over the company,

628
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,240
so I let you do whatever you want.

629
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,840
You did a good job.

630
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,250
Are you really okay with me taking away

631
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,960
all that you've worked so hard?

632
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,850
Don't you resent me?

633
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,760
In the past,

634
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,120
everything I've done

635
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,640
was to become

636
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,440
a son my father could be proud of,

637
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,760
and also

638
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,760
a qualified heir to the Gu's.

639
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,520
Now,

640
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,720
if you need me,

641
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,960
I'll always be by your side,

642
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,880
even if

643
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,920
everyone calls me the Gu family's dog.
