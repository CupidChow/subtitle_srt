No more tears, no more tears.

179
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,160
It's okay.

180
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
I'll stop crying. I'll stop crying.

181
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Good boy.

182
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,520
Mom.

183
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,700
Who is this man?

184
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,840
Him?

185
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
He is your father.

186
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,000
Your father.

187
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,920
My... my...

188
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,200
my father?

189
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
He's your father.

190
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,040
Mom.

191
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,130
No, he's not.

192
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,250
He's not.

193
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,560
He's not.

194
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,060
Don't cry, my baby.

195
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,640
There, there, my baby.

196
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,240
Don't cry.

197
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,880
You deliberately lured me here.

198
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,380
Who told you to do this?

199
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:27,920
Mr. Qin.

200
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,400
Brother,

201
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,440
we meet again.

202
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,010
You hate me
for sending Qin Mian to prison.

203
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,360
You think you can get back at me

204
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,890
by making up a lie like this?

205
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,010
"Making up?"

206
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,410
Stop lying to yourself.

207
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,640
Luo Qian has been at this sanatorium
for 20 years.

208
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,900
With her mental state,

209
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,240
how could I possibly get her

210
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,370
to help me lie to you?

211
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,290
You're my dad's illegitimate son.

212
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,770
You just don't want to admit it.

213
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,240
Fine.

214
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,520
You claim I'm Qin Mian's illegitimate sonâ€”

215
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,220
what proof do you have?

216
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,560
Back then,

217
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,440
Luo Qian met Mr. Qin Mian at a ball

218
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,450
and secretly got pregnant with his child.

219
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,200
At that time, Mr. Qin Mian was

220
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,740
already engaged to Miss Song.

221
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,080
Luo Qian

222
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,060
came to discuss it with me.

223
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,890
I thought that once the child was born,

224
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,880
his real father surely wouldn't

225
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,140
just walk away, right?

226
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:43,890
Besides,

227
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
I thought I could also

228
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,800
get some benefits from it.

229
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,280
So

230
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,160
I married Luo Qian

231
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,900
and got myself a ready-made son like you.

232
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,370
But I never expected

233
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,400
Mr. Qin Mian to not only refuse to
give me money

234
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,800
but also send someone...

235
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,560
to break my leg

236
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,120
and forbid me from telling anyone.

237
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,920
He told me

238
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,520
he would never accept

239
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,760
that bastard.

240
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:07,800
He Wei.

241
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,120
Mr. Qin.

242
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,730
I'll get going then.

243
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,770
Brother,

244
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,280
I'm a bastard,

245
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,520
and so are you.

246
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,600
We really are good brothers.

247
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,960
But now you know

248
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,080
that the man you sent to prison
with your own hands

249
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,610
is your biological father.

250
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,490
Do you

251
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,860
feel even the slightest bit of guilt?

252
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,880
Qin Mian

253
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,930
brought his fate upon himself.

254
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,360
So, you must hate him a lot now, right?

255
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,760
Because he didn't want you

256
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,820
and abandoned you.

257
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,960
And you must also hate me a lot,

258
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,360
right?

259
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,490
Because he treats me

260
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,120
as his only son.

261
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,240
Do you hate me to the core?

262
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,320
Are you in unbearable pain

263
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,380
and want to kill me?

264
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,120
I'm not interested in...

265
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,960
the matters between you and your father.

266
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,680
Aren't you afraid

267
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,880
that I'll tell all this to the Gu family?

268
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,400
If Gu Changfeng and Qiao Yan knew

269
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,460
who you really are,

270
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,320
would they still keep you by their side?

271
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,760
Would they think

272
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
you conspired with my father

273
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,000
to kill Gu Hai?

274
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,960
And that you married Qiao Yan just to...

275
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,100
What exactly do you want to do?

276
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,090
Brother,

277
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,440
promise me one thing,

278
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,620
and I'll keep this secret for you for now.

279
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,040
I want you

280
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,120
to divorce Qiao Yan.

281
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,720
Because

282
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,040
Qiao Yan belongs to me.

283
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,320
You're back.

284
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,800
I told you,

285
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,320
you don't need to wait up for me.

286
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,850
Why'd you fall asleep here?

287
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,720
I was bored, so I watched a movie,

288
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,010
and then I dozed off.

289
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,660
Are you hungry?

290
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,160
I bought you some steamed buns.

291
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,520
Should I reheat them for you?

292
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,380
I'm not hungry.

293
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,140
I still have work to do.

294
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,060
Go to bed first.

295
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,000
Why do you still have work?

296
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,080
Mr. Gu,

297
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,490
you should balance your work and rest.

298
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,800
I really need you.

299
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,690
Alright.

300
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,160
I know.

301
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,520
Go to bed.

302
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,240
Be good.

303
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,570
Okay.

304
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,480
Mm.

305
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,880
Rest early.

306
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:54,800
Okay.

307
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,720
If Gu Changfeng and Qiao Yan knew

308
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,780
who you really are,

309
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,760
would they still keep you by their side?

310
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,080
Would they think

311
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,600
you conspired with my father

312
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
to kill Gu Hai?

313
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,570
I'll hand Yan over to you now

314
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,600
on behalf of Hai and Yuling.

315
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,940
It was Qin Mian.

316
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,360
He killed my parents.

317
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,800
Tell me,

318
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,320
how can I catch Qin Mian?

319
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
How can I catch the murderer?

320
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,480
Brother,

321
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm a bastard,

322
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,840
and so are you.

323
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,050
Nothing can change the fact

324
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,320
that he is your father.

325
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,160
Boss,

326
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,480
as per your instructions,

327
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,400
I borrowed this necklace

328
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,730
from Director Lu and had it investigated.

329
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,240
This button is custom-made.

330
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,860
And its owner is...

331
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,410
indeed Qin Mian.

332
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,180
I heard that it was left
by my biological father.

333
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,460
It's yours now.

334
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,810
You don't look well.

335
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,820
What happened?

336
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,340
Nothing, just a bit tired lately.

337
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,240
Qin Ziyu came to me again.

338
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,360
He still hasn't given up

339
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,290
on breaking you and Qiao Yan apart.

340
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,720
I'd like to see exactly

341
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,560
what he's up to.

342
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,520
Stay out of this.

343
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,920
He's in the shadows,
while you're in the open.

344
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,120
He's always a threat.

345
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,130
Don't worry.

346
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,440
Leave it to me.

347
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,880
How am I supposed to
tell Yan and Dad about this?
