[Episode 2]

3
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,400
Just now,

4
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,400
I was about to leave.

5
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,520
Then you suddenly came back.

6
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:25,920
I...

7
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,560
With your look like that,

8
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,130
I was too scared.

9
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,800
So I hid away.

10
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,250
What did I look like?

11
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,640
Are you very happy today?

12
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,240
Do you think you saw my awkward moments?

13
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,840
Qiao Yan.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,600
What exactly do you want to do

15
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,100
by returning to the Gu Residence?

16
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,620
I'm just back here to visit my family.

17
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,040
My parents are already gone.

18
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,600
They left me alone.

19
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,120
When Grandpa came to find me,

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
he told me

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,370
he would be waiting for me
at the house in Xijiang.

22
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,480
So I came back.

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,840
Your hand.

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,280
Let me bandage it for you.

25
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,370
No need. Get out.

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,040
If you don't treat your wound,
it'll get inflamed.

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,480
If you don't let me bandage your wound,

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,680
I'll go tell Grandpa.

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,480
I promise that

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,120
after I finish bandaging it for you,

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,720
I won't tell anyone about it.

32
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,490
I'll go get the medical kit.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,600
It's done.

34
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,440
Luckily, the wound is not deep.

35
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,370
You'll be fine
after it's disinfected and bandaged.

36
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,720
Uncle,

37
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,560
don't be so impulsive again.

38
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,290
No matter what happens,

39
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,260
you shouldn't hurt yourself.

40
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,520
Okay.

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,760
Thank you.

42
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,280
Then you can get out now, huh?

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,570
I really don't want to
inherit Gu's Group.

44
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,370
I'm back here

45
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,940
not to compete with you for anything.

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,680
But since I've just come back,

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,240
I have to

48
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,820
follow Grandpa's orders.

49
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,760
But I will find a suitable opportunity

50
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,020
to make it clear to him.

51
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,500
You don't want to inherit Gu's Group?

52
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,930
Do you know
how many assets Gu's Group has?

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,320
No matter how many assets it has,

54
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,860
can my parents be bought back?

55
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,779
Can my home be bought back?

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,290
I don't have a home anymore.

57
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
You and Grandpa

58
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,120
are my only family in this world.

59
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,520
So I hope that

60
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,050
you can let your guard down,

61
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,730
stop being hostile to me

62
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,600
and truly accept me.

63
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,140
Because you're my family.

64
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,320
Rest early.

65
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,960
I'm going back to my room.

66
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,960
Oh, by the way,

67
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,159
don't let your wound touch water
these days.

68
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,560
If you need to change the dressing,

69
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,620
come to me anytime.

70
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,320
Gu Jingyuan.

71
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,040
It was really you who stole the model.

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,000
So this is the project
you made for the company?

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,160
Those several overseas resort projects
are all a mess.

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,960
They're full of falsification.

75
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,680
Have you guys forgotten

76
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,280
how Director Zhou got fired?

77
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,200
Wang He.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,560
Think clearly.

79
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,320
Though someone dared to protect Zhou Qiao,

80
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,920
it doesn't mean
he would take extra care of you.

81
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,800
Mr. Gu.

82
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,520
There must be

83
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,600
some other mistakes in the process.

84
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
I've been doing the accounts

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,120
-based on the actual income of the group.
-You mean I'm giving you a hard time?

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,980
No, you're not.

87
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,340
That's not what I mean.

88
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,840
Mr. Gu.

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
Mr. Wang is a senior member
in our company.

90
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,640
‌Logically and emotionally,

91
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,360
he wouldn't do such a thing
to hollow out the company.

92
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,020
‌Logically and emotionally?

93
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,780
Uncle Chen.

94
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,720
Is this how you judge the truth?

95
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,160
Jingyuan.

96
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,840
You joined our company late.

97
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,240
You haven't experienced the hardship
of starting a company.

98
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,040
Last time,

99
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,080
you used tough tactics
to deal with Director Zhou.

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,210
But the so-called evidence

101
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,000
is completely untenable.

102
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,080
If you insist on

103
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,120
laying off these old employees,

104
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,420
which disappoints everyone,

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,850
when Miss Qiao Yan takes over the company,

106
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,720
who else can she rely on?

107
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,480
Uncle Chen, you have a point.

108
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,440
Since you care so much
about old relationships,

109
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,170
then I'll respect your choice.

110
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,720
Lin Ze.

111
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,659
Arrange a cashier position for Mr. Wang.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,800
That's all for today's meeting.

113
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,240
Mr. Gu!

114
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,720
Um...

115
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,450
Mr. Chen.

116
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,200
Well...

117
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,840
After seeing my father's birthday photos,

118
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,810
I only have one thought now.

119
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,840
Hmm?

120
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,850
My father has always been handsome
since childhood.

121
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,400
He

122
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,320
looks like your grandma.

123
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,090
Grandpa.

124
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:26,840
Yes?

125
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,600
When I was looking at the photo album,

126
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
I couldn't find
Uncle Jingyuan's birthday photos.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,680
Does he usually not

128
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,280
take photos on his birthday?

129
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,040
Oh.

130
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,970
Your Uncle Jingyuan
never celebrates his birthday.

131
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,000
Why?

132
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,760
Yuan is an orphan.

133
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,020
He doesn't know his date of birth.

134
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,720
Gradually,

135
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,159
I forgot it, too.

136
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,400
Yuan?

137
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,760
Is that his old name?

138
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,840
Yes.

139
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,480
I heard that those old guys

140
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,880
were openly against you.

141
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,530
So your strategy

142
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,560
is drinking alone here?

143
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,520
Alright.

144
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,140
No matter what,

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,330
I'm always on your side.

146
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,240
No matter what you want to do,

147
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,100
I will help you.

148
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,500
The people on this list

149
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,140
are neither Chen Shi's men

150
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,320
nor loyal to the old Mr. Gu.

151
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
Go find out

152
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,520
[Shareholder List Information
of Gu's Group]

153
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,730
if they are interested in working with me.

154
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,160
That's right.

155
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,320
As long as Gu Changfeng

156
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,600
loses the right of control
over Gu's Group,

157
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,000
Qiao Yan will be nothing.

158
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,930
This is what my Yuan is like.

159
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,610
Mr. Gu, you're back.

160
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,240
Miss Qiao has ordered me

161
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,640
to save some food for you.

162
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,760
What Miss Qiao?

163
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,720
Oh.

164
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,080
Miss Qiao Yan.

165
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,800
It's okay. I won't eat it.

166
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,320
Ah.

167
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,200
Grandpa, look.

168
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,360
You have a little red flower.

169
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,040
Oh.

170
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,600
Uncle.

171
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,490
You're back.

172
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
Taste the red bean paste I made.

173
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,660
I don't eat sweet food.

174
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,690
Then play games with us for a while.

175
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,000
I still have work to do.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,760
Enjoy yourselves.

177
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,440
Grandpa.

178
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,240
Jingyuan.

179
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,440
You don't need to be in such a hurry

180
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,800
to deal with the company's affairs.

181
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Spending time with my granddaughter

182
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,280
is just the serious business.

183
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,880
Come here.

184
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,770
Hurry up.

185
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,530
Look.

186
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,400
If you randomly input six digits

187
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,730
into this mini program,

188
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,370
it'll present a blind box
that belongs to you.

189
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,720
Miao.

190
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,520
There is a strongbox
in Gu Jingyuan's room.

191
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,360
It requires not only a six-digit password

192
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,920
but also
the owner's fingerprint identification.

193
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,120
I want a mini program.

194
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,120
As for this mini program,

195
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,200
I hope those who use it

196
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,440
can open a blind box

197
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,160
by inputting a six-digit password.

198
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,000
A very cute blind box.

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,660
No problem.

200
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,600
I've played this game with so many people.

201
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,920
No one has ever gotten a bomb.

202
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,450
Grandpa.

203
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,080
He got a bomb.

204
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,720
With his bad temper,

205
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
bombs are the most suitable for him.

206
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,760
Don't be angry, Uncle.

207
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,610
Taste the red bean paste I made.

208
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,570
By the way, Grandpa,

209
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,640
do you know

210
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,560
my father has a house model

211
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,160
with his name engraved on it?

212
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,160
Yes, I do.

213
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,320
With his temper,

214
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,480
I thought

215
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,540
he had thrown it away long ago.

216
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,440
What's wrong?

217
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,660
Did you bring it back here?

218
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,600
No.

219
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,240
I accidentally

220
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,200
lost that model.

221
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,690
Grandpa.

222
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,080
What exactly

223
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,900
is that model used for?

224
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,290
Your grandma

225
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,640
left it to your dad.

226
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,680
Meifeng was seriously ill at that time,

227
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,200
so she specially left a will to your dad.

228
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,160
According to
the attached conditions of the will,

229
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,840
after the will takes effect,

230
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,960
as long as he brings the model

231
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,160
back to the Gu family,

232
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,000
he can inherit ten percent of her shares.

233
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,040
I see.

234
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,180
Gu Jingyuan's purpose

235
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,580
is to stop me from inheriting the shares.

236
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,720
Yan.

237
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,360
Why did you suddenly ask about this?

238
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,600
Oh, it's alright.

239
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,120
It doesn't matter if you lost it.

240
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,000
All my shares

241
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,090
will be yours in the future.

242
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,400
Grandpa,

243
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,170
why do I need so many shares?

244
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,640
Am I right, Uncle?

245
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,480
Yuan.

246
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,490
Are you willing to come with me?

247
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,380
Where are we going?

248
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
Let's go home.

249
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,920
Dad.

250
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,200
What am I

251
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,640
to you?

252
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,960
As Yan's uncle,

253
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,330
when I'm gone in the future,

254
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,050
you'll have to take good care of her

255
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,800
and protect Gu's business for her.

256
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,440
This is

257
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,400
your duty.

258
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,560
Uncle.

259
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,730
Happy birthday.

260
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,320
Today is not my birthday.

261
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,240
Grandpa told me about it.

262
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,890
He said when he adopted you,

263
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,080
there was no record of your date of birth.

264
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,410
So he has never celebrated your birthday.

265
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,440
After I heard that,

266
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,520
I was very sad.

267
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,600
So,

268
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,020
I've decided to

269
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,880
regard the date
when you joined the Gu family

270
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
as your birthday.

271
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,120
That's today.

272
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,320
On what grounds can you

273
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,450
decide my birthday?

274
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,770
What do you want to do this time?

275
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,320
Since you've blown out the candles,

276
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,800
I'll just think
we've celebrated your birthday.

277
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,330
What intentions can I have?

278
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,860
I just want you to be happy.

279
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,920
Because I like celebrating birthdays
very much.

280
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,780
When I was a kid,

281
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,160
every year on my birthday,

282
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,220
my parents would celebrate it for me.

283
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
And they would prepare gifts for me.

284
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,210
At that time,

285
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,560
I thought I was the happiest girl

286
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,680
in the world.

287
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,520
Today,

288
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,490
you are not Gu Jingyuan.

289
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,570
And you're not He Yuan, either.

290
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,940
You're just yourself,

291
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,880
a person who gets one year older

292
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,540
and has received good wishes.

293
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,730
Qiao Yan, have you never suspected me?

294
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,600
I don't know what you are talking about.

295
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,520
I mean,

296
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,880
in order to get Gu's Group,

297
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,880
I killed my brother and sister-in-law.

298
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,880
At least,
half of the people in Gu's Group think so.

299
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,240
Have you never suspected me?

300
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,520
Uncle.

301
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,480
We are a family.

302
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,410
Why would I suspect you?

303
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,410
What's more,

304
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,410
my parents died
because of the brake failure.

305
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,100
That's the German police's conclusion.

306
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,140
Haven't you been thinking

307
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,090
why I came back to the Gu family?

308
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,840
I just want to

309
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
be with my family.

310
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,400
I wish you

311
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
a happy birthday.

312
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,360
Thank you.

313
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,680
Uncle.

314
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,760
Uncle.

315
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,280
People tend to
use their most familiar digits

316
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,210
as the password.

317
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,840
That was why I asked you to design

318
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,480
that mini-program game for me.

319
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,240
As long as we can
get the digits in Gu Jingyuan's mind,

320
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,970
the password of the strongbox
must be among them.

321
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,640
I even mentioned the model

322
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,090
in front of him that day.

323
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
From the perspective of psychology,

324
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,400
people tend to make mistakes more easily

325
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,680
when they are nervous.

326
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,100
Gu Jingyuan input eight combinations
of digits in total.

327
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,820
[System]

328
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,160
Apart from
the first two perfunctory combinations,

329
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,090
there are six valid combinations.

330
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,480
It's not the stock code of Gu's Group

331
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,800
or the date of merging with
Yongjia Real Estate.

332
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,600
Could it be...

333
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,200
the date
when Gu Jingyuan joined the Gu family?

334
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,000
The password is correct.

335
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,730
Please scan your fingerprint.

336
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,640
Do you really think I would believe you?

337
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,440
Since the day
when you returned to the Gu family,

338
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
I knew something was wrong with you.

339
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,680
Then why have you waited till now?

340
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,520
I wanted to see

341
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,930
what the old Mr. Gu's dear granddaughter,

342
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,380
who's also the future heir of Gu's Group,

343
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,080
was really capable of.

344

How did you get this video?

514
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,640
Grandpa.

515
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,920
The most important thing now

516
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,460
is what you're going to do.

517
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,290
Grandpa.

518
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,420
In the past,

519
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,080
perhaps you trusted Uncle Jingyuan
the most.

520
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,720
But now that I'm back alive,

521
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,680
maybe everything is different.

522
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,490
You don't trust him?

523
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,000
He personally said
that he was plotting against you

524
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,330
and against Gu's Group.

525
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,640
Does it matter
whether I believe him or not?

526
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,100
Then what do you want to do?

527
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,520
I want to work in the company.

528
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,490
I want to investigate Gu Jingyuan.

529
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,640
Yan.

530
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,480
Yan...

531
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I mean,

532
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,200
in order to get Gu's Group,

533
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,720
I killed my brother and sister-in-law.

534
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,960
Yan...

535
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,120
Yan...

536
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,930
It's so late now.

537
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,540
What's the matter?

538
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,740
I'm here to return something.

539
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,040
I saw someone today,

540
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,200
who looked quite similar to you.

541
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,400
But she left in a hurry

542
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,570
and dropped something.

543
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,280
What is it?

544
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,840
Is it yours?

545
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,520
It's not mine.

546
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,140
Don't let me find out about you again.

547
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,720
You're just bluffing.

548
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,400
I'm not afraid of you.

549
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,600
I must catch you.
