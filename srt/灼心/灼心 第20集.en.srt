3
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,480
Yan.

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,480
I kept avoiding you before

5
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
because I was too afraid to face you.

6
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,759
I'm afraid you'll hate me when you know

7
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,800
all the truth.

8
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,479
What truth?

9
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,440
I thought my mom had passed away.

10
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,240
But He Wei told me

11
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,090
she was still alive.

12
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,539
So I went to see her.

13
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,330
She lives in Xin Yu Sanatorium.

14
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,850
How did you know?

15
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,240
What happened later?

16
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,250
Later...

17
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,920
Later, I found out about

18
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,050
the identity of my biological father.

19
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,200
Yan.

20
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm Qin Mian's son.

21
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,260
I didn't want to
believe all of this at first.

22
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,290
But when I first found out about it,

23
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,490
I didn't know how...

24
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,240
how to tell you and Dad.

25
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
So you prepared...

26
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,160
that divorce agreement?

27
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,360
No, Yan.

28
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,900
I've never wanted to divorce you.

29
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,770
That divorce agreement

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,850
was a just a tactic when I had no choice.

31
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
You had no choice?

32

33
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,280
What else are you hiding from me?

34
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,680
Xin Yu Sanatorium

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,940
belongs to the Qin family.

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,329
My mother has been confined there
for over ten years.

37
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,060
Now Qin Ziyu is threatening me with my mom

38
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,079
to divorce you.

39
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:03,960
Yan.

40
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,480
I should have told you everything

41
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,520
from the beginning.

42
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,880
As I didn't dare to face it,

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,940
I kept delaying it,

44
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,120
which hurt you all.

45
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,399
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,079
Can you forgive me?

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Those days,

48
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,050
you must have suffered a lot

49
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,900
while facing it alone.

50
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,160
But even so,

51
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,370
you still didn't choose to
face it with me.

Gu Jingyuan.

53

Do you remember

54
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,880
what I told you when I found you

55
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,020
at the ocean ball hall?

56
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,800
You are

57
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,340
such a man of contradictions.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,060
You obviously wanted to grab my hand,

59
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,680
but you pushed me away every time.

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,360
Do you not trust yourself

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,920
or not trust Grandpa and me?

62
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,320
Does it really matter

whose son you are?

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,640
Can it change our relationship

65
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,080
or erase all the memories

66
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,280

I want to divorce you

72
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,440
not because of whose son you are.

Do you remember

soon after you joined the Gu family,

121
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
you accidentally

broke the pen Meifeng had given to me?

123
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,730
You were so scared
that you ran away from home.

Because of it, your Uncle Xu and I

by asking me to grow flowers for a month.

But you can't miss the right timing

not because you had broken something.

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,640
It was because

137

you didn't want to make up for it,

Remember.

140
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,720
If you want to apologize,

141
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,820
you have to bear

the consequence
of the other person refusing to accept it.

If the other person doesn't accept it,

00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,640
will you just do nothing?

and punish me.

162
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,720
It's even okay
to give me the silent treatment.

163

But I don't agree to get divorced.

We can put the divorce aside temporarily.

which I hope you can promise me.

172
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,040
Okay.

173
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,640
You haven't even asked me what it is.

174

Hello, Mr. Gu.

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,480
This has been
the first shareholder's meeting

since Chairman Gu passed away.

179
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,720
It looks like

180
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
we're going to elect a new chairman.

181

be the new chairwoman of our group.

Since the former Chairman Gu
and Mr. Gu Jingyuan

214
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,920
both said so...

346
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,400
is in these accounts.

347
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,200
If the investigation team delays it
for two months,

348
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
the company's capital flow

349
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,930
will definitely be broken.

350
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,200
It's okay.

351
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,690
Don't worry.

352
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,160
There will be a solution.

353
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,330
Grandpa.

354
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,730
Don't worry.

355
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,440
Jingyuan and I

356
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,010
will protect Gu's Group properly.

357
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,770
Uncle Xu.

358
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,370
Ms. Qiao.

359
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,360
There was something I couldn't figure out.

360
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,840
A couple of days ago,
when I was tidying up the chairman's car,

361
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,680
I found a mark at the rear par of the car,

362
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,280
which might be caused
by a rear-end collision.

363
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,820
But I clearly remember

364
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,440
the day before his birthday,

365
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,040
there were no such marks
when I cleaned the car.

366
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,660
So you're suspecting that

367
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,560
Grandpa had a heart attack

368
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,020
because of a car accident?

369
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,600
And it was a hit-and-run?

370
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,520
Maybe it was not that simple.

371
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,840
Before your grandpa died,
he asked me to investigate

372
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,000
what happened between you and Jingyuan.

373
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,130
I found that it was related to Qin Ziyu.

374
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,170
And I reported it to him.

375
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,040
So you mean...

376
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Grandpa's death

377
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,200
might be related to Qin Ziyu?

378
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,920
That day, your grandpa suddenly

379
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,050
went to your parents' cemetery alone.

380
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I just thought it was quite strange.

381
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,400
So,

382
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,800
I went to get the surveillance videos
from that day in the cemetery.

383
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,640
I found that he had really

384
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,500
met with Qin Ziyu in the cemetery.

385
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,800
However,

386
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,360
when the two cars left and arrived,

387
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,240
I didn't find

388
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,380
any traces of rear-end collisions
or scraping.

389
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,180
In other words,

390
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,410
Grandpa's car accident

391
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,840
happened on that path

392
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,920
without CCTV cameras, and then he died?

393
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,980
It was very likely.

394
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,050
If that was really the case,

395
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,530
Grandpa's death

396
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,340
had something to do with Qin Ziyu.

397
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,980
It's rare for you to ask me out.

398
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,200
Last time, in the mourning hall,

399
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,330
Gu Jingyuan hit you.

400
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
I'd like to apologize to you for him.

401
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,680
It's okay.

402
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,040
I didn't take it to heart.

403
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,680
How have you been lately?

404
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
You look thinner.

405
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,330
Grandpa is gone.

406
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,640
I've returned to Gu's Group.

407
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,920
I'm a bit busy indeed.

408
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,000
Isn't Gu Jingyuan managing Gu's Group?

409
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,640
You said you were not
interested in doing business.

410
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,120
I'm...

411
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
going to divorce him.

412
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,490
Are you sure?

413
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,780
Did Gu Jingyuan agree?

414
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,680
Yes.

415
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,290
However,

416
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,400
we haven't

417
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,010
announced this news to the public yet.

418
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,210
Can you keep this secret for me?

419
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,400
Sure.

420
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,200
Then what is

421
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,940
your next plan?

422
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,610
What plans could I have?

423
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,130
Grandpa is gone.

424
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,280
And I'm alone again.

425
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,960
Qin Ziyu, tell me.

426
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,680
If I hadn't

427
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,120
married Gu Jingyuan back then,

428
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,780
would everything be fine now?

429
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,460
At least, I would still have an uncle.

430
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,410
I won't leave you alone.

431
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:08,970
Qiao Yan.

432
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,480
I like you.

433
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,040
I wanted to tell you from the first day
I returned to our country.

434
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,970
But I was one step late at that time.

435
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,780
You had already married Gu Jingyuan.

436
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,440
But...

437
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,020
But your dad...

438
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,400
I know

439
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,640
you've never resented me

440
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
because of my dad.

441
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,540
You are the best girl in the world.

442
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Other people can't understand you.

443
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,880
Now

444
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,090
the obstacle between us no longer exists.

445
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,820
I don't want to lose you again.

446
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,360
The obstacle between us?

447
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,980
Are you talking about my grandpa?

448
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,560
I mean...

449
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,940
Chairman Gu

450
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,400
might not want us to be together.

451
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,970
However,

452
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,760
I really want him to be alive, too.

453
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,960
But the accident has already happened.

454
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,800
I'm sorry.

455
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,100
Many things have happened recently.

456
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,200
Now I'm still not able to

457
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,730
accept a new relationship.

458
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,530
Let's be friends first.

459
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,360
So you mean

460
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,570
there's still a chance between us?

461
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,760
Great!

462
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,090
Qin Ziyu.

463
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,840
I'm sorry.

464
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,500
I was a bit too excited.

465
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,100
I must have scared you.

466
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,330
Well, I still have something to do
in the company.

467
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,220
I have to go now.

468
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,640
Let me see you out.

469
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,280
I'm leaving.

470
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,200
Let's have dinner together sometime.

471
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,530
Okay.

472
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,600
What's wrong?

473
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Um,

474
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,530
I don't think I can start my car.

475
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,320
But I'm in a hurry

476
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,560
to go back to the company for a meeting.

477
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,840
Why don't you drive my car now?

478
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,700
I'll handle it.

479
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,760
Thank you.

480
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,520
You're welcome.
