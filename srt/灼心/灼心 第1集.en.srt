I nearly caused your mother to miscarry.

Your father, in a fit of anger,

182

took your mother and left the Gu family.

183

Grandpa,

192
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,770
Dad chose from the start

193
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,800
to give me Mom's surname,

194
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,720
and he never told me

195
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,740
about the Gu family's existence.

196
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,040
That means

197
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,450
he didn't want me
to return to the Gu family

198

and didn't want me to return to you.

they just came out of the repair shop.

the cause was brake failure.

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,200
Okay. Okay.

351
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,120
Uncle,

352
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,700
have we met somewhere before?

353
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,560
Gu Jingyuan,

354
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,200
was it you who killed my parents?

355
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,480
I will find out the truth.

356
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,760
Uncle?

357
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,880
Have we?

358
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,560
Maybe you've forgotten me.

359
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,680
Qiao Yan,

360
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,160
I really regret

361
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,000
not bringing you back earlier.

362
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,960
Otherwise, your parents

363
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
wouldn't have...

364
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,490
It's quite cold at night in Xijiang

365
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,480
when it's windy.

366
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,260
If you plan to stay here often,

367
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,640
you'll need to get used to it.

368
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,840
Of course.

369
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,080
This is my home.

370
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,040
I'll definitely settle in well.

371
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,250
Thank you for your concern, Uncle.

372
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,520
Miss Qiao Yan,

373
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
your room is ready.

374
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,560
Let me take you upstairs.

375
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,770
Thank you, Uncle Xu.

376
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,680
Jingyuan,

377
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,520
Chairman Gu is waiting for you
in the study.

378
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,120
We moved into this old house

379
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,040
when your father was born.

380
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,640
Mr. Gu is nostalgic.

381
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,240
He's lived here all the time.

382
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,560
Oh, this room

383
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,200
belongs to Jingyuan.

384
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,880
He likes peace and quiet

385
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,600
and doesn't like to be disturbed.

386
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,360
Make sure you don't enter by mistake.

387
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,760
Come,

388
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,500
your room is over here.

389
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,040
Dad,

390
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,290
you wanted to see me?

391
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,320
Jingyuan,

392
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,280
come, have a seat.

393
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,720
What?

394
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,240
You're unhappy?

395
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,640
Of course not.

396
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,960
I'm happy for you

397
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,650
that Qiao Yan has come back.

398
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
Your brother died in a car accident.

399
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,280
Yan is my biological granddaughter

400
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,920
and the only blood relative
I have left in this world.

401
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,120
Over the years,

402
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,440
I've owed her far too much.

403
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,840
I must make it up to her double.

404
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,360
Dad,

405
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,120
what am I

406
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,920
to you?

407
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,600
Yan's uncle

408
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,100
and my adopted son
who has been by my side for many years.

409
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,100
Since Yan is willing to come back,

410
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,440
you should get along well with her.

411
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,080
When I'm gone,

412
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,720
you must take good care of her

413
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,970
and help her
safeguard the Gu family's business.

414
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,530
That is your duty

415
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,520
as my closest

416
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,880
adopted son.

417
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,980
Do you understand?

418
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,080
Yes.

419
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,920
If there's nothing else,

420
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
I'm going back.

421
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,280
Yuan,

422
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,680
don't

423
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,120
let me down.

424
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,200
Yuan,

425
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,960
Yan is my biological granddaughter

426
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,610
and the only blood relative
I have left in this world.

427
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,040
You must take good care of her

428
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,090
and help her
safeguard the Gu family's business.

429
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,640
Oh my!

430
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,400
Come out.

431
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,960
What are you doing in my room?

432
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,440
This house is too big.

433
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,120
I got lost.

434
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,640
Just now,

435
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,920
Uncle Xu specially showed me around.

436
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,560
But

437
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,400
I didn't remember the way.

438
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,800
So I ended up in the wrong room.

439
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,240
When you walk into the wrong room,

440
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,320
your first reaction should be to leave,

441
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,720
not to stay.

442
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,840
You're right.

443
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Just now,

444
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,800
I was about to leave,

445
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,920
but you suddenly came back.

446
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,280
I...

447
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,720
The way you looked

448
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,400
scared me,

449
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,280
so I hid.

450
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,500
What way did I look?

451
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,260
You're very happy today, huh?

452
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,160
You think you made a fool of me, huh?

453
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,200
Qiao Yan,

454
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
why exactly

455
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,720
did you come back to the Gu family?
