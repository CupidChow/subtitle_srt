176
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,600
Don't you want to know

177
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,320
why your birth mother abandoned you?

178
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,880
Whose blood runs in your veins?

179
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,780
You know my mother?

180
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,280
Dad.

181
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,130
Gu Jingyuan,

182
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,080
please leave,

183
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,340
or I'll call security.

184
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,730
I've got other things to do,

185
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,900
so I won't keep you.

186
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,560
If you're interested,

187
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,610
come have tea next time.

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,360
Dad,

189
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,560
is what he said true?

190
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,960
Did you order Manager Zhu

191
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,370
to mess with Gu's Group?

192
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,760
Dad, why are you always picking on them?

193
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,220
Shut up.

194
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,760
This has nothing to do with you.

195
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,090
Stop talking nonsense.

196
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,650
Avoid coming

197
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,260
to the company these days.

198
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,820
He Wei's gone missing?

199
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Alright, I got it.

200
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,020
Why are you still watching He Wei?

201
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,720
You seem to have something
on your mind these days.

202
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,960
Are you hiding something

203
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,520
from me?

204
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,760
No.

205
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,520
I just don't want him
causing more trouble.

206
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,240
Oh.

207
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,360
By the way,

208
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
take these flowers,

209
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,300
and give them to Xi.

210
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
She'll love them.

211
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,680
Ms. Qiao Yan.

212
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,080
Xi,

213
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,120
you look lively today.

214
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,280
Feeling better?

215
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,480
Miss Qiao Yan,

216
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,120
Mr. Gu,

217
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,240
I misunderstood you before.

218
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,040
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,760
It's okay.

220
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
We understand.

221
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,280
As long as the kids are healthy,

222
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,840
right?

223
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,640
Mr. Gu,

224
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
she loves the toy

225
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,050
you gave her—

226
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,890
sleeps with it every night.

227
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,600
Xi,

228
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,440
if you ever feel unwell again,

229
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
you must tell me,

230
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,440
okay?

231
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,840
Xi,

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,930
don't be afraid.

233
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,160
He

234
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,880
just looks

235
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
a bit serious.

236
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,000
But actually,

237
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,980
he's very nice.

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,260
See? Pretty, isn't it?

239
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,680
He bought it just for you.

240
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,720
Here.

241
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,440
Yan,

242
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,560
you're so nice to him.

243
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,170
Are you his girlfriend?

244
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,200
Hey,

245
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
watch your mouth.

246
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,120
Sorry,

247
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,440
she's just a kid.

248
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,520
It's okay.

249
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,320
I'll go pack up for you.

250
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,480
Great.

251
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,450
Come with me.

252
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,800
I'll go with you.

253
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,290
My heart is beating hard again.

254
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,760
What's wrong?

255
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,570
Maybe I've just been too tired lately.

256
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,690
Probably worrying over my issues.

257
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Get some rest

258
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,160
and leave the rest to me.

259
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,840
Find something

260
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,240
you enjoy doing.

261
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:53,880
Yan.

262
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,720
Come on.

263
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,880
Coming.

[Qin Group]

265
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,610
Do you think Qin's is behind it?

266
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,160
It's hard to say.

267
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,880
Yeah.

268
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,480
What should we do?

269
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,360
Don't forget what I told you.

270
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,960
Hey, Mr. Qin.

271
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,360
Okay.

272
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,900
Mr. Qin,

273
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,240
according to authorities,

274
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,900
the food poisoning incident

275
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,120
at Gu's Parent-Child Day event

276
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,880
was caused by Qin's malicious competition.

277
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,610
Is that true?

278
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,540
Everyone,

279
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,400
it has been investigated.

280
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,840
Our marketing manager Zhu Ming

281
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
used underhanded

282
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,080
tactics for personal gain.

283
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,480
He's been fired

284
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,320
and will face legal action.

285
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,560
The company is also a victim—

286
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,520
but I feel deeply guilty

287
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,480
and will compensate

288
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,120
the children and parents.

289
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,040
I'm sorry.

the disputed land

to Gu's without a fight

Qiao Yan?

299
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,970
It's really you.

300
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,080
You're here for the show too?

301
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,160
I own this

302
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,540
small theater.

303
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,200
Mmm.

304
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,480
By the way,

305
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,930
why didn't you answer my calls?

306
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,160
Shouldn't you know

307
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,820
the answer to that?

308
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,280
I've told you,

309
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm different

You're quite interesting.

I really want to make friends with you.

313
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,760
Your family's been fighting

314
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,560
with mine over that land,

315
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,760
and you still want to be friends?

What?

317
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,560
Don't you have any friends?

No.

319
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,369
I really need to reflect on myself.

320
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,800
Now that you want to be my friend,

321
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,240
should I feel flattered

322
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,480
or doomed?

323

By the way,

avoiding Gu Jingyuan back then?

326
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,800
I thought he was my enemy.

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,880
And now?

I'm not your enemy either.

331
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,600
I bought this theater

332
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
so I could one day

333
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,370
invite you to perform here.

334
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,520
I told you, I don't do meaningless things.

I lied to you.

Don't you want to know

343
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,600
why your birth mother abandoned you?

no trace of Luo Qian,

348
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,580
and He Wei's

349
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,560
missing too.

Got it.

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,520
Meet me here.

352
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,560
Uncle.

353
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,200
Hmm?

354
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,360
Do you think

355
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,160
I should come

356
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,020
to perform at Qin Ziyu's theater?

357
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,040
I don't want to interfere
with your making friends.

358
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,720
But Qin Ziyu is Qin Mian's son.

359
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,360
You'd better be careful.

360
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,120
Okay.

361
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,640
I know.

362
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,800
Since your parents passed away,

363
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,340
you've been working hard.

364
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,970
Don't worry.

365
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,600
I will catch the murderer

366
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,360
so that they can rest in peace

367
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,480
in heaven.

368
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,080
Uncle,

369
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,600
thank you.

370
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,640
I should thank you.

371
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,720
If it weren't for you,

372
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,450
we'd never have
solved He Wei's mess so smoothly.

373
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,680
But

374
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,280
strictly speaking,

375
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
you've saved me three times already.

376
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,720
So what I did today

377
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,420
is nothing in comparison.

378
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,600
The hardest thing in life
is facing old wounds.

379
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,080
I've been telling you

380
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,660
to let go of that accident.

381
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,440
But I've been trapped

382
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,940
in my childhood nightmare all along.

383
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,560
I chose to run from it…

384
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,480
until I luckily

385
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,960
found a strength I never had.

386
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,240
Don't tell me

387
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,060
that "strength" is me?

388
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,760
When you stood up for me

389
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,440
in front of everyone,

390
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,560
all I could think was—

391
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,570
I won't let anyone who's hurt me

392
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
hurt the people I care about.

393
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
I checked with Lin

394
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,600
about your symptoms,

395
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,330
combined with my own thinking,

396
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,600
I've come to a conclusion:

397
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,130
Qiao Yan,

398
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,330
you're not sick.

399
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,280
You've

400
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,000
fallen for Gu Jingyuan.

401
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:07,960
Yan,

402
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,440
what happened?

403
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,880
Are you okay, Yan?

404
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,120
Ah?

405
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,560
Who's there?

406
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,640
S-S-Security's here.

407
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,880
Let's go.

408
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,440
Go.

409
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,580
Slow... slow down.

410
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,060
Hey, slow down.

411
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,280
Get down.

412
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,880
Why are they running?

413
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,740
Yeah, why are you running?

414
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,120
Yeah.

415
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,520
When I'm nervous, I...

416
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,050
Why are you nervous?

417
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,200
I...

418
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,210
You've fallen for Gu Jingyuan.

419
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,420

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,000
Yes.

438
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,560
Let's go back.

439
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,040
Okay.

440
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,000
Well,

441
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,760
you should go home.

442
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,720
I'm not going back.

443
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,080
No.

444
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:37,800
I…

445
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,610
I'll stay at Han Miao's.

446
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,160
We had an appointment.

447
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,480
Yes.

448
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,120
Well...

449
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,240
It's late. Let me give you a ride.

450
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,680
No.

451
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:45,960
I...

452
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,280
I...

453
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,280
I just want to take a walk.

454
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,680
Hey, Qiao—

455
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,360
Miao,

456
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,800
I confessed to Gu Jingyuan.

457
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,200
What?

458
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,760
Are you there?

459
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,480
Yes.

460
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,720
I'm so sleepy.

461
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,760
Good night, Uncle.

462
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,560
[WeChat Transfer – 10,000 yuan]

463
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,880
Wait,

464
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,360
after you confessed,

465
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,520
his first reaction was

466
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,480
to transfer you money?

467
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,840
He really think he's your elder.

468
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,280
I don't know why—

469
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,600
in that moment,

470
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,040
looking at his face,

471
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,200
I just lost control.

472
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,200
Do you think he'll see me

473
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,640
as some kind of pervert now?

474
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,970
What will he think of me?

475
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,160
Will he hate me?

476
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,650
What am I supposed to do?

477
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,120
First,

478
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,010
there's no blood relation.

479
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,620
Second,

480
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,450
he's only a few years older.

481
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,480
Liking him doesn't make you a pervert.

482
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,320
But we're family.

483
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,560
So are married couples.

484
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,240
Huh?

485
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,080
Yeah.

486
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,170
What's wrong with liking someone?

487
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,180
If you think it's worth it,

488
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,080
just go for it.

489
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,120
Honestly,

490
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,320
I haven't figured it out.

491
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,080
Maybe I've been

492
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,520
through a lot these days.

493
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,640
I might have got confused

494
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,400
and

495
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,360
caused him trouble.

496
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,840
You're sure

497
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,320
it's just confusion?

498
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,520
What matters now

499
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,980
is finding my parents' murderer.

500
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,760
I can't let my mind wander.

501
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,840
Jingyuan,

502
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,240
why aren't you going to work?

503
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,240
I'm free this morning.

504
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,580
I want to spend more time with you.

505
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:21,920
Hey.

506
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
Miss Yan's back.

507
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,020
Go and have breakfast.

508
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,200
No, I've eaten.

509
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,240
Dad,

510
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,560
I just remembered

511
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,480
I have a client meeting.

512
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,210
I have to go.

513
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,000
Okay.

514
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
Yan, you're back.

515
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,960
Morning, Uncle.

516
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,170
Morning.

517
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,360
Going to work?

518
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,320
Yes.

519
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,880
Well,

520
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,480
you're back so early.

521
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,380
Didn't stay longer with Han Miao?

522
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,040
I'm done.

523
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,460
I'll go back if there's nothing else.

524
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,320
Yan.

525
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,760
Come with me.

526
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,460
I've got something to say.

527
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,560
-Qiao Yan.
-Gu Jingyuan.

528
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,340
How much older are you than me?

529
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,200
Uh...

530
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,210
F-Five years older.

531
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,920
See?

532
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,100
Only five years older—

533
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,240
and I'm calling you Uncle?

534
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,370
That's unfair to me.

535
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,480
So,

536
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,880
I don't want to call you uncle anymore.

537
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,480
I want to

538
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,080
call you by your name,

539
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,840
Gu Jingyuan.

540
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,320
I must look so dumb right now.

541
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,530
Qiao Yan,

542
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,660
I promised Grandpa

543
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,280
and your parents

544
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,610
that I'd look after you.

545
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,500
I saved you and cared about you

546
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,400
because we're family.

547
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
I'm your elder.

548
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
So I don't want you

549
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,320
to get the wrong idea.

550
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,960
Uncle,

551
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,160
why are you

552
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,560
so old-fashioned?

553
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,760
I don't want you to misunderstand.

554
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,690
That's why I didn't explain to you.

555
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,920
I've been

556
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,640
growing up

557
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,120
abroad.

558
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,740
I'm used to being free.

559
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,720
I just think

560
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,410
we're about the same age

561
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,300
and we get along very well.

562
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:54,880
So

563
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,140
I don't want to see you as my elder.

564
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
I want to treat you

565
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,280
as my best friend.

566
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,200
In our town,

567
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,720
best friends would

568
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,160
kiss each other's cheeks.

569
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,280
Like this.

570
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,240
That's all.

571
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,260
Really?

572
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,400
If you don't believe me,

573
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,040
we can do it right now.

574
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,360
Don't even

575
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,200
think

576
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,250
about it.

577
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,970
Cheapskate.

578
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,560
I'm done explaining.

579
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,600
I'm going back.
