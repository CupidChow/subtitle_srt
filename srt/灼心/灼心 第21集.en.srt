Mr. Yuan.

4
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,160

Okay?

10
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,020
Then I'll cut to the chase.

11
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,410
Okay.

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,920

Is Jinjie Holdings under your name

14
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,160

a further investment in us?

15

31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,100
Mr. Yuan, you are taking advantage of me.

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,880
It's not fair

34

to say that.

35
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,010
Well.

If it weren't for our old friendship,

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,160
I wouldn't have wanted to
get involved in the mess at all.

353
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,280
Be careful.

354
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
Keep in touch.

355
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,280
What?

356
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,760
Saving Ms. Luo can be a good opportunity.

357
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,490
I want you to put on a show with me

358
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,010
to make Qin Ziyu believe

359
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,410
we've really broken up.

360
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,000
No.

361
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,440
I can't let you
stay close to Qin Ziyu alone.

362
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,360
It's too dangerous.

363
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,560
But I have to do this.

364
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,160
Qin Ziyu is very likely

365
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,290
to be the murderer who killed Grandpa.

366
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,080
I can't let him

367
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,280
get away with murder.

368
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,520
Yan.

369
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,140
There are many ways

370
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,600
to investigate this matter.

371
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:49,960
You don't have to...

372
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,290
This is the only way now.

373
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,560
We have no evidence.

374
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,160
We'll only alert them
if we call the police.

375
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,800
You know

376
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
Qin Ziyu

377
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,320
is vigilant and cunning.

378
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,290
If we don't get close to him,

379
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,280
there's no way we can find any evidence
of his wrongdoing.

380
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,600
Besides,

381
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
only I can do this.

382
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,560
You must protect the Gu's Group.

383
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,820
Only you can see through Qin Ziyu's plot.

384
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,840
Yan.

385
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,180
How can I not be worried about you?

386
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,120
Trust me,

387
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,820
and cooperate with me.

388
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,800
Let's avenge Grandpa together.

389
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,520
In my opinion,

390
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,760
your boss should have

391
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,240
told me everything earlier.

392
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,900
Otherwise,

393
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,080
I wouldn't have

394
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,980
bitten you so hard.

395
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,680
It's just a minor injury.

396
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,080
Mr. Gu and Miss Qiao Yan

397
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,340
are having a hard time.

398
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,040
They must be very sad.

399
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,440
[The marriage of a rich family
breaks rapidly.]

400
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,360
[The Gu's Group may plunge
into its biggest crisis.]

401
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
It must have been leaked by Qin Ziyu.

402
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,600
Miss Qiao.

403
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,160
Mr. Qin asked me

404
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,760
to make you
this white fungus soup with longan.

405
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,930
Thank you. Put it there.

406
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,080
Mr. Qin asked you to rest early.

407
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,760
He has a dinner appointment today

408
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,090
and will come back late.

409
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,480
Where is it?

410
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:09,920
Mom.

411
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,000
Please bless me

412
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,320
so that Qin Ziyu
will be brought to justice.

413
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
To my son Ziyu,

414
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,040
If anything happens to me,

415
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,570
I'll leave the Qin's to you.

416
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,600
I saw what you were hiding.

417
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,040
Forget everything you've done.

418
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,970
Dad will take all the blame for you.

419
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,240
Don't avenge me.

420
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,520
Remember, be patient.

421
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,900
You must protect the Qin's first.

422
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,530
I've done many wrong things in my life,

423
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,720
but you'll always be my beloved son.

424
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,720
What did Qin Ziyu do?

425
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,100
Is my parents' death also related to him?

426
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,160
You and your grandfather
were fooled by him.

427
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,880
I think

428
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,720
Gu Jingyuan

429
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,250
may be related to your father's death.

430
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,200
Why did Qin Ziyu

431
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,840
drive a wedge between Jingyuan and me
with that matter?

432
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,600
Was Qin Mian not the only one

433
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,340
who killed my parents?

434
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,930
There was someone else?

435
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,120
Who?

436
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,080
It's me.

437
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,530
Have you gone to bed?

438
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,920
I brought you some snacks.

439
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,000
Do you want some?

440
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,200
Sure.

441
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,560
What's wrong?

442
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,650
No appetite?

443
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,400
Qin Ziyu.

444
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,640
Did you spread the news

445
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,210
about my divorce with Gu Jingyuan?

446
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,840
Are you unhappy about it?

447
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,000
I...

448
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm not.

449
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,060
I'm just...

450
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,480
I just think

451
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,080
if

452
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,000
the news of divorce gets out,

453
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
it might do harm to

454
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,960
the Gu's Group.

455
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,610
Isn't this the best time

456
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,730
to deal with the Gu's Group?

457
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,500
W-W-What's your plan?

458
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,370
I want to help you

459
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,440
take back the Gu's Group.

460
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,960
Although you're Chairwoman Qiao now,

461
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,620
Gu Jingyuan has been in his position
for so long.

462
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,660
He shouldn't be underestimated.

463
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,480
That's why

464
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,240
I tired to get his ledger

465
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,620
and disrupt his capital flow.

466
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,170
Do you want me

467
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,650
not to deal with him?

468
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,360
No.

469
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,600
I

470
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
must get the Gu's Group back.

471
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,560
I just think

472
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,000
what we're doing

473
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,440
might also

474
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,720
cause us

475
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
great losses.

476
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,130
Don't worry.

477
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
I know what to do.

478
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,480
By the way,

479
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
will you go back to the company
in the next few days?

480
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,220
I want to go back to the company tomorrow.

481
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:21,820
Because

482
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,880
I have a regular meeting tomorrow.

483
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,960
If I don't go,

484
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,340
Gu Jingyuan

485
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,210
might take advantage of it.

486
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,520
I'll go with you then.

487
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,240
Uh...

488
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,880
I don't think so.

489
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,370
Well,

490
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,880
there are many shareholders
in the company.

491
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,080
It's improper for you

492
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,320
to go there.

493
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,800
Trust me.

494
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,020
I can handle it myself.

495
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,000
Qiao Yan,

496
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,640
Thank you.

497
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,700
Thank you for coming into my life.

498
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,800
I still want to thank you.

499
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,740
Thank you for coming into my life.

500
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

501
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,840
I'm sorry.

502
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,200
Check

503
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,250
if this phone can still be used?

504
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,660
[Please enter the password.]

505
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,880
It's fine.

506
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,480
Look.

507
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,520
Qiao Yan.

508
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,120
Sorry.

509
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,480
I was too impulsive just now.

510
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,000
No.

511
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,680
It's my fault.

512
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm not ready yet.

513
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,250
Qiao Yan,

514
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,040
I've always liked you.

515
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,720
You are a ray of light in my life.

516
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,680
When I was in despair,

517
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,360
it was you

518
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,720
who gave me hope so I could live on.

519
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,520
As long as you give me a chance,

520
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,200
I can be really good to you.

521
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,080
I can be a good husband,

522
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,960
a good father.

523
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,080
I'm a little

524
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,360
sleepy.

525
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,120
I'm going back to my room.

526
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,560
Qiao Yan,

527
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,360
don't let me down.
