Please read it.

344
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,770
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

345
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,880
On the Parent-Child Day,

346
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,640
I'll offer free admission
to families that visit the space

347
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,040
for the experience event

348
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,200
so that everyone knows

349
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,280
Gu's Group

350
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,280
can not only make economic value

351
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,480
but also achieve human care.

352
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
What's more, on the Parent-Child Day,

353
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,040
I will open the live stream room

354
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
to convey the children's feelings

355
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,200
in a timely manner

356
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,460
and receive real-time supervision
of the society.

357
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,360
Then we'll invite some parents

358
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,250
to experience it with the kids.

359
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
What do you think?

360
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:07,960
Hey!

361
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,120
I think there's still a problem.

362
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,720
What is it?

363
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,080
How about this?

364
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,880
Ask Lin Ze

365
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,760
to focus on the inspection of fire safety

366
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,040
and catering issues.

367
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,440
This must be safe.

368
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,780
And we must be careful.

369
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,480
Yes.

370
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,640
I think our event

371
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,900
will definitely be very successful.

372
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,280
We'll defeat Qin Mian, that sly fox,
at one stroke.

373
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,490
Give me five.

374
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,560
Aren't you quite close to that little fox?

375
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,520
You mean Qin Ziyu?

376
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,760
I haven't talked much to him. Okay?

377
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,080
How would we be close to each other?

378
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,680
Besides,

379
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,850
even if I'm close to him,

380
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,640
I can't help our enemy, right?

381
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,280
Hello?

382
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,240
What's wrong?

383
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,330
Feng has been arrested.

384
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,930
Hello, what's going on now?

385
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,760
We found the suspect when he was trying to
illegally leave our country.

386
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,920
During the pursuit,

387
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,520
the suspect fled to the road

388
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,720
and was hit by a truck.

389
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,040
After emergency treatment,

390
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,640
his life is out of danger now.

391
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,520
But his head is severely injured,

392
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,760
so he can't wake up for the time being.

393
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,600
Did the doctor say

394
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,800
when he would wake up?

395
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,960
Thank you.

396
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,240
Once he wakes up,

397
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,640
let me know immediately.

398
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,260
Thanks for your hard work.

399
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,320
Let's go back.

400
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,840
If he dies,

401
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,760
or he never wakes up,

402
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,360
then we won't be able to
catch the real murderer anymore, huh?

403
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,560
It won't be like that.

404
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,180
Justice has long arms.

405
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,200
The criminals

406
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,920
will be punished.

407
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,600
You're right.

408
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
The truth will come out eventually.

409
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:27,920
Yes.

410
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,400
What a pity.

411
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,440
He has been arrested.

412
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,880
But we lost the clue.

413
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,800
As for the person who killed Hai,

414
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,920
I'll definitely make him pay the price.

415
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,560
Yeah.

416
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,400
Tell me what you want to say.

Mr. Gu.

418

I really don't think

419
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,410
this has anything to do with Jingyuan.

420
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,080
Otherwise, he wouldn't have

421

saved Miss Qiao Yan again and again.

422
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,320
Miss Qiao Yan is so smart.

423
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,540
I believe in her judgment.

424
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,650
I understand

425

what you said.

the company's operations now.

they won't let me down.
