Just being prepared, that's all.

176
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,730
What exactly happened?

177
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,000
Can you tell me?

178
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
You've been acting strange lately.

179
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,130
We've been through so much.

180
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,280
If something's wrong, you can tell me.

181
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,720
We'll face it together.

182
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,000
There really is nothing.

183
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,880
I haven't done well enough these days.

184
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,280
I'll make it up to you.

185
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,160
Mm.

186
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,850
Where are you going?

187
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
I want to be alone.

188
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,960
I should go.

189
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,560

Yan,

193
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,440
how am I supposed to tell you

194
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,680
I'm Qin Mian's son?

195
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,770
But he was the one
who killed your parents.

196
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,000
And in my veins,

197
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,800
flows his blood.

198
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,370
You're quite punctual.

199
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,810
Just spit it out.

200
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,720
Director Lu,

201
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,620
you've got some nerve.

202
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
You want Qiao Yan.

203
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,700
I want Gu Jingyuan.

204
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,400
We each take what we need.

205
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,240
But now,

206
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,920
I'm not just interested
in playing the game

207
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,520
of wrecking their marriage.

208
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,920
Don't beat around the bush.

209
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,980
I'll be frank then.

210
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,980
I want to completely bring down Gu's.

211
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,920
Your father hates Gu's the most.

212
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
He fell at the hands of the Gu family.

213
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,840
Mr. Qin, you must desperately want

214
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,240
to take back
what belongs to the Qin family.

215
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,080
So, are you willing to join me

216
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,560
in taking back

217
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,680
what belongs to us?

218
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,740
Maybe only if Yuan and I

219
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,800
go back to the time

220
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,360
when we had nothing,

221
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,360
will he belong to me forever.

222
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,200
Looks like

223
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,540
we are the same kind of people.

Cheers.

You want me to steal Gu's account records?

226
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,260

I want all relevant files.

Mr. Qin,

231
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,520
that's stealing trade secrets.

232
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,720

But he won't tell me.

Could it have something to do with me?

309

I have to get to the bottom of this.

Why don't you just
investigate Gu Jingyuan directly?

He is so vigilant.

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,360
Okay.

318
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,290

always working overtime.

348
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,000
He thought

349
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,500
if he came home so late,

350
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,280
he might disturb my rest.

351
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,840
So,

352
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,970
we sleep in separate rooms occasionally.

353
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,420
Working overtime?

354
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,920
Is he that busy?

355
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,840
You two have been acting weird lately.

356
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Tell me the truth.

357
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,930
What exactly happened?

358
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,880
Really,

359
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,960
nothing.

360
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,650
Grandpa,

361
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,360
don't worry.

362
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,660
We really didn't have a fight.

363
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,860
Rest early.

364
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,860
I'm going back to rest.

365
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
Qin Ziyu asked you to do this, right?

366
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,650
[Delete]

367
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,650
Just resign on your own.

368
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,960
Doesn't Director Lu work for Mr. Gu?

369
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,020
Why did she resign?

370
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,320
I heard

371
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,200
she was caught by Mr. Gu in the act

372
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,320
of secretly photographing
confidential company documents.

373
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,080
Really?

374
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,400
I don't know.

375
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,200
That's what everyone's saying.

376
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,910
[Gu Group]

377
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,520
Gu's design director, Lu Wanqing,
suddenly resigned.

378
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,560
The reason remains unknown.

379
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,620

developed by Gu's with full commitment

[Live]

381
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,700
is still underway.

382
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,360
It's unclear
whether Lu Wanqing's resignation

383
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,420
will affect the project's progress.

384
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,930
What a surprise.

385
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,120
I didn't expect you to ask me out.

386
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,160
I want to know

387
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,860
why you suddenly left Gu's Group.

388
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,720
Didn't Yuan tell you?

389
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,920
What exactly is he...

390
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,960
Do you know something?

391
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,920
You shouldn't ask me.

392
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,140
You should ask your Jingyuan.

393
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,450
If Yuan didn't tell you,

394
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,800
I won't either.

395
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,800
Forget it.

396
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,960
You are husband and wife.

397
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,290
But he won't tell you anything.

398
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:15,840
It seems

399
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,800
he doesn't trust you that much.

400
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
At least he doesn't think

401
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,370
you're worthy of sharing his burdens.

402
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,700
Coming to you today

403
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,160
is my mistake.

404
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,540
Gu Jingyuan is my husband.

405
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
I should believe everything he does

406
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,400
is for our family.

407
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,900
As for anything about him,

408
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,520
I shouldn't hear them from an outsider.
