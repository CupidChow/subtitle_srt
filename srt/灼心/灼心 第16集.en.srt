Hello, Miao.

What should I do?

00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,600
You don't have to be so nervous.

Have you never

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,900
Are you going to

181
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,640
keep calling me that?

182
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,200
How about I call you Dad

183
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
as Jingyuan does?

184
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
What do you think?

185
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,620
I'm willing to be your grandson-in-law.

186
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,040
Okay.

187
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,600
Okay.

188
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,440
You two

189
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
call me the way you used to.

190
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,090
Okay.

191
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
Now, let's eat.

192
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,800
Ice water.

193
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,410
Goddess.

194
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,940
You need to take good care
of your stomach today.

195
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,320
Are you worried about my stomach

196
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,780
or are you worried that
I'm feeling so unwell

197
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,720
that I can't make it up to you?

198
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,560
Hey.

199
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,680
Why are you blushing?

200
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,720
Yan, stop it.

201
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,260
Stop it.

202
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,060
Why are you so cute?

203
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,880
Find a proper occasion
to show your intimacy.

204
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,240
Okay?

205
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,560
Although I'm old,

206
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,760
I've

207
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,720
never been a third wheel.

208
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,080
You

209
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
took away my son.

210
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,360
You

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,600
took away my granddaughter.

212
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,920
Now,

213
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,200
I'm all alone.

214
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,320
Humph.

215
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,880
Grandpa.

216
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,120
Are you jealous?

217
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,640
No.

218
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,080
Grandpa, you should think this way:

219
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,440
well,

220
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,360
I

221
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
brought you

222
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,290
a grandson-in-law;

223
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,640
he

224
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,240
brought you

225
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,400
a daughter-in-law.

226
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,320
This is called

227
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,890
"Don't let outsiders
take advantage of you."

228
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,290
You're really a sweet-talker.

229
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,200
Well said.

230
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,560
All right.

231
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,360
Let's eat now.

232
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,210
Okay.

233
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,740
By the way, Dad,

234
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,380
I want to discuss something with you.

235
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,760
Since I've given up

236
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,600
being the adopted son of the Gu family,

237
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,200
I think

238
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,760
I have to go to the company

239
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,360
and resign from my position.

240
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,160
What?

241
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,680
Are you worried people at the company

242
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,880
will gossip about us?

243
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,200
Yes.

244
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,120
I can't let

245
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,250
my family and the Gu's Group

246
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,280
be gossiped about because of me.

247
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,380
I've been thinking these days

248
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,320
that though Yan joined the company

249
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,050
not long ago,

250
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,880
she's smart and capable.

251
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,120
I can help her

252
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,010
with managing the company.

253
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,120
Slow down.

254
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,570
What's the rush?

255
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,680
No.

256
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,080
How am I capable of managing the company?

257
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Why can't you?

258
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,880
You are so capable

259
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,600
and smart.

260
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,280
What makes you think so?

261
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,360
I can't even read a balance sheet.

262
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,820
I can teach you how to do it.

263
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,520
We had a deal before we got married.

264
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,360
You make money and I spend it,

265
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,680
right?

266
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,080
Well.

267
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,520
Why should I take over the company?

268
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,680
Hey, Yan.

269
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,200
I...

270
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,200
Jingyuan.

271
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
I won't interfere

272
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,650
in you two's business anymore.

273
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,400
In the future,

274
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,720
I'll

275
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,720
just exercise

276
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
and keep fit

277
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,859
so that I can be expecting your child.

278
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,970
After getting married,

279
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,300
you're grown-ups now.

280
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,720
You can discuss to
decide everything yourselves.

281
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,050
Okay?

282
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,480
Now,

283
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,880
let's eat.

284
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,480
Let's eat.

285
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,960
Why do you think

286
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,880
Qiao Yan

287
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,360
called us in this big office?

288
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,010
Is she preparing to take over the company?

289
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,760
Miss Qiao Yan is still young,

290
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,120
and has never done any business.

291
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
After all,

292
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,920
compared to Mr. Gu, she's outdone.

293
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,680
If Chairman Gu retires,

294
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,240
and Mr. Gu leaves the Gu's Group,

295
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
what should we do?

296
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,120
Then we'll have no leader.

297
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,160
What should we do?

298
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,960
Yeah.

299
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,120
Sorry, everyone,

300
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,650
I'm late.

301
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,680
I gather you here today

302
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,680
to tell you

303
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,080
about the recent changes
of the Gu's Group.

304
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,210
and at the same time,

305
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,940
to clarify rumors of me
taking over the company.

306
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,360
I know you're all worried

307
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,520
that Mr. Gu will leave the Gu's Group.

308
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,040
Here,

309
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,680
I can promise you

310
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,940
that Mr. Gu's position

311
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,160
won't change.

312
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,260
Although Mr. Gu

313
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,050
gave up being
the adopted son of the Gu family,

314
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
he's my husband

315
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,600
and he's still a member of the Gu family.

316
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,080
I'll focus on taking care
of my grandpa at home.

317
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,860
From now on,

318
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,880
Mr. Gu and you guys

319
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,520
will forge ahead with

320
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,450
developing the Gu's Group.

321
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,330
As the heiress to Chairman Gu's position,

322
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,680
Qiao Yan will make best use of time

323
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,480
to learn the business of the company.

324
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,960
I hope you'll join me

325
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,480
to fully support her.

326
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,760
Of course.

327
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,240
The Gu's Group

328
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,840
will be better and better

329
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,520
with you two.

330
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,300
I'll give my full support.

331
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,840
We support you!

332
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,900
We all support you.

333
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,670
[Choose]

334
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,360
[Han Miao]

335
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,940
Don't drink too much today.
Remember what to do!

336
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,880
Don't worry.

337
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,920
I'm waiting for Jingyuan.
We'll do it together.

338
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,650
So romantic.

339
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,280
Wish you a happy, romantic wedding night.

340
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,560
Enjoy it.

341
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,360
Still busy?

342
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,790
[I'll be home late. Go to bed first.]

343
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'll be back soon.

344
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,100
Go to bed first.

345
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,660
I'll be right back.

346
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,640
Can we talk?

347
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,780
It'll only take a few minutes.

348
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,520
I won't take you much time.

349
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,900
You'll meet your newlywed wife soon.

350
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,780
Have a seat.

351
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,400
No need.

352
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,660
This is for you.

353
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,820
I haven't officially congratulated you
on your marriage.

354
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,880
Thank you.

355
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,760
At least,

356
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,080
you look happy.

357
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
So I don't regret

358
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,920
for not taking you away from her.

359
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,540
By the way, one more thing.

360
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,850
Qin Ziyu likes Qiao Yan.

361
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
He asked me to help make you break up.

362
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,290
Director Lu.

363
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,960
Qin Ziyu.

364
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,370
It's boring to drink alone.

365
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,200
Let me drink with you.

366
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,920
I don't think we're close enough

367
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,980
to drink together.

368
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,880
Looks like

369
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,200
today's wedding

370
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
not only got me heartbroken.

371
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,560
Why are you heartbroken?

372
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,760
Do you

373
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,000
like Qiao Yan?

374
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,480
Of course.

375
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,600
Lunatic.

376
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Your dad killed Qiao Yan's parents.

377
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,520
So what?

378
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,600
I won't give up

379
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,080
the woman I love.

380
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,210
Can you stand seeing

381
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Gu Jingyuan be taken away by others?

382
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,140
What are you trying to say?

383
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,810
I don't like your beating around the bush.

384
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,880
We have the same goal.

385
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,880
So,

386
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,640
we can cooperate.

387
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,560
Anyway,

388
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,200
be careful.

389
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,920
Thank you.

390
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,080
Can you give me a hug?

391
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,480
I...

392
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,240
Don't get me wrong.

393
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,680
I just...

394
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,840
One day,

395
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,680
you will find your Mr. Right.

396
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,540
I'm here to take you...

397
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,330
Home.

398
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,680
Don't be jealous.

399
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,200
I'm just here to congratulate

400
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,560
Yuan on his marriage.

401
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,920
I even gave him a gift.

402
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,560
Here it is.

403
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,280
Well.

404
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,200
Why would Yan be jealous?

405
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,900
Why did you come in person?

406
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,400
Mm?

407
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,440
I missed you.

408
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,160
I missed you too.

409
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,440
Okay.

410
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,040
If you want to be intimate,

411
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,080
go home first.

412
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,160
Think about me.

413
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,880
I don't want to see this.

414
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,280
Bye.

415
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,120
You...

416
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:55,970
Well.

417
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,640
Yan.

418
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,720
Yan!
