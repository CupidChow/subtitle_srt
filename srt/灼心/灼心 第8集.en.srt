[Episode 8]

3
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,740
[Gu Jingyuan's biological father
reported his refusal to provide for him]

4
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,250
My name is He Wei.

5
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,740
I'm the father of Gu Jingyuan,

6
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,039
who's the President of Gu's Group.

7
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,400
Under my real name, I'm reporting that

8
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,480
he favors the rich and disdains the poor,

9
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,080
a-and he's an ungrateful man

10
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,840
as he refuses to provide for his father.

11
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,240
Do you have any evidence?

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,720
Yes.

13
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,650
All of this is the evidence.

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,080
At that time, Yuan...

15
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,780
Gu Jingyuan was called

16
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,170
He Yuan at that time.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,479
After his mother died,

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,970
he thought his family was poor,

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,080
so he went to the welfare house himself
and claimed to be an orphan.

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,400
When I found him,

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,240
he had been adopted by Chairman Gu.

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,140
He refused to recognize me as his father.

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,449
All these years,

24
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,250
he has never cared about me.

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,880
But I never thought that

26
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,780
though he used to steal stuff,

27
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,480
now

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,650
for the so-called bidding,

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,480
he would even take advantage of the kids.

30
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,600
I... I... I...

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,640
I can't let him harm others.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,079
Right?

33
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,320
[Gu Jingyuan's biological father
reported his refusal to provide for him]

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,970
After all...

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,100
After all, I'm his father.

Did you steal my stuff?

00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,520
I didn't steal it.

It wasn't me.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,720
You're lying! It was you!

-Yes, it was you.
-It was you.

63

Take it out now.

64

Take it out!

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,980
Take it out at once!

67
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,560

Take it out.

73

I didn't steal it.

Take it out now!

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,090
I saw it with my own eyes.

76
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,120
You stole it.

77
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,040
You stole it.

78
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
-Yes, it was him!
-It was him!

I didn't steal it.

It wasn't me.

It was you

82
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,560
who stole my mom's wallet!

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
I didn't steal it.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
Because you're a bastard child.

85
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,480
A bastard child would steal wallets.

86
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,210
Little liar,

87
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,040
if you still refuse to give it to me,

88
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,760
I'll ask your dad to beat you up.

89
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
I didn't steal it.

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,520
You're still denying it?

91
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,920
I really didn't steal it.

92
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,120
Hey, He Wei.

93
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,960
Your bastard son stole something.

94
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,360
Will you discipline him or not?

95
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,680
He... He stole something?

96
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,080
Yes.

97
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Little bastard!

98
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,410
H-How dare you steal stuff?

99
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,120
I didn't steal anything.

100
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,400
You're still lying?

101
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,860
I'll beat you to death!

102
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,120
He deserves to be beaten up.

103
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,640
How dare you steal stuff?

104
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,300
-Beat him up!
-He deserves it!

105
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,279
How dare you steal stuff?

106
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,500
How dare you...

107
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
I didn't steal it.

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
How dare you steal stuff?

109
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,240
Just let him beat you to death,
bastard child!

110
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,280
How dare you steal stuff?

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,000
Bastard child!

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
-He deserves it!
-Beat him to death!

113
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,480
How dare you steal stuff?

114
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
You wicked thief!

115
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,159
Bastard child!

116
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,240
Will you steal stuff again?

117
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I didn't steal it!

118
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,400
Oh!

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,120
Isn't this my son, who's a president?

120
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,520
What's wrong?

121
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,400
You finally found your way home?

122
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,320
Huh?

123
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,040
Isn't this very familiar to you?

124
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,900
Are you quite touched?

125
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,760
Call me Dad.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Let me hear it.

127
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,330
You've never looked for me.

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,660
Why did you lie?

129
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,690
I want money.

130
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,360
I've raised you for so many years.

131
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,560
Isn't it quite normal

132
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,480
to ask for compensation?

133
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,080
If you had just wanted money,

134
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,680
you wouldn't have needed to
slander me from the start.

135
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,340
What on earth is your purpose?

136
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,940
Because I want to destroy you.

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,300
Because you didn't make me happy.

138
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,770
That annoying woman

139
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,040
gave birth to a bastard child like you.

140
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,400
I shouldn't have let you be born!

141
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,060
He Wei, you're such a villain!

142
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,360
What?

143
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,280
As the President of Gu's Group, you think

144
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,140
you're a member

145
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,340
of the upper class?

146
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:50,960
Huh?

147
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,320
You are just a bastard child.

148
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,780
A bastard child that no one wants!

149
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,760
You want me to keep living

150
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,290
in my childhood nightmare.

151
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,840
He Wei, let me tell you. Dream on!

152
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,280
I know

153
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,580
you have many ways to deal with me.

154
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,330
However,

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,240
don't you want to know
where your mom, Luo Qian, is?

156
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,330
Your mom is not dead.

157
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,600
I lied to you.

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If you piss me off,

159
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,120
I can do anything.

160
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,240
Do you dare to risk

161
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,730
your mom's life?

162
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,600
Why should I trust you?

163
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,020
Lin Ze, have you got in touch with him?

164
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,400
I got it.

165
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,360
Qiao Yan!

166
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,179
Are you going to look for Yuan?

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,530
Wanqing.

168
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,320
Do you know about He Wei?

169
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,520
This is

170
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,039
what he hates to talk about the most.

171
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,320
He Wei

172
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,180
is not his biological father.

173
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,240
What?

174
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,980
He merely married his mother.

175
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,640
He Wei

176
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
is a scoundrel.

177
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,250
Every time he got drunk,

178
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,700
he liked to hit others.

179
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,970
What's more,

180
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,890
he was a habitual thief.

181
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,720
When people found out about it,

182
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,520
he would let Yuan be the scapegoat.

183
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,450
Because of that,

184
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,740
Yuan was beaten up many times.

185
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,160
No matter how hard he tried to refute it,

186
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,290
no one believed him.

187
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,160
So later,

188
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,290
whenever he's criticized,

189
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,060
he won't defend himself anymore.

190

193
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,780
When he's in a bad mood,

194
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,850
he doesn't want others to disturb him.

195
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,680
But I think

196
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
he probably hopes
that others can find him.

197
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,730

Yes?

667
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,120
Regarding the Parent-Child Day incident,

668
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,250
don't worry. I'll handle it properly.

669
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,960
As for the land we're bidding for,

670
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,520
we'll certainly get it.

671
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,000
I believe

672
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,160
you will definitely handle it well.

673
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,690
Alright.

674
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,040
Let's not talk about this now.

675

Let's eat.

676
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,840
Okay.

677
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,820
Be careful.

678
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,480
Thank you, Uncle.

Oh.

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,890
This is strange.

686
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,930
Why is my heart beating so fast?

687
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,440
Am I really drunk?
