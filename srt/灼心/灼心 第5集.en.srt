175
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,460
in Germany.

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,660
What clues?

177
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Fill me in.

178
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Here's the thing.

179
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,250
The German police found

180
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,760
the vehicle abandoned by the suspect
the other day.

181
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,480
The surveillance video on the street

182
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,540
showed that he had got out of that car.

183
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,290
I'll send you the photos later.

184
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,520
Yan.

185
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,080
Okay.

186
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,960
The company's stock price
has decreased so much.

187
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,560
But there's no news from the higher-ups.

188
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,420
Without Mr. Gu,

189
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,720
who else can help the company
get through this crisis at this time?

190
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,520
Hello, Mr. Gu.

191
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,560
Hello, Mr. Gu.

192
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,890
-Mr. Gu.
-Hello, Mr. Gu.

193
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,090
No more chatter.

194
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,080
Focus on your work.

195
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,480
The PR department is monitoring
and guiding the employees.

196
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,760
The information department is
investigating the source of the rumors.

197
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,240
The results will come out soon.

198
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,170
Within two days.

199
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,200
Okay.

200
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,880
Miss.

201
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,720
Let me take the luggage
into the car first.

202
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,050
Okay.

203
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,200
Grandpa.

204
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,320
Yes.

205
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,890
I've finished packing.

206
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,840
Okay.

207
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,560
Miss Qiao.

208
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,720
You like taro pies made by me.

209
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,680
So I made some.

210
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,180
You can eat them on the way.

211
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,260
Thank you, Yue.

212
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,320
Well.

213
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,240
You're leaving in such a hurry.

214
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,400
There're many dishes
I haven't cooked for you.

215
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,680
Then cook them for me
when I'm back during holiday.

216
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,120
Go.

217
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,720
Let me see you off.

218
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,200
Grandpa.

219
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,360
Is the company in a big trouble?

220
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,920
Don't worry.

221
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,940
Jingyuan will handle it well.

222
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:03,920
Okay.

223
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,360
Yan.

224
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,440
I should support you
in realizing your dream.

225
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,280
But remember,

226
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,520
this is your home.

227
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,760
I will

228
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
wait for you to come back.

229
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,290
Okay.

230
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,490
Okay.

231
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,160
Boss.

232
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,000
Well,

233
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,200
the Xijiang Businessmen Charity Dinner
is scheduled tonight.

234
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
He sent you the invitation
half a month ago.

235
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,760
I got the news

236
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,960
that Qin Mian will definitely go there.

237
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,920
There must be a lot of journalists
at the dinner.

238
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,450
Should I decline it for you?

239
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Tell them I'll go.

240
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,160
Okay.

241
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,550
I'll send him a reply.

242
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:15,470
[Xijiang City Businessmen Charity Dinner]

243
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,860
Coming.

244
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,340
Coming.

245
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,160
Mr. Qin.

246
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,530
Rumor has it that

247
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,480
the current crisis of the Gu's

248
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,960
was caused by the Qin's.

249
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,880
Is that true?

250
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,640
Yes, tell us about it.

251
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,080
Say something.

252
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,600
Mr. Qin.

253
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,880
Of course it's fake news.

254
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,440
I'm very confident that I'll win

255
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,560
the battle against the Gu's this time.

256
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,640
What do you think about the battle

257
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,680
between the adopted son and the real
granddaughter of the Gu family?

258
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,280
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,840
This is their family matter.

260
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,570
It's not proper for me to judge.

261
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Mr. Gu is here.

262
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,720
Mr. Gu.

263
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,280
Hurry up. This way.

264
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,680
Mr. Gu.
Mr. Gu.

265
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,160
Mr. Gu.

266
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,160
Didn't you hand the resign application
to leave the Gu's?

267
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,960
Why are you attending the dinner
on behalf of the Gu's today?

268
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,400
Yes, please tell us about it.

269
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,960
Say something.

270
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,220
Say something, Mr. Gu.

271
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,880
Mr. Gu.

272
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,200
Please say something.

273
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,800
Thank you.

274
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,320
Mr. Gu.

275
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,730
Nice to meet you.

276
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,570
Say hello to Chairman Gu for me.

277
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,940
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

278
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,200
Mr. Qin just said

279
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,480
he was confident to beat the Gu's
to win the bidding.

280
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,720
What do you think?

281
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,780
It's good to be confident.

282
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,880
But I'm afraid

283
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,980
Mr. Qin will be disappointed.

284
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,960
I'll wait and see.

285
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,240
I've always admired you
as a young achiever.

286
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,700
There's a saying you should know.

287
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
"If you don't sweep a room,

288
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
how can you sweep the world?"

289
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
I'm not sure

290
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,760
what this saying means to me.

291
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,000
By the way,

292
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,730
it's an important occasion today.

293
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
How come the heiress of the Gu family
didn't come?

294
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,720
Has she returned to Germany?

295
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,720
It seems that the rumor is true.

296
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,560
Mr. Gu won.

297
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,040
Yes.

298
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,300
The real granddaughter of the Gu's
was made to leave by him.

299
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,200
Miss Qiao Yan.

300
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,640
Rumor has it that you and Mr. Gu
are on bad terms.

301
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,400
Is it true?

302
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,720
Uncle and I are family.

303
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
We'll fight together in the future

304
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
and manage the Gu's Group together.

305
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,280
I hope you won't believe the rumors online.

306
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,920
All are crazy stories.

307
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,180
"The heiress is back."

308
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,780
"Family Fortune War."

309
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,330
Too dramatic to be true.

310
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,940
Our life is not a drama.

311
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,040
They seem to be getting along well.

312
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,520
Yes, they are in a good relationship.

313
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,080
Yes.

314
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,800
It seems the rumor is not true.

315
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,880
Hurry up.

316
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,400
They look so harmonious.

317
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,330
Are they acting?

318
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,040
They're willing to be united
to face the media.

319
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,360
It shows their relationship
is not that bad.

320
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,880
I think they are acting.

321
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,080
So why did you ask me to keep you?

322
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,320
Didn't you need me all of a sudden?

323
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,880
Qiao Yan.

324
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,810
Let's talk about this later.
Get through this first.

325
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,560
-Hello, Mr. Gu.
-Hello, Mr. Gu.

326
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,360
Hello, Mr. Gu.

327
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,320
Hello, Mr. Gu.

328
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,200
Hello, Mr. Gu.

329
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,680
Hello.

330
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,840
Good for you, Mr. Gu.

331
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,130
You must be a social butterfly.

332
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,370
What are you talking about?

333
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,610
I mean you're handsome.

334
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,580
She is Chairman Gu's granddaughter?

335
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,560
She is

336
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,080
quite good-looking.

337
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,640
It seems

338
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,690
she and Mr. Gu are really close.

339
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,520
They're acting in front of outsiders.

340
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,600
I heard from someone in Gu's Group that

341
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,520
Chairman Gu left all his assets

342
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,280
to his granddaughter.

343
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,880
Mr. Gu got nothing.

344
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,650
Hey, Yan.

345
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Yan, are you okay?

346
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,520
I almost fell down.

347
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm fine.

348
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,520
I'll get something to eat.

349
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,650
You have a nice talk.

350
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,960
Yan, how about you...

351
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,520
My foot hurts.

352
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,480
Mr. Gu.

353
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:04,839
Hello.

354
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,240
This lady is injured.

355
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,640
Please call her driver.

356
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,319
Okay.

357
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,900
No need.

358
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
You can leave now.

359
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,200
I just need to take a short rest with you.

360
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,680
Honey.

361
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,490
Are you okay?

362
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,440
Mr. Gu.

363
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,119
I heard everything.

364
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,640
You're so bad.

365
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,800
He Yue asked you out several times.

366
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,000
But you never agreed.

367
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,119
I've been busy with work,

368
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,640
so I don't have much time.

369
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,720
Mr. Gu.

370
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,640
You should strike a balance

371
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,240
between your work and life.

372
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,220
How about this?

373
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,960
Next week,

374
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,640
there'll be a nice art exhibition.

375
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,200
Why don't we...

376
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,760
Mr. Gu.

377
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,440
Mr. Du from Jingong Construction
has been looking for you.

378
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,400
Let me take you there.

379
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:49,800
Okay.

380
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,480
Miss He.

381
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,860
Mr. Gu has to leave.

382
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,380
She is Lu Wanqing,
creative director of Gu's Group.

383
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,400
The Hes are a rich family.

384
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,930
Mr. Gu, you're quite lucky.

385
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,320
Stop joking.

386
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,000
I missed you, honey.

387
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,280
I missed you, honey.

388
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,540
Do you remember me?

389
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,000
It's really you.

390
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Thank you

391
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,360
for what happened last time.

392
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,820
You're welcome, Qiao Yan.

393
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,240
How did you know my name?

394
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,530
Everyone knows that

395
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,620
the heiress of the Gu's came back.

396
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,000
By the way,

397
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,780
My name is Qin Ziyu.

398
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,480
We've both

399
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,690
made self-introductions.

400
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,080
Yes.

401
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,480
Aren't you here for the party?

402
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:51,960
Why

403
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,300
are you alone here?

404
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680
I just came out to get some fresh air.

405
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,020
What about you?

406
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,880
Are you here?

407
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,440
Ziyu.

408
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,610
Are you trying to sneak away again?

409
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,320
Dad.

410
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,080
It's the same for you.

411
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,280
You're leaving too?

412
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,680
He's Qin Mian's son.

413
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,760
By the way.

414
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,480
Let me introduce her to you.

415
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,080
This is...

416
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,120
Qiao Yan.

417
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,040
You took your mother's surname.

418
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,200
Sorry.

419
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,570
That's my personal matter.

420
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,840
Wait.

421
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,060
I want to make it clear that

422
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,520
the fight between the Gu's and the Qin's

423
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,720
has nothing to do with me.

424
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,760
What my dad did

425
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,240
doesn't show my intention.

426
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,200
So you admit

427
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,460
your dad did something bad to Gu's Group?

428
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,160
No.

429
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,800
You misunderstood.

430
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,120
I mean I just came back.

431
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,360
I don't want those things

432
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,760
to damage our friendship.

433
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,320
Stop.

434
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,600
We are not friends.

435
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,080
Well.

436
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,800
I did you a favor.

437
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
How can you be so ungrateful?

438
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,360
What favor?

439
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I don't remember.

440
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,320
You...

441
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,200
Cunning.

442
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,160
You like this piece of music?

443
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's Brahms's Sonata in D Minor.

444
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,820
It was composed

445
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,160
after Brahms's parents and friends

446
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,890
passed away one after another.

447
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,480
He felt desperately

448
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,820
the ruthlessness and inevitability

449
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,600
of death,

450
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,970
so he got into

451
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,580
a deep exploration

452
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,240
of the soul

453
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,600
and of the life.

454
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,160
I think

455
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,680
this sonata contains a lot of emotions.

456
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,840
Death is scary,

457
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,040
but human emotions

458
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,500
will not disappear because of death.

459
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,300
So the composer

460
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,690
put longings

461
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,800
into every note.

462
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,930
You know music well too?

463
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
It's just a hobby.

464
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,210
A music enthusiast.

465
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,520
I also hope that the Gu's Group
and the He's Group

466
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,380
can cooperate well in the future.

467
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,120
Mr. He.

468
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,840
Excuse me.

469
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,320
Excuse me

470
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,160
for interrupting.

471
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,560
I want to talk to Qiao Yan.

472
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,360
Let's talk next time.

473
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,720
Uncle.

474
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,690
Qiao Yan.

475
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,960
Be careful when making friends.

476
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,090
Do you know who he is?

477
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,680
He's Qin Mian's son.

478
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,700
If any journalist takes a photo of you,
they'll make up stories of you.

479
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,480
Why are you laughing?

480
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,040
I'm laughing because

481
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,160
actually,

482
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,360
you're not much older than me

483
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,640
but why do you

484
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,440
act like my old uncle every day?

485
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,300
I'm not acting.

486
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,640
I am your uncle.

487
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,300
Fine, you're my uncle.

488
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,240
She's acting like a fine lady.

489
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,640
She must be adopted by the Gu family.

490
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,260
She might not be the real granddaughter.

491
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,680
Miss Qiao Yan majors in music.

492
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,460
This is the perfect occasion for her.

493
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,840
Ladies and gentlemen,

494
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,240
Miss Qiao Yan from the Gu's Group

495
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,600
would like to give a performance

496
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,360
to raise money for the charity fund.

497
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
Please give her a round of applause.

498
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,680
Hello, I’m Qiao Yan.

499
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,780
It's my honor to attend
today's charity dinner.

500
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,520
As an excellent enterprise in Xijiang,

501
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,360
the Gu's Group has been devoted
to public welfare.

502
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,000
I believe

503
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,760
all excellent entrepreneurs here

504
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,180
are as responsible

505
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,840
as us.

506
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,490
I hope my performance today

507
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,400
can bring you blessings.

508
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,800
Wish you

509
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,740
good health

510
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,980
and safety.

511
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,080
Well said.

512
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,160
Let's see

513
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,560
how well she can play.

514
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,450
Since Yan is so happy today,

515
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,360
I'll join her to perform.

516
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,730
Hope our performance will please you.

517
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,040
My dream's always

518
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,580
been to be a violinist.

519
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,490
I will never compromise

520
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,400
on my life with anyone.

521
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,600
Good.

522
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,560
Good.

523
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,390
[Miss Qiao of the Gu family shows up
at the charity party]

524
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,580
[She and her uncle walked arm in arm,
quashing rumors of fighting for fortune]

525
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,360
Mr. Gu

526
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,080
made Miss Qiao Yan stay.

527
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,120
Miss Qiao Yan

528
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,980
has also announced her identity.

529
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,400
These two kids

530
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,060
did this for Gu family.

531
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,240
You should rest assured.

532
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,720
Yan can

533
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,840
learn from Jingyuan

534
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,960
how

535
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,760
to be a qualified successor.

536
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,080
Hey.

537
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What are you doing?

538
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
Can you tell me

539
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,480
why you suddenly decided to stay now?

540
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,610
I've found new clues

541
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,400
to my parents' matter.
