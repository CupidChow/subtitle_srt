Hey.

I don't like them.

I know what you're thinking.

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,960
Instead of mentally struggling here,

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,520
you might as well call Gu Jingyuan

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,720
and ask him directly.

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,460
Just ask him

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,450
what the engagement means.

33
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,480
He's two-timing you.

He's such a scumbag.

35

I'm not worried about his engagement.

I know he won't do that.

37

I'm just afraid that

38
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,920
he will solve the problem

39
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,050
by hurting himself.

40

42

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,600
You stopped my father back then.

178
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,760
But my father still loved my mother
for the rest of his life.

179
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,200
Now,

180
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,900
if you don't agree to my decision,

181
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,210
just like my father,

182
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,320
I will also never give up.

183
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,570
Grandpa!

184
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,200
Dad!

185
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,680
Grandpa!

186
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,000
Dad!

187
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:35,840
Dad!

188
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,690
Uncle Xu.

189
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,160
How is my grandpa now?

190
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,340
The doctor said

191
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,320
it was mainly caused by
emotional fluctuations.

192
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,780
There's nothing serious.

193
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,240
I'll go check on him.

194
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,520
Hey.

195
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,360
Yan.

196
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,040
Your grandpa is resting now.

197
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,290
It's so late.

198
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,130
You two should go back, too.

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,730
Grandpa doesn't want to see me.

200
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,200
It's okay.

201
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,280
Regarding this matter,

202
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,920
give him some time.

203
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
Your grandpa will figure it out.

204
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,090
Okay.

205
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,240
Hey, Uncle Xu.

206
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,020
We'll just stay here tonight.

207
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,680
What if something happens to my dad again?

208
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,560
At this critical moment,

209
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,760
if you disobey him,

210
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,860
you'll only make him angrier.

211
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Just go back home.

212
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,410
Alright.

213
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,730
Thank you for today.

214
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,620
We'll come tomorrow morning.

215
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,890
Let's go.

216
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:33,890
Okay.

217
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Just go back home.

218
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,120
Let's go.

219
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,640
Thank you.

220
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,410
Alright.

221
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,040
Mr. Gu.

222
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,080
Miss Qiao.

223
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,780
How is Chairman Gu?

224
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Don't worry, Yue.

225
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,520
The doctor said

226
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,400
he was fine after taking the medicine.

227
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,930
Thank God for blessing him.

228
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,120
Chairman Gu will be surely fine.

229
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,560
Yue.

230
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,360
It's getting late.

231
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,620
Go back and take a rest.

232
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,720
Okay.

233
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,600
Well,

234
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,120
you guys should rest early, too.

235
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,660
I can't leave Grandpa alone
in the hospital.

236
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,360
Yan.

237
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,720
Calm down.

238
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,460
I planned to bring you back home first

239
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,730
and then go there to take care of my dad.

240
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,850
Don't worry.

241
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,010
I'm here.

242
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,810
Alright?

243
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,660
I should be blamed.

244
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,610
Grandpa was angry with me and got sick.

245
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,580
The blame is certainly not on you.

246
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
It's all my fault.

247
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,840
Yan.

248
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,280
Yes?

249
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,720
Trust me.

250
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,570
I'll definitely make my dad accept us.

251
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,880
Now,

252
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,200
go back and have a good sleep.

253
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,000
After you wake up,

254
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,440
everything will be fine.

255
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,200
This is not your problem.

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,260
Falling in love with you is my own choice.

257
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,370
What's more,

258
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,400
my parents told me that

259
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,980
when you really love someone,

260
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,120
no matter how many difficulties

261
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,980
and grievances

262
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,420
you encounter,

263
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,920
it will still be worth it.

264
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,960
That will only make this love

265
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,000
shine more brightly.

266
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,650
I'm sorry...

267
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,900
for making you suffer so much with me.

268
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,900
But I'd like to say thank you, too.

269
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,460
Thank you for coming into my life.

270
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,320
Xu.

271
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,840
Xu.

272
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,920
Water.

273
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,000
Why are you here?

274
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,840
Why can't I be here?

275
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,520
Uncle Xu
can't look after you for so long alone.

276
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,080
Besides,

277
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,250
isn't it my duty to take care of you?

278
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,570
Go back home.

279
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,860
I don't want to see you.

280
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,600
Hey, Dad.

281
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,020
What should I do

282
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,540
so that you can forgive me?

283
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,600
Leave Qiao Yan.

284
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,860
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

285
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,690
Gu Jingyuan.

286
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,480
Do you think I really don't dare to...

287
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,610
Do you dare to take the medicine first?

288
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,080
Hmm?

289
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,000
Gosh.

290
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,360
If you collapse,

291
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,200
both Qiao Yan and the company

292
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,760
will be mine.

293
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,040
That's the right thing to do.

294
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,840
Take a good rest to recuperate.

295
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,280
Only when you're energetic
can you keep an eye on me

296
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,200
and manage the Gu family.

297
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,680
Right?

298
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,770
I'm going to the office.

299
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,240
Take a good rest to recuperate.

300
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,640
I'll come again tonight.

301
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,900
Did he really say that?

302
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,690
Don't you think this guy

303
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,920
is a bit too arrogant now?

304
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,560
I think what he said

305
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,880
makes sense.

306
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,440
It makes sense?

307
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,120
Oh.

308
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,080
Mr. Gu.

309
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,210
Look who's here.

310
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,930
Grandpa.

311
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,280
Look.

312
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,420
Guess what food I brought you?

313
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,780
I have no appetite now.

314
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,600
I don't want to eat it.

315
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,720
Grandpa.

316
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,680
I got up before dawn today

317
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,660
and made this soup for five hours.

318
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,460
Don't you want to taste it?

319
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,920
Oh.

320
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,450
Taste it.

321
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,119
Since you don't want to drink it,

322
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,160
Uncle Xu,

323
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,599
please drink it.

324
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:07,880
Oh.

325
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,400
Then I'll...

326
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,319
drink it.

327
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,000
Hey, Xu!

328
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,599
Are you sick, too?

329
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,200
Huh?

330
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,450
Give it to me!

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,400
Oh.

332
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,599
Here you are.

333
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,329
I'm not sick.

334
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,490
Please drink it.

335
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,359
Let me give you a massage.

336
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,450
How is it?

337
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,569
Is it delicious?

338
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:30,840
Isn't she

339
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,400
such a good granddaughter?

340
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
If she's really a good granddaughter,

341
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,320
she should

342
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,720
break up with Jingyuan at once

343
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,520
so that I won't be angry anymore.

344
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,480
Grandpa.

345
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,160
Yan.

346
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,680
I won't agree to let you two be together.

347
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,970
If you really disobey my order,

348
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,720
I won't recognize you

349
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,800
as my granddaughter anymore.

350
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,200
You...

351
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,560
I know

352
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,440
what happened to your parents

353
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,900
was a terrible blow to you.

354
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:05,850
Jingyuan

355
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,320
once stayed with you

356
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,180
at your most fragile moments.

357
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,360
You like him

358
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,800
and are grateful to him.

359
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I can understand.

360
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,050
However,

361
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,960
it's hard to say

362
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,760
whether this is really love.

363
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,720
Maybe after a period of separation,

364
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,380
you'll forget him gradually.

365
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,810
Grandpa.

366
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,440
I know my own feelings very well.

367
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,480
My feelings for Gu Jingyuan are never

368
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,400
about dependence

369
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
or gratitude.

370
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,440
I truly like Jingyuan.

371
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,130
He likes me, too.

372
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,650
As long as you break up with him,

373
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,240
I won't interfere in your affairs anymore.

374
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,040
Whether you want to study abroad

375
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,180
or play the violin,

376
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
it's all up to you.

377
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,410
In addition,

378
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,880
I also won't force you

379
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,840
to inherit the company.

380
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,930
But Grandpa,

381
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,250
love is never something

382
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,920
which we can make a deal with.

383
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,820
My dad wouldn't accept it.

384
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,160
Nor would I accept it.

385

You...

386
00:18:59,600 --> 00:18:59,800
Oh.

387
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,760
She's saying this out of anger.

388
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,360
Calm down.

389
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,920
Mr. Gu, don't be angry.

390
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,200
I don't want to make Grandpa angry now.

391
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
We'll talk about it after you recover.

392
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,260
But no matter what,

393
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,560
you'll always be my grandpa
who loves me the most.

394
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,690
I won't make a choice

395
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,720
between you and Jingyuan.

396
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,380
I won't lose

397
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,520
either of you.

398
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,460
I'll go back first.

399
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,540
I'll come again tomorrow.

400
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,720
Don't you think

401
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,340
they really

402
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
show no respect for me now?

403
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:45,650
Alas.

404
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,880
I think

405
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,960
they are quite smart.

406
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,400
They knew

407
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,520
you were actually not that angry.

408
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,420
Who says I'm not angry?

409
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,840
You're angry.

410
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,380
Hey.

411
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,800
Keep warm.

412
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,060
Come on.

413
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,440
Mr. Gu.

414
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,160
Please

415
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,570
allow me to say more.

416
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,360
Look.

417
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,840
These two kids

418
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,810
are not the ones
who can't see things clearly.

419
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,680
I think

420
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
they are serious.

421
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,760
Look at Miss Qiao Yan.

422
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,400
Her temper

423
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,960
is just the same as Hai's from back then.

424
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,130
Instead of separating this couple

425
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,880
and letting the tragedy repeat,

426
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,920
it's better to let the young people
pursue their own happiness.

427
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
What do you think?

428
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,760
Take it away. I'm not hungry.

429

You only keep working without eating.

Why are you here?

432
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,480
I just went to visit Grandpa.

433
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,690
I merely stopped by to check on you.

434
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,440
How is my dad?

435
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,250
Grandpa has almost recovered.

436
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,420
He was quite energetic

437
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,560
and even scolded me harshly.

438
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,450
The main problem is that

439
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
he still holds a tough attitude

440
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,810
towards our relationship.

441
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,560
It's okay.
