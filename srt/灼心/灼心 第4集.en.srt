Mom,

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,280
I came to see you.

6
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,280
I was wrong.

7
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
I thought

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,479
Gu Jingyuan was the one who killed you.

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
But he wasn't.

11
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,120
I go against him every day,

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,600
yet he has been secretly protecting me.

13
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,160
Actually, I'm very grateful to him.

14
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,480
But

15
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,320
now I don't know how to face him,

16
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,480
or even say "thank you."

17
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,800
What should I do?

18
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,920

20
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,840
Where's Yan?

21
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,680
Would she be okay?

22
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,840

Why don't you keep an eye on her?

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,960
Don't worry, Dad.

25
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,160
I'll try to reach her.

26
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,200
It'll be fine.

How did you find me here?

33
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,480
After what happened,

34
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,960
you must miss your parents a lot.

35
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,080
I'm sorry,

Uncle.

37
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
I wronged you before.

38

It's okay.

39
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,930
I never took it to heart.

It's okay, Yan.

41

It's okay.

Don't cry.

43
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
Since my parents died,

finding the truth

It's just a scratch.

Why are you apologizing to me?

at first I was angry with youâ€”

68

I made you misunderstand,

69

and

70
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,700

You know what?

76
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,840
I was abandoned

77
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,440
by my parents as a kid.

at gambling,

81
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,880
he'd scold and beat me.

82
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,840
Later I went to an welfare house,

83
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
but the elder kids there bullied me.

84
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,080
I endured it all

85
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,920
until...

86
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,460
I was adopted by the Gu family.

87
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,040
I didn't know you had

88
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,130
such a rough childhood.

89
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240

for having a happy family

91
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,960
and parents who love you.

92
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,040
But then I realized

93
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,890
suddenly losing

94
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,290
hurts even more than

95

The police already cleared him.

He just wanted to use Qiao Yan
to get at me.

As for Wang He,

144

151
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,520
to maintain Gu's current equity structure

152

and management.

153
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,360
This person

154
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,600
must be afraid of Hai and Yan

inheriting Gu's.

156

00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,800
might be?

159
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,100
The most likely person...

160
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,240
is me.

Yuan,

162
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,640
then tell me,

163
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
was it you?

164
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,800
No.

165
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,200
I trust you.

Keep investigating.

Also,

171
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,220
never let Yan get involved again.

172
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,450
It's too dangerous.

173
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,760
Don't worry, Dad.

174
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,520
I pretended to break ties
with you over Qiao Yan.

I'll deal with the people

180
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,240
behind him one by one.

181
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,920
The company should stay stable for now,

182
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,440
and it'll be easier

183
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,980
if Qiao Yan takes over.

184
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,520
Jingyuan,

185
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,160
you'd really

186
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
hand the company to Yan?

187
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,640
It's yours.

188
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,330
You can give it to whoever you want.

189
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,120
Okay.

190
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,320
You've worked hard lately.

191
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,960
Go rest.

192
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,450
I'll head back then.

193
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,240
Mmm.

194
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,840
Yan?

195
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,040
Don't worry.

196
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,800
I've explained everything to Dad.

197
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,240
He...

198
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,740
I'm here to change your dressing.

199
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,440
Did I hurt you?

200
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,840
It's all my fault.

201
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,320
The wound must've reopened

202
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,720
when you carried me back.

203
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,120
It's fine.

204
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,530
Doesn't hurt at all.

205
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,120
Does Grandpa

206
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,840
have a suspect in mind?

207
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,500
What's he going to do next?

208
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,370
Don't worry.

209
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,400
We won't let your parents' deaths

210
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,480
go unanswered.

211
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,720
But promise me,

212
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,040
until we find the real murderer,

213
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,690
you must stay in Xijiang

214
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,760
and keep low.

215
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,320
Leave it to me.

216
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,080
Trust me.

217
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,400
Okay?

218
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,600
Really?

219
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,000
You're really coming back?

220
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,720
Why, am I not welcomed?

221
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,250
[Flip] [Blur background]
[Switch to voice call]

222
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,600
You heartless thing.

223
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,770
I've been hoping you'd hurry back.

224
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,080
The Gu family is full of danger.

225
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,960
Nothing good comes from
getting involved.

226
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,850
Since Gu Jingyuan isn't the murderer,

227
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
and I'm not after Gu's inheritance,

228
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,220
of course I'm coming back.

229
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,920
Besides, they're worried about my safety

230
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,000
and won't let me
look into my parents' case.

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,760
It's hard to do anything here.

232
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,880
I might as well
go back to Germany and dig for clues.

233
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,520
If

234
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,440
the German police find anything,

235
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,500
tell me right away.

236
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,360
Okay.

237
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,360
But

238
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,240
would your grandpa let you go so easily?

239
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,450
I'm worried too.

240
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,360
How can I convince Grandpa

241
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,890
to let me go back to Germany?

242
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,280
Yan,

243
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,960
you're drowning that plant.

244
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,760
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,480
What's on your mind?

246
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,800
Uncle.

247
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,680
Hmm?

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,530
I want to go back to Germany.

249
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,640
Germany?

250
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,200
Shh.

251
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,610
Keep it down.

252
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,690
Don't let Grandpa hear you.

253
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,440
Don't worry.

254
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,680
Dad won't agree.

255
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,440
I know he won't.

256
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,240
So...

257
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,820
I wonder

258
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,920
could you help me

259
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,400
talk to him?

260
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,200
The thing is, I also believe

261
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,320
you should stay.

262
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,240
Uncle,

263
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,880
have you ever had a dream?

264
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,640
Yes.

265
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,960
What dream?

266
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,250
Has it come true?

267
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,930
I'm not telling you.

268
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,520
Cheapskate.

269
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,800
My dream

270
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,360
is to play the violin.

271
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,140
So I don't want to give up my study.

272
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,960
Besides,

273
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,080
you're the one who told me

274
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,680
to live on and move forward.

275
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,520
That's why I want to go back to study.

276
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,520
I thought

277
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,500
you'd understand me best in this family.

278
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,640
Violin?

279
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,119
Xijiang Normal University also

280
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,200
has a violin major.

281
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,000
It's not the same.

282
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,760
Why not?

283
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,920
If it doesn't work,

284
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,319
I can hire your German

285
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,359
professor here.

286
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,800
You're exaggerating.

287
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,980
Gu's Group is capable of that.

288
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,880
Fine, big boss.

289
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,119
But...

290
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,440
I mean,

291
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,000
it's not necessary.

292
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,080
You sure

293
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,010
this is really about study?

294
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,480
Yes.

295
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,720
I just want my simple,

296
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,080
ordinary life back.

297
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,160
The house here is big,

298
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,360
and you and Grandpa treat me well,

299
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
but

300
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,240
sometimes

301
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,540
it still feels like

302
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,600
this place doesn't belong to me.

303
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,480
I see.

304
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,840
You agree?

305
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,480
Well,

306
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,320
I can try to persuade Dad for you.

307
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,240
You're the best!

308
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,400
Yan.

309
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,360
Don't celebrate yet.

310
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,720
I said I'll try,

311
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,760
not promise.

312
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,040
With Mr. Gu on my side,

313
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,560
it's as good as done.

314
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,450
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

315
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,680
I've learned your skills.

316
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,640
Just let bygones

317
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,480
be bygones.

318
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,810
Besides,

319
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,680
family don't

320
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,440
hold grudges.

321
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,720
Yue.

322
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,240
Yes.

323
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,360
Your bread soup is getting better.

324
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,160
It tastes exactly
the same as what I had in Germany.

325
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,120
I'm glad you like it.

326
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
This sausage too.

327
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,680
Exactly the same flavor as

328
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,410
German ones.

329
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,760
Yeah, I've been making it

330
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,760
for almost a month now.

331
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,320
Practice

332
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,800
makes perfect.

333
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,640
I've been back from Germany for a month.

334
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,980
It's good, Dad.

335
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,640
Mmm.

336
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,840
Grandpa,

337
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,400
I have something to tell you.

338
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,640
Well,

339
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,320
I have something to tell you too.

340
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,440
Oh.

341
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,200
Well,

342
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,010
Grandpa, you first.

343
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,410
I invited the principal of
Xijiang Business University

344
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,000
to discuss

345
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,440
about your transfer.

346
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,640
I...

347
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,320
Grandpa,

348
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,040
I studied violin in Germany.

349
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,610
Why should I transfer to business school?

350
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,240
Can you take over Gu's

351
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,400
by playing the violin?

352
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,320
You need to learn

353
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,240
business skills.

354
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,290
I never thought about
taking over Gu's Group.

355
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
My dream's always

356
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,180
been to be a violinist.

357
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,780
The only reason I agreed to take over Gu's

358
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,800
was because

359
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,050
I misunderstood Uncle.

360
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,360
Now

361
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,760
the misunderstanding was cleared up.

362
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,290
I should go back to Germany
and keep studying.

363
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,080
No.

364
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,360
I can agree to anything else,

365
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,920
but not this one.

366
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,720
You and Uncle are
more than enough for Gu 's.

367
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,120
I don't know business.

368
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,400
I can't even read a balance sheet.

369
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,860
If you hand me the company,

370
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,760
I'd probably run it

371
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,290
into the ground in two days.

372
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,600
You brat,

373
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,480
what did you say?

374
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,040
Dad, Dad.

375
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,760
Dad.

376
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,080
Dad, calm down.

377
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,760
Calm down.

378
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I think

379
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,560
we should respect Yan's choice.

380
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,530
Don't worry.

381
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
I've arranged everything in Germany.

382
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,400
When Yan goes back,

383
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
she'll be well looked after.

384
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,000
So,

385
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,600
you want Yan to give up on our company?

386
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,720
I just want her

387
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,920
to do what she loves.

388
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,800
She's still young.

389
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,640
Even if you want her to take over,

390
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,760
it can wait until after she graduates.

391
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,320
Yan's safest

392
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,760
by my side.

393
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,880
But you... you're
sending her back to Germany.

394
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,520
What if I never

395
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,080
see her again?

396
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,120
Grandpa,

397
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,160
I asked Uncle to speak for me.

398
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,720
Stop blaming him.

399
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,320
If you care about me,

400
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,320
just forget about it!

401
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,120
Grandpa,

402
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,140
is that how you drove Dad away too?

403
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,360
You...

404
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,840
-Dad.
-What did you say?

405
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,120
Dad.

406
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,640
Dad, calm down.

407
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,130
If Brother were still here,

408
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,040
he'd want his daughter

409
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,640
to study what she likes,

410
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,120
do what she loves,

411
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,810
and live the life she wants.

412
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,120
Please agree to her,

413
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,040
for Brother's sake.

414
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,160
Fine.

415
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,800
If you

416
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,960
care so much about your brother

417
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
and Yan,

418
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,480
you should give up the company

419
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,420
and take care of her yourself.

420
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,200
Grandpa, you mean

421
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,090
I should be wary of Uncle

422
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,380
stealing Gu's from me?

423
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Silly girl.

424
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,680
You finally understand?

425
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,760
Wait,

426
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,690
Grandpa,

427
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,320
I only joined the company

428
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,920
to investigate him.

429
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,600
I never wanted

430
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
to inherit it.

431
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,520
You're my granddaughterâ€”

432
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,240
you carry the Gu name.

433
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
If Gu's Group isn't yours, whose is it?

434
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,400
My surname is Qiao.

435
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,640
Yan,

436
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,240
you have to understand me.

437
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
If Jingyuan had no selfish motives,

438
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,880
he'd hand over the company

439
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,200
and go with you.

440
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,240
If he hesitates,

441
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
it means what he thinks

442
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
is different from what he said.

443
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,560
Grandpa,

444
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:41,920
but...

445
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,760
Yan,

446
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,920
you're

447
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,040
too naive.

448
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,760
The one thing

449
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
you can't trust in this world

450
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,370
is people's hearts.

451
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,080
Grandpa,

452
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Uncle is our family.

453
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,720
He's my adopted sonâ€”

454
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,280
not Gu blood.

455
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,040
Didn't you suspect that

456
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,560
he killed your father

457
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,080
for the company?

458
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,160
What?

459
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,760
You're going back
to Germany with Qiao Yan?

460
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,160
Even if you want to
stop your dad's worries,

461
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,400
do you have to do this?

462
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,280
Yuan,

463
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,820
you should know

464
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,260
once you give up power,

465
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,780
it's not easy to take back.

466
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,560
Being president

467
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,100
of Gu's Group is not that important to me.

468
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,080
You should know me

469
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,210
better than anyone.

470
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,360
Wan,

471
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,960
title or no title,

472
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,600
I'm still me.

473
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,680
But...

474
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,210
The hardest times are over.

475
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,840
I once promised

476
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,880
I'd get you out of the welfare house,

477
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,000
and I have.

478
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,320
Wan,

479
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,490
I'm not that ambitious.

480
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,560
Yuan,

481
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,760
I just

482
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,160
don't want you to be wronged.

483
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,800
I'm not wronged.

484
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,440
And I've made up my mind.

485
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,340
Let's not talk about this.

486
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,880
Uncle.

487
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,360
Yan.

488
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,410
Why are you still up so late?

489
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,840
What took you so long?

490
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,560
How much did you drink?

491
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,520
No.

492
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,480
I just drank a little.

493
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,120
If you lie, your nose will grow.

494
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,480
I'm not lying.

495
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,680
Why would I lie to you?

496
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,200
Uncle,

497
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,240
are you in a bad mood?

498
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,600
No.

499
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,560
Why would I be in a bad mood?

500
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,840
I'm happy.

501
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,280
Happy?

502
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,080
Happy enough to drink this much?

503
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,810
If Grandpa sees this, he'll...

504
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,840
Yan?

505
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,100
Is that you?

506
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,040
Oh no. We woke Grandpa up.

507
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,440
Weird.

508
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,440
I clearly heard something.

509
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,960
I...

510
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,120
Shh.

511
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,400
Must've been dreaming.
