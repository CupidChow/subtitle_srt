[Episode 4]

3
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,010
Take off your clothes.

4
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,000
Take it off.

5
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,870
Put it on.

6
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,430
You're injured, so stay put.

7
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,630
Don't wander around.

8
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,960
This matter is definitely not that simple.

9
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,420
If he can't be controlled,

10
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,430
should I still keep him?

11
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,870
Yingying,

12
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,870
why do you look so troubled today?

13
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,150
I think I've made a mistake.

14
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
What happened?

15
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,310
Master,

16
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,210
Cai Ping said you were looking for me.

17
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
We'll talk later.

18
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,400
Yingying,

19
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,430
who is he?

20
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,990
He's a slave I bought yesterday.

21
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,680
A slave?

22
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,770
You're from the Yue State.

23
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,630
My Lord,

24
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,800
last night at dawn,

25
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,190
there was a murder at the arena.

26
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,050
The entire scene was burned down.

27
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,910
This needle contains Datura poison.

28
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,040
We suspect someone from the Yue State.

29
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,420
Where were you at dawn last night?

30
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,360
My Lady.

31
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,390
My Lady,

32
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,920
someone came to visit.

33
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,800
Madam asks you and Young Master
to the courtyard.

34
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,120
I'm talking to you.

35
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,890
Brother,

36
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,480
Mother is looking for us.

37
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,510
Let's go first.

38
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,000
Sister,

39
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,070
let me have a look at you.

40
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,430
Aunt?

41
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,190
Why have you lost so much weight?

42
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,040
Why did she still come?

43
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,110
It truly breaks my heart.

44
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,840
[Li Huiwen, Lu Yingying's Aunt]

45
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,000
In my previous life,
after my father was imprisoned,

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,659
Aunt seized the Lu's Mansion,

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,330
and forced my mother to remarry,

48
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,000
[Lu's Mansion]

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,240
causing us to be separated.

50
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,920
Could it be that capturing Ding Huairen

51
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,360
is not enough to change
our previous predicament?

52
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,750
Your favorite treats.

53
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,750
Take a look.

54
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,180
We're sisters. You don't need to do this.

55
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,680
Cai Ping,

56
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,240
be more attentive.

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,570
Come take this quickly.

58
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,600
You can't even handle this properly.

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,200
Wasting my good intentions.

60
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,310
These ones still in the box

61
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,310
are still edible.

62
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,720
What's this on top?

63
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,390
It's all moldy

64
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,630
and growing fuzz.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,430
Someone might
mistake it for fermented tofu.

66
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,240
Aunt,

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,750
I wonder how long
you've kept these pastries.

68
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,950
Weren't they bought
specifically for my mother?

69
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,120
I was thinking

70
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,270
that Sister likes these pastries,

71
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,240
but I didn't realize
the journey was so long

72
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,750
that they would spoil.

73
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,680
Mother, doesn't she know

74
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,340
that you hate sweets the most?

75
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,310
Or perhaps

76
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,480
sending this box of moldy pastries

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,240
is meant to humiliate
your sister who's better off than you.

78
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,310
What did I do wrong

79
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,950
for you to judge me like this?

80
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,810
How about this?

81
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,560
Why don't you eat these pastries?

82
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,390
If you eat them,

83
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,990
I won't suspect you anymore.

84
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:52,750
Yingying.

85
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,560
Yan Hui! Yan Hui!

86
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,430
Yingying.

87
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,430
Sister.

88
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,920
Alright.

89
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,560
I'll take you to rest in the backyard.

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,090
Let's go.

91
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,070
Go back now.

92
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,160
Aunt, we'll settle our score later.

93
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,390
Report!

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,310
Lord Ding is here!

95
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,930
I forgot to tell you.

96
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,160
The matter with Ding Huairen

97
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,020
has been resolved by Consort Yun.

98
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,270
They're both here.

99
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,720
Then what happened in the previous life

100
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,120
might happen again.

101
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,240
What?

102
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,070
[Act with Integrity]

103
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,240
Sister-in-law,

104
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,310
what happened before
was just a misunderstanding.

105
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,510
I hope you can forgive me.

106
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,640
Don't worry, Lord Ding.

107
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,120
However,

108
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,870
thanks to my daughter Yingying
for this matter,

109
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,120
otherwise, my husband

110
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,920
would be in prison now.

111
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,170
These two were partners
in crime in their past life.

112
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,970
I can't believe
they're already in cahoots now.

113
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,370
Lord Ding, your visit at this time

114
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,159
is to show off

115
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:56,830
[Act with Integrity]

116
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,270
that you've been released from prison?

117
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,830
You misunderstand, niece.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,950
I was just passing by your residence

119
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,550
and stopping by to say hello.

120
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
Since Lord Lu isn't here,

121
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,680
I won't disturb you.

122
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,070
[Act with Integrity]

123
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,920
Sister,

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,430
I'm tired from my long journey.

125
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,510
I'll go rest now.

126
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,190
Alright.

127
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,440
[Act with Integrity]

128
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,480
If they conspire against my family again,

129
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,560
wouldn't I

130
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,560
fall into Jun Che's hands?

131
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,510
You rascal, let go of me!

132
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,510
What's the rush?

133
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,840
I've missed you so much.

134
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,630
If you're so capable,
make our relationship  public here.

135
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,430
You smell so good.

136
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,420
I'm tired of sneaking around like this.

137
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,720
Once I get rid of Lu Yang,

138
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,240
the remaining ones in the Lu family

139
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,390
will be at our mercy.

140
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,920
The Lu's Mansion
will be ours sooner or later.

141
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,360
Hurry.

142
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Get in the carriage now
and let me take good care of you.

143
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,560
Then I'll try fighting poison with poison.

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,360
I need you to do something for me.

145
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,510
You are my master.

146
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,200
Feel free to command me.

147
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,000
Then no matter what I say,

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,950
you'll do it?

149
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,760
Of course.

150
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,120
Through fire and water,

151
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,050
I won't hesitate.

152
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:13,780
Come with me.

153
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,909
Do you see that carriage?

154
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,080
Overturn it.

155
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,880
Be careful. Move inside.

156
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,240
Make way!

157
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Get out of the way!

158
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,640
Move aside quickly!

159
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,000
Move!
