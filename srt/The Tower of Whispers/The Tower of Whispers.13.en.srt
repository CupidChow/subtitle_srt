When I first saw you in the arena,

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,360
I needed an identity.

58
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,950
Being a slave to a noble lady

59
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,490
could perfectly conceal my true purpose.

60
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,120
What purpose?

61
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,159
To kill the Eldest Prince,

62
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,320
the future Crown Prince.

63
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,240
Why?

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,800
My mother was from the Yue Tribe.

65
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,510
When I was born,

66
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,800
the imperial astronomers said
I was a bad omen for Daning.

67
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,000
So my father, the Emperor, rejected me.

68
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,120
Later, my mother
was rescued by her people,

69
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,380
but she left me behind.

70
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,830
The Eldest Prince, for his amusement,

71
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,390
threw me into the arena.

72
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
But he never expected me to survive,

73
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,270
let alone be rescued
by the Yue Tribe later.

74
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,390
So that's how it was.

75
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,370

It's all in the past.

77

So,

78
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,600
you're now relying
on the Yue State's power

79
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
to kill the Eldest Prince

80
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,720
and the emperor?

81
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,190
You don't like it when I kill people,

82
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,680

83
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,430
That's not it.

84
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,230
They corrupt the country

85
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,130
and oppress the people.

86
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,810
They deserve to die.

87
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,510
But can you promise me

88
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,720
not to harm any innocent people?

89
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,520
All right.

90
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,600
I promise you.

91
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,600
There are many ways to kill them.

92
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,930
I'll just use a different method.

93
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,930
Then I have one last question.

94
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,390

It's like he's a different person.

116
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,390
