[The Tower of Whispers]

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,360
[Episode 3]

3
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,079
Hurry up!

4
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,160
Stop!

5
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,140
Get up! Get up now!

6
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,590
No. 5! Get up now!

7
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,630
Why did he stop?

8
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,370
Young man, what's going on?

9
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,150
What are you doing?

10
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,360
Why did he stop?

11
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,960
Miss, what displeased you?

12
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,150
He didn't deserve

13
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,840
such a quick death.

14
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,520
I want to buy him.

15
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,560
Before you die,

16
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,910
I will return all the suffering

17
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,640
I endured in my past life to you.

18
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,750
Why is he chained up?

19
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,680
I don't know.

20
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,900
What's happening?

21
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,690
He must have offended someone.

22
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,560
My Lady,

23
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,360
why did you chain him up outside?

24
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,680
There are many people watching
on the street.

25
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,910
Are we going too far?

26
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,240
I want him to taste

27
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,150
the feeling of being humiliated in public.

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,000
[Lu's Mansion]

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My Lady, I'll get you a mounting block.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,630
No need.

31
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,310
You, come here.

32
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,840
Kneel.

33
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,250
Hold out your hands.

34
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,260
Clean the blood off yourself
before coming in.

35
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,950
[Lu's Mansion]

36
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,830
You're filthy.

37
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,480
That's my residence ahead.

38
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,750
From now on,

39
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,450
whether it's windy, rainy,
or freezing cold,

40
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,950
your residence

41
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,520
is right on this floor beneath my feet.

42
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,160
Be a good watchdog for me.

43
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,680
Master,

44
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,270
please give me a name.

45
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,270
Why does a slave need a name?

46
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,230
The arena owner called you No. 5,

47
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,120
so I'll call you Five from now on.

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,180
Thank you, Master.

49
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,070
The snow...

50
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
In my past life,

51
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,560
the first time I met Jun Che,

52
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,630
he made me kneel in the snow all night.

53
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,500
If you want to thank me,

54
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,600
do it sincerely.

55
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,450
Thank me on your knees.

56
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,630
Thank you, Master.

57
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,120
Shut up!

58
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,270
Yan Hui,

59
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,070
I would be better off dead.

60
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm just like a walking corpse now.

61
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,560
Can Yan Hui bring you back from the dead?

62
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,950
If I catch you writing
to another man again,

63
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,680
Let it go!

64
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,430
I'll break your wings myself!

65
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,750
My Lady, what happened?

66
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,159
Bring me the horsewhip.

67
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,560
You killed my pigeon,

68
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,950
and prevented me
from sending letters home.

69
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,720
You imprisoned me while I was alive,

70
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,630
and wouldn't let me go even after I died.

71
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,240
Cutting you into a thousand pieces

72
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,300
wouldn't ease the hatred in my heart.

73
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,360
Master, it's just a baby

74
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,490
and nearly freezing to death.

75
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,830
Please save it.

76
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,560
Call someone.

77
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,830
Compared to my suffering,

78
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,100
this is merely a drop in the ocean.

79
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,680
I won't let you die easily.

80
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,210
[Lu's Mansion]

81
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,480
My Lady,

82
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,840
he looks seriously injured.

83
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,169
Should we call a doctor?

84
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,240
He defeated so many people.

85
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,370
He won't die easily.

86
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,080
But My Lady,

87
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,750
your cloak is still on him.

88
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,030
Should I get it back?

89
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,910
He has made it dirty.

90
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,970
Just leave it here.

91
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,550
So noisy.

92
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,970
[Those near are won over,
and those far away come to join]

93
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,870
Come on.

94
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,670
Eat slowly.

95
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,440
Come on, drink.

96
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,870
You're annoying.

97
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm filthy rich.

98
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,390
Thank you, sir.

99
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,360
Murder!

100
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,350
[Those near are won over,

[Those near are won over,
and those far away come to join]

103
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Get up.

104
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,570
[Those near are won over,
and those far away come to join]

105
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:36,860
Chief Commander.

106
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,510
[Sang Li, a witch from Yue State
and Jun Che's trusted aide]

107
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,200
Let us handle these scum.

108
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,530
You don't have to deal with them yourself.

109
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,750
I've found a new hideout.

110
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,440
This arena is no longer useful.

111
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,700
Sang Li, clean this place up thoroughly.

112
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,390
The most important thing now

113
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,550
is to lie low

114
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,860
and bide our time.

115
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,840
[Wen, Jun Che's trusted aide]

116
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,790
People from all factions will gather

117
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,970
at the Crown Prince's
investiture ceremony.

118
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,390
[Those near are won over,
and those far away come to join]

119
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,150
The situation will certainly be complex.

120
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,150
It's a perfect opportunity for us
to observe covertly

121
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,480
and move in for the kill.

122
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,670
Chief Commander.

123
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,790
Will you be staying

124
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,390
by that noble lady from the Lu family

125
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,850
to conceal your identity?

126
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,750
Lu Yingying doesn't seem

127
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,510
to be a docile lady.

128
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,240
Are you sure about this?

129
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,960
But I think

130
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,890
she's quite interesting.

131
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,550
[Lu's Mansion]

132
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,870
Why did he recover so quickly?

133
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,210
Where have you been?

134
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Oh, it is here.

135
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,730
I've been looking for it everywhere.

136
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,290
Why is there blood on your clothes?

137
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,440
It's from

138
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,320
an old wound.

139
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,590
It's nothing.

140
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,670
An old wound? Here?

141
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,910
Does it hurt?

142
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,980
Take off your clothes.

143
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,000
Take it off!
