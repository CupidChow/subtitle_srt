My Lady!

189
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,440
Yingying!

190
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,790
-My Lady!
-Yingying!

191
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,080
Brother.

192
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,670
Brother!

193
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,510
What are your intentions
bringing Yingying here so late?

194
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,550
My Lord,

195
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,960
I am not your prisoner,

196
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,870
and I don't like
having a knife pointed at me.

197
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,240
Brother, you've really misunderstood.

198
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,510
I asked him to come.

199
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,750
Five, I'm warning you.

200
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,670
You're just our family guard.

201
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,080
Know your place,

202
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,910
and stay away from Yingying from now on.

203
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,840
Didn't I tell you?

204
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,550
I invited him to watch the fireworks.

205
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,150
It's true. Trust me.

206
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,720
Yingying,

207
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,790
the city isn't safe lately.

208
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,480
There have been many murders.

209
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,600
Don't go out this late anymore.

210
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,150
Alright.

211
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,490
I got it, Brother.

212
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,470
[Lu's Mansion]

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,790
Yingying!

214
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,000
Father, Mother.

215
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,960
Where have you been so late?

216
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,320
I've been so worried.

217
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,720
It's so dangerous for a young girl.

218
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,080
Why are you still waiting for me so late?

219
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,790
It's cold. Let's go inside.

220
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,200
So you know it's late.

221
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,480
You know your parents
are worried about you?

222
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,240
Father, Mother, don't worry.

223
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,910
I'm fine. I'm safe.

224
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,600
Was she

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,480
with Five all day?

226
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,080
Father, no.

227
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,240
When I found her,

228
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,960
she was setting off fireworks
with Cai Ping.

229
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,120
Father, Mother, let's go inside.

230
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,480
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

231
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,440
It won't happen again.

232
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,510
You're not allowed
to come home this late anymore.

233
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's see if you dare do it again.

234
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,030
I wouldn't dare.

235
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,360
Your mother even cried for you.

236
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,790
It's okay, Brother.

237
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,270
Five's martial arts are excellent.

238
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,150
I'm very safe with his protection.

239
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,570
