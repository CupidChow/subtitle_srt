She wants to use His Majesty

227

to kill all Daning people
at tomorrow's Heaven Worship Ritual.

228

you would surely find a way.

231
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,510
I can't even see him now.

232
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,120
How can I persuade him?

233

Greetings, Your Majesty.

Your Majesty,

Take this Calming Bead to Jun Che

238
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,760
and ask him to come see me.

239
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,240
If he doesn't come,

our relationship

This is the Calming Bead.

243
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,790
My mother obtained it for me.

244
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,840
It works very well.

245
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,550
If you keep it close to you,

246
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,510
I think those noises

247
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,910
might become less noisy.

248
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,480
Give out my order.

249
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,120
Pour this Heartbreak Powder

250
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
into the moat.

251
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,080
I want this water

252
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,510
to tear apart
the insides of anyone who drinks it,

253
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,510
and turn the dead bodies
to ash upon contact.

254
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,000
Your Majesty.

255
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,390
I knew you would come.

256
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,030
Threatening me?

257
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,910
Mother was right.

258
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,560
The one who poisoned
and cursed me wasn't her.

259
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,080
It was you.

260
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,480
The Yan Hui you saw before

261
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,150
was Sang Li in disguise.

262
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,750
Still quibbling!
