Look.

183
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,910
They're laughing at you.

184
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,960
They've all bullied you

185
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,910
and insulted you before.

186
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,970
Have you forgotten all these things?

187
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,000
Hurry!

188
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,270
Take revenge for your own deep grudges.

189
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,870
Go kill them now, Che!

190
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,240
Kill them!

191
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Kill them!
