00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,520
My dear.

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,150
Yingying

5
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,400
is over 18, right?

6
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,850
She's already 20.
She is no longer a child.

[Marriage Profile]

8
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,280
Shouldn't we start arranging

9
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,850
Yingying's marriage?

10
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,680
Yes.

12
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes.

13
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,930
Father, Mother, what's up?

14
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,240
Yingying.

15
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,190
It occurs to me that

16
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,150
from now on, my brother will be living
at the Longxiang Guard Command Center.

17
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,610
Take a look at these first.

18
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,090
Marriage profiles?

19
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,710
These are the marriage profiles of

20
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,710
those talented and successful young men

21
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,800
around your age in the capital.

22
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,170
Take your pick.

23
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,960
If you find someone suitable,

24
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,190
I'll send someone to arrange the match.

25
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
No.

26
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,560
I just want to stay with you two forever.

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,120
Well...

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Silly child.

29
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,120
People who come of age should get married.

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,050
How could you stay with us forever?

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,820
Just take a look first.

32
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,190
Forget it if you don't want to
marry someone.

33
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:26,750
However,

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,870
your monthly allowance

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,520
will be cut in half.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,470
You always threaten me with that.

37
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,400
Yingying, be good and listen to us.

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,630
Take these and have a look.

39
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,000
Go back, read these profiles

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,680
and pick someone carefully.

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,910
Take a good look.

42
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,040
You really want to choose someone, huh?

43
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,960
I had no choice.

44
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,800
My parents insisted that I choose someone

45
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,560
or they would reduce my allowance.

46
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,960
If you don't want to do it,

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,800
it's easy to solve this problem.

48
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,520
What?

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,200
You want to meet them?

50
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,360
Don't tear them up! Give them back!

51
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,830
You want to keep them?

52
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,750
They can't be torn.

53
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,920
We can't!

54
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,750
These marriage profiles were carefully

55
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,750
selected by my parents.

56
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,149
How could we tear them up?

58
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,830
I just accidentally

59
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,290

and burned them.

61
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,560
I accidentally threw

62
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,270
all those marriage profiles into the fire.

63
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,310
I tried to retrieve them

64
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,920
but only got my hand burned.

65
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,600
You...

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,630
Just as I expected.

67
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,920
Today,

68
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,120
I've invited all those talented young men

69
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,390
to come over.

70
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,800
You can meet each of them

71
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,160
to get to know them all.

72
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,830
It is more direct than
just reading their profiles.

73
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,190
That's a bit too direct.

74
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,070
It's not convenient to

75
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,240
have so many people at our house.

76
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,950
You...

77
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,920
I have foresight, don't I?

78
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,160
With this large screen here,

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,270
you can hear their voices

80
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,070
and see their silhouettes.

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,680
But it's not a formal meeting.

82
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,630
You can talk about

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,430
whatever you want.

84
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,430
You're in such a hurry to marry me off?

85
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,920
You've gone to great lengths.

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,720
Alright, Yingying. Be good.

87
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,580
Hurry up and go.

88
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,120
Your father and I are free today.

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,450
So, we'll go out for tea.

90
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,510
Have a chat with them.

91
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,430
My Lady, what should we do?

92
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,240
Do not talk with them.

93
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,770
Let's go.

94
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,390
Wait.

95
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,040
It's better to solve it once
rather than keep avoiding it.

96
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,920
Don't my parents want me to talk with them?

97
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,240
Then I'll speak freely

98
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,830
and say everything that we women

99
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,800
want to say.

100
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,430
I assume all of you

101
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,630
know something about my situation.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,930
So let me tell you my criteria for
choosing a husband.

103
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,310
If you want to marry me,

104
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,000
we should live in harmony,

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,510
be understanding of each other,
and communicate on an equal footing.

106
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,430
It's easy.

107
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,510
Go on.

108
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,640
Since we're equals,

109
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,950
we should discuss matters together,

110
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,310
make decisions together,

111
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,390
and share household chores.

112
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,950
It is too easy.

113
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,830
Is she in a hurry to get married?

114
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,770
Ridiculous!

115
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,070
Doing housework?

116
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,600
Don't you know that gentlemen
should stay away from the kitchen?

117
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,270
Do you want your husband to do dirty work,
Miss Lu?

118
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,070
Since you've read the classics,

119
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,240
you should know that
if one cannot clean his own house,

120
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,000
he can't help govern the country.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,510
You...

122
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,750
I am not destined to be with Miss Lu.

123
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,210
I'll take my leave now.

124
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,510
Mr. Zhou, since you came here by carriage,

125
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,630
could you give me a ride?

126
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,240
Let's go. Let's go.

127
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,920
Okay. Okay.

128
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,310
Then I'll continue.

129
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,600
My husband can't
have any concubines in his life.

130
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,270
The first child born

131
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,510
must take my surname.

132
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,360
Not taking concubines is already too much,

133
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,750
and now the child must take her surname?

134
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,240
There has never been such a rule
throughout history.

135
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,830
That's right.

136
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,830
-There has never been such a rule!
-Miss Lu is too domineering!

137
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,560
I'm leaving.

138
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,930
I haven't finished yet.

139
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
This last item is that

140
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,560
my husband can't keep me stuck at home

141
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
in the name of love.

142
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,240
I have ambitions just like men.

143
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,500
My husband must not
restrict my freedom.

144
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,270
Miss Lu has such high demands.

145
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,920
I would like to see

146
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,950
how beautiful you are.

147
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,920
Let me see.

148
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,790
Indeed, you are a beauty.

149
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,490
Miss Lu, your features resemble someone.

150
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,830
I remember now.

151
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,800
You look like Honglian of
the Diecui Brothel.

152
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,630
She is the newly crowned courtesan.

153
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,430
It is said that it would only cost
a maximum of 100 taels of silver

154
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,560
to spend a night with her.

155
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,480
Sir, you needn't
compare me with a courtesan

156
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,159
to insult me.

157
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,600
Because I don't care.

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,800
What's wrong with being a courtesan?

159
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,120
If this is your understanding,

160
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,520
why bother coming here?

161
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,760
You just don't know
how to be a good wife.

162
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,390
How dare you make such demands of men!

163
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,950
Yes. Exactly!

164
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,560
Ridiculous!

165
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,510
I'm merely asking for

166
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,310
loyalty and respect
from my future husband.

167
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,950
But you think I'm being improper.

168
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,000
What about all those demands

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,680
you put forward to the matchmaker?

170
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,190
Can I say you're failing to
uphold male virtue?

171
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:05,720
You...

172
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,800
All I want is

173
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,680
monogamy.

174
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,070
Is that difficult?

175
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,780
Wishful thinking.

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,430
Who dares hit me?

177
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,070
I think it was karma.

178
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,630
I'd better not get involved with her.

179
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,200
Let's go. Let's go.

180
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,630
Let's get out of here.

181
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,550
That's great, My Lady.

182
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,120
They all left.

183
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,580
What an impressive woman!

184
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,669
I'm still here.

185
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,200
This way, Young Master.

186
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,600
I think all of Miss Lu's demands

187
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,600
can be fulfilled.

188
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
It's you.

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,790
Yingying,

190
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,890
long time no see.

191
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,200
Hong'an.

192
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,270
I remember you were chubby
when you were young.

193
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,440
That's right.

194
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,080
I was often bullied because I was fat.

195
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,910
You were the only one
who played with me.

196
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,790
Do you remember that

197
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,150
we used to catch butterflies together.

198
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,630
Yes. I loved butterflies.

199
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,080
So we always tried to
catch butterflies together.

200
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,790
But we were too clumsy.

201
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,960
We never managed to catch one.

202
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,840
So this time,

203
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,170
I brought a butterfly especially for you.

204
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,670
No, this is too valuable.

205
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,670
I can't accept it.

206
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,240
We're close.
So, do not talk about the value of it.

207
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,360
A bracelet is an intimate item.

208
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,750
You're just an outsider.

209
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,240
How can you give her a bracelet casually?

210
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,790
Who is this gentleman?

211
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm her bodyguard.

212
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,870
He's Five.

213
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,440
I'm also called Five.

214
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,320
How could a decent guy be called Five.

215
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,780
Isn't it a servant's name?

216
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,840
Five.

217
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,980
This is for you.

218
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,150
Anyway,

219
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,840
I can't accept this bracelet.

220
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,500
Please don't feel pressured.

221
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,390
This is just a small gift

222
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,850
I'm giving you as a friend.

223
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,790
Besides, if I'm going to
give you something,

224
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,390
how could I possibly
just give you a butterfly?

225
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,750
Five.

226
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,620
Coming, Young Master.

227
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,320
Young Master has prepared

228
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,440
a golden butterfly

229
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,240
for everyone in Lu's Mansion.

230
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,090
Well...

231
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:29,870
Well...

232
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,270
It will cost you too much.

233
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,960
These are just....

234
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,360
Our Young Master is rich.

235
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,870
He is the wealthiest man in the capital.

236
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,130
You're too talkative.

237
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,910
I'll slap myself.

238
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,150
Stop. Stop.

239
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,720
Stop.

240
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,870
Give them away now.

241
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,720
Well,

242
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,750
one for each person.

243
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,910
Soon, everyone in Lu's Mansion

244
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,120
will have a butterfly.

245
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,360
Yingying will be happy to see that.

246
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,440
Alright.

247
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,960
If that's the case,

248
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,000
thank you, Hong'an.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,510
I'll visit you another day

250
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,790
with gifts.

251
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,650
Yingying, no need to be so polite.

252
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,510
Yingying, can you help me up?

253
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,030
You have leg pain, right?

254
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Do you need me to set your bone?

255
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,600
Yingying.

256
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,720
You scared him.

257
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,840
This gentleman is feeling unwell.

258
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,130
He should seek medical attention now.

259
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,270
No need.

260
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,240
I've arranged a dinner party.

261
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,040
What about checking on my leg
after we have dinner?

262
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,080
Okay.
