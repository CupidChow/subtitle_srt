save me.

190
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,240
How dare you!

191
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,000
We, the Longxiang Guards,
are here to investigate a case.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,030
How dare you toy with me like this!

193
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,270
There's no case to investigate here.

194
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,630
Now that you've entered this cage,

195
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,390
why don't you investigate me instead?

196
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,840
My Lord, do you also like

197
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,480
the scent of my cosmetics, My Lord?
