189
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,570
could you spare me
just a little bit of affection?

190
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,310
♪ When everything turns into smoke,
I hope we can stay peaceful forever ♪

191
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,880
♪ That year, the pear blossoms
were filled with laughter ♪

192
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,270
♪ A night of snowflakes
falling in disarray ♪

193
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,720
If you can't do that,

194
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,630
♪ All the perfection in the world
hides deep regrets ♪

195
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,720
then stab me

196
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,120
and let me give up this hope.

197
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,810
♪ The blood in my heart
is the spell of love ♪

198
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,670
♪ I'll never miss you again in my dream ♪

199
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,790
Five.

200
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,760
You're truly insane.

201
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,300
♪ When everything turns into smoke,
I hope we can stay peaceful forever ♪

202
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,840
This obsessive feeling

203
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,410
is exactly like Jun Che from my past life.

204
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,840
Could he

205
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,600
be destined to become that madman?

206
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,270
So it was really you

207
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,050
who gave your blood to heal me yesterday.

208
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,750
My Lady, please don't worry about it.

209
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,810
I did it willingly.

210
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,950
So beautiful.

211
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,360
Yingying.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,080
Got you.

213
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,910
Let me kill him.

214
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,670
You are my wife.

215
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,240
How could I ever let you go?
