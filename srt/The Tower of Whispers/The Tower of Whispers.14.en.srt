[The Tower of Whispers]

2
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,270
[Episode 14]

3
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,120
The Eldest Prince is here!

4
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,240
The Eldest Prince is coming.

5
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,640
Please. Please. Please.

6
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,470
Greetings, Your Highness.

7
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,800
Everyone,
there's no need to stand on ceremony.

8
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,560
My humble home is really honored
with Your Highness's presence.

9
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,490
Your Highness, please have a seat.

10
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,000
You hurt my little dog!

11
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,520
Look.

12
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,880
It's so frightened.

13
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,490
Apologize to it right now!

14
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,910
An illegitimate child from the Yue State!

15
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,970
Who allows you to look at me like that?

16
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,810
Believe it or not,
I may even gouge your eyes out!

17
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,290
How dare you look at me?

18
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,360
Stop looking!

19
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,750
How dare you still look at me?

20
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,680
Do you even dare to look at me again?

21
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Chief Commander.

22
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,370
Should we just take action now

23
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,710
and kill this evil guy
who's as cruel as a beast?

24
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,150
No.

25
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,710
This is Lu's Mansion.
Yingying is still here.

26
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,870
Don't cause any trouble.

27
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,560
Yan Hui.

28
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,700
The case was handled well.

29
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,240
Today is your birthday.

30
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,490
I'm here to reward you with some wine.

31
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,870
Thank you, Your Highness.

32
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,470
There are 2 happy events
in Lu's Mansion today.

33
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,590
Firstly, let's congratulate Minister Lu
on presiding over my Investiture Ceremony.

34
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,190
Secondly,
let's celebrate Lord Yan Hui's birthday.

35
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,000
This time,

36
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,730
I'll drink a toast to Lord Yan Hui myself.

37
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:49,840
Yan Hui.

38
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,310
His Highness is drinking a toast to you.

39
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,840
Raise your cup right now!

40
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,590
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
However, I drank too much just now,

42
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,820
so I'm feeling a bit dizzy at this moment.

43
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,050
Please allow me to sober up a little

44
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
before you drink a toast to me again.

45
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,430
My brother
hasn't recovered from his cold recently.

46
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,430
I'll drink this cup of wine for...

47
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,830
What's the rush, Miss Lu?

48
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,430
This toast of mine

49
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,800
is about loyalty
between Lord Yan Hui and me.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,860
Not drinking it

51
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,950
means disloyalty.

52
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,560
Not only Lord Yan Hui shows disloyalty,

53
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,750
but your entire Lu family is also

54
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,490
going to rebel, huh?

55
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,800
-Please calm down, Your Highness!
-Please calm down, Your Highness!

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,659
Please calm down, Your Highness!

57
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,040
Your Highness, I will

58
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,470
drink up this cup of wine.

59
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,950
Good!

60
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,120
Have another cup of wine.

61
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,480
Refill it again.

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,800
What's wrong?

63
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,590
Is that all you can drink?

64
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,159
Lord Yan Hui.

65
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,120
Hui.

66
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,680
Yan Hui.

67
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,560
Oh, no.

68
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,800
The Heart-Binding Poison
will stop being effective soon.

69
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,070
I can't drink anymore.

70
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,070
I'd like to leave now.

71
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,440
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

72
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,480
It would be terrible if Yan Hui
regains control of his own body now.

73
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,280
I need to get out of here quickly.

74
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,320
Everyone, stand up.

75
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,310
Lord Yan Hui really has

76
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,710
a low alcohol tolerance.

77
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
I'm really concerned whether

78
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,250
he can work as a Longxiang Guard properly.

79
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,910
I'll see you in the imperial court,
Lord Lu.

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,310
No.

81
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,040
I'm counting on you
for my Investiture Ceremony.

82
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,270
Don't make any mistakes.

83
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,360
Goodbye, Your Highness!

84
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,830
That witch must be using my body

85
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,030
for a certain scheme.

86
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,840
I have to stop her this time.

87
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,360
What's wrong with Yan Hui today?

88
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,310
Yingying.

89
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,830
The secret was almost exposed just now.

90
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,960
Yingying will definitely suspect it.

91
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,190
I should take the initiative
to confess to her.

92
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,560
He's not at home.

93
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,130
Has he returned
to the Longxiang Guard Command Center?

94
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,870
Hui!

95
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,800
This is strange.

96
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,070
She's not here.

97
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,750
Did she...

98
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,830
go out to look for Yan Hui?

99
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,550
Who are you?

100
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,480
Miss Lu.

101
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,880
Have you seen my brother?

102
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,750
Lord Yan Hui didn't come here today.

103
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,390
He has stayed in the Fengman House lately.

104
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,190
Why don't you check it out there?

105
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,280
Take a look! Fresh goods! Fresh goods!

106
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,180
Why does this person
look so similar to Five?

107
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:56,550
Why is he here too?

108
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,260
[Fengman House]

109
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,840
If the Heart-Binding Poison
touches alcohol,

110
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
your vital energy
will be severely weakened.

111
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,030
Stay here to recuperate properly.

112
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,790
Witch!

113
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,550
Let go of me!

114
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:15,910
Five!

115
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,960
Let go of me! You two...

116
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,870
Hui, are you inside there?

117
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,080
It's really you.
