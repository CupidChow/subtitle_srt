=Episode 6=

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,470
Did it hurt?

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,389
Yes.

9
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,469
I'm sorry, Cheng.

10
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,150
I've been wondering
whether or not you're doing well

11
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,029
all these years.

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,910
Whether or not you've been bullied.

13
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:46,910
No.

14
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,870
That's not going to happen again.

15
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,189
Yan Jun is investigating
what happened to my mother.

16
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,910
I've searched the entire Chunshui Town,
but to no avail.

17
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,949
That's the three-year agreement.

18
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,078
After marrying the clan leader's son,

19
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:22,230
I will be the most envious woman
in Chunshui Town.

20
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,198
No one will humiliate my mother

21
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,149
or call me a wench again!

22
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,030
Do you get it,

23
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,310
Cheng?

24
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,109
I see.

25
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,549
I'm back.

26
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,190
I will help you find out the truth.

27
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,910
For the past three years,

28
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,910
I was carrying this ruler

29
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,630
and visiting
all of the tailor shops in the town.

30
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,869
But I haven't found out anything.

31
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,829
I've thought of visiting the county.

32
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,190
Do you want to join me?

33
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,709
No.

34
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,510
I can't be out here for long.

35
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,269
Why?

36
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,480
Now that you're married
to the clan leader's son,

37
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,720
and you've become
the most envious woman in Chunshui Town,

38
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,149
you can no longer
leave the house as you please?

39
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,669
It's not that case.

40
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,989
He's just protective of me.

41
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,429
You're out taking a breather.

42
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,230
Yet you're with a ticking time bomb.

43
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,030
Shen Cheng.

44
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,309
You've investigated in town
for three years and found nothing.

45
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,549
Either you've been doing it
the wrong way

46
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,309
or the clue isn't here to begin with.

47
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,669
Are you really going
to miss this chance today?

48
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,989
All my life

49
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,150
I've never left this town.

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,350
I'll take you out.

51
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,030
You didn't close it properly.

52
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,599
Call the county chamber of commerce.

53
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,790
Chamber of commerce?

54
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,599
What for?

55
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,749
Just do it.

56
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,390
Now.

57
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,669
Great.

58
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,869
Young Master.

59
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,309
Where did the car go?

60
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,599
Looked like it was headed to the county.

61
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,790
But the county is big,
there's no way to tell.

62
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,919
Check every tailor shop in the county.

63
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,150
Yes, sir.

64
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,710
Welcome.

65
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:09,890
(Mrs. Yan)

66
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,429
Are you here for a qipao fitting
with your wife?

67
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,710
We're not husband and wife.

68
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:21,838
Thank you.

69
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,230
Thank you, sir.

70
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,590
Ma'am, this way please.

71
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,278
Use this brass ruler.

72
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,470
Sure.

73
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,069
We have our own rulers.

74
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,629
Let's just use this one.

75
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,549
We're both from Chunshui Town.

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,559
Ma'am, what are you talking about?

77
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,150
I don't get it.

78
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,509
Just as I thought.

79
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,470
I've never been to Chunshui Town.

80
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,438
Please stand still, ma'am.

81
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:36,590
I'll be measuring your front now.

82
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,670
You too are from town.

83
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,869
You must know what happened
to the Shen family.

84
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,789
Well,

85
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,389
I found this ruler
in the Disciplinary Hall.

86
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,789
Ma'am,

87
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,550
I can't make your dress.

88
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,029
Take the ruler back.

89
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,398
What do you know?
Tell me everything!

90
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,239
- I... I don't know anything.
- Speak! Tell me!

91
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,839
I know nothing!

92
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,269
