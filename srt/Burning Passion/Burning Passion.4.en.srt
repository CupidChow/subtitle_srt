7
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,000
For the past three years,
Young Madam has been visiting

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,080
the tailor shop with a bronze ruler
to investigate her mother's death.

9
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,918
I've followed her countless times.

10
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:01,879
Therefore...

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,150
Therefore,

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,389
you neglected it, huh?

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,029
The sun looks nice today.
You should take a look.

14
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:19,749
If you wish to see the sun again,

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,949
you better find her before nightfall.

16
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:26,949
Yes, sir!

17
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,949
Have you reflected upon your actions?

18
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,230
Do you know what mistake you committed?

19
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,309
I don't.

20
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,799
I spent the entire afternoon
talking to you.

21
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,530
It turns out that you're dense, huh?
You didn't understand me at all.

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,549
Why don't you explain it to me?

23
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,990
Someone got drenched,

24
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,070
had a hangover,

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,669
and got injured because of you.

26
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,660
Not only did you not
show him any concern after that,

27
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,820
but you also reprimanded him.

28
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,400
Don't you think you went overboard?

29
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:10,910
Eldest sisters should act like mothers.

30
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,638
You have to be more gentle
and show your younger brother

31
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,869
more concern, understood?

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,389
But you must also
maintain proper boundaries.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,750
It's best

34
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,230
if you can keep him in a happy mood

35
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,510
without making him fall for you.

36
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,549
That's pretty difficult.

37
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:33,510
Young Master Jiang,

38
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,109
why don't you teach me what to do?

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,038
So, you knew it was me all along?

40
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,230
You should've told me earlier.

41
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:09,790
This is a warning.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,910
I'll lecture my brother myself.

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,590
I'm fine.

44
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,149
Young Master Jiang
was just joking with me.

45
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:33,549
If so, I'll let him off
on account of my wife.

46
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,429
Young Master Jiang,

47
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,389
please educate your brother.

48
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,590
Cheng, I stuffed the map
into her handbag.

49
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,790
Who told you to kidnap her?

50
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,949
Cheng.

51
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,669
What are you doing?

52
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,350
Are you going to beat me up?

53
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,590
Come on, then. Do it.

54
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,949
Cheng, I'm doing this for your sake.

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,669
She's not good enough for you.

56
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,420
Do you know what people
are saying about her?

57
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,800
They said that she's a loose woman.

58
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,749
This is a warning.

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,158
Do not say that

60
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,470
in front of me again.

61
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,950
Dear, you must've been startled.

62
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,830
I'm fine.

63
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,830
Young Master Jiang
was merely rambling to me.

64
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,189
He didn't hurt me.

65
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,910
So, you knew that the culprit was him.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,189
Even so, you allowed him
to do what he did.

67
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,710
Who were you waiting for?

68
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,629
What do you mean by that?

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,189
Shen Cheng is my younger brother.

70
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,869
You're my wife.

71
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,189
Naturally, I believe you.

72
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,280
(Did he see it?)

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,318
Something cropped up at the chamber
of commerce. I need to head there.

74
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,590
You don't need to worry about me

75
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,590
if I return late tonight.

76
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,730
(Map)

77
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,669
Isn't this the map of Chunshui Town?

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,950
(Cheng did steal the map.)

79
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,869
Young Master Jiang.

80
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,989
Qingru, you look gorgeous today.

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,950
May I have a dance with you

82
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,270
as my apology?

83
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,109
Sorry. I'm not used to outsiders
wrapping their arms around my waist.

84
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,280
Who has such poor aesthetic standards?

85
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,590
It's too fancy.

86
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,390
Do you know how to dance?

87
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,030
I'm an outsider too, you know?

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,869
You're still angry at me, huh?

89
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,989
Qingru, you're a great dancer.

90
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,189
Seems like you danced a lot
with your husband.

91
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,669
Of course.

92
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,710
Take care, Young Master.

93
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,119
Where's Young Madam?

94
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,189
I don't know.

95
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,679
Sir,

96
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,119
a rare talent has appeared

97
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,318
in the Jiang family,

98
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,309
the largest warlord family in Jiangnan.

99
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,350
He dealt a heavy blow to the Lu Family Army,
the major warlord force in Jiangbei. Look here.

100
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,710
He's all the craze
in the newspapers lately.

101
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,559
However, he's a mysterious figure.

102
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,999
There are no photos of him.

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,590
But I heard

104
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,599
that the Lu Family Army
has offered a high bounty of

105
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,790
300,000 silver dollars for his head.

106
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,069
The head of Young Marshal Jiang Wei

107
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,030
is pretty valuable, huh?

108
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,239
You offered a whole chest of gold
when you act.

109
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,520
And, you stole a confidential map
right after your return.

110
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,309
What kind of dirty deeds
were you doing outside?

111
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,710
I'm a bandit.

112
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:34,430
Chunshui Town is the territory
of the Yan family.

113
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,149
No matter what,

114
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,629
you shouldn't touch this town.

115
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,950
I will touch it whenever I want.

116
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,070
The Yan family is influential.

117
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,840
Yan Jun excels at doing business
and greasing the palms at all levels.

118
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,149
He has a good relationship
with the county security regiment.

119
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,999
Where's Young Madam?

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,350
I have no idea.

121
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,950
What's the three-year pact?

122
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,430
- Will you divorce him after three years?
- Shen Cheng.

123
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,109
Does your hand still hurt?

124
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,550
No.

125
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,190
You're still the same as always.

126
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,629
That's not true.

127
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,389
From now on,

128
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,550
we can never go back
to how things were before.

129
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,789
