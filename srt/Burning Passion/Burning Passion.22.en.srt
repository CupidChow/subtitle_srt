Sir.

8
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,190
Marshal Jiang has returned.

9
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,070
Your mother loved plum blossoms.

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,189
I'm afraid I won't be able
to see this year's blossoms.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,469
I'll place the flowers on your grave.

12
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,200
(Grand Marshal Jiang)
When you do,

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,910
(Grand Marshal Jiang)
remember to call me "Father."

14
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,710
Why did you kill my mother?

15
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:37,350
It doesn't matter anymore.

16
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,350
She died by my gun.

17
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,879
I'm sorry, Mother.

18
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,669
I don't want to go.

19
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,630
What character is this?

20
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,269
"Zhen."

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,518
Young Master.

22
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:20,790
Wei,

23
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,230
the plum tree in the courtyard
is in bloom.

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,598
(Gu Yuzhen, Mrs. Jiang)
Would you help me pick

25
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,320
(Gu Yuzhen, Mrs. Jiang)
a plum blossom branch?

26
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,669
Will you give me a hug?

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,109
Yuzhen!

28
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,719
Grand Marshal never explained

29
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,358
what you saw back then.

30
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,750
The truth is,
your mother committed suicide.

31
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,630
Yuzhen!

32
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,949
I've lost the battle

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,350
between us.

34
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,310
I die with no regrets

35
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,190
by your gun.

36
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,030
Grand Marshal never told anyone

37
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,269
what happened in the study that year.

38
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,350
He took that secret

39
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,030
to his grave.

40
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,000
I will not marry two women

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,399
(The Late Grand Marshal Jiang Yuan)

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,750
like you did.

43
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,590
I will marry no one

44
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,989
but her.

45
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,549
Our Wei has grown up,

46
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,269
Yuzhen.

47
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,830
Drown her!

48
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:36,390
Drown the harlot!

49
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,131
Drown the harlot!

50
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,991
Good!

51
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:48,099
Good!

52
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,240

55
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,830
Shen Qingru.

56
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,989
Three years ago, you swore

57
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,069
that you and your brother would never
have feelings for each other.

58
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,350
And yet,

59
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,150
you secretly had

60
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,989
a passionate affair

61
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,950
with your brother.

62
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,989
Do you admit

63
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,069
to this?

64
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,830
Even if Shen Cheng and I

65
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,869
truly love each other,

66
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,999
what can you do about it?

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,470
Shut up!

68
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,189
You harlot!

69
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,470
"Harlot."

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,710
My mother bore that same insult

71
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,069
as you drowned her in the river.

72
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,429
Countless women in Chunshui Town
were just like my mother,

73
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,710
carrying the weight of those insults,

74
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,429
turning into cold, lifeless bones
at the bottom of the river.

75
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,350
You're just like your father.

76
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,790
Members of the Yan clan!

77
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,030
Do you know

78
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,950
what kind of pathetic,

79
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,230
worthless man your clan leader is?

80
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,439
Shameful!

81
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,790
Disgraceful!

82
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,629
Truly a tramp!

83
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,950
Why?

84
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,879
Why are you
degrading yourself like this?

85
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,509
Why?

86
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,950
How can you be so utterly shameless?

87
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,749
You locked me away
in the depths of Yan's Residence.

88
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,309
For three years, without any sunlight.

89
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,309
You trapped me like a caged bird,
humiliated and abused me.

90
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,950
Between us lies
a sea of blood and hatred.

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,350
How could I possibly love a man

92
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,030
as heartless,

93
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,830
unrighteous,

94
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,629
loveless,

95
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,749
and incompetent as you?

96
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,869
Fine.

97
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,590
Since you're so determined to die...

98
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,109
Shen has committed incest

99
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,629
with her brother.

100
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,869
