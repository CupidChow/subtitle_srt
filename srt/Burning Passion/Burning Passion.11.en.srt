You don't know what you're saying.

Cheng.

10
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:16,621
Your brother-in-law saved me
from despair,

11
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,870
gave me

12
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:19,380
a life of luxury and riches,

13
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,020
and solved
the case of my mother's death.

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,861
I love him. I respect him.

never apart.

18
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,660
No.

19
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,901
You can't.

20
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:35,781
Have you forgotten the rules between us?

21
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,221
You're never late.

22
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,741
I was a little worried.

23
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,980
But I made it in time.

24
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,860
All these fireworks lighting up the sky

25
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,940
are for you, dear.

26
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,461
Let's go light the lantern
and make a wish.

27
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:30,701
As you wish.

28
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,060
Cheng.

29
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,421
How's the investigation
on the tailor going?

30
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:03,509
The county said the tailor shop
is just a normal investment

31
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,040
by the Chunshui Town's
chamber of commerce. Nothing suspicious.

32
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,180
Cheng, you're hurt!

33
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,100
Didn't I tell Deputy Zhang to...

34
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,420
I'm fine.

35
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,500
They were after Qingru.

36
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:36,509
Cheng.

37
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,660
Stop looking at them.

38
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,141
Why didn't you go
to the county hospital?

39
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,901
If that wound gets infected,
it could kill you.

40
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,141
I'm worried they'll make another move.

41
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:49,461
That's why you didn't go
to the hospital.

42
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,341
I can't dance with her,

43
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:57,701
but I can at least die for her.

44
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,141
Don't worry.

45
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:09,941
This won't kill me.

46
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,180
I'll do something about the wound.

47
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:15,180

you'd just shake your head.

53
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:03,381
Why the sudden interest in me?

54
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,021
I want to get to know you better.

55
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:11,060
