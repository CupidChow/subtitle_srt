I'll kill you!

Jun! Jun...

9
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:05,650
Let go.

10
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,090
Jun...

11
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,370
Give it to me.

12
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,051
Jun...

13
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,570
Jun...

14
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,090
Jun...

15
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,010
You wanted to pass off
your illegitimate child as mine.

16
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,211
When that didn't work,

17
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,579
you tried to lay your hands on my woman.

18
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,010
Jun, you mustn't believe that wench!

19
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,834
Should I believe you then?

20
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,051
Believe you'd do what?

21
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,620
Believe that you'd hand over
the Yan family's lifeline,

22
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:40,219
our mining rights, to the Lu family,

23
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,650
so you could drag the entire Yan family
to the grave with you?

24
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:46,010
Jun, this is just like gambling.

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,051
You can't put all your chips
on one side.

26
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,930
I'm your father!

27
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,331
Father.

28
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:57,060
You're going to die sooner or later.

29
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,331
No...

30
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:01,810
But you want to take
the entire Yan family down with you?

31
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,411
Not a chance!

32
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:06,331
I'm your father...

33
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:14,211
Jun...

34
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,451
Jun!

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,850
Guards!

36
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,250
Young Master.

37
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,090
From this day forward,

38
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:22,211
I am the clan leader.

39
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,250
The former clan leader will live out
the rest of his days in this room.

40
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,970
He is not to leave
unless it's in a coffin.

41
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,299
Jun!

42
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,650
Jun!

43
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:42,019
Jun!

44
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,690
Don't go!

45
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,650
Jun! Jun...

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,260
(Yan's Residence)
We received a report

47
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:01,970
that the Yan family is colluding
with the Lu family's army! Search!

48
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,130
I let my guard down.

49
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,850
I never imagined

50
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,410
your father would have such a vile plan...

51
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,611
- That's why I was...
- The Yan family will pay you back

52
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:23,291
for everything we owe you.

53
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,130
Young Master!

54
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,250
Bring them out!

55
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,850
On your knees!

56
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,011
On your knees!

57
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,579
Mr. Zhang?

58
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,140
Show some respect to the head

59
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:41,250
of the marshal's guard!

60
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,779
I'm sure

61
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,331
I've made my sincerity clear
in business, Deputy Zhang.

62
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,420
Colonel Wang forced the contract

63
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,970
upon my old and senile father.

64
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,700
Now, I'm in charge of Chunshui Town.

65
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,051
I will give you

66
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,690
a satisfactory explanation
regarding the contract, Marshal.

67
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:17,410
Mr. Yan,

68
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:19,610
this is no longer about the contract.

69
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,990
Last night, Colonel Wang tried
to assassinate the marshal.

70
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,251
Every single one of the corps
was killed.

71
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:26,460
He was a spy for the Lu family's army.

72
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:28,090
And the Yan family

73
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,660
colluded with the Lu family

74
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:33,290
to sell the mines to him.

75
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,730
Speak!

76
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:37,580
Were you involved in the assassination?

77
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:39,530
My family absolutely
had nothing to do with this!

78
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,650
The truth will speak for itself.

79
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:45,931
I trust the marshal
will clear the Yan family's name.

80
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:48,691
I only believe what's in writing.

81
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,211
Mr. Yan.

82
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,660
Your father signed

83
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,379
the mining rights over to Wang.

84
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,819
How do you expect the marshal

85
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,771
to believe your family
wasn't betraying him?

86
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,850
Search the place.

87
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,891
Leave no stone unturned!

88
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:28,490
Cheng, is this necessary?
You're already at the Yan's Residence.

89
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,460
Why not just pull out your gun,

90
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:32,691
reveal your identity,
and shoot Yan in the face?

91
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,819
She's borne the shame

92
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,850
of being a harlot's daughter
for far too long.

93
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,371
Only by defeating her enemy
with her own hands

94
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:45,970
can she break free from her shackles.

95
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,050
My gun can't do that for her.

96
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,331
Stop.

97
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:07,980
Don't touch anything.

98
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,211
Get out.

99
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:19,970
Ms. Shen.

100
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,819
We received your message.

101
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,891
Thank you.

102
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,460
Marshal, we uncovered evidence
of Clan Leader Yan's conspiracy

103
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,900
with the Lu family's forces,

104
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:37,331
but nothing about the assassination.

105
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,891
That will suffice.

106
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,891
Mr. Yan. You and your father have been
playing both sides with the Jiangs and Lus.

107
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:46,691
How will you answer to the marshal?

108
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,619
My father is old.

109
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,931
He misjudged people.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,540
But as the new clan leader,
Chunshui Town is now under my control.

111
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,011
Business is business.

112
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:57,811
We will compensate you according
to the contract, not a single dollar less.

113
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:01,251
Consider these my apology, Marshal.

114
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:03,371
I could care less.

115
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,251
Distribute it as disaster relief.

116
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,571
Give it all to the victims.

117
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:07,850
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,460
Make haste!

119
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:12,090
As soon as the roads are cleared,
the army will mobilize.

120
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,011
Mr. Yan,

121
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:16,931
remember your promise.

122
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,451
The marshal's patience is limited.

123
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,290
How long the Yan clan survives

124
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,331
depends on you.

125
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:26,580
Let's go.

126
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:27,650
Yes, sir.

127
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:45,290
Happy now?

128
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,299
I didn't expect this...

129
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,811
Take inventory
of our shops and land deeds.

130
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:50,499
Exclude Ms. Shen's personal belongings,

131
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,891
but gather everything else,

132
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,970
especially what the former clan leader

133
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,860
hid in the secret room.

134
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:57,939
Jun!

135
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,460
That's my...

136
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,460
It's your life.

137
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:00,059
Yes.

138
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,970
And I'm taking it.

139
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,730
All the servants have been dismissed.

140
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,290
But I didn't touch
the jewelry and clothes I bought you.

141
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,730
You can sell them all if you want.

142
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,131
They belong to the Yan family anyway.

143
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:37,250
They're yours.

144
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:39,610
What I gave you is yours.

145
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:47,010
We will get it all back.

146
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:48,850
Trust me,

147
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,051
