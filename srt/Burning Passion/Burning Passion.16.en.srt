Are you the chief editor?

You have ten minutes.

00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,619
Here's the headline.

10
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,570
"Shen Qingru's Divorce Announcement."

11
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:08,659
Cheng put his life in danger

12
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,370
because of this divorce announcement.

13
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,971
Whoever dares say no to it,

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,810
I will shoot them to dead.

15
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:16,411
I'll sign it.

(Chief Editor)

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,611
Stop dilly-dallying!

18
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,891
I'll print them out.

19
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:54,680
Do you know how to fire a gun?

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,771
Do you want me
to teach you how to do it?

21
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,290
My entire family is being kidnapped.

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,579
If this announcement gets out,

23
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,450
they will all be killed!

24
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:05,851
Please have mercy on us!

25
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,059
I was only away for a while

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,579
and you managed to capture her.

27
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,011
You're really something else.

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,011
Who said you'd come in here?

29
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:19,260
I always dried your hair

30
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:20,850
when you were injured all these years.

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,291
Why?

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,530
Now that you have Qingru,
I'm no longer needed, huh?

33
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,011
Treat me nicer, Cheng.

34
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:37,619
I got the best physician in town

35
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,451
to treat her wound.

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,051
She's now out of danger

37
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,040
and having a good sleep.

38
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:48,200
Since the county newspaper office doesn't work,
let's try the provincial one instead.

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,120
Isn't your former fiancee
the provincial newspaper office's chief editor?

40
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:53,690
But you ran away from the wedding.

41
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:56,530
I've never had a fiancee.

42
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:58,299
Fine.

43
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,650
You've never had one.

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,410
Wait a minute.

45
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,779
Didn't you head out

46
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,410
and call
the provincial newspaper office?

47
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,171
Cheng...

48
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:19,491
Go.

49
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:21,331
Cheng...

50
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,930
Don't come back again.

51
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:27,171
Don't come back again.

52
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:37,291
You took the bullet for me.

53
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,331
Yet, you want me to leave this place.

54
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,051
Did you know how many times
I charged through a hail of bullets and gunfire

55
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:50,211
and crawled out
from piles of dead bodies

56
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,530
just to make it back here?

57
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,611
Cheng...

58
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,090
Don't go.

59
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:38,970
Shen Cheng?

60
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,771
Since you're awake,
take this concoction.

61
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,730
Shen Qingru.

62
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,050
What exactly are you trying to do?

63
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:25,811
I should be asking you that.

64
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,891
What were you doing to me?

65
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:34,691
What?

66
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,290
Didn't you just say,

67
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:47,490
"Cheng,

68
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,730
don't go"?

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,610
He hasn't returned since then.

Did you know how old he was then?

76
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,811
