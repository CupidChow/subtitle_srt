00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,770
What are you doing, dear?

8
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,658
Nothing.

9
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,490
I'm just reminding myself

10
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,098
not to lose myself in decadence

11
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:09,250
when we're out having a business event.

12
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,610
Never forget everything
the Yan family did

13
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,890
to my mother, my brother,

14
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,970
and me.

15
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,250
You may avenge it.

16
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:24,050
But don't you ever hurt yourself
in my presence.

17
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,089
That's the new rule

18
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,369
between us.

19
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,490
Don't you find it ridiculous?

20
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,569
Remember to keep your word.

21
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:44,250
Cheng.

22
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:47,250
Come with me.

23
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:48,929
Cheng.

24
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:50,938
Cheng!

25
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,330
Where are you taking me?

26
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,658
Let go!

27
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,009
Let go, Shen Cheng!

28
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,850
Where exactly are you taking me?

29
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:09,659
Young Master.

30
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,610
- Go get Colonel Wang now.
- Yes.

31
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:14,058
Shen Cheng...

32
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,610
Let go, Shen Cheng!

33
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,129
Have you lost your mind, Shen Cheng?

34
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:22,458
What are you doing?

35
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:23,689
Let go!

36
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:25,529
Let go, Shen Cheng!

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,210
Shen Cheng!

38
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,089
Just see me as a lunatic who's lost himself.
The more you struggle, the more it hurts.

39
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,689
Qingru.

40
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:09,170
Your injury...

41
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,730
Untie me. Let me help you with that.

42
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,409
It's getting late.

43
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,890
The county's newspaper office is closed.

44
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:33,249
Newspaper office?

45
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:43,210
We're going to there

46
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:45,330
and report your divorce.

47
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:51,170
(No matter what you want to do,)

48
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,610
(I will never
let you go back to Yan Jun.)

49
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,210
What has he done to you

50
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,049
in these past three years
while I was away?

51
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,289
I can't

52
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,089
divorce Yan Jun.

53
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,450
You can't do that?

54
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,450
Or you don't want to?

55
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,930
You can't.

56
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:45,419
(Quanyou Trading Company)

57
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,419
Sir, we've surrounded the entire building.

58
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,459
They're right in there.

59
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,169
How dare that brat
kill my men in public?

60
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:53,019
You two, come with me.

61
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,169
Yes.

62
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,370
I'm not having a divorce. I just want...

63
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,849
I love Yan Jun.

64
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,370
I would have believed you
if you had said that a few days ago.

65
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,339
I'm done here, Cheng.

66
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,720
- What do we do next?
- We'll talk about that after this.

67
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:35,729
Go on.

68
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,169
Even though he hits me,

69
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:40,818
that only happens once in a while.

70
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:43,089
He dotes on me most of the time.

71
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,210
I would've believed that
if it were someone else.

72
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,570
But not you.

73
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,010
You're Shen Qingru.

74
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,529
Permission granted. Stand by.

75
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,298
Even if I don't love him,

76
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:13,250
I want to be the Yan family's mistress.

77
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,729
I want to be
the future clan leader's wife.

78
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,930
Well said.

79
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,690
But whether or not you like it,
you are getting a divorce.

80
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,549
Open up!

81
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,988
Open up!

82
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,138
Search the place!

83
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,210
Yes!

84
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,659
Sir. Looks like they've run away by car.

85
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,649
Give chase!

86
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,890
Yes!

87
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,250
That car...

88
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:21,089
I paid them three extra coins

89
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,849
to drive the car away.

90
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,930
Are you going to force me to do so?

91
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,010
You have two options here.

92
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,250
You either get a divorce

93
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,169
or become a widow.

94
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,979
I've had some information, Young Master.

95
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,339
Well... Mrs. Yan is going

96
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,779
to report your divorce.

97
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,210
You may go.

98
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,690
Yes.

99
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,010
(Why do you release lanterns
with me every year with a mask on?)

100
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,289
(Why are you asking that
all of a sudden?)

101
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,289
(I want to get to know you.)

102
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,698
May I know your name,

103
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:26,378
Qingru.

104
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,099
miss?

105
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,330
Let's go.

106
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,810
Shen Qingru.

107
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:34,489
I won't let it slide this time.

108
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,498
(Chun County Daily)

109
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:41,810
Dear.

110
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,849
Are you really going
to report our divorce?

111
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:59,129
I got it now.

112
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,930
Say no more.

113
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:03,969
It's time to put an end

114
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:06,330
to our affair.

115
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,530
Qingru...

116
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,650
Shen Cheng is my bottom line.

117
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,690
As expected, only you

118
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,290
know how to get rid of me.

119
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,249
How cunning of you.

120
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:38,969
Qingru...

121
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,089
Qingru!

122
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,089
Qingru.

123
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,729
If we're having to do
with one another after today,

124
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,170
I'd rather die as your husband.

125
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:55,690
- I'll grant your wish, then!
- Watch out, Young Master!

126
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:02,690
Qingru.

127
