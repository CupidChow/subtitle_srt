Anyone?

You'll clean it.

18
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:00,940
Sorry for the tardiness.

19
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:02,170
Let me clean it.

20
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,091
That's not how you do it.

21
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:28,211
It's still not clean.

22

Alright.

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,250
I'll clean it thoroughly this time.

Isn't that the mute guy?

25
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,300
Yeah, that's him.

26
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,379
Didn't he get kicked out
three years ago?

27
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,091
(What's he doing back now?)

28
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,651
Shen Cheng!

29
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,659
He dropped the offering.

30
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,820
That's a bad omen.

31
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:06,410
Just put out another one.

32
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,371
(Cheng...)

33
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:13,010
(You came back after all.)

34
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:15,931
This is a chest of gold bars.

35
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:17,651
Is it enough?

36
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:21,051
It's to make up

37
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,690
for my sister's dowry.

38
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:25,820
(Yan's Residence)

39
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:28,820
They say you left town to go into business
three years ago, Mr. Shen.

40
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:30,451
But you are back now.

41
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,300
Our Clan Leader said

42
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:33,779
you are both honored guests.

43
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,059
You may stay here as long as you like.

44
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,339
Go wherever you please.

45
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,451
Please, come in.

46
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,740
Brother, did we really need to

47
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:43,810
come here for something this trivial?

48
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:45,451
We're looking for the map.

49
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,771
Where do we even start?

50
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:48,899
And what's the deal between you

51
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,130
and Mrs. Yan?

52
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,339
Be careful when you speak.

53
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,290
The Young Master and Mrs. Yan live here.

54
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:55,771
No entry without permission.

55
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,970
This way, please.

56
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,860
Still upset?

58
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:41,251

I was just as surprised.

You won't accept
the match your family arranged,

109
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,291
and you flip out

a better little brother
