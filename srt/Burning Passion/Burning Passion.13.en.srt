=Episode 13=

7
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,280
- Mr. Zhang.
- Second Young Master, don't call me that.

8
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,730
Still calling me that?

9
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:03,730
You'll blow my cover.

10
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,961
It's fine. No big deal.

11
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:05,729
Cheng.

12
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,449
I already rerouted

13
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,041
the Marshal's private train.

14
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,289
We're all set to leave.

15
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,449
And you've sent Deputy Zhang

16
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,201
to the Yan family to look into the mine.

17
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:15,041
So, why are you still
getting all dressed up?

18
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,041
He's going to the Yan family
for business.

19
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,961
I've got my own reasons for going.

20
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:23,130
Cheng, don't do anything stupid.

21
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:25,321
Weren't those killers hired
by the Mo family?

22
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,520
The Mo's Residence
burned down three years ago.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,929
Everyone said it was your doing.

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,890
Now, the remaining few

25
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,681
want revenge the second you're back.

26
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,369
The uncles and nephews
running businesses out of town

27
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,770
paid a fortune to hire those men.

28
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:37,649
Didn't Deputy Zhang already
crack the case?

29
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,841
Let's just wipe out
the Mo family and end it.

30
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:42,201
It's not that simple.

31
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:44,841
Cut it out.

32
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:47,401
You just can't let go of Shen Qingru.

33
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:49,201
Pass me the towel.

34
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,449
Shen Qingru is impressive.

35
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,000
She's got you under her thumb.

36
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,520
No wonder everyone in town says she's...

37
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,160
What?

38
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,360
Go on.

39
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:05,920
Just kill me.

40
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,330
Grab that knife.

41
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:08,761
Go on, cut me with it.

42
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,721
She's someone's wife now.

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,329
As long as you stay in Chunshui Town,

44
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,120
she'll never have her name cleared.

45
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,561
So, the best you can do

46
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:25,360
is leave this place.

47
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,009
Fine, I'll shut up.

48
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,640
I'm sorry, Cheng!

49
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,960
Calm down.

50
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,761
My clothes.

51
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,561
What a frail little thing.

52
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,520
Stretch your arms.

53
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,800
Once we arrive at the Yan's Residence,
I'll go in alone.

54
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,561
Wait for me in the car.

55
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,130
Guard Unit, stand by.

56
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:53,281
Yes, sir.

57
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,889
Mr. Zhang,
a pleasure to have you here.

58
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,970
You've brought honor
to our humble home.

59
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,601
Please, have some tea.

60
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,850
Colonel Wang, please enjoy the tea.

61
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:04,800
Young Master Yan is quite thoughtful.

62
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,561
He even had his wife
personally serve us.

63
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,530
I'm not sure my old bones

64
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:12,561
can handle this kind of treatment.

65
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:17,481
I've heard your wife is famous
for being a wise and capable woman.

66
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,120
She must've
helped you out a lot, Colonel.

67
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:22,289
I'd love to learn
a thing or two from her.

68
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:22,960
Her?

69
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,680
(Wang Duren, peace preservation corps)
She wins more at mahjong than anything else.

70
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,240
Please, enjoy your tea.

71
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,481
I'll be in the dining hall
to prepare lunch.

72
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,080
Thank you, dear.

73
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:46,729
(Mr. Zhang, please enjoy this tea.)

74
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,001
(It's the finest Junshan Yinzhen.)

75
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:51,601
You flatter me, Clan Leader Yan.

76
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,441
For our future cooperation,

77
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:55,930
and for the safety of the mine,

78
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,721
we'll be counting on Colonel Wang.

79
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,650
You're too modest, Mr. Zhang.

80
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,881
Given your connection
to the Grand Marshal,

81
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,250
I wouldn't dare

82
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:05,840
meddle in the mine again.

83
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:08,449
You're too kind, Colonel Wang.

84
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,650
The Yan family will still

85
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:12,001
rely on you
to keep the peace in the county.

86
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,449
You flatter me.

87
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,449
Who goes there?

88
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,530
Shen Cheng?

89
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:17,040
Didn't you leave?

90
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:19,570
Why you...

91
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,010
Do you want me to leave so badly?

92
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,441
Did the Yan family commit a crime?

93
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,400
Shen Cheng, your insolence

94
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,040
is disrespectful!

95
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:31,650
And this is?

96
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:32,921
My brother-in-law.

97
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:35,480
He should know
better than to be so rude.

98
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:37,441
Apologies for the rudeness.

99
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,960
It's quite all right.

100
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:45,321
Colonel Wang of
the peace preservation corps.

101
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:46,489
That's me.

102
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,720
What is it?

103
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:49,249
At the fair,

104
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,600
I was almost assassinated.

105
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:52,761
- The attacker...
- We never investigated.

106
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,080
But, I know who it is.

107
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,080
Give me an answer before noon.

108
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,410
Shen Cheng.

109
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:19,400
Do you even know what you're saying?

110
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,400
If you want to side with them,

111
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:26,840
I can make that happen right now.

112
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,201
Who are you, really?

113
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:32,321
Show your true color.

114
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:47,561
Shen Cheng is armed.

115
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:49,160
Get more men ready

116
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:51,121
just in case.

117
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,201
Here's your tea.

118
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,650
Mr. Shen, calm down.

119
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:09,729
Please have some tea.

120
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,729
Did you brew this tea?

121
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,160
My brother doesn't drink tea.

122
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:14,321
Mrs. Yan.

123
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,321
It's poisoned.

124
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,561
What's going on?

125
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,201
Mr. Shen...

126
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,520
Butler Yan.

127
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,640
How do you explain this?

128
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:29,720
Young Master.

129
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,570
I have no idea.

130
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:32,840
The tea...

131
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:35,441
The tea came from the kitchen.

132
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,729
Are you implying

133
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,241
I poisoned the tea?

134
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,729
Who would I poison?

135
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,770
My own brother?

136
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:42,049
Clan Leader, help me!

137
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,090
This isn't my doing!

138
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:45,489
Calm down.

139
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,280
We're not accusing you of anything.

140
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,770
You're an old man
who's served us for 30 years.

141
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:52,600
No one said you did it.

142
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:53,689
Just leave.

143
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,960
Yes.

144
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,480
Hold on.

145
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,850
Shen Cheng! How dare you shoot him?

146
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:02,761
Butler Yan tried to poison my brother!

147
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:04,809
Mrs. Yan.

148
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,850
Someone died during the fair.

149
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:08,609
My men suspect

150
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,561
Shen Cheng is the murderer.

151
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:11,609
Mr. Yan.

152
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,090
I'll be counting on you, Young Master,
to keep the mine business running

153
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:17,121
so I can still make a living.

154
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,441
You are too modest, Colonel Wang.

155
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:22,570
We need you to keep Chunshui Town safe.

156
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:26,129
But today, bandits barged into my home,

157
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,570
and injured my servant.

158
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:28,720
Well,

159
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:30,650
you owe me an explanation.

160
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,160
Do not worry, Clan Leader Yan.

161
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,890
I'll make sure you get one.

162
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:34,489
Guards.

163
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,249
Yes, sir.

164
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,400
Seize him.

165
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,080
Speak. Who ordered you?

166
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:54,970
I don't know what you're talking about.

167
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:56,720
Whose memorial tablet
do you keep at home?

168
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:00,040
Second Young Master.

169
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:01,450
What did my brother find out?

170
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:02,720
Should I smash it now?

171
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,080
What tablet?

172
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:14,801
That's right.

173
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:16,049
It was me.

174
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,480
Thirty years ago,

175
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,520
I was begging
on the streets of Chunshui Town,

176
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,361
and Old Madam Mo took me in.

177
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:25,480
You and your sister
are the ones who killed her.

178
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,210
Now, I'll kill you both!

179
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:31,361
Watch out!

180
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,441
Are you all right?

181
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:36,050
Young Master.

182
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:37,201
Tell me.

183
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,009
Who were you really trying to kill

184
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,161
during the fair?

185
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,369
Young Master.

186
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,729
Everything I did was for you.

187
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,649
That woman is nothing but trouble.

188
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,041
Jun!

189
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:51,681
Keep him alive.

190
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,880
You watched me grow up.

191
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:57,720
I'll see you to your grave.

192
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,281
You...

193
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:02,489
Yan Jun!

194
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,080
You can rest in peace now.

195
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,161
I heard

196
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,080
Shen Cheng is leaving.

197
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:43,210
And you agreed to
let Shen Qingru go see him off?

198
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:46,480
Aren't you worried
the two of them might elope?

199
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,641
She'll come back.

200
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,129
Let's talk about the assassination.

201
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,541
(Yan)

202
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:58,090
Father.

203
00:09:58,091 --> 00:09:58,810
(Yan)

204
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:01,120
The assassin at the fair

205
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:04,080
was after Qingru, wasn't he?

206
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,041
Your wound...

207
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,801
How is it?

208
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,600
I'll live.

209
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,360
That's why I stayed.

210
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,240
But I won't be here long.

211
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,041
The train.

212
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,041
This is the one you met
at the alley that day.

213
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,921
It smudged your clothes.

214
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:11,880
So, I got you a new one.

215
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,360
It's the latest style from out of town.

216
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:40,561
I thought it would suit you.

217
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,801
Go try it on.

218
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,641
You should get ready for the train.

219
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,360
