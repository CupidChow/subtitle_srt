Dear, you're stubborn indeed.

00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:21,231
But that's precisely why I like you.

00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:30,470

Young Master,

26
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,960
my younger brother committed
the mistake because of me.

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm willing
to be punished on his behalf.

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,231
Young Master,
please give us your verdict.

29
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:27,550
Let him go!

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,471
Cheng!

you didn't belong in Chunshui Town

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,311
since the day I met you.

34
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,990
Hurry and go.

35
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,631
From today onward,

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,710
your elder sister, Shen Qingru,

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,950
will be the female head
of the Shen family.

She's the young madam of our family now.

39
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,031
(Would things be different)

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,990
(had I left together with you
three years ago?)

41
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:02,351
(Qingru,)

42
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:04,550
(it's my fault for being inept.)

00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:06,631

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,599

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,311
(I'll reveal the truth)

46
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:11,670
(and escape from this cage.)

47
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:31,231
Young Master Jiang, did you
slept well last night?

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,950
I did.

49
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,710
Why do you reek of alcohol?

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,751
Do you drink often outside
all these years?

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
Keep your own husband in check
and mind your own business.

52
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,031
What kind of attitude was that?

53
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,319
Isn't it obvious?

54
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,791
I'm just an outsider.

55
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,231
Dear.

56
00:03:57,681 --> 00:03:58,830
Have a seat.

57
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,851
It's been three years
since you two had met.

58
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,550
But you two know each other inside out.

59
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,080
You two understand each other
without words.

60
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,271
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

61
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:22,271
I've never seen you
this talkative before.

62
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,190
Let's eat.

63
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,670
I don't have any appetite.

64
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,870
You don't have an appetite, not me.

65
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,550
By the way, dear,

66
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,319
the map of Chunshui Town
I kept in our room,

67
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,550
it's gone.

68
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,920
Have you seen it around?

69
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,870
(Why is he asking me that
all of a sudden?)

70
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:02,959
This map is vital.

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,951
It concerns the safety of the town.

72
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,190
(I think Cheng did
hide something last night.)

73
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,711
(Could it be that he has stolen it?)

74
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:14,310
(But what would he do with the map?)

75
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,711
Dear.

76
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:21,911
Don't worry. Since it's in our residence,
I'm sure it's still around.

77
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,510
I'll find it for you.

78
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:27,391
Let's eat, then.

79
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,911
(She's distant from me,)

80
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:38,151
(yet she's hiding
the truth for my sake.)

81
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,911
Thank you, dear.

82
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,630
(No matter what you have in mind,)

83
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:45,990
(I'll help you out.)

84
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:50,911
How's your relationship with
Shen Qingru all this while?

85
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,471
Father, didn't you send your men
to keep an eye on us?

86
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:56,430
Shen Cheng came back
because of Shen Qingru.

87
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:59,070
The county specifically
sent a letter instructing me

88
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,880
to treat him well

89
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:02,911
like an esteemed guest.

90
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,560
An esteemed guest?

91
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:06,990
Why would an esteemed guest
steal a map of our town?

92
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,040
Do you mean a map of our mine?

93
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,159
This mine concerns
the livinghood of the Yan family.

94
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,550
How would he know about it?

95
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,750
He's a mute blacksmith.

96
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,680
But in

97
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:19,519
just three years,

98
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,839
he became Young Master Shen.

99
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,959
The validity of the letter
and the sources of the gold,

100
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,510
have you investigated them?

101
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,031
I'll find out who Shen Cheng is.

102
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,310
Jun.

103
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:33,670
Come back.

104
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,951
Tell me.

105
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,391
Are you trying to investigate
Shen Cheng?

106
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,231
Or are you just afraid
that he might steal Shen Qingru from you?

107
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,711
The Mo's Residence was burned down.

108
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,719
Old Madam Mo and her servants are dead.

109
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,990
Young Master!

110
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:49,600
Everyone in the town said

111
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:51,279
that Shen Cheng was behind the incident.

112
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
From today onward,

113
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:54,759
your elder sister will be
the young madam of our family.

114
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,480
I've told you this long ago.

115
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:58,550
Shen Qingru is...

116
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,031
I ended up like this
all because of Shen Qingru.

117
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm going to keep her in my cage.

118
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:06,510
This is what she owes me.

119
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,310
Father, you should withdraw your men.

120
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,040
My wife and I

121
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,070
don't like it when people spy on us.

122
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:19,911
This brat is getting
crazier and crazier.

123
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,911
What?

124
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,680
Cheng, what's wrong?

125
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:52,190
Are you itching to forge something?

126
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,670
Or are you itching
to get into a relationship?

127
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,639
Cheng, it's more than just an itch.

128
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,110
You're utterly impatient.

129
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:04,750
You can no longer wait, huh?

130
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:07,791
Young Marshal.

131
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:12,079
Tell Marshal Jiang that the mine
is at Lanshan Forest of Steles.

132
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,920
Yes, sir.

133
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:13,839
Cheng.

134
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,550
Was that what Father
wanted you to find out?

135
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,310
Return the map to its original spot.

136
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,000
- Cheng, but... How should I...
- Deal with it yourself.

137
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:23,990
Go now.

138
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,391
(You want me to deal with it myself?)

139
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:29,911
(Just you wait.)

140
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:32,439
Young Marshal,

141
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,110
if it's located in the forest of steles,

142
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,880
the clans in the town

143
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,750
are unlikely to let this go easily.

144
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,191
If so, we shall lay waste
to Chunshui Town.

145
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,591
How dare you kidnap
the young master's wife?

146
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,431
Do you guys have a death wish?

147
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,679
So, you know that you're married, huh?

148
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,150
If so, how dare you still make
people long for you?
