7
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,930
Sir.

8
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,010
We found a large amount
of explosives here.

9
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,290
Conduct a full search.

10
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,060
See if there are any more explosives.

11
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:29,170
Yes, sir.

12
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:33,771
Yan Jun.

13
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,251
It's time for you to pay for everything

14
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,930
you've done to me.

15
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,010
I knew you'd figure out where I'd be.

16
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:53,411
Go now.

17
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,331
What are you going to do?

18
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,051
Everyone in Chunshui Town who hurt you,

19
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,691
who hurt your mother,

20
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,011
they're all here.

21
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,410
I'll make them pay

22
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,530
for what they did.

23
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:24,090
I'll drag them all

24
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,410
to hell with me.

25

(Prosperity for Generations)

26
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,171
When you forced me to marry you,

27
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,970
did you know about the sins
your father committed?

28
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,930
I knew.

29
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:07,250
What grudge did we have between us?

30
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,130
You made me marry you,

31
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,899
the son of my family's murderer.

32
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,090
Endure your torment night after night!

33
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,491
You wanted to sink me in the river.

34
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:22,499
You used me to get at Shen Cheng.

35
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,930
You drove the knife
straight into my heart.

36
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:30,331
What grudge was so deep
that you had to torture me so?

37
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,970
The truth is,

38
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:40,650
I never wanted the night to come.

39
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:43,451
Being a married couple,

40
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,611
to you, it was torment.

41
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:49,530
To me,

42
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,171
it was both torment

43
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:55,130
and a painfully beautiful daydream.

44
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:19,251
Don't you think you're ridiculous?

45
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,650
Absolutely, utterly ridiculous.

46
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:36,730
You've feigned your love
for me for three years.

47
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,451
I know it was hard for you
to keep up the act.

48
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:42,090
Sorry for putting you
through such suffering.

49
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,610
Shoot me.

50
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:45,451
I deserve it.

51
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,850
I can't believe this day actually came.

52
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,090
To think you had in you
a shred of love for me, after all.

53
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,691
This deadlock between us,

54
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,931
I hate that it wasn't me who started it.

55
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:39,811
But I want you to be the one to end it.

56
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:43,970
Shoot me.

57
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:46,170
Please.

58
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:12,331
(Why do you wear a mask every year
when we light the lanterns?)

59
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:16,211
(Why the sudden interest in me?)

60
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:18,490
(I want to get to know you better.)

61
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:23,410
(You want to know me,)

62
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,011
(but I don't like
talking about the past.)

63
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,451
(All right.)

64
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,131
(Then let's talk about the future.)

65
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,420
(Young Master! You're out of your mind!)

66
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,059
(That iron cage is welded shut!)

67
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,530
(If you didn't make it,)

68
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,619
(neither will the rest of us!)

69
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,560
(What's this nonsense
about cold invading his body)

70
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,850
(and his manhood damaged?)

71
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:44,730
(He is to be the next clan leader!)

72
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:47,610
(If he cannot perform in bed,)

73
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,730
(how will he carry on
the Yan family's bloodline?)

74
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,211
(I want to meet you
for the first time again every year.)

75
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,610
(May I know your name,)

76
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:03,090
(Miss?)

77
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,340
It is the rule

78
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:09,410
that shameless women
be drowned in Chunshui Town.

79
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:11,811
We drown her today

80
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:14,811
as a warning to others.

81
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,970
Carry out the clan law!
