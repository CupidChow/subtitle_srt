My grievance

14
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,160
is nothing compared to yours.

Have I made you wait for too long?

Have I?

00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:51,769
Tell me

(Yan)

30
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,761
You drowned my mother back then

31
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,449
(Yan)
over the same lies.

32
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,090
(It's him.)

33
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:30,569
My mother was innocent.

34
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,250
Drowing a shameless woman

35
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:34,650
has always been a rule
here in Chunshui Town.

Mother!

37
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,321
Carry out the clan law!

00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:41,281
Mother!

39
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:43,360
I'm coming to your rescue!

40
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:45,410
Mother!

00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:46,800
Brother!

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,800
(I've actually lived with my enemy)

44
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,161
It's actually him.

45
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:57,640
Mother.

46
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,360

What's the matter?

50
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:20,201
Nothing.

51
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:26,321
Why are you here?

52
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,570
I was worried about you.
Besides, the death of the tailor...

53
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,720
Cheng.

54
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,280
What exactly is the matter, Qingru?

55
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,121
(I won't let you get hurt again
because of me.)

56
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,201
I miss our mother.

57
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,801
I'll be here.

Cheng.

59
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,761
I've finally figured out the truth
behind Mother's death.

00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:08,801
Yes.

63
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,241
I saw Mother today.

64
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,001
But my brother wasn't there.

65
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:22,840
Back then, he jumped into the icy river
without a second thought.

66
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:25,201
I'm sure he can see Mother there.

67
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,761
He has her to keep him company.

68
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:30,480

If he couldn't find our mother,

73
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,201
he would feel so scared and lonely.

74
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,720
Perhaps he's too playful

75
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,361
