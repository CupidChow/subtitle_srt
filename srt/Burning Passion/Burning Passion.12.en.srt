=Episode 12=

7
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,491
As a soldier,

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,030
are you afraid of dying?

9
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,509
Yes.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,709
(I used to be afraid too.)

11
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,630
(But then your mother died.)

12
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,318
(In times like these,)

13
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,509
(there is no time to spare for romance,)

14
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,550
(only life and death.)

15
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,750
(Cheng.)

16
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,789
(You've been through)

17
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,919
(hell and back these past three years,)

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,598
(haven't you?)

19
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,309
(What is the three-year promise?)

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,910
(This is our three-year promise.)

21
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,830
(How do you really feel about me?)

22
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,709
(From the day I married you,)

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,069
(every day has felt like
living in a dream.)

24
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,559
(But I don't dare succumb to it.)

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,229
Living in a dream

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,630
but not daring to fall.

27
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,829
It's the same for me.

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,320
But you're the one who makes me
want to believe it is real…

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,389
(Cheng.)

30
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:21,590
Come.

31
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,310
Sit.

32
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,190
(It's been three years, Shen Qingru.)

33
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,669
(Was any of it real for you?)

34
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,389
Where did all this blood come from,

35
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,590
dear?

36
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,430
You like blood, don't you?

37
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,390
I got it on me on purpose,

38
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,549
to make you happy.

39
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,510
Make me happy?

40
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,869
Yan Jun!

41
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,229
You lunatic!

42
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,390
How could Shen Cheng ever measure up

43
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,030
to everything I've done for you?

44
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,830
If we could just be a normal couple,

45
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,549
would you truly love me?

46
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,510
Do you know

47
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,070
what I told Shen Cheng tonight?

48
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,350
I told him

49
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,869
I want to fall with you.

50
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,869
I didn't lie.

51
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,070
Tonight,

52
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,350
when I lit the lantern, I made a wish.

53
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,239
I wished to stay entangled
with you forever.

54
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,350
We'll always be together.

55
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,749
Won't we?

56
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,749
Of course.

57
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,510
Of course.

58
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,189
As you wish.

59
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,549
As you wish.

60
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,559
(Chunshui Station)

61
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,758
Where's the assassin's body?

62
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,559
The townspeople found it after the fair

63
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,789
and reported it to the corps.

64
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,999
Investigate the Mo family
and the Yan family for the assassin's identity.

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,030
Yes, sir.

66
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,350
Also,

67
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,040
Yan Jun just made it known

68
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,749
that he's interested in working
with you on a new mining venture.

69
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,549
He came knocking on my door.

70
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,470
Disguise yourself as a businessman
from the provincial capital to meet him.

71
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,580
Tell him you have connections
with the marshal's estate.

72
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,789
Dress the part.
Don't give yourself away.

73
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,910
Yes, sir.

74
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,869
"Sir"?

75
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,749
If you're going to play a rich man,
act the part.

76
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,150
Nice trap.

77
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,679
Now, take your medicine.

78
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,229
Prepare to leave Chunshui Town.

79
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,510
Well, you still need take your medicine.

80
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,350
They're gone?

81
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,758
Young Master Jiang
just packed his things.

82
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,989
Shen Cheng hasn't shown up.

83
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,869
The corps saw

84
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,999
signs of struggle in the alley.

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,629
It seems Shen Cheng was injured.

86
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,758
If he's injured,

87
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,350
he should have come to us.

88
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,958
If he didn't,

89
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,549
it's either because he couldn't
figure out who the assassin was,

90
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,749
or because he's afraid to dig deeper.

91
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,150
Unless…

92
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,109
Shen Cheng's identity is fake.

93
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,030
Cheng.

94
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,510
(I told you not to drink.)

95
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,109
(But you never listen.)

96
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,359
(But once you're married,)

97
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,950
(your wife will take care of you.)

98
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,390
(I hope you find happiness.)

99
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,789
It's time for me to do what I should.

100
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,149
You smell like alcohol.

101
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,790
I do.

102
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,430
While you were in the bath,

103
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,869
I went to Cheng's place.

104
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,470
Sat there, reminisced a little.

105
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,229
Had a drink.

106
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,190
Is that not allowed?

107
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,509
It hurts,

108
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,989
doesn't it?

109
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,470
I'm sorry, dear.

110
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,509
- I'll…
- You'll…

111
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,790
You'll control yourself.

112
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,550
You've been saying that for three years.

113
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,509
Can you really do it?

114
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,880
Shouldn't you be heading
to the chamber of commerce?

115
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,190
I hosted the fair

116
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,430
for the matter of the mines.

117
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,989
Colonel Wang has been eyeing
the my family's mining rights for years.

118
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,989
His waters run deep.

119
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,790
Instead of working with Wang,

120
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,389
I'd rather use the mining rights
to build ties with Marshal Jiang.

121
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,670
We attracted
a businessman named Mr. Zhang.

122
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,710
He claims he can connect us
to Marshal Jiang.

123
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,240
I plan to hold banquet at home
to entertain him,

124
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,509
and I've invited Wang too.

125
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,869
Just to remind him of his place.

126
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,830
What does this have to do with me?

127
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,029
You never bring me to social events.

128
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,350
From now on, anywhere I go,

129
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,229
you can come too.

130
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,950
I'll leave

131
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,950
the luncheon to you.

132
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,190
How does that sound?

133
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,470
We'll see how I feel.

134
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,229
I've never seen
this willful side of you.

135
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,869
I'm rather fond of it.

136
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,720
(Mining Shares)
(Both Mr. Zhang and Colonel Wang)

137
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,430
(are after the mining rights.)

138
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,229
(Behind Mr. Zhang
stands Grand Marshal Jiang.)

139
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,950
