Shen Qingru,

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,570
who

9
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,330
am I

You

12
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,650
are...

13
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,211
Jiang Wei! Die!

Cheng!

17
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:52,891
Answer me.

18
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,290
What?

19
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,140
Answer my question.

20
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:57,980
At a time like this?

21
00:01:57,981 --> 00:01:59,411
Focus on staying alive!

22
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,331
There are plenty of people
who want me dead.

23
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:16,211
If you don't tell me now,

24
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:18,970
there may not be another chance.

25
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,530

Father!

32
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,250
Father!

33
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,090
You...

34
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,860
You two...

35

Are you even a man?

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,970
Let him go!

37
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,130
Shen Cheng,

38
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,331
my biggest mistake

39
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,211
was letting you leave Chunshui Town.

40
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,970
Yan Jun.

41
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,611
Let my father go, and I'll stay with you
until the end of our days.

42
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,891
Excellent suggestion.

43
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:32,731
My father's dead.

44
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,810
I no longer have anything
to keep you by my side.

45
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:39,891
Ms. Shen.

46
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:44,250
I can give you everything,

47
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,211
including myself.

48
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,810
And I can destroy everything,

49
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,940
including you.

50
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:55,130
No!

51
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:02,491
Qingru.

52
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,810
Yan Jun.

53
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:18,331
If you don't let my father go,

54
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:20,650
I'll fight you
until the end of our days.

55
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,650
Point the gun

56
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,891
at me.

57
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,691
Qingru...

58
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:42,251
There is nothing crueler
than striking one's weakness.

59
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,850
I am no match for you

60
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,490
when it comes to having a stone heart.

61
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,251
I know exactly what you want.

62
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,170
And I also know what you fear the most.

63
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:15,259
Father!

64
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,371
Father!

65
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:17,490
Father!

66
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:20,011
Father... Father!

67
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,371
Sir.

68
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,980
After them!

69
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:27,050
Yes, sir!

70
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:31,900
Several groups of people
didn't get word about the ceasefire

71
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,331
and came for the bounty.

72
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:34,891
I left a few alive.

73
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,059
Kill them.

74
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,131
Understood.

75
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:38,650
Stop!

76
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,891
Marshal.

77
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:55,211
Mr. Song.

78
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,571
What brings you here?

79
00:05:57,781 --> 00:05:59,011
Cheng?

80
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,090
Marshal?

81
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:06,000
Jiang Wei.

82
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:09,311
(Deputy Song, Jiang Family Army)

83
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,120
Grand Marshal Jiang is critically ill.

84
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:14,139
If you hurry,

85
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,691
you might still make it in time.

86
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:18,610
Didn't get that from the phone call.

87
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:23,490
If you could figure it out
from a phone call,

88
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,811
he wouldn't be Grand Marshal Jiang.

89
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,211
Mr. Song.

90
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,170
If you don't leave now,

91
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,290
I'll shoot the woman
that's keeping you here.

92
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,451
I'm taking her with me.

93
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,131
I will not aim my gun
at Grand Marshal Jiang's son.

94
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:08,530
Either you shoot me right now,

95
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,331
or you come with me.

96
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,730
There's no other option.

97
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:26,311
(Yan's Residence)

98
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:30,891
Yan Jun.

99
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,170
If she loses even a single hair,

100
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:34,819
in three days,

101
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,179
I'll return with my troops

102
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,850
and flatten Chunshui Town!

103
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,530
So, it was you and your brother

104
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,610
who destroyed everything
the Yan family worked so hard to build.

105
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,730
Tell me.

106
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,451
How do you think

107
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:12,931
this should end between us?

108
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:21,811
Only one of us will survive.

109
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:28,090
You're right.

110
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:31,931
As you wish.

111
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,610
(I sent you away)

112
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:16,090
(because I didn't want you
to see any of this.)

113
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:20,571
(I have no regrets in this life.)

114
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,451
(My only regret is that)

115
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,211
(I won't get to see you grow up.)

116
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,010
(Wei,)

117
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:31,730
(don't ever bring me up again.
Not at home,)

118
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,460
(not in front of your father,)

119
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:34,811
(all right?)

120
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,850
(You killed her!)

121
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:43,610
(I couldn't accept Mother's death,
so I left home without a second thought.)

122
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,691
(I kept my promise to Mother,)

123
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,890
(and for over ten years,
I never spoke of her again.)

124
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,691
(Until three years ago,)

125
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:53,890
(when I was separated from Qingru.)

126
00:09:58,701 --> 00:09:59,659
