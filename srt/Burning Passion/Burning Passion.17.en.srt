7
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,610
It's ruined.

8
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,570
It's ruined.

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,811
There go her ashes.

10
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:04,980
What have we done wrong to deserve this?

11
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,711
(The Late Mrs. Shen)

12
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,730
Shut up!

13
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:19,851
Dear.

14
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:22,131
Young Master.

15
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:23,570
We're now...

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,010
Ms. Shen.

17
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:31,411
Today, I came

18
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:34,810
to make one thing clear.

19
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:37,930
Ms. Shen didn't elope with her brother.

20
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,099
She chose to report the divorce

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,411
because she's had enough of my abuse.

22
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:45,700
As the young master,

23
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,450
I have been misconducted myself.

24
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,971
By right,

25
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:51,810
I should be punished
according to the clan law.

26
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,211
Enough!

27
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:22,260
It's all my fault.

28
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,571
Ms. Shen is nothing but innocent.

29
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,850
I've done her wrong.

30
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,130
If anyone dares to shame her again,

31
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,891
that person shall be punished
based on the clan law.

32
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,410
Shen Qingru.

33
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,491
Wench, you still have the cheek
to show up here?

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,731
Guards.

35
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,930
Drag her to the Disciplinary Hall,
the clan law shall be executed.

36
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:56,171
Father.

37
00:02:56,661 --> 00:02:58,220
What do you mean?

38
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,530
Jun.

39
00:02:59,661 --> 00:03:01,970
You've spoiled her.

40
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,850
This is between me and Qingru.

41
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:08,850
Are you trying
to poke your nose into it again?

42
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,451
Don't you forget about our agreement.

43
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:17,980
Jun.

44
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,090
Let's drop the subject.

45
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:22,331
Come and meet your son.

46
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,451
When did I have a son?

47
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,140
He's already five.

48
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:32,930
Don't you remember him?

49
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,700
I find this boy

50
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:49,619
quite adorable.

51
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,771
Look,

52
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:52,491
he resembles you so much.

53
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:56,540
Shen Qingru.

54
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,410
This is our family affair.

55
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,451
You're in no place to comment on it.

56
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,171
(Mother.)

57
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,611
(The Yans tarnished your name)

58
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:11,051
(and drowned you.)

59
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:14,491
(I insist on exposing their true color.)

60
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,290
(I'm going to ruin their reputation)

61
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,290
(and break them apart.)

62
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,251
(Father saw to it five years ago.)

63
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,691
(To ensure the continuation
of the Yans' lineage,)

64
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,811
(Father has done a lot.)

65
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:31,451
Does he resemble me?

66
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,650
Since you want to have a good time
with your grandchild,

67
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,251
I will grant your wish.

68
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:41,571
Guards.

69
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,139
From today onward,

70
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,451
Clan Leader Yan will just rest at home.

71
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,540
And I will be in charge

72
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,331
of all clan affairs.

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,451
Jun.

74
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,059
Don't fall for her trap!

75
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,331
Shen Qingru!

76
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,131
Boy.

77
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,410
(Like I said,)

78
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:06,170
(Chunshui Town is happening.)

79
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,211
(And it's going to be so
for days to come.)

80
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,850
You're injured too.

81
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:31,050
Yet, you're tending mine.

82
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:33,451
Mine isn't as serious as yours.

83
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:37,090
Now that we're divorced,

84
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:39,211
you're more gentle and patient

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,050
than when we were married.

86
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:43,540
You have no idea, Ms. Shen.

87
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,020
I never cared about that piece of paper.

88
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:51,050
All I ever care about is you.

89
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,970
You and I will bear the same wound.

90
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,939
I returned to this cage

91
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,891
at the expense of my freedom.

92
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:22,170
I just want
to smash this cage to pieces.

93
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,610
I can't wait for that day to come.

94
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,490
It's getting late.

95
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,730
We can't share a room.

96
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,170
I'll go pack up

97
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,011
and move into the guest room.

98
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,650
I built this Rose Garden for you.

99
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,610
You're always its owner,

100
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,371
not me.

101
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,811
Besides, in Chunshui Town,

102
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,931
I make the call.

103
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:19,751
(See you at the same old place
at 10 sharp.)

104
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:35,939
(Chunshui Station)

105
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,299
Have you passed the stuff to her?

106
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,371
I've seen to it. Rest assured, sir.

107
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,131
She's got the knife.

108
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,059
So she will decide

109
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,331
what to do next.

110
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:47,939
(Wang Duren)

111
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,451
(The Jiang and Lu warlords
have been at war for years.)

112
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,811
(Who would've thought Colonel Wang
was with the Lu Family Army all along?)

113
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:58,290
(He's been after the new mine vein
in Chunshui Town)

114
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:03,139
(If Marshal Jiang finds out
that the Yan family)

115
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,371
(has been secretly colluding
with the Lu Family Army,)

116
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:07,691
(Yan Jun,)

117
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:10,490
(isn't that going to cost
all of your clan members' lives?)

118
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,340
(Colonel Wang must have known)

119
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:15,451
(about Mr. Zhang's ties
to Marshal Jiang.)

120
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:18,251
(He'll definitely get the mine
from the Yan family.)

121
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,691
(All I need to do
is drop a hint to Colonel Wang's wife.)

122
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,860
(Once the deal between them
is set to stone,)

123
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:25,771
(I'll write
to inform the Jiang family of it.)

124
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:28,850
(After that...)

125
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,571
Yan Jun.

126
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:32,811
When you made me marry you,

127
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,730
did you know about your father's crime?

128
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,691
You signed this mining rights contract
with Colonel Wang.

129
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,490
Father.

130
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:44,370
You're truly getting old.

131
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:47,411
I am getting old.

132
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,211
But I'm still breathing.

133
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,250
If you lock me up,

134
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:58,451
I will revoke the mining rights.

135
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:00,691
Revoke them?

136
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,691
Wait... Jun.

137
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:09,890
You can't do that!

138
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,820
When Colonel Wang asked to sign

139
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:13,499
this mining rights contracts with you,

140
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,370
weren't you aware of who was behind him?

141
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:19,571
It was the Lu family.

142
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:22,531
Cheng.

143
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,490
Here's a telegram from Deputy Zhang.

144
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,051
That Wang has made a move
on the Yan family's mining zone.

145
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:28,387
It's said that someone anonymously wrote

146
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:30,520
(Telegram Transcription Paper)
tipped off the Marshal's Mansion.

147
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,180
The Lu family's spies
are finally in motion

148
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,451
after being planted for years.

149
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,010
Should we get rid of them?

150
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,610
We've kept them around all these years

151
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,850
not just to get rid of them.

152
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,211
They need to bleed when we do.

153
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,051
(When a person has lived in purgatory
for too long,)

154
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,171
(even honey)

155
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:55,610
(tastes bitter.)

156
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,531
(What tastes sweet to her now)

157
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:01,411
