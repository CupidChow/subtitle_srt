00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,611
Cheng.

8
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:37,010
You...

9
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,730
(Cheng.)

10
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,691
(I'll be alone
on this path of vengeance.)

11
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,250
(I'm sorry.)

12
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:22,541
It's been a long day
at the chamber of commerce.

13
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,211
Yet, you're still in the mood
for dancing?

14
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:31,130
Did you know?

15
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,810
From the day I married you,

16
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,451
my suffering came to an end.

17
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,571
Every day has felt like a dream.

18
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:45,291
But I was afraid to lose myself in it.

19
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:52,850
It's different now.

20
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,810
I want to

21
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,771
fall for you completely.

22
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:03,211
Do you want to?

23
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:14,891
(What exactly do you want?)

24
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,291
Make sure you kiss the right person.

25
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:27,930
You don't want
to fall for the wrong man.

26
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:52,331
Let's just head to the garden fair now.

27
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:56,871
(Zhengfushun Premium Pastries)

28
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,731
Could I do a dance with you, miss?

29
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:15,491
Drink up.

30
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,891
Would you like to dance?

31
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,220
Your turn.

32
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:33,451
Drink.

33
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,610
Drink up.

34
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,490
It's Mrs. Yan.

35
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,220
Let's go.

36
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:11,179
Come.

37
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,410
Don't leave.

38
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,730
What's wrong with you?

39
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,530
That brat

40
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,610
has had this event

41
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:26,011
for three years in a row.

42
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,420
Men and women

43
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:29,179
mingle around intimately in public.

44
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,811
How ridiculous!

45
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,290
Calm down, Master Yan.

46
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,699
Young Master is trying

47
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,371
to curry favor with Grand Marshal Jiang
through this garden fair

48
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:41,100
since our family is mining soon.

49
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,619
That makes it a good thing.

50
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,490
I know it's a good thing.

51
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,660
But there are rules to follow here.

52
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:48,811
Indeed.

53
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,410
Just look at that ritual offering
by the river.

54
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,530
He's getting out of hand day by day.

55
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,580
Chunshui Town is still under my control.

56
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:57,170
Yes.

57
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,610
But you see, Master Yan.

58
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,299
No matter what,

59
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,939
he is your son.

60
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,530
You are family.

61
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,131
You shouldn't get worked up

62
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,980
over such a trivial matter.

63
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:11,131
Am I right?

64
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,100
Of course.

65
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,850
Jun is my son, after all.

66
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:17,290
As for Shen Qingru...

67
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:21,410
If she dares sow discord between us two,

68
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,931
I will have to get rid of her.

69
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:30,530
Is everything ready?

70
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:37,090
(If things go south,)

71
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:39,371
(the Mo family will take the blame.)

72
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,811
Why?

73
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,850
Are you feeling lonely

74
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,131
since my brother-in-law isn't here?

75
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,610
Shen Cheng.

76
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,490
You don't call me Cheng anymore, huh?

77
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:57,451
Will you listen to me if I call you that?

78
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:03,090
I'm no longer a boy.

79
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,131
You can't be with me

80
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:07,730
in the future.

81
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,970
You said so.

82
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,730
And you kept your word.

83
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:20,811
Upon setting up our mother's
spirit tablet, you tried to drive me away.

84
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,371
What was that?

85
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,771
I'm not needed anymore?

86
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,090
You're trying to cut ties with me?

87
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:38,451
I just want someone to keep me company.
Why are you stopping me from doing so?

88
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:41,571
Who are you to be stopping me?

89
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,290
You're drunk, Shen Cheng!

90
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,050
Here.

91
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:14,050
Here.

92
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,090
And here.

93
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:19,170
They're all wounds.

94
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:24,691
For the past three years...

95
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,371
I've returned here countless times
in my dreams.

96
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,850
But every time I woke up,

97
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,531
I was either in the wilderness

98
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:38,451
or among the dead.

99
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:53,490
You said it's been like a dream
and you were afraid to lose yourself in it.

100
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,411
I've had the same situation.

101
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:06,130
Yet, the one who makes me fall...

102
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:20,211
You're drunk.

103
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:21,931
You're just saying what you don't mean.

104
00:09:27,581 --> 00:09:28,850
