=Episode 18=

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,150
We've kept them around all these years

8
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,589
not just to get rid of them.

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,790
They need to bleed when we do.

10
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:06,669
The Lu family wants to use us
to fight the Jiang family.

11
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:08,949
The only ones who'll suffer are us.

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,870
I won't allow you

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,150
to make our family a pawn
in their power struggle.

14
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,510
Trying to take advantage of it all
will only get them killed.

15
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,589
Well, I shall grant their wish.

16
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:23,829
If it were something else,

17
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,710
we could still stay neutral
among the two warlords.

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,469
But both of them
are after the mining rights.

19
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:35,469
Do you want the entire Yan family
to go down with you?

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,678
Clan Leader! Young Master!

21
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:38,359
This is bad!

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,000
There's been
a large of refugees in town.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,240
The fellow local gentries
request to see you, Clan Leader.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,309
Father, since you're getting old,

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,230
I think I should be in charge

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,589
of our clan.

27
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:51,999
Jun!

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,150
Jun...

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,230
There's been a fresh flood in the North.

30
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,309
Yet, Chunshui Town doesn't
seem to be affected by it.

31
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,150
The roads to the North are all ruined.

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,790
And there've been famines
in many places.

33
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,350
If we don't clear the roads
for the troops soon,

34
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,160
we might end up delaying
our military campaign.

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,310
Cheng.

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,070
Are we staying here for the night?

37
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,869
- Are you going to meet your sister...
- I'm not her brother.

38
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,560
Order the townsfolk
to provide manpower and money

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,429
for disaster relief and road clearing.

40
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:35,960
Have our army conceal themselves
on the high ground outside the city

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,109
and await further orders.

42
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,078
Young Master.

43
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,279
You need not be there
for disaster relief.

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,758
- What if the mountain pass collapsed...
- I need to be there.

45
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,478
I received a call from the county.
Marshal will stay here for the night.

46
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,590
He will lead his troop
and pass by our town tomorrow.

47
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,750
As for the road repair...

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,999
You think it's all about that.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,839
I'm trying to save the Yans here.

50
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,959
You go greet the marshal.

51
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,839
I'm headed to the dam.

52
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,030
Yes.

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,709
Everyone is getting it.

54
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,389
Careful, it's hot.

55
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,910
Dear.

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,669
You were the most kind-hearted one.

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,429
If you were still around,

58
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,310
you would've done the same, no?

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,790
Welcome to Chunshui Town, Marshal.

60
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,429
Protect Cheng!

61
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,890
(Yan)

62
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:30,919
Guards.

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,270
Guards!

64
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,590
Who's that?

65
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,150
What are you doing?

66
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,189
Let go of me!

67
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,039
Jiang Wei!

68
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,109
You think you can get away with it?

69
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,230
Cover me.

70
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,350
Cheng!

71
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,669
Shen Cheng.

72
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,950
Those who ever tried to kill me
are long gone.

73
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,439
How could you be Jiang Wei?

74
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,869
Go ask Yama.

75
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,669
Marshal.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,800
The peace preservation corps
have dealt with it.

77
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,669
How are the roads?

78
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,480
They're all ruined by the flood.

79
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,069
Upon learning about the incoming war,
the refugees dared not leave.

80
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:33,999
The refugees in the North
are making their way to the South.

81
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:35,000
They're all stuck on the roads.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,040
We need food for disaster relief. And those
on the frontline are having a hard time.

83
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,549
I'm afraid we're having a tough battle

84
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,470
with the Lu family.

85
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,950
I will decide whether
or not it's a tough battle.

86
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,710
I knew it.

87
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:53,069
You returned here with a motive.

88
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,509
My mother

89
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,109
and brother

90
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,030
are dead.

91
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,030
But you're still alive.

92
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,030
You want to avenge them, huh?

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,109
In your dream!

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,629
If you think all I want
is for you to die,

95
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,749
then you're being too naive.

96
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,989
What do you want?

97
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,910
The night

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,669
is long.

99
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,239
(Yan's Residence)
I need to settle

100
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,979
the score with you.

101
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,638
(Lanshan)

102
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,790
Here.

103
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,429
Here. And here.

104
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,840
Contact the 115th Division.

105
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,818
Deploy two regiments
and split them into three groups.

106
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:14,359
- Deliver rations and supplies to the frontline.
- All these areas are near the battlefront.

107
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,518
Indeed.

108
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,790
All our supplies
have been sent for disaster relief.

109
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,278
But it's only right to send provisions

110
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,669
near the frontline despite the risk.

111
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,758
Cheng.

112
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,509
What you're moving isn't supplies.

113
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,069
It's the Lu Family Army.

114
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,520
War is the art of deception.

115
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,380
Advance when it benefits you,
retreat when it's otherwise.

116
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,070
With a full display of disaster relief,

117
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,398
we lure the Lu Family Army here
to catch them off guard

118
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,840
and strike when they least expect it.

119
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,029
It's time to put an end to the grudge
between the Jiang and Lu families.

120
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,158
Wait here. I'll go meet the marshal
after getting changed.

121
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,389
Yes, Young Master.

122
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,479
Young Master.

123
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,638
You're finally back.

124
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,509
Ms. Shen...

125
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,269
I'm going to kill you!

126
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,719

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,989
