00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,029
I can't make your dress.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,510
Take the ruler back.

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,799
What do you know? Tell me everything!

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,829
- I... I don't know anything.
- Speak! Tell me everything!

11
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,309
Have mercy on me!

12
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:11,710
Please!

13
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,029
Are you all right?

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,510
Cheng.

15
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:16,038
Are you hurt?

16
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,910
I've finally got the clue.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,270
I didn't do it.

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,510
No... I didn't do it.

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,710
It wasn't me. I'm telling the truth!

20
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,230
It wasn't me.
You've got the wrong person!

21
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,949
I bet you didn't see it coming, Cheng.
I ran all the way here for you.

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,389
Send him to the Yan family.
Let's see how they're going to deal with him.

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,870
You got rid of me
just to catch this fatty, huh?

24
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,270
Well, who are you?

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,910
Who are you?

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,638
Young Master.

27
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,959
The tailor who humiliated Mrs. Yan

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,790
is being kept in the Disciplinary Hall.

29
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,510
Is it nice?

30
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,949
No?

31
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,630
Well...

32
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,350
It's nice...

33
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:42,790
It's nice, huh?

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,190
Tell me, is it nice or not?

35
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,389
It's nice...

36
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,590
It's getting cold.

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,350
Warm his hand.

38
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,590
Yes.

39
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,669
It wasn't me!

40
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,790
It wasn't me!

41
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,869
I said I'd investigate
your mother's case.

42
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,070
Why did you not listen to me?

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,989
Have you no shame

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,869
to be showing your face in public?

45
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,989
Do you not trust me?

46
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,350
Say something.

47
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,429
I just wanted to catch him.

48
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,429
For the past three years,

49
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,758
I've visited all the tailor shops

50
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,350
in town.

51
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,038
If it weren't for Cheng,

52
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,999
I wouldn't have found out

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,470
that who I've been looking for
isn't here in town.

54
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,230
This is my only chance.

55
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,919
No matter what you think,

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,549
I will do it at all cost.

57
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,239
We've been married for three years.

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,830
Three whole years!

59
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,109
Yet, you still don't trust me.

60
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,350
Your mother was raped.

61
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,350
But so what if you're aware of that?

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,669
It's meaningless

63
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,509
if you don't know who the culprit is.

64
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,230
Is that tailor the one?

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,638
With no evidence,

66
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,309
all I could do was keep watch.

67
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,559
So I had to drop by the tailor shop
now and then

68
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,669
to get a qipao made for you.

69
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,570
(Mrs. Yan)

70
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,549
Did you get this qipao?

71
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,950
Do you like it?

72
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,629
You're injured?

73
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,230
I'm to blame for it.

74
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,150
I was just worried about you.

75
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,950
I wrongly blamed you too.

76
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,230
I'm talking about this matter.

77
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,629
Let's go.

78
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,629
I'm taking you to the Disciplinary Hall.

79
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,509
I didn't know you're Mrs. Yan.

80
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,069
Have mercy on me, Mrs. Yan!

81
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,799
Please!

82
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,470
Come clean.

83
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,069
I...

84
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,429
I lied to you.

85
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,189
I did it.

86
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,790
Explain yourself.

87
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,910
Well...

88
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,439
Well...

89
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,270
I had too much to drink on that day.

90
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,995
- And I saw a lady. It was dark
- Carry out the clan law!

91
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:06,879
- and I was delivering ironware.
- Qingru! I'm innocent!

92
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,429
- So I...
- Run!

93
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,309
I carried her

94
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,749
to that room

95
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,669
next to the Disciplinary Hall.

96
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,390
I never thought I'd drop my ruler there.

97
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,669
You killed my mother

98
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,958
and little brother.

99
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,830
I will make you pay with your life.

100
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,318
No...

101
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,230
It's all karma!

102
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,278
If the servant hadn't told me

103
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,710
about such a serious matter,

104
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,109
would you have taken it in hand?

105
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,830
My three-year agreement
with her is due.

106
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,390
So I owe her

107
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,030
an explanation about what happened then.

108
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,069
Why?

109
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,590
Are you not happy enough
with what I did?

110
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,549
During the interrogation,

111
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,950
what else did that tailor say?

112
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,869
Your mother was raped.

113
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,389
Qingru.

114
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,558
I'm innocent.

115
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,989
Do live well, okay?

116
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,359
Use this brass ruler.

117
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,359
Sure.

118
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,079
We're both from Chunshui Town.

119
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,070
You must know what happened
to the Shen family.

120
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,638
Ma'am, what are you talking about?

121
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,558
I don't get it.

122
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,879
I've never been to Chunshui Town.

123
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,590
Your mother was raped.

124
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,070
It wasn't me.

125
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,350
It wasn't me.

126
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,749
What else do you think I've heard?

127
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,590
I lied to you.

128
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,359
I did it.

129
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,909
I carried her

130
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,830
to that room

131
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,798
next to the Disciplinary Hall.

132
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,758
No.

133
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,190
