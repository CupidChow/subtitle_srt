00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,330
Cheng.

8
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,771
Let's pay respects to Mother.

9
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:00,091
Sure.

10
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:04,810
Mother!

11
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,170
Qingru.

12
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,730
Mother!

13
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,331
Qingru.

14
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:14,730
You'd have a hard time
here in Chunshui Town after this.

15
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,299
Be a strong girl,

16
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,810
okay?

17
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,051
Carry out the clan law!

18
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:25,099
Qingru!

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,860
Drowning a shameless woman

20
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:30,051
has always been a rule
here in Chunshui Town.

21
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,491
We sink her today

22
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,780
as a warning to others.

23
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:36,211
Qingru!

24
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,739
Qingru!

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,251
Mother!

26
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,771
I'm innocent!

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,860
Do live well!

28
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,331
Mother!

29
00:01:47,261 --> 00:01:49,331
I'm coming to your rescue!

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,650
(On that day,)

31
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,019
(I lost the two people dearest to me.)

32
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,500
Leave! Now!

33
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:57,891
Leave!

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,570
Leave!

35
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,131
(The enemy I've been looking for...)

36
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,291
(Actually, Mother's eyes)

37
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,171
(told me the answer.)

38
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,130
Mother!

39
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:25,850
Mother!

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,611
Brother!

41
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:30,451
Brother!

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,739
I beg of you, Clan Leader!

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,331
Get them out of the water!

44
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,891
I'll kowtow to you!

45
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,451
Please!

46
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,850
My child.

47
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:52,410
Drowning a shameless woman
is our clan law.

48
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,410
There's nothing I can do about it.

49
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,690
I hope you mind your conduct

50
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,891
and take your mother's fate
as a warning.

51
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,291
(Mother.)

52
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,090
(I can finally pay respects to you
without hiding.)

53
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,410
(It's a blood feud.)

54
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,370
(Even if it means
putting my life in danger,)

55
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:18,771
(I fear nothing.)

56
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:22,051
(I, Shen Qingru,)

57
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,611
(will use myself as bait)

58
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,410
(to lure the enemy into the trap.)

59
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:34,451
(I am not afraid
of this merciless Chunshui Town.)

60
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,370
(I just hope Shen Cheng)

61
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:39,891
(can get out of this troublesome place.)

62
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,491
(I will make the Yan family)

63
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,250
(The Late Mrs. Shen)
(pay for what they did to us.)

64
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:47,019
Yan.

65
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,660
Thank you for today's ritual offering.

66
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,370
Please carry my mother's spirit tablet.

67
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,619
You forgot this pen

68
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,530
that you used when you were young.

69
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:07,891
Don't forget it again when you leave.

70
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,371
There'll be a garden fair in town.

71
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,379
Mr. Jiang, if you're up for it,

72
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,860
you may join it before leaving.

73
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:24,610
Let's go, Father.

74
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:40,151
(Chunshui Station)

75
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:43,090
Sir.

76
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,960
The men you asked for are here.

77
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,200
And they're waiting for your order
to seize the mine in town.

78
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,580
Once our troop has seized the mine,

79
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:53,660
you can stay here
and keep your sister company.

80
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:54,730
Retreat.

81
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:56,410
Retreat?

82
00:04:58,461 --> 00:04:59,571
Yes, sir!

83
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:02,819
Cheng. You have no reason to stay here
unless you're going to seize the mine.

84
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,131
Have you thought it through?

85
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,490
Cheng.

86
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,139
Listen here.

87
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,900
Cheng will only leave after the fair.

88
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:24,420
So those spies might
recognize him before then.

89
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:26,900
Those scoundrels who are after
the Lu Family Army's rewards.

90
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,170
Rest assured, Second Young Master.

91
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:30,131
Second Young Master.

92
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,331
What's the matter with our marshal?

93
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,860
He's as lovestruck

94
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:38,211
as Grand Marshal Jiang.

95
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,251
You eat earlier these days, Mr. Jiang.

96
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,490
I'm growing, so I need to eat more.

97
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,410
Help yourself if you like it.

98
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,650
Cheng asked me to pass you a message.

99
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:59,131
Well,

100
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,931
if you want him
to join you for the fair,

101
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:02,490
you just put on that hairpin.

102
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,650
Dear.

103
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:10,730
You serve nice pastries.

104
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,811
I'm off.

105
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,619
I received a call from the county.
There's been an emergency.

106
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,771
I'll make it home tonight
as soon as possible, okay?

107
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:23,090
Hold on.

108
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:31,850
That way, I can recognize you.

109
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,050
Thank you, dear.

110
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:43,939
(How lovey-dovey they are.)

111
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,610
(Cheng is at a disadvantage.)

112
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:47,691
(I need to lend him a hand.)

113
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,331
Enough, stop looking.

114
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,290
I've told her so.

115
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,340
But your sister

116
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,970
just wants to visit the fair

117
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:50,490
with her husband,
which is your brother-in-law.

118
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:04,771
Cheng.

119
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,290
Your sister is married now.

120
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,490
She focuses on taking care
of her husband's household.

121
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:12,290
She's no longer who she was.

122
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,931
You're having
psychological imbalance, you know?

123
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:22,371
I've called the county.

124
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,970
The chamber of commerce promised
to make sure Yan Jun comes back late.

125
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,771
But, Cheng,

126
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:33,139
If you can't even dance

127
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,691
with your own sister in public,

128
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:37,970
what's the point of you doing all this?

129
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:47,250
I just want to figure one thing out.

130
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,739
Fine. If you're asking
for trouble, go ahead.

131
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,250
Anyway, if you refuse to leave

132
00:08:57,941 --> 00:08:59,090
after the garden fair,

133
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:01,770
I'll carry you away myself.

134
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,451
Okay, then.

135
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,571
I'll go look into the tailor's matter.

136
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:10,811
