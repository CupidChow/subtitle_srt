(Sink her.)

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,850
(Shameless woman.)

8
00:00:56,227 --> 00:00:57,084
(Just die!)

9
00:00:57,085 --> 00:00:57,859
(Shameless woman.)

00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,570
(Shen Qingru.)

11
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:01,850
(You swore a deadly oath.)

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,049
(You swore you and your brother
would never fall for each other.)

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,930
(But behind everyone's back,)

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,418
(you and your brother gave in
to passion in the woodshed.)

(Disciplinary Hall)

16
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:15,409
Do you admit it?

17
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,489
Even if Shen Cheng
and I did fall in love,

18
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,858
what could you do about it?

19
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:22,650
Silence!

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,010
Shameless woman!

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,409
Back then, my mother
was labeled the same.

22
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:31,730
You all sank her
to the bottom of the river.

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,530
Shameless woman?

24
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:41,370
Yan Jun.

25
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,170
There nothing but a grudge
and hatred between us.

26
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,849
How could I ever love

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,890
a worthless man like you?

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,138
Since you have a death wish...

29
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:56,650
Shen Qingru committed adultery
with her own brother.

30
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,810
We sink her today

31
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,609
as a warning to others.

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,658
(Disciplinary Hall)

33
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:13,569
Carry out the clan law.

00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,090
Qingru!

35
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,530
I was too late.

36
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,490
Cheng...

37
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,770
No matter how hard I fought,

38
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:49,930
they still called me shameless.

39
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,658
(They were in love all along!)

40
00:02:58,659 --> 00:02:59,538
(Exactly!)

41
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:01,009
(Do they know no shame?)

=Episode 1=

43
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,050
(Mother.)

44
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:27,370
(I will uncover the truth.)

45
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,729
(I will prove your innocence.)

46
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,490
(The day my mother was drowned,)

47
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,289
(my younger brother died
trying to save her.)

48
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,250
(Later, I found Shen Cheng.)

49
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,810
(He became my brother.)

50
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,139
Well, well. Look at you.

51
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,729
Have you been tailing me?

52
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,370
(Even if he cannot speak,)

53
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:51,009
(I will protect him for life.)

54
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,409
You know how to pick a lock?

55
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,818
(This is the place. This is where it
all happened to my mother.)

56
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,569
(The truth was never uncovered,)

57
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,610
(and the clan leader drowned her.)

58
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:15,760
Later, I snuck back here

59
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,699
(Shen Qingru, blacksmith's daughter)
and found this bronze ruler.

60
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,600
(Shen Cheng)
This might be

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,200
(Blacksmith's adopted son)
the only clue to clear my mother's name.

62
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,689
The one who owns this ruler...

63
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:31,418
Come on.

64
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:32,810
Step a little closer.

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,850
Why is the door
to the Disciplinary Hall open?

66
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,019
Even better.

67
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,290
Let's do it right here.

68
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,418
Sweetheart,

69
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:42,930
I've missed you so much
these past few days.

70
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,610
What's the rush?

71
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,819
Be gentle.

72
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,569
Relax? No one's here.

73
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,089
Wait. Did you hear that?

74
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,769
Is someone coming?

75
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:57,889
Someone's there.

76
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,680
That just makes it more thrilling.

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,379
Back then,
the Shen family's daughter-in-law

78
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,290
was caught committing
adultery in this room.

79
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:07,009
Maybe her ghost has
come back to haunt the place.

80
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,050
There's really something there!

81
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,970
Quick! Let's get out of here!
Someone's coming!

82
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,850
Bring them over.

83
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,250
Yes, Clan Leader.

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,579
(Clan Leader of Chunshui Town, Yan Du)

85
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,449
Well, well, Shen Qingru.

86
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,160
You were promised to Mr. Mo,

87
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,320
(Butler of the Mo family)
but you're out here with another man.

88
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,098
If the Young Master hadn't fallen ill,

89
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,819
and if the old madam hadn't
sent me out to pay respects,

90
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,218
you would've gotten away with it.

91
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:45,379
Stop making things up!
I came to learn the truth about my mother.

92
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,009
Who's going to buy that?

93
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,899
Everyone passing by heard you two.

94
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,689
If it wasn't you, then who?

95
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:52,218
Shen Cheng.

96
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,930
You may be adopted,

97
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,939
but your name's still
in our family records.

98
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,978
Getting involved with your sister?
That crosses every line there is.

99
00:05:58,979 --> 00:05:59,858
Clan Leader!

100
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,139
You have to stand up
for our Young Master!

101
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,459
Tie them up!

102
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,218
Parade them through the streets!

103
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:06,579
Carry out clan law!

104
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,050
Why are you tying us up?

105
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,819
You drowned my mother back then

106
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,649
over the same lies.

107
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:15,050
She was innocent.

108
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:18,649
Every one of you is guilty.

109
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,658
Insolent and shameless!

110
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,490
How dare you accuse the Clan Leader?

111
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,098
Shen Cheng.

112
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,290
You dumb mute.
Are you getting rebellious too?

113
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,538
Guards!

114
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:34,930
Make him kneel!

115
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,810
Still acting tough, huh?

116
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,170
Beat him till he kneels.

117
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,209
No, stop! You can't hit him!

118
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:54,610
Keep going!

119
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:56,139
Clan Leader!

120
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,889
Please, that's enough!

121
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,059
Shen Cheng doesn't know the rules.

122
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,850
I can overlook his mistakes.

123
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,379
But this relationship between you two...

124
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,858
There is no relationship!

125
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,569
How do you expect me to believe that?

126
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:14,899
Keep going.

127
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,649
Beat him until he can't get back up!

128
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,610
I, Shen Qingru, swear to the heavens,

129
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,250
that there was nothing improper
between me and Shen Cheng.

130
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,738
We will never fall for each other.

131
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,218
If I break this vow,

132
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:31,129
I'll accept the clan's punishment!

133
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,658
Let me sink to the bottom of the river.

134
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,730
Let the world spit on my name.

135
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,778
There were so many people around.

136
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:49,490
Why did you fight back?

137
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,738
If I hadn't stopped them,

138
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:57,490
they would've beaten you to death.

139
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:03,769
Why...

140
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,050
Why...

141
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,209
Why did you swear that?

142
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,930
Would you rather
get your legs broken instead?

143
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,970
Don't move.

144
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:26,290
Does it hurt?

145
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:31,979
I've been asking you that
since we were kids.

146
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,610
You always just shake your head.

147
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:43,970
(Qingru...)

148
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,889
(Sorry you had to suffer like that.)

149
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,929
(You've always protected me.)

150
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,210
(I've never done anything for you.)

151
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,330
You little brat!

152
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:54,818
Your father's drinking again.

153
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:57,450
It's not even dark yet
and you're already gone.

154
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:00,450
So this is where you snuck off to nap!

155
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:05,009
Get over here!

156
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,379
Figures.

157
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,619
Standing up for your sister again?

158
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,600
(Shen the Blacksmith)
You're always causing me trouble.

159
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,529
I oughta grab a stick
and teach you a lesson!

160
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,219
You little rascal.

161
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,250
Can't you just behave?

162
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:26,658
Your sister is about
to marry into the Mo family.

163
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:28,178
If you get into trouble again,

164
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:30,210
I'll break your legs myself.

165
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:32,529
That's enough.

166
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,129
Go to sleep.

167
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:38,889
Don't forget to bring the horseshoes
to the Mo family tomorrow morning.

168
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,490
Cheng, come with me to the Mo family.

169
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,058
That's the dowry the Mo family sent.

170
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:18,418
I heard Mr. Mo is on the verge of death.

171
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,490
They want me to marry her
to bring good luck.

172
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,698
I was planning to call it off.

173
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:28,009
What are you getting mad for?

174
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:31,690
(She came to call off the wedding.)

175
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,938
(Who do you think you are?)

176
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,850
(You dare reject
the Mo family's engagement?)

177
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,809
(This is outrageous!)

178
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,889
(You show up
and drag away my brother?)

179
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,250
(I was never worthy
of the Mo family anyway.)

180
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:49,739
(On your wedding day, you're still thinking
about your mute brother?)

181
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,289
(What a disgrace.)

182
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,259
(Read this Book
of Virtuous Women out loud.)

183
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,099
(Now that you've stepped
into the Mo family,)
