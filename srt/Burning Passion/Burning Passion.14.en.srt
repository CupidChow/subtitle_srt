7
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,470
(After the tailor was dealt with,)

8
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,269
(you started pulling away from me.)

9
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:16,190
(What exactly have you
been hiding from me?)

10
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,869
You ungrateful son.

11
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,078
You're out of line!

12
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,149
You dare bring up Butler Yan?

13
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,190
Clever move, Father.

14
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,669
While I was gone,

15
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,109
while things were in chaos,

16
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,389
you pinned everything
on the Mo family.

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,590
You waited for Qingru to die

18
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,709
and for me to track
the crime to the Mo family

19
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,879
so I could wipe them out completely.

20
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,510
Then, you'd swallow up
everything they owned.

21
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,510
Isn't that right, Father?

22
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,798
Jun.

23
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,790
I have no right to mention him?

24
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,109
You think I shouldn't mention him.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,350
Jun!

26
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,669
You played a part
in that old butler's death too.

27
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,149
Fine.

28
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,790
Jun.

29
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:08,109
Jun!

30
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,510
Are you still going
to threaten Qingru after this?

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,389
Father?

32
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,829
My son.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,109
I won't get on your bad side again.

34
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,429
You should get ready for the train.

35
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,230
Are you afraid?

36
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,549
That I'll change my mind and stay?

37
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,710
(Truth is, I'm more afraid
of changing my own mind.)

38
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,429
(Why isn't anything happening yet?)

39
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,629
(Did I not use enough poison?)

40
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,230
You were always like this as a kid.

41
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,109
You never used a comb.

42
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,429
You ran your hands through my hair.

43
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,309
When you go quiet,

44
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,189
you look even more
like the boy I knew.

45
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,749
You used to be
so well-behaved back then.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,309
You know,

47
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,470
after you came back...

48
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:35,270
I've been so upset.

49
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,989
I might not

50
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,950
have the time to annoy you anymore.

51
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,549
What do you mean?

52
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,030
Are you going off to war?

53
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,549
I'm going on a trip.

54
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,910
A business trip.

55
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,989
I can't come back too often.

56
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,590
The wound on your back...

57
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,350
You should go now.

58
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,429
What happened?

59
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,999
I...

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,239
I slipped while taking a bath.

61
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,590
It's nothing serious.

62
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,109
Go, now.

63
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,189
Are you taking it off,
or should I do it?

64
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,150
Just go already.

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,239
Shen Cheng, let go of me.

66
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,718
Don't move.

67
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:57,749
Shen Cheng.

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,189
Shen Cheng!

69
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,270
Did Yan Jun do this to you?

70
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,790
I've been back this long.

71
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,509
Why didn't you tell me?

72
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,950
Why?

73
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,710
I'll go shoot him right now.

74
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,230
Cheng!

75
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,509
Cheng!

76
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,509
Cheng!

77
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,390
You don't look worried.

78
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,270
You drugged the wine.

79
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,119
I was desperate. It was the only way

80
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,590
to get my brother out of here.

81
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,189
I used to think you weren't reliable.

82
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,629
As it turns out, we owe it all
to you this time.

83
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,230
Take him.

84
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,629
I can handle the things here.

85
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,199
All right.

86
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,389
Off we go.

87
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,590
The butler is dead.

88
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,350
You must feel awful.

89
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,710
You really are starting
to understand me.

90
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,190
I know you well enough.

91
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,789
For example,

92
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,550
I don't know if the butler
acted on your orders

93
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,029
when he tried to kill my brother.

94
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,430
If I had given the order,

95
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,869
would you stab me the same way

96
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,950
you stabbed him?

97
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,629
Would you pierce my throat
with the scissors?

98
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,310
Yes.

99
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,550
Hurting Shen Cheng would be
the last straw.

100
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,950
But, my patience has its limit too.

101
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,450
(Yan)

102
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,250
(Yan)

103
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,650
(Yan)

104
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,590
You saw that blood painting
in the Disciplinary Hall.

105
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,690
(Yan)

106
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,470
The Lu family came for the Jiang family.
One of the two sons has to live.

107
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,918
Get my brother out of here.

108
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,310
I'll deal with the rest.

109
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,610
(Yan)

110
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,149
Why?

111
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,670
If I didn't let you see
what the Yan family has done,

112
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,070
what reason would you have

113
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,029
to stay with me?

114
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,590
Let go.

115
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:58,670
No.

116
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,629
I won't let you go.

117
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,909
Shen Qingru.

118
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,590
Not unless

119
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,830
I'm dead.

120
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,749
I'm not leaving.

121
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,149
I'll stay right here in the Yan family.

122
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,230
I'll personally

123
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,909
drag you all down to hell.

124
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,430
That's exactly what I wanted.

125
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,269
In this fleeting world,

126
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,749
hate lasts longer than love.

127
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,710
