=Episode 5=

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,850
I see. You like to dance
this way, huh, dear?

8
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,810
Mind your conduct.

9
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,849
My brother-in-law.

10
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,849
With what identity

11
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,090
are you telling me what to do?

12
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,969
If you mistreat her,

13
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,730
I'm taking her away now.

14
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,849
Have I mistreated you
for the past three years?

15
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,050
What do you want?

16
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,618
Shen Cheng!

17
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:19,689
Shen Cheng!

18
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:21,090
Yan Jun.

19
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,680
They are the Yan family.
And we're in Chunshui Town,

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,530
where clan rules are above all.

21
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,330
He's the clan leader's son.

22
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,849
Since you hit him,

23
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,699
the Yan family won't it slide.

24
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,129
He started it.

25
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,889
They could just come at me.

26
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,610
Stop it.

27
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,650
I'm the reason why all this happened.

28
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,699
I will accept the punishment.

29
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,810
You should leave now.

30
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,569
Where are you taking me?

31
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,889
We're going
where there are no clan rules.

32
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:54,899
Let go!

33
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,969
You!

34
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,409
Let go!

35
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:10,459
Open the door.

36
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,810
Let me out!

37
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:16,979
You're soaking wet.

38
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,490
Get changed first.
You wouldn't want to catch a cold.

39
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,899
What are you waiting for?
Do you need my help?

40
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,979
What have you picked up
out there all these years?

41
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,610
You're being disrespectful.

42
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:39,739
Get changed now

43
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,218
or my hands will misbehave.

44
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:42,530
Shen Cheng.

45
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,849
I'll do it.

46
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,289
Get down the car.

47
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:57,449
You gave me a slap.

48
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:01,810
Bye.

49
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,338
He's right here.

50
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:05,169
Stop right there!

51
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:11,330
You think I'm a pushover just because
I've been holding back, huh?

52
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:21,939
My county magistrate,

53
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,499
just rest assured.

54
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,050
I will definite settle it.

55
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,009
You have my word.

56
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:28,619
Sure.

57
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,009
Goodbye.

58
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,089
I told you not to mess with Shen Cheng.

59
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,850
What do we do now?

60
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:39,649
I've checked the name list
of the key county officials.

61
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,738
Shen Cheng isn't in the list.

62
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,290
He's not
one of the key county officials.

63
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,970
But he's no longer a mute blacksmith.

64
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,689
He's now a changed man.

65
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,569
You can do whatever you want
to the town folks.

66
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,899
And I won't ask about it.

67
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,209
But Shen Cheng?

68
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,139
He's backed by some big man.

69
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,850
A big man, huh?

70
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:01,810
When will you let me go?

71
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:11,689
That depends on my mood.

72
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,209
Give me your hand.

73
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,619
I shouldn't have named you Shen Cheng.

74
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,970
You've always been boastful.

75
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:44,240
There are calluses
between your thumb and index finger.

76
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,810
You always fire a gun, don't you?

77
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,129
Cheng.

78
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:02,129
For the past three years...

79
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:06,250
You've been through
a lot of life-and-death moments, right?

80
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,730
It's nothing.

81
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,889
It's true.

82
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,009
Take off your shirt and let me see it.

83
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,169
Remove it.

84
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,929
Aren't you going to see it?

85
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,809
I am.

86
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,809
How did you get all these wounds?

87
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,850
Those were gunshots

88
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,250
and knife cuts.

89
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,289
Did it hurt?

90
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,490
Not at all.

91
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:47,490
You're as vain as ever.

92
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,769
This was from me.

93
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,330
Cheng!

94
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:05,250
Did it hurt?

95
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:08,970
Qingru.

96
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:10,970
Come with me.

97
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,490
