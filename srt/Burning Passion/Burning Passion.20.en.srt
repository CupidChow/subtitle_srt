=Episode 20=

7
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,649
That's the full situation.

8
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,890
Ms. Shen really doesn't look well.

9
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,138
Why?

10
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:09,258
Cheng's already handed her the gun.

11
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:10,480
She should be doing just fine.

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,730
If Cheng hadn't meant to leave him
for her to deal with,

13
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:15,720
he wouldn't have gone to such lengths
to bring down the Yan family.

14
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,560
- What's the situation at the front line?
- Proceeding according to plan.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,338
What about the roads?

16
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:21,650
At least another two or three days
to clear them.

17
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:24,218
Have them hurry.

18
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,209
Yes, sir.

19
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,290
The Yan family can't afford
to keep servants for you,

20
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,090
nor your illegitimate son.

21
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,530
He...

22
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,769
He's your brother...

23
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,290
My brother?

24
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,819
My mother's been dead for 12 years.

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,010
How could I have
a five-year-old brother?

26
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,530
12 years.

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,049
She should have reincarnated by now.

28
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,170
Maybe that's for the best.

29
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,769
She won't have to meet you again
in her next life.

30
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,530
I will bear

31
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,449
your sins and karma.

32
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,409
Jun...

33
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,650
Estranged from your son.

34
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,610
Fortune lost.

35
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,530
Your own flesh and blood scattered.

36
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:17,169
No one left to bury you when you die.

37
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,729
Misery doesn't taste good, does it?

38
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,409
You defiled my mother

39
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,250
and drowned her.

40
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:33,129
The day my brother died,

41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,930
so did my innocence.

42
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,370
You brought this all

43
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:47,050
upon yourself.

44
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,181
(Yan)

45
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,790
(Yan)

46
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:26,649
Cheng.

47
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,730
You've had that map
spread out all afternoon.

48
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,689
But your eyes haven't been on it once.

49
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,579
Sir. The former clan leader is dead.

50
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,390
Ms. Shen has returned
to the Shen's Residence.

51
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,290
So she really was after revenge?

52
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,889
Second Young Master,

53
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,569
after what's happened to the Yan family,

54
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,930
is that even a question?

55
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:51,810
Women can be vicious.

56
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,610
Deputy Zhang,
clear the roads immediately,

57
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,649
so my brother can escape...

58
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,290
I mean, head to the front line.

59
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:06,819
Someone kept saying

60
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,730
this has nothing to do with Shen Qingru,

61
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,329
but now he's glaring at me.

62
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,769
What's that supposed to mean?

63
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,050
Haven't you been hurt enough?

64
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,529
Second Young Master.

65
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,050
Please say less.

66
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,900
Just wait for the military order.
Let's see if you leave or not.

67
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,970
Marshal! Emergency order!

68
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,529
Sir.

69
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,970
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:47,250
Cheng, I was just joking.

71
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:48,649
Didn't mean to jinx it.

72
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:51,050
Did something change at the front line?

73
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,410
Grand Marshal Jiang and Jiangbei

74
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:57,889
have reached an agreement

75
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,329
to resist

76
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,899
foreign invaders together.

77
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,960
That's great news!

78
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,490
I've been waiting for them
to unite against foreign enemies!

79
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,059
Withdraw the troops.

80
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,209
Yes, sir.

81
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:23,529
Father,

82
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,009
you go first.

83
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,569
I'll follow soon.

84
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,778
Old Master is kind man.

85
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:49,499
Yes, he is.

86
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,259
Have some more.

87
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,209
Thank you.

88
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,089
Cheng...

89
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,850
Even if your brother came back,

90
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:35,169
he'd only be five years old.

91
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,889
You're back.

92
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,570
I've avenged us,

93
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,850
Cheng.

94
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,610
You never actually left me.

95
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,800
You gave me the evidence

96
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,680
of the Yan family's collusion
with the Lu family, didn't you?

97
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,370
Answer me.

98
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,610
Only if you take your medicine first.

99
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,889
Your clothes are wet.

100
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,450
