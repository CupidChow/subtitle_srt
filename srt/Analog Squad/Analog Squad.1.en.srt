[music on CD player slipping]

4
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,666
[woman] Why not try cassettes?
They don't skip.

5
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:00,375
CDs sound better,
and I can pick the songs.

6
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,000
But if they're scratched
and the player can't read them,

7
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,250
you'll have to throw them out.

8
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,375
No. No! Don't die yet. [sighs]

9
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,458
- Isn't that game for kids?
- [chuckles]

10
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,083
It's not feeling well. Aw!

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,125
- You find it fun to raise fake creatures?
- [game beeping]

12
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,250
It's fun <i>because </i>it's all fake.

13
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,166
No hard feelings.
I can start over when it dies.

14
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,875
How many have died so far?

15
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,416
[laughing] Five!

16
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,000
But this one's survived
for over four months now.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,750
[man laughs] You planning
on raising it till you're old?

18
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,750
[woman] Well, I'm single.
What do you want me to do?

19
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,375
Other people raise cats and dogs.

20
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,583
[man] So? Why's it sick?

21
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,583
- [woman] I forgot to collect its poop.
- [man] What?

22
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,625
[woman laughs]

23
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,708
[upbeat music continues playing softly]

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,875
- [woman sighs]
- Where are we now?

25
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:13,833
Dad?

26
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,791
We should practice, man,
so I can get used to it.

27
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,208
Hey, don't call me "man."
I'm your client, kid.

28
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,291
[kid chuckles]

29
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,291
We're almost at Takua Pa.

30
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,208
We should be there in an hour.

31
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,666
I told you to just act the part.
No need to ask what he thinks.

32
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,666
I was just practicing.
I'll play it for real when we get there.

33
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,708
You're…

34
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,375
- Bung.
- I know.

35
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,958
What are you named for? Uh…

36
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,375
You're a bad Bung? Tough Bung? A <i>Bungkee</i>?

37
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,291
I don't know.

38
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,541
My dad named me. Why don't you ask him?

39
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,500
I don't know, but

40
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,958
I think it means "bug."

41
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:01,916
You make me itch.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,041
Hmm. You're hilarious.

43
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,875
And you're Keg. What keg?

44
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,375
Beer keg? Keg party? Or keg stand?

45
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,416
I don't know.

46
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,166
I also got it from my dad,

47
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,833
but he's dead, so you can't go ask him.

48
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,416
[scoffs]

49
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,083
Whoa! Phang Nga is really gorgeous.
I've never been here.

50
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,708
Hey. Take this.

51
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,791
- Here.
- You have a nice body.

52
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,458
Hey. Control yourself.

53
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,625
[both laugh]

54
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,541
I'm your mother.

55
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,583
These breasts fed you
when you were a baby, so behave.

56
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,875
- You got it, Mom.
- [chuckles]

57
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,625
- I wish my mom was funny as you are.
- [chuckles]

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
By the way, girl…

59
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:22,625
Do you know why Pond hasn't been home
for the past 20 years?

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,333
Did they have a big fight?
And where'd his wife and kids go?

61
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,666
Why'd he have to hire <i>us?</i>

62
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,166
How should I know?

63
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,500
Hey.

64
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,625
I thought you said you were his ex.

65
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,125
[laughs]

66
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,416
Girlfriend, yeah.

67
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,208
Not his wife.

68
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:50,416
Ah! So why'd you take this job, then?
Are you getting back together with him?

69
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,708
Get real!

70
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,125
[woman] Hmm.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,833
[Keg rinsing mouth]

72
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:05,333
So, uh… do we do any activities together
as father and son?

73
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,291
Like playing video games?

74
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,875
We're seeing my parents
for a couple of days.

75
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,458
I doubt they'll ask that.

76
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,541
I slept at a friend's house once,
and he drank with his dad.

77
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,958
I had a great time!

78
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,500
I don't play games, but I can drink.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,083
So how close are you, anyway,
with your dad?

80
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,625
What's Grandpa like? Is he really strict?

81
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,791
[footsteps approaching]

82
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,500
[grunts]

83
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,916
[grunts]

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,958
[Keg] Okay.

85
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:44,958
Whoa!

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,041
What do you think?

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,458
- Nice.
- [woman chuckles]

88
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,708
Am I girlie enough, Pond?

89
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,000
Sir.

90
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,625
[woman and Keg laugh]

91
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,833
- Sir?
- [Pond] Hmm.

92
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,708
- Well, you look more like her now.
- [Keg laughs]

93
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,166
Mag is a sweet person.

94
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,333
She's not really… ill-mannered.

95
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,250
[Bung] Come on.

96
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,166
You said she only met her grandparents
once when she was little.

97
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,416
People can change, you know, Pond.

98
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,833
Don't you want a daughter
who's pretty, sweet, and chic,

99
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,166
like Julia in <i>Notting Hill, </i>or

100
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,375
a cool lady
like Faye Wong in <i>Chungking Express</i>?

101
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,416
Who are they? I don't know them.

102
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,458
But from what I see,
you look like… a country girl.

103
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,250
[all laugh]

104
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,500
- Girl.
- Oh, come on.

105
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,625
All right. Let's do a quick review now.

106
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,291
We're a family who hasn't seen
the grandparents for 20 years.

107
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,708
You make a living by importing goods
from Hong Kong to sell here.

108
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,625
[Pond] Hmm.

109
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,500
[woman] Your dad opened up a photo studio,

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,958
and your mom worked as a secretary
for a foreigner who worked at a mine.

111
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,833
My name is Mam.

112
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,666
I'm a housewife.
I've never met your parents before.

113
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,875
- [Pond] Correct.
- Okay.

114
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,833
My name's Mag.
I graduated from ABAC. I work at Thai Air.

115
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,208
- [Keg] Hmm!
- [Mam] Yes.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh!

117
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,291
Well, my name is Mon.
Mag's little brother.

118
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,750
My dad is Pond, and…

119
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,541
Mm… [sighs]

120
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,708
- Mom is Mam.
- [Mam] Mm-hmm.

121
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,500
I don't have great eyesight,
and I'm a sixth-year med student.

122
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,416
[Pond] Yes.

123
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,583
- And your grandpa's name is?
- Grandpa Kew!

124
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,208
- [Mam] Mm-hmm!
- Grandma Sodsri!

125
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,125
No!

126
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,958
- [Bung and Pond] Sodsai!
- [Mam laughing]

127
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,583
So are there any other details
that we should know about?

128
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,666
Why is it we never visited them?

129
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,000
That's it. You can improvise the rest.

130
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,166
Really?

131
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,583
If we say whatever we want,
then it might not be consistent.

132
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,583
Hmm. True.

133
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,916
It's easy to make stuff up
when you're alone,

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,791
but we've gotta know who said what,
or we'll be screwed. Got it?

135
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,166
- Okay.
- [Keg] Hmm.

136
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,041
Then just don't talk much. If you can't
talk about something, change the subject.

137
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,791
I'm not worried about the two of us.

138
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,208
But this guy…

139
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,083
Okay. From now on, no real names.

140
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,250
- It'll be only Mag, Mon, and Mam.
- Mag.

141
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,041
- [Mam] There are no retakes here, okay?
- You got it, girl.

142
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,958
[all] Mom!

143
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,041
[steady rock music playing]

144
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,791
Pond!

145
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,125
[Pond] Hi, Mom.

146
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,250
You finally came.

147
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,250
Is this Mam, Mag, and Mon?

148
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,833
- [Pond] Yes.
- [Mam] Hello.

149
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,416
The doctor's
going to remove the ventilator,

150
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,750
but I wanted to wait for you.

151
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,333
Your dad told me he didn't
want to prolong the inevitable.

152
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,416
[somber music playing]

153
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,416
[Sodsai] Honey.

154
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,625
Pond brought your grandchildren here.

155
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,083
Mag, Mon,

156
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,375
come say goodbye to your grandpa.

157
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,375
Go on.

158
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,208
Uh, hello, Kew.

159
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,416
It's me, Mam.

160
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,375
I'm sorry that we took so long
to come visit you.

161
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,000
Wait, Mag!

162
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,125
Uh. I'll…

163
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,291
I'll go check on the kids, shall I?

164
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,500
[Sodsai] Pond.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,208
Please forgive your dad.

166
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,291
Bung! Wait!

167
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:35,916
Where are you going?

168
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,541
I can't do it after seeing their faces.

169
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,458
They believe we're their grandkids.

170
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,708
But that's our job, isn't it?

171
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,250
To make them believe that.

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,541
You said it yourself, Bung.

173
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,000
That woman believes that her grandchildren
have come for a visit.

174
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,458
Are we just gonna
run out on her like this?

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,541
I understand

00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:25,458
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I never came to visit you.

343
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,708
[forced laughter]

344
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,166
How's that?

345
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,541
[Mam] Um…

346
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,750
What's your name?

347
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,500
- I'm Keg.
- [Mam] Keg.

348
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,416
- Okay.
- Yes.

349
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,083
[Mam] Who do you love the most?

350
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,041
- Uh… my mom.
- [Mam] You love your mom.

351
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,833
- Let's try this, then.
- [Keg] Okay.

352
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,291
I want you to imagine this, Keg.

353
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:47,041
You are going to visit your mom
who is dying.

354
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,166
What the fuck?

355
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,458
[laughs]

356
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,250
- You shouldn't joke about stuff like that.
- [Mam laughs]

357
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,416
- [buzzing]
- It's okay. It's hard. [chuckles]

358
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,708
Look. It's not for real.
This is just acting.

359
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,000
YOUR DAD'S IN THE ICU

360
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:05,125
[Mam] If you were going to visit her,
how would you be feeling in that moment?

361
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,041
FROM MOM

362
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,291
[Mam] Seeing her lying there.

363
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,791
- Now, just take your time with it.
- Can you leave tonight?

364
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,916
For 100,000? I was ready yesterday.

365
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,500
- Okay. You're hired.
- Huh?

366
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,791
And for the daughter,
you know anybody who can do it?

367
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,333
It's gotta be someone
who can leave tonight.

368
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,333
Find one.

369
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,500
NANA RAMA

370
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,750
Bung, have you watched every video here?

371
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,791
Pretty much.
And I've rewatched some of my favorites.

372
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,833
Can you guess

373
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,416
who this is?

374
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:03,916
[playful piano music]

375
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,958
[sultry music playing]

376
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,625
Sharon Stone. <i>Basic Instinct</i>.

377
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,000
[laughs]

378
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,208
How about…

379
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,250
[slow jazz music playing]

380
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,583
…this one?

381
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,916
Kate Winslet in <i>Titanic</i>.

382
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:49,000
[engine revving]

383
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,333
Who was that?

384
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,083
That's Andy Lau in <i>A Moment of Romance</i>.

385
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,750
[Pond sighs] Not her.

386
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,416
Hey. Wait a sec.

387
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,166
Check her out.

388
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,833
Hey, girl! Where've you been hiding?
Your late fees are piling up.

389
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,541
[Mam] Mm. [tuts]

390
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:19,083
Let's just deal with that later.
I've got a proposition for you.

391
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,041
Wanna hear about it?

392
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:29,125
- Mm… That mean you're going?
- Yeah, I should.

393
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,250
I miss you already.

394
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:44,083
Got an acting job for you.
Good role, easy money.

395
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,625
You get to travel
down south for free. Interested?

396
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:49,750
Acting job? I can't go.
I gotta look after my store.

397
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,500
[sighs] That's a real drag.

398
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:55,041
It's a 100,000 for three days. Come on.

399
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,916
Hey, girl! Hold on.

400
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,291
A little work and travel could be fun.

401
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,666
Who's gonna watch your store?

402
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,791
My mother can do it. It's pretty slow now.

403
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,083
[laughs] Good.

404
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,666
This is Pond, your client.

405
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,333
And this

406
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,000
is…

407
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,291
- I'm Keg.
- He'll be your little brother.

408
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,583
Hello, Mr. Client.

409
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:23,458
What's up, bro?

410
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,583
- Have you ever acted before?
- Hold on.

411
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,500
Found it.

412
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,166
When I was in kindergarten,
I was on stage.

413
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,708
- [Keg] Hmm.
- Also…

414
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:47,291
When I was in high school,
I was in the drama club.

415
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,291
And in university, I was a commando
who defused bombs.

416
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,791
[imitating gunfire]

417
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:00,541
I've acted my whole life,
so I can take on any role.

418
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,416
Why don't you act like a Red Devil fan
the day you beat Liverpool?

419
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,791
What would you say to Owen
if he asked you out?

420
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:06,875
No way!

421
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,375
That's like converting
to another religion.

422
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,375
So where exactly are we going?

423
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:14,375
- Phang Nga.
- I play?

424
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,833
A granddaughter
who's visiting her very sick grandpa.

425
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,291
- Name?
- Mag.

426
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:20,583
- What does he have?
- Don't know, but he's really sick.

427
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:24,458
Oh. Well, how long's he been sick?
Is it a chronic illness?

428
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,750
Has he ever been sick like this before?

429
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,416
Did you just find out,
or have you known for a while?

430
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,125
Do we need to know all that?

431
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,041
[Pond] Yes.

432
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,500
- What's your name again?
- Keg.

433
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:37,791
Your character!

434
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,041
Oh! Mon.

435
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:40,791
Mon, come here.

436
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,625
- What?
- [Bung] Come here.

437
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,458
How close are we, do you think?

438
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:51,416
What are you saying? I just met you.

439
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,333
Well, we grew up together,
and every day we fight over something.

440
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:57,333
You also used all my school books.

441
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:01,041
Whenever you have a problem with girls,
you always ask me for advice.

442
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:04,166
And when you snore,
I don't kick you out of the room.

443
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,916
So are we close now?

444
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:10,833
Sure.

445
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:12,708
A little closer. [chuckles]

446
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,833
You need to put emotions into acting, bro.

447
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:19,625
You need the characters' backgrounds
to see how they're related.

448
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:22,208
And what you might say
when you say goodbye to them.

449
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:26,083
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh! All right.
Let's try a little improv here.

450
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:29,541
Bung, you're visiting your grandpa
who you haven't seen in 20 years

451
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,041
because your dad took off with you
when you were little.

452
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,291
What will you say to Grandpa
when you see him?

453
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,541
Okay. Pond, you play Grandpa.

454
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:41,083
I haven't seen Grandpa for 20 years?

455
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,750
Why has Dad never taken me to see Grandpa?

456
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,291
What kind of person is that? He sucks.

457
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,583
Pond, come here.

458
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:51,125
Yes.

459
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,916
Mm-hmm.

460
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,333
Action.

461
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,791
Grandpa.

462
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,166
How are you feeling?

463
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,166
I'm sorry I never came to visit you.

464
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:19,125
Get better soon, okay? Mon said he'll take
you on a road trip once you feel better.

465
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,250
Right, Mon?

466
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,833
Yes. [laughs]

467
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:28,291
You've gotta be strong
so you'll get better soon.

468
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,375
When you're well, we'll be together again.

469
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,708
I'll take care of you.

470
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,333
Yeah. She's good. Let's get in the car.

471
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,666
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

472
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,958
Wait a sec. Are we leaving now?

473
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:46,208
Why is there only just the four of us?
Where are the cameramen and the crew?

474
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,458
[Mam] Well, uh…

475
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:54,416
Pond's father is not well,
and we're all going to visit him.

476
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:56,916
You mean

477
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,875
we're going to go see his real dad?
This guy's not an actor?

478
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:07,375
Whoa! This isn't acting at all.
This is what you call fraud.

479
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
- Hey.
- [Mam] It's not fraud.

480
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,708
Pond just happens to be my ex,

481
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:16,375
and his wife ran away
with his real children.

482
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:18,875
He just… He doesn't want
his parents to know that.

483
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:22,250
I feel really bad for him,
but it's still a lie.

484
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,625
We lie to make other people happy.

485
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,666
Just think of it
as us making his parents happy.

486
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,208
My dad's been transferred to the ICU.

487
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:34,208
If you wanna come,
we're going now. You in?

488
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:36,916
[playful music]

489
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,833
Look. This is a real job. Okay?

490
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,291
50,000, up front.

491
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,000
It'll take three days,
and then we go our separate ways.

492
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,083
[upbeat rock music playing]

493
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,416
You want me to go tonight? It's 200,000.

494
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,750
Okay. [snaps fingers] Get in the car.

495
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,208
[chuckling]

496
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,708
[Bung] Mom, I'm going south
for three days. I'll be back soon.

497
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:16,375
- [Keg] So same deal for me?
- [Pond] No, we already had a deal.

498
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,291
[Keg] Oh!

499
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:30,125
If… you don't feel comfortable,
tell me. I'll take care of you.

500
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,208
Take care of me? We're close now?

501
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,083
Of course. I'm Mon,

502
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,416
your little brother.

503
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,708
[Bung scoffs]

504
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:37,625
Hmm!

505
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,916
- [Keg] Pull over by the sign.
- [Pond] Which sign?

506
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,208
- [Keg] This yellow sign.
- [Pond] I can drop you at home.

507
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:06,000
[Keg] It's okay.
I won't be long. It's a short walk.

508
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,375
- Pull over here.
- [Pond] Here?

509
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:08,791
- [Keg] Yes.
- [Pond] Here you go.

510
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,250
- Keg.
- [Keg] Yeah?

511
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,416

[woman] <i>Wow. I haven't done</i>
<i>a photo shoot for over a decade.</i>

515
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,125
Thanks for thinking of me.

516
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,833
Pupae, you were the top model of that era.

517
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:03,583
- Everybody wanted to have you.
- Mm-hmm.

518
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:05,625

[camera shutter clicking]

520
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,250
Oh, hey, guys! This round is on me!

[all cheering]

522
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,500
Wahay! [laughs]

523
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,583
Whoo! [laughs]

524
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:25,166
[Pupae] Cheers!

525
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,416
She is amazing. [chuckles]

526
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,916
- So charming.
- Mm.

527
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:35,958
You know, this is one of the best places
to visit on Khao San Road. [chuckles]

528
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,291
The nude star hostel.

529
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:41,333
Good atmosphere and cheap.

530
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:43,541
[man laughs]

531
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:48,041
- Have a good time, dude.
- [laughs]

532
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:49,791
Asshole.

533
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,875
- [man 2] Woo-hoo!
- [photographer] Okay!

534
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Great!

535
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,750
[people whistling and whooping]

536
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,500
[photographer] This'll be a great shot.

537
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:04,583
All right. One, two, three!

538
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,750
[sultry music playing]

539
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:09,208
[woman] <i>Wow!</i>

540
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,416
<i>Such a classic photo.</i>

541
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:12,750
[Pupae] <i>Oh, that?</i>

542
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:15,458
Someone wanted to buy it,
but I wouldn't sell it.

543
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:18,916
That's the photo
that lets people know who Pupae Parach is.

544
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,708
[woman] <i>What did you do</i>
<i>before you ran this place?</i>

545
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,041
[Pupae] <i>I was just selling stuff</i>

546
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,666
before I came here, you know.

547
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,166
I sold clothes.

548
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,916
Then I opened this hostel, mm,
three years ago.

549
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,625
The baht went down
after that financial crisis,

550
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:36,208
so there've been
a lot of foreign tourists.

551
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,666
[men laughing]

552
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,500
It's enough to make a living.

553
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,833
Now, back when you were posing nude a lot,

554
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:45,958
how did people treat you?
How did they look at you?

555
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,125
Hmm…

556
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,666
They couldn't differentiate
between a nude model and a hooker.

557
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,541
<i>Men would leer at me.</i>

558
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,750
<i>They acted as if I was a walking sex toy.</i>

559
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,208
<i>Someone once asked me</i>

560
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:02,166
how much it cost to <i>have </i>me.

561
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,625
When people treated me like that,
it would make me feel cheap.

562
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:08,583
And I'd wonder why
I was putting myself through it.

563
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,041
[sighs softly]

564
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:15,250
But then I had a child,

565
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,000
and my views on life totally changed.

566
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,416
My child looks at me
as a woman <i>and </i>a mother.

567
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,416

Where are you going?
Come here. I wanna introduce you.

576
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,833
This is my son.

577
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,458
- Hi.
- [man] Hi there.

578
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:21,125
- Let's get a picture.
- Okay.

- [man] Let's take a couple.
- [woman] Sure. Take them.

580
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,583
[man] Okay. One, two, three.

581
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,416
Oh, wait. Uh, okay. Let's do another one.

582
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,125
- Okay, okay.
- [man] Yeah, come on. One, two, three.

- Ah. Okay!
- [Pupae giggling]

584
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,416
- [woman] Just one more?
- One more shot?

585
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,083
- [man] Look straight at the camera.
- Okay.

586
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:41,500
[man] Right? Just this way.
Okay. All right.

587
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,666
One, two, three.

588
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,333
- Oh, not again!
- [woman] Okay.

589
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,541
- [man] Okay. All right. Look at me.
- One more shot?

590
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,416
- [man] Yeah. One more.
- [woman] One more shot.

591
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,041
I'll put on a hat so I'll look handsome.

592
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,375
- You're already handsome.
- [man] You look handsome.

593
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:56,958
Look straight ahead, all right?
One, two, three.

594

- [man] Yes.

- Uh, Ma?
- [Pupae] Yes?

I'm going to a friend's place
for three days.

- [Pupae] Three whole days?
- Mm-hmm.

[Pupae] Be careful.

599
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:09,166
- I need to go. They're waiting. Bye-bye.
- [Pupae] Okay. See you soon. Mm!

600
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,250
- [Keg] Goodbye! Nice to meet you.
- [man] Goodbye.

601
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,416
- Don't get too drunk.
- Okay. I'll try.

602
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,583
[woman] All right. Where were we?

603
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:18,875
Mind if I ask him for a couple more shots?

604
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,916
Oh, sure! Get a lot of shots.

605
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,708
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you so much.

606

I didn't get a shot of your face.
Let me try again.

610
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,541
I can't let you do that.

Dad!

619

Wake up and talk to me.

we'll let the patient go
when he's ready in his own time.

624
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,291
As for how long that will take,

625
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,208
that'll depend on how strong he is.

626
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,583
I'm so sorry.

Twenty-four years

645

Yeah, I do drink,

Pond told me that you were
quite something when you were young.

664
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,000
You drank every day at the mine.

665
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:25,083
Well, my subordinates were all men.
I had to drink with them to control them.

666

I would always sleep on the sofa

668
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,083
And he didn't say anything?

669
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:37,750
No, not a word. And he chose
to stay with an alcoholic wife.

670
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:41,416
I threw up all over the sofa one night.

671

The fabric was ruined.
We had to throw it out.

672

He didn't say anything.

673
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:49,375
But then when we got a new sofa.

674
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,666
He'd put a plastic sheet on it
every night.

[Mam laughs softly]

676
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:05,083

He didn't mind it when we dated,

00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:18,333
so why would he
after we got married, you know?

681

Is Pond the same way?

We finally got to meet Mam.

00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:34,458
[gentle acoustic music playing]

685
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:36,500
Yeah.

686
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:40,708
Mag and Mon have really changed a lot.

687
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:43,125
They don't look the same at all.

688
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:46,291
Does Pond ever plan to move back home?

689
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:49,625
Pond can be so stubborn, you know.

690
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:52,708
I never thought

691
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:56,708
that he'd take this many years
to finally forgive his dad.

692
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:58,333
[Sodsai sighs]

693
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,666
Who would've thought

694
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:07,375
that the Apollo spacecraft would keep
our family apart for almost 30 years?

695
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,125
Apollo?

696
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:15,625
[intriguing music playing]

697
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,958
<i>No single space project in this period</i>

00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:25,708

<i>Liftoff. We have a liftoff.</i>

Nine, seven, five, three, one, zero.

709
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,291
I'm on a three-day business trip
with my family, Ruk.

710
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:23,250
Can you fill out
the leave request for me? Thanks, Keg.

711
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:27,125
Yes, you got the spelling right.
Okay. Goodbye.

712
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:34,125
Seven, zero, zero, zero, zero, seven.

<i>You brighten up my sky</i>

715
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:47,125
I'll be back in three days.
I'll text you when I get back. Love ya.

716
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:55,333
"You brighten my sky."

717
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:59,125
- Mind your business.
- What?

718
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:01,625
You just told
the call center guy that. Don't be shy.

719
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:04,041
Well, that's a call center guy.

720
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,125
I'm a call center guy.

721
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:09,625
I'm a call center agent at Pagelink.

722

[clears throat]

723
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:14,875
Hello. This is Pagelink.
How may I help you?

724
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,666
Seriously?

725
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,541
- That's cool.
- Mm-hmm.

726
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,708
So you see messages
people send to each other?

727
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:28,416
- I bet you know a lot of secrets, huh?
- [chuckles]

728
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:32,333
Oh yeah. And I got access to all of them.

729
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:34,125
Mm! Hey…

730
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:37,625
Can you check
if Yuyee's getting other texts? Can you?

731
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:41,500
Mind your business.

732
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:54,083
What's your degree in?
Why'd you end up working at a call center?

733
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:55,458
I got a business degree,

734
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,833
but it was hard to find jobs,
so I took whatever I could.

735
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:02,166
I'm trying to save up some money
so I can go to the United Sta--

736
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,208
[man] Seriously?

737
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,583
- [man 2] No!
- [man 1] Get in the zone! Come on!

738
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:09,583
- We got a red card for way less than that.
- Yeah. No, no. That is a red card!

739
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:10,541
Totally!

740
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:11,583
What the fuck?

741
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,583
[TV announcer] <i>…without a red card.</i>

744
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,541
So what did you wanna do
when you saved enough money?

745
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:24,875
[TV announcer] <i>…a wonderful ball in!</i>
<i>Across the…</i>

746
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:27,083
Well, I wanna work
in a restaurant in the States.

747
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:30,250
[Bung] You wanna go there
to chop vegetables and clean toilets?

748
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,041
I don't get why people wanna go.

749
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:35,083
We don't get
to do what we want here, do we?

750
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:38,083
Money's more important.
Exchange is 40 baht per dollar now.

751
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:41,333
But the cost of living
is higher, isn't it?

752
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:42,250
[Keg] Mm-hmm.

753
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:44,166
How do you know
your life will be better there?

754
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,625
- No!
- I don't know what it'll be like.

- [cheering on TV]
- Owen! [laughing]

759
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,791
[laughing] Yeah! Yeah! [whoops]

760
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,666
- Yeah!
- [cheering]

761
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:08,875
Hey,

762
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:10,833
are you also a red?

763
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:14,916
- Mm-hmm.
- [laughs]

764
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Yes!

[continues laughing]

766
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:39,083
[Mam] I once thought

767
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:42,166
that when my time came,

768
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,375
I'd probably die alone.

769
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:48,750
No one would be holding my hand like that.

770
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:57,125
You're so lucky
to have such a nice family, Pond.

771
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,666
I'm not any different from you.

772
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,166
But I don't really have anyone.

773
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:14,083
You chose to be alone.

774
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,916
[Mam sighs softly]

775
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:21,000
When I decided to hire you guys,

776
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,041
I still felt alone.

777
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:01,083
[Sodsai] Nurse! Nurse!

778
00:53:01,166 --> 00:53:03,458
Where are the nurses?
I need a doctor here!

779
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:04,750
Can someone get the doctor?

780
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:09,166
What is it, Mom?

781
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,083
[Sodsai] Your father's awake!

782
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:13,000
[nurse] Open your eyes for me.

783
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:15,083
[dramatic music playing]

784
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:17,208
[nurse] Look straight ahead.

785
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:24,291
[Keg] The doctor's here!

786
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:45,750
[doctor] Miracles do happen.
This case is one in a million.

787
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:49,041
His lungs are still infected,

788
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:53,375
so I'll have to do
a thorough examination once again.

789
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:56,875
[Sodsai] Honey.

790
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:00,458
Pond brought his wife and children
to visit you.

791
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:05,541
Hello.

792
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:08,791
Hi.

793
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,750
Oh, Pond. So happy you came back to us.

794
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:20,083
[laughs softly]

795
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:24,083
If I weren't dying, I wouldn't
have gotten to see you, would I?

796
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:33,500
He's gonna be fine. Right, Doctor?

797
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:37,000
[doctor] He's much better now,
but he still needs close attention.

798
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,625
He's better now,
so I'm going back to Bangkok.
