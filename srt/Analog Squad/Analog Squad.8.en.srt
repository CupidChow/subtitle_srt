This was just a warning.

'Cause you owe us money,
and you need to pay it back.

I came back for my mother's funeral.
Moron.

45
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,708
You are a flight risk.

46

How was I supposed to know?

47
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,583
If you'd told me, I would've
driven you to the funeral myself.

48
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,583
Why the hell did you run?

49
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,541
Fuck you.

[Kew] Hey.

51

How much does he owe you?

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,500
[boss] Well, the principal and interest
total about six million baht.

53
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,875
This is all I've got right now.

54
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,750
But. I'll give you the rest in full
within a month.

If you see anything of value that you want
in my studio, take it.

56
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:36,625
And… if I can't find the money, I'll work
for you to pay off the entire debt.

57
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:40,166
Dad, stay out of this.
It's my debt and I'll pay it.

58
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,208

63
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,958
You should've told us, Dad.

64
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,750
I still have the money you gave me.
I'll give it back.

65

- [boss] Aww.
- [slow handclap]

66
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,375
Am I supposed to be moved by all this?

Look, whatever! As long as you get it.

[music fades]

69
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,125
You have to pay back what you owe.

70
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,708
A loan comes with interest.

71
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,041
It's still six million
for the next two weeks.

72
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:14,083
But after that, 20% interest. Compounded.

73
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,833
Got that?

74
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,458
That's not a loan. That's robbery!

75
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,750
You weren't this arrogant
when you begged us for money.

And I'm really sorry…

91

is that man there.

I'm sorry, Dad.

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,166
I…

00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,958

I'm so sorry…

102
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,208
for thinking…

103
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,333
that you never did anything for me.

104

00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,375
your father looked high and low for you.

109
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,416
He went to everybody for help,

110

hoping to find evidence
to support your case.

111
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,833
You almost lost him once.

112
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,875
Learn from your mistakes.

113
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,250
Don't go your separate ways
without saying goodbye again.

114
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,250
Grandma told me everything that happened.

115

If she was still here,

116
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,708
that's what she would say to you both.

117
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:24,083
I always believed you.
You know that, right?

118
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,666

to take the blue pill.

It's time I did some self-reflection,

don't tell me the truth.

189
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,250

I've got a game I think
would be fun for us to play.

Everyone needs to put
their pager on the table.

We close our eyes and switch the
pagers around, and you randomly pick one.

- Wanna play?
- [Lilly scoffs]

209
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,291
It's just a trick to read our
private messages. Count me out!

210
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,750
Yeah. I don't wanna play.

- [chair squeaks]
- [Pond] That's sweet.

233
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,666
Your dad paged you a birthday greeting.

234
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,708
Mmm. That's because he was
never there for any of them.

- Well, then…

get to see him for many years.

But didn't you once say
I could be your father?

00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,958
Yeah, but that was different.

449
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,083
My dad never hurt my mom's feelings,

450
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:24,375
and he didn't pretend to be someone else.

451

better, and to get close to you.

But not this way, man.

I don't even know
if I can trust you ever again.

if I had told you I was your dad?

I once thought that…

it'd be nice to have Ruk as a dad.

481
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,000
He understood me.

I don't like it at all.

You don't hate him.

488

You're just angry, sad, and
disappointed because of what he did.

I don't know.

Wasn't easy for me and my dad.

494
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:44,041
But when Grandpa Kew forgave us,
it felt nice, didn't it?

495
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,666
I asked Grandpa Kew why.

496
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,833
Why he wasn't angry.

497

You know what he said?

He focuses on the good times we had.

499
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:09,625

anger is literally nothing.

538
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,208
I thought we weren't
going to lie to each other.

539
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:10,083
Is that why you're going to America?

540
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,750
[breathing shakily]

541
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:24,333
Mom, I know you love what you do.

542
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,333
And I love you.

543
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:30,958
And that's why I'm going.

544
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:37,208
[both sniffle]

545
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:39,375
You know what, honey?

546
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,208
Before I had you,

547
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,666
everyone told me

548
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:51,625
that nude models shouldn't have children.

549
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,625
But I chose to have you.

550
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,208
[Keg sniffles]

551
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:01,291
And do you know…

552
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,916
how lucky I've felt to have you?

553
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:12,291
To have such a warm, understanding son?

554
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,291
You never once made me feel
that my profession embarrassed you.

555
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,916
But it's made me realize…

556
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:30,958
[sobs] …how hard
it must have been for you…

557
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,625
Mm-hmm? To put up with all of it.

558
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:37,916
[Keg] Mmm.

559
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,750
I'm so sorry.

560
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:47,958
I can't change the past.

561
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:54,041
But I promise you that,

562
00:47:55,416 --> 00:48:00,250
from now on, I'll never do
anything that'll make you uncomfortable.

563
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:04,625
Mom, do it.

564
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,041
I know how happy it makes you. [sniffles]

565
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,333
I'll even take you to the shoot.

566
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:16,208
And this time, I'll brag to everyone,

567
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:19,166
how beautiful you are…

568
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:21,791
[chuckles] …despite your age.

569
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,500
[laughs]

570
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,083
Thank you so much, honey.

571
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,166
[sighs]

572
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,708
You're so wonderful.

573
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,875
Thank you so much.

574
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,125
All right.

575
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:46,208
[sighs]

576
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:50,041
I want nothing but the best for you.

577
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:55,208
Go. Follow your dreams, honey.

578
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,458
Finally, you'll be living your own life.

579
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:03,291
Hmm?

580
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:08,375
Oh!

581
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,791

582
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,708

[music becomes hopeful]

585
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:10,916
[Bung] Come on! Hurry up!

586
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:13,291
I'm coming!

587
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,000
Taxi's leaving. You all set?

588
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:16,833
You bet.

589
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,041
Are you ready?

590
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,583
Don't be scared.
Your family's all here to support you.

591
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,541

593
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:45,958
[sobs]

594
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:49,291
Aww, look. She's tearing up!

595
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:51,125
[all laughing]

596
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:07,166
[exhales]

597
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:14,166
[yells] I'm not scared of you!

598
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,416
Whoo!

599
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:36,041
I'm fine. You're so sweet.

600
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:37,958
You look so beautiful.

601
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:45,125
Debt's been settled. I owe you nothing.

602
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:54,791
It's all good. The studio
needed to be renovated anyway.

603
00:51:57,291 --> 00:51:59,583
- Hang on, Dad. I'll help you.
- Okay.

604
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,291
- Want me to put the sign up?
- Yeah.

605
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:03,916
- Okay.
- Great.

606
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,916
I'll find the money to pay you back, Dad.

607
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:10,208
Dad. Hmm.

608
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:12,666
