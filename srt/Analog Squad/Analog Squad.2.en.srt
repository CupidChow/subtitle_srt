Why are you wearing pants to the wedding?
I put a nice dress in your room.

just go and talk to him?

265
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,708
It probably wouldn't come
with a warranty, Grandma.

266
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:27,000
And the voltage is different.
I say… buy it here.

But he's a lot better now.

291
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:34,208
Oh, that's good. Here, I brought him
some fish maw. It's good for him.

292
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,291
I'm going to pay you for it this time.

293
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,291
Nah. Kew's done so much for me
over the years. It's my pleasure.

294
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,250
Uh, by the way, which building is he in?
What's the room number?

295
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:49,333
I'm planning to go to the hospital
myself soon. I could go and visit him.

296
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,333
- Why are you going to the hospital?
- [coughs]

Mon hasn't graduated yet.
He's still a med student.

309
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,500
I think it would be better
if he went to the hospital.

310
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:35,416
Hmm? I'm sure Dr. Mon can
treat a simple sore throat.

311
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,750
Why bother going to the hospital?

312
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,333

Come on, Dr. Mon.

314
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,541
Please. Do this for me.

315
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,166
- You can do it. I know you can.
- Grandma…

- Yeah.

319

Is your eye okay now, Mag?

342
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,583
Ah… uh…

343
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,708
Yeah… it's better now, Grandma.

344
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,958
[Sodsai] You are still as clumsy as ever.

345
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,583
You tripped and fell at the beach
last time you were here.

346
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,291
I remember you getting
all those stitches on your knee.

347
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,500
I even teased you about it.

348
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,166
I said you'd never be in a beauty pageant.

349
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,458
Do you still have a scar there?

[tense music playing]

351
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,416
She's fine, Mom.

352
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,750
Let's eat. Come on.

353

[coughing]

354
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,416
I guess I'll just go the hospital, then.

355
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay.

356
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,125
Bye.

[comical music plays]

358
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,083
[Pond] I'll set the table.

359
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,083
[Keg] Mmm.

360
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,791
[Sodsai] He just put the dishes
on the table.

361
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,791
- He only eats extremely hot food.
- I see.

362
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,666
- Here.
- Thanks.

[dog barking outside]

364
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,250
- Give me some rice.
- [microwave beeps]

365
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,916
Can I have some more?

[microwave beeps]

367
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,833
Peel the shrimps. I can't see.

[microwave door slams]

369
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,583
[Sodsai] How bad is your eyesight?

370
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,875
What if you forget
to bring your glasses to the OR?

371
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,416
[chair leg squeaks]

372
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,916
Oh, Mon usually carries a spare pair.

373
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,666
Mag doesn't usually break my glasses.

374
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,500
[Sodsai] Hmm!

375
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,416
- Hmm.
- [Lilly] Hmm.

376
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,916
[Sodsai] Hmph!

377
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,875
When you come down south,
you have to try southern pork stew.

378
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:50,833
And you've gotta try this fish <i>tom yum.</i>
I put a lot of effort into it.

379
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,125
Go on. Try some.

380
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,750
I won't eat it, then.

381
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,666
Why won't you try it?

382
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,916
Because what happens if I love it?

383
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,250
I can't find it in Bangkok.
I'll have to come here to eat it.

384
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,416
[all chuckle]

385
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:10,250
You could always stay here.
Then I could cook for you every day.

[Sodsai] I hope you're not planning
on rushing home.

389
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,083
I'm sure Grandpa has a lot
to talk to you about.

390
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,500
We can't stay, Mom.

391
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,833
We all have jobs to go back to.
We're leaving tomorrow morning.

392
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,416
That's a real shame.
I thought we'd have more time.

Hmm.

395
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,958
I don't have anything. I might
be able to stay a couple of days.

Why did you say that?

399
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,250
Didn't you see your mother's face?

400
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,750
Your father just woke up.

401
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,750
He'll wanna speak to his grandkids.

402
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,041
Are we staying?
Do I have to miss more work?

403
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,375
No. You don't.

404
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:33,375
[sighs] I wanna go home now.
I feel uncomfortable here.

405
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:37,000
Grandma seems to really believe
that we're her grandkids.

406
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,958
Hang in there. It'll be over soon.

407
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,125
It might be over for us, Pond.

408
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:49,208
But in your mother's eyes,
I will always be her daughter-in-law,

409
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,583
and these two kids will
always be her grandchildren.

410

[sighs] Listen!

411
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,833
We can't just quit
when we're halfway through this thing.

Keg.

413
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:10,041
Don't you ever call me "girl" again.

414
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,875
Okay? And go buy new glasses tomorrow.

415
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,250
Okay.

00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,541
- [Pond] What?
- Prop money.

417
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,208
Oh.

418
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:29,666
As for you, keep wearing long pants
and skirts that cover your knees.

419
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,208
Just in case Grandma
brings up that scar again.

420
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,041
And keep an eye on Keg.

Yes, Mom.

Listen.

424
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:45,791
From here on in, whether
Grandma and Grandpa are there or not,

425
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:50,208
you've gotta remind yourself that
you're Mon, a sixth-year med student.

426
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,625
Not Keg, the call center guy.
You got that?

- [Keg] Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

428
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,125
- It's called "method acting".
- What's that?

429
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,083
Like… you know, Jodie Foster
did for <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

430
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,500
She trained to be an FBI agent.

431

And Daniel Day-Lewis in <i>My Left Foot.</i>

432
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,708
He stayed in a wheelchair
throughout the whole time he was filming.

00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,041
We've gotta do the same.

434
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,208
From now on…

This is what they mean by method acting.

447
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:01,125
You've gotta believe
that I'm your sibling, like it or not.

448
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,625
But siblings don't do this.

449

Even if we were,
you'd be my sister, not my brother.

Wait. Mag's father doesn't sell computers.

[Sodsai] <i>You know, the family's never</i>

517
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,666
<i>Your grandpa always said</i>
<i>he wasn't up to it.</i>

518
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:43,250
<i>Pond begged Grandpa to take</i>
<i>him to an island so many times.</i>

519
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,125
<i>But Grandpa never took him.</i>

520
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:48,625
<i>When Grandpa was a boy,</i>
<i>his boat capsized and he was traumatized.</i>

521
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:52,208
- Oh…
- So is Grandpa afraid of boats or water?

522
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:53,458
Oh. It's the water.

523
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:56,750
He doesn't mind sitting on a boat
if it's docked and he's eating.

524
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,500
[all laughing]

525
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,166
[Pond] Breathe slowly, Dad.

526
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,875
Breathe real slow. We'll do it together.

527
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:04,875
- Inhale.
- [under breath] Yeah.

528

[inhales]

529
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:07,666

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I love traveling for work!

[upbeat music plays]

542
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:24,416
Everyone, gather around! Let's
get a nice family photo together.

543
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,666
Come on. Let's take one right here.

544
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:31,833
Okay, everyone.
Take one step backwards now.

545
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,000
[Lilly] Oh. I'm sorry.

546
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,625
[Kew] Okay. Uh…

547
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:39,083
Mam, could you stand on the other side?

548
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,500
That's perfect.

549
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,416
Mag and Mon, get a bit closer.

550
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:52,000
Okay. Everyone stand straight. All right.

551
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:54,833
Mmph. Honey, why do we have
to stand so straight? Hmm?

552
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:57,583
We aren't taking ID photos.
We're on holiday!

553
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:02,958
All right. Uh, is everyone ready?

554
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,708
Here we go.

555

One more. I want one more.

00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,375
- Get closer to me.
- [Kew] Get ready.

Can you take a photo for us?

563
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,041
[man] Okay. Everybody ready?

One, two, three.

- [shutter clicks]
- Got it.

566
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:37,666
Oh, just one more.
Let's get one with Pond and his parents.

567
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,291
Come on, guys!
Quick, quick, quick! Come on!

568
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:43,625
Okay. I'll take it. Give me the camera.
Come here, kids!

- [sighs] Can you stand closer together?
- Yeah. Scootch together, guys!

[Lilly] Put your arm through Dad's, Mom.

573
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:00,041
- Get closer.
- Get a bit closer.

Okay!

581
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:35,166
[Bung] So you believe it's okay to lie
if it makes other people happy?

582
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,625
Why are you knocking? It's our room.

583
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:52,291
My sixth sense.

584
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:53,500
Your what?

585
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:59,291
Wait. You see ghosts?

[suspenseful music playing]

587
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,333
[Keg] No…

588
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,875
No.

[music stops]

590
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,166
It's a gecko.

- Geckos?
- Yes.

594
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,875
- You're afraid of them?
- Aren't you?

[scoffs]

596
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:28,791
No.

[music fades]

600
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,416
Now I'm sure you were raised by penguins.

601
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,583
Played with weird creatures
when you were young.

602
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,791
What a wuss. [laughs]

603
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:01,916
I just hate geckos.

604
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:03,875
Lizards too.

605
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:07,708
Man up! I can't rely on you for anything.

[mimics] "I can't rely on you
for anything."

607
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:12,541
You're supposed to take care of me, sis.

608
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:15,291
Go. Check the bathroom.

609
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,000
Ugh. Uh…

610
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:21,791
- I'm a girl, dude.
- [scoffs]

611
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,833
Fear has no gender.

612
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,250
Check under the sink.

613
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,833
And behind the toilet, too.

614
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:31,916
They love it there.

Ah! Shit! Did you hear that?

619
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,958
- I told you there's one in here.

[screaming]

621
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:05,416
Mon!

622
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,416
- [Keg] Ah! Fuck this!
- [Bung] Mon!

623
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
What?

[Keg yelping]

625
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,416
What is he doing? [laughs]

- [laughs]
- [Keg yelps]

628
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,708
Isn't this a bit much?

629
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:23,125
Did you tell the ranger why
you wanted to borrow the tent?

630
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,250
Leave me alone.
I'm not taking any chances.

631
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,833
That gecko might have friends.

632
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,125
- [Bung] Oh no! Here they come!
- Hey!

633
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,375
[Bung] The geckos are here!

634
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,333
- They're coming to get you!
- Hey! Hey!

638
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,208
Mmm!

639
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:00,583
Here.

640
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:03,291
Take a photo of your wife.

641
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:05,666
- Give me your bag.
- [chuckles]

642
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:14,291
- Ooh!
- Hmm?

643
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,708
You didn't use to dress like that.

644
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:21,125
I used to have an overprotective
boyfriend, but I don't anymore.

645
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:25,583
Come on. One, two.

646
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,166
- [shutter clicks]
- Mmm!

647
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:30,250
One more. One, two.

648
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,583
It's just like your father said.

649
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,458
If you've always wanted to do something,
do it today.

650
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:44,083
Don't wait till it's too late.

651
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:46,541
Hmph.

652
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,541
Mmm… So, tell me.

653
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,666
Still talk to Mam?

654
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,708
She got remarried a long time ago. So, no.

655
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:01,833
What about you? Why are you still single?

656
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,666
Hmm.

657
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:11,833
Listen, at my age, if you can't
find a good man, it's better to be single.

658
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,208
Hmm!

659
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:16,416
I don't need an extra burden in my life.
I prefer being alone.

660
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:19,458
- Hmm.
- Hmm. Yeah, well…

661
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:23,500
At least no one was there to stop me
from taking this weird job.

662
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,166
Yeah.

663
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,166
Mmm…

664
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,250
Can I ask you something?

665
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:32,916
What is this whole Apollo thing?

666
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:35,333
Hmm!

667
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:39,958
Well, my mom wants to invite
Neil Armstrong over for dinner.

668
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,625
You're full of crap.

669
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:44,916
Hmph…

670
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,166
Hmm. Pond?

671
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:01,000
I think your father really wants
to talk to you.

672
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,083
Why don't you just go and see him?

673
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:09,666
Hey!

674
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,416
What's wrong with you?

675
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:16,208
Your parents look so happy. Why don't you?

676
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,958
I'm worried they might
grow attached to all of you.

677
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:21,916
What?

678
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,291
Can you try not to get
too attached to them?

679
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,541
You guys are leaving soon.

680
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,041
Look. It's not our fault.

681
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,750
You're the one who hired us
to do this crazy thing.

682
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:35,583
I didn't know it was
going to drag on this long.

683
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:39,291
I thought you were just gonna meet
them and leave and that would be it.

684
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,291
Hmm.

685
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,500
Why not let them love us
and grow attached to us?

686
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:47,208
You can't manipulate
people's feelings, you know?

687
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:49,791
Hmm?

688
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,083
Hey.

689
00:41:55,916 --> 00:42:00,041
Are you doing all this for your parents,
or are you doing it for yourself?

690
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:03,958
[Sodsai] Mam!

691
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,625
Yeah?

692
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:14,291
Just remember that the six of us are
one big happy family now.

693
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,125
Hey!

694
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:20,083
[gentle, uplifting music plays]

695
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:28,041
[both laughing]

696
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,250
[Lilly] Yeah. That'll be fun. Sure.

697
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,041
Pond!

698
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:35,833
Go get your father's breathing thingy!

699
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,875
[laughter]

700
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,583
- [Lilly] Whoo-hoo!
- [Keg] Yeah!

701
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,375
- [Bung] Okay, here!
- [Lilly] Whoa!

702
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:45,666
- Yeah!
- [Lilly] Nice one!

703
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,625
- Yeah!
- [Keg] Yeah!

704
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,083
- [Lilly] Whoo!
- [Sodsai] Whoa!

705
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:49,875
[Lilly] Hurry, back where you were!

706
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,458
- [Keg] Mag, hurry!
- [Lilly] Here I go!

707
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,750
- [Bung] Back to me!
- [Keg] Do it, Grandma!

708
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,041
[Sodsai] I've got it!

709
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,375
- Okay, now…
- [Keg] Get it!

710
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,166
- [Sodsai] Catch it!
- [Keg] Get it! Get it!

711
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:01,958
- [Sodsai] Go ahead, Mon.
- [Lilly] Stand further back.

712
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:05,000
- [Keg] Over here!
- [Lilly] Ow! There's sand in my eye!

713
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,791
[Keg] Whoo!

714
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,083
- Keep going, Dad.
- [grunts]

715
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,166
- [Lilly] Over here!
- [Keg] Whoo!

716
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,708
- [coughing]
- [Keg] Mag, hurry.

717
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:18,791
- Take a deep breath, okay?
- [Lilly] That's it.

718
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,208
The doctor wants all three balls to go up.

719
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:24,333
[Keg] Hey, hey, hey!

720
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:26,958
I'll try again.

721
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:29,166
- [Bung] Yes!
- [Keg] Treat it like a real game.

722
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,666
[Sodsai] Mag, come on.

723
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,666
- Oh, come on!
- Two more balls.

724
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,375
- Whoa. [coughing]
- [Lilly] Mon, come on.

725
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:38,041
- Throw it my way.
- [Bung] Whoa!

726
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:41,208
- [Lilly] Come on. Throw.
- I can't. I can't. I can't.

727
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:42,833
It's okay, Dad.

728
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:46,333
But you've gotta do it every day.
It's good for your lungs.

729
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,875
- Come on!
- [Lilly] Throw it! I'm ready.

730
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,583
Waaah!

731
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,333
- [Lilly] Where are you aiming? Seriously!
- [laughs]

732
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:54,916
- Whoa!
- [Bung] Yes!

733
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,041
[Lilly] Oh, come on!

734
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,416
- [Sodsai] Victory is within our reach!
- Look at your mother!

735
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,166
- [Sodsai] I'll take them down!
- [Keg] Do it!

736
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,083
She acts like a kid. But she'll
get hurt if she trips and falls. Hmm.

737
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,125
Mag and Mon are with her, Dad.
Don't worry.

738
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,750
[Lilly] Come on, son.

739
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,125
- Okay.
- [Keg] Bring it!

740
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:13,916
Yes. I'm glad we finally got
to come here together.

741
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:17,041
- [Lilly] Whoo-hoo!
- [coughs]

742
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:20,625
Look at the water out there.
You see? The color?

743
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,875
It's clearer than the water
near the mainland. Hmm?

744
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
- [Sodsai] Go!
- [Keg] Mind the water!

745
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:28,291
Aren't you scared?

746
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,916
[Bung] Yeah!

747
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,500
- That way, Mon.
- I am.

748
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:35,291
- But I'd be more scared sitting at home.
- [Bung] You suck, Mon.

749
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:38,083
[Keg] Oh-ho-ho!

750
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:39,458
Aww, come on!

751
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,333
Here.

752
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:44,083
- [Sodsai] Oh-ho-ho!
- [Lilly shrieks]

753
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:46,875
- [Bung] Okay, Mom, throw it.
- [Keg] Bring it.

754
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,375
- [Lilly] Here I go.
- [Bung] Throw it.

755
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:49,791
[Sodsai] Okay!

756
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,375
[Keg] Okay! Okay.

757
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,750
- [laughs] Let's see what you got.
- [Bung] Come on!

758
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,416
Whoo!

759
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,000
- How's the studio doing?
- [Keg] Stop it!

760
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:00,208
[Sodsai] I'm good at this!

761
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:03,791
- [Lilly] I can't catch it.
- Well… It's a bit quiet.

762
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,000
[Bung] To me, to me!

763
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:07,750
There are regular customers.

764
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:10,666
- [Keg] Mom, what are you trying to do?
- It's mostly just old faces.

765
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:15,541
These days, all the teenagers use
are these bloody digital cameras.

766
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,000
[Keg] No, no, no! Not again.

767
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:20,416
They take photos and never look at them.
Why bother taking them at all?

768
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,916
- [coughs]
- [Keg] Let's do this!

769
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,458
- But we barely look at our photo albums.
- [Keg] Oh, oh! Here!

770
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:26,708
- We keep them in a drawer.
- [chuckles]

771
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,916
[Keg] Yes!

772
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,375
You're right.

773
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:32,000
- [Bung] Come on!
- [Keg] Yeah! Okay… Whoo!

774
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,833
- By the way, how's your business going?
- [Lilly] Whoo!

775
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:36,916
- [Keg] You caught it.
- [Sodsai] You always catch it.

776
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,958
- [Keg laughs] Nice!
- It's okay.

777
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:44,500
We ship merchandise to
Hong Kong and Singapore.

778
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:51,041
Is the IMF affecting you in any way?

779
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:53,291
- [Keg] Oh, no way!
- [Sodsai] Oh, oh!

780
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,041
- [Keg] Okay, here.
- [Sodsai laughs] Over here!

781
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:57,958
- [Lilly] Whoo!
- [Bung] To me, to me!

782
00:45:58,041 --> 00:45:59,708
[Lilly] Good job. Give it here. Hurry.

783
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,000
[Bung] Oh, oh…

784
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,708
Aah! [groans]

785
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,541
- Nice.
- [Lilly] Are you getting tired?

786
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:05,541
[Sodsai laughs]

787
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:07,333
- [Bung] Grandma.
- [Sodsai laughs]

788
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:09,791
[shutter clicks]

789
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:12,625
- Have you thought about moving back home?
- [Sodsai] Mag, hurry.

790
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,125
[Keg] Oh, good hustle!

791
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:18,166
- [Sodsai] Yeah!
- [laughter]

792
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:23,875
The statute of limitations expired
a while ago. Why don't you come home?

793
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:26,291
- [Keg] Okay. A fast one. You ready?
- [Bung] Yes.

794
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,875
Let's change the subject, Dad.

795
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,041
[Keg] Oh, no way!

796
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:33,500
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

797
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,833
- [Keg] I got it, I got it, I got it!
- [Sodsai] Yay!

798
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:39,125
You got me arrested! Remember?

799
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:42,208
- 'Cause I knew you were telling the truth.
- [Keg] Hurry!

800
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:44,708
If you'd dealt with it then,
nothing woulda happened.

801
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,916
The police didn't care
about the truth, Dad!

802
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:50,916
- They cared about the evidence.
- [Keg groans]

803
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,541
Here! Catch.

804
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:56,166
- Hurry, hurry!
- [Lilly] Mon!

805
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:58,708
[low humming]

806
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,000
- [coughing]
- [Keg] Good play!

807
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:03,833
- [low humming]
- [static crackling]

<i>One giant leap for mankind.</i>

810
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:13,208
[static crackling]

811
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,416
[screaming]

812
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,750
- [Lilly] Here it comes.
- [Keg] Faster.

813
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,625
- [Bung] Aah! [groans]
- [Lilly] Oh!

814
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:22,625
- [Keg] Hey!
- Are you okay?

815
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:23,625
[Bung winces]

816
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,166
- Let me see.
- [Sodsai] Mag?

817
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:27,416
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

818
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:29,125
I'm so sorry.

819
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:30,875
It's okay. It's my fault.

820
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:37,208
Does it hurt here?

821
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:38,791
[Bung] Yeah.

822
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:42,250
All right. Come on.
Better get Mag to the cabin now.

823
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:43,833
Okay?

824
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:47,750
[grunts]

825
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:51,833
- You ready?
- Mmm.

826
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:53,916
[gentle, emotional music plays]

827
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:01,625
[Keg] 'Scuse me!

828
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:03,541
I need help!

829
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:09,916
- [woman] What happened?
- [Keg] She hurt her foot.

830
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,791
- Could you look at it?
- [woman] Sure, come in.

831
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:47,291
So, you are reliable after all.

832
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:27,416
[music fades]

833
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,250
Does anyone want the shrimp's head? Huh?

834
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:34,625
Oh.

835
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:37,625
[Pond] Pack your bags tonight.

836
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,666
We're taking the first boat back
at nine tomorrow morning.

837
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:43,916
Why are you leaving so soon?

838
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,041
Can't you stay for a few more days?

839
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,958
I have work, Mom.

840
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:51,500
Come visit us during the New Year.

841
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:54,125
Okay, Mon? Mag?

842
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:00,416
So, how's the ankle, Mag? Hmm?

843
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:03,791
Oh. [chuckles]

844
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,583
I took something.
I'm feeling much better now.

845
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:10,708
I'll, uh… take you to the doctor
tomorrow after we get off the boat.

846
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,875
She's my daughter. I'll take her.

847
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:24,750
Who took Mag to the doctor when she
was five years old and allergic to milk?

848
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:27,666
Why do you always have to be so difficult?

849
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:30,375
[coughs]

850
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,875
[pager vibrates]

851
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:06,541
[emotional music plays]

852
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:22,875
Mag?

853
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,041
I'll… I'll go get her.

854
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:38,666
Hey, sir! Hey!

855
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:44,375
Hey, sir! Please!

856
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,500
Hey!

857
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,291
[man] What's the matter?

858
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:55,125
Please, I'm begging you.
Can you take me back to shore?

859
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:58,833
The boat's not allowed to leave the dock
now. You have to wait until morning.

860
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,625
I'm begging you. It's really important.

861
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:02,583
- Bung?
- [man] I wish I could help you.

862
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:05,125
- But I can't, I'm sorry.
- What's going on, Bung?

863
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,958
My dad was in a car accident.

864
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:11,916
What?

865
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,208
[whimpers]

866
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,291
[sobbing]

867
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,541
Please!

868
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:25,083
[wails] Please!

869
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:27,333
[click]

870
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
[waves rushing]

871
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:02,916
[gentle, moody music plays]

872
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,458
[music fades]

873
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,333
[uplifting pop music plays]

874
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,791
[music fades]
