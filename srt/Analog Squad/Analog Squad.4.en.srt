for him to get better.

- [music fades]
- Apologize if you can.

105

Better still, you bow down to her.

106
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,333
The important thing is to never talk back.

107
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,875
You sure that'll work?

108
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,125
Believe me.

109
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,041
It's your fault.

110

Even if it isn't… oh, it is.

111
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,583
But in this case, it really is your fault.

112
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,500
I know, man.

113
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:09,208
But wouldn't I be lying if I apologized
to her, without really feeling sorry?

114
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,000
Keg.

115
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,333
When it comes to relationships,

116
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,625
apologizing doesn't mean
that you're lying to her.

117
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,041
It just means you're willing
to put your… ego aside for her.

00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,541
Okay.

129
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,958
First of all, apologize to her.

130
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,041
Okay.

"I'm sorry."

132
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,000
No. Say "I'm so sorry."

No. Just a little. Stop.

142
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,541
Now move to your right a little.
Yes. To the right.

143
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,583
Move your face, not your whole body.

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,708
Keep your neck still. Okay.

146
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,083
Look down a bit.

147
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,541
That's too much.

148
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,791
All right. Hold still. That's perfect.

149
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,041
Chest up. Here we go!

150
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,041
Chest up again.

- [Bung] Uh, yes.

Wow. You are good.

153
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,833
Now, hold your breath,

[inhales loudly]

Now, look. The most important thing
in photography

156
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,708
is the moment you press the shutter.

157
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,666
Okay.

158
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,708
A split-second delay
can cause a huge effect.

159
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,791
Hold still.

160
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,000
- Why don't you just keep pressing it?
- Well…

161
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,291
You could do that.
But you only have so much film.

162
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,041
That's why you gotta be sure
before you press it.

163
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,208
Hmm. You mustn't waste film.

00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,333
I came to see my grandson Mon.
He's a doctor here.

180
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,083
Oh, I see. And is Mon short for something?

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,625
Uh…

182
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,958
No, but if it helps,
his last name is Juengniran.

183
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,208
- Juengniran.
- Let's see.

184
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,750
I don't see his name on our staff list.

185
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,166

which department he's in?

[nurse 1] Try a general search, maybe.

189
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,083

190
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:30,875
His name's not here.

191
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,375
- Are you sure about that?
- [nurse 2] Yes.

192
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,750
- I can try paging him for you.
- [nurse 1] Hmm.

193
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,333
That's all right. Can I use your phone?

194
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,500

And lots of birds poop on it.

245
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,458
You should buy an urn tower
on the other side instead.

246

It's shady,
and you can hear the monks praying.

00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:45,125
Huh. Why did you start working
at the call center?

700
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:47,583
Well…

701
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,500
I wanted to try it out.

702
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:53,041
[scrubbing]

703
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:58,041
Hey. What did they ask you today?

704
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,791
They asked me why I wanted to go there.

705
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:02,458
Hmm. And what did you say?

706
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,791
"I want a new life."

707
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,250
You can't tell them that!

708
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:09,750
No one's gonna give you a visa.

709
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:13,041
They'll think you plan on working
illegally. Don't tell them that.

710
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,625
- No?
- No.

711
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:19,750
Tell them you're going there to study
and they'll grant you a long stay.

712
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:22,083
Uh, what else did they ask you?

713
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:25,583
They asked me who was sponsoring my trip.

714
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:27,250
Hmm. And?

715
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:31,291
Well, I said I was.
I have over 100,000 baht.

716
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:35,875
Wow, seriously? That's… a lotta cash.

717
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,500
Hmm.

718
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:47,791
Don't tell anyone.

719
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:51,833
I took a gig and pretended
to be part of someone's family.

720
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:56,458
Pretended to be a part of what?
What do you mean?

721
00:46:57,166 --> 00:47:00,666
Well, this guy was looking for someone
to pretend to be his son

722
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,458
so he could visit his sick father.

723
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:05,000
Short gig, but paid well.

724
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:07,625
Oh boy.

725
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:11,916
You took that ridiculous gig just
so that you could go to America?

726
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,166
[sighs]

727
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:16,958
I thought so too at first.

728
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:18,916
But think about it.

729
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
How long would it take us to save
up enough money for a trip abroad?

730
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,083
Also, it was kinda nice.

731
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,666
Gave me the chance to be part of a family,

732
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,000
with a grandpa, a grandma,

733
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:37,791
and even a father.

734
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:39,958

736
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:44,083
Keg.

737
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:48,416
Would I be the kind of father
you think you'd like?

738
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:55,458
You gonna hit on my mom?

739
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,416
No.

740
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,875
[chuckles]

741
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:02,791
Of course you would!

742
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:06,458
You're my… sugar daddy.
You're always buying me drinks.

743
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:10,125
When I'm done with this,
I'll have two beers.

744
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,458
Sure.

745
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,791
- Mmph. Mm-hmm?
- [laughs]

746
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,291
- [Ruk] Aww…
- [chuckles]

747
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:19,875
- Get off, man!
- Two beers, huh?

748
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:21,166
Finish that first.

749
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:31,750
Listen, Ruk.

750
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:38,291
While I'm away,

751
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,000
can you check on my mother?

752
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,208
Mmm.

753
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:48,083

757
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:27,625
The studio looks much livelier now.
Very festive.

758
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:30,500
- I like it. I really do.
- [chuckles]

759
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,416
[both chuckle]

760
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,875
I think I'll head off to bed now.

766
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:38,916
Is it too tight?

767
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,958
Yes, it's a little tight around the
waist.

768
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:43,916
Can I try on the other dress?

769
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,166
Of course.

770
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,875
<i>"Your son, Pond, did it out of love."</i>

771
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:04,333

00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:34,041
- I'll be done soon, Mom.
- Okay.
