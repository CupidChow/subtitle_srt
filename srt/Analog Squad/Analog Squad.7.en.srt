[knocking continues]

00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,750
[Pond] This is Grandpa Kew.
Say hello to him.

8
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,583
Hello, Grandpa Kew.

9
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,750
- What are your children's names?
- He's Mon and I'm Mag.

10
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,458
How's Mom doing?

11
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
[somber music playing]

12
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,833
[Pond] <i>I bought you some fruit, Mom.</i>

13
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,833
[Sodsai] <i>Oh, why did you come back, Pond?</i>
<i>My condition isn't that serious.</i>

14
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:13,500
[Pond] <i>I had to come, Mom. I wanted Mag</i>
<i>and Mon to meet their grandparents.</i>

15
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,083
I wanna have an apple.

16
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,791
No. They're for Grandpa and Grandma.

17
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,833
- But I want an apple!
- [Pond] Mon!

18
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,125
[Sodsai] Aw, there, there.

19
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,458
Don't cry, Mon. You can have mine.

20
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,500
[Mon] Thank you.

21
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,541
[Kew] Hmm. This wound hasn't healed yet.
It looks like you've been bitten.

22
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,083
You're covered in a rash.

23
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,291
- Look.
- [Pond] She didn't get bitten.

24
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,000
She's allergic to milk.

25
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,000
- Why do you keep drinking it?
- Grandpa gave me cookies and a glass of--

26
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,333
Don't do that.

27
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't blame others.

28
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,791
You know you're allergic.
Grandpa didn't know that.

29
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,458
Mag's fine, Dad.
Her rash'll clear up with some medicine.

30
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,916
- No, I want Dr. Kiat to look at her.
- There's no need!

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,333
- [Kew] Come on. Let's go.
- Dad! Leave her be.

32
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:20,541
Come on.

33
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,625
[Kew] <i>Poor Mag.</i>

34
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,000
[Sodsai] Pond doesn't want to go out
in case someone sees him.

35
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,208
His case is still active. You know that.

36
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,791
Just be happy he came back.

37
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,750
Having to live in hiding like this…

38
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:45,041
It's hard enough doing it alone,
but with a wife and kids?

39
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,916
He's managed until now.

40
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,291
It's only four more years.

41
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,416
Why do you always think
you know what's best?

42
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,666
He's my son, not a stranger.

43
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,666
- [knocking]
- [Kew] Dr. Kiat. Dr. Kiat?

44
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:40,583
Hmm. She's allergic to something.
She's got a rash. Hmm.

45
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:53,250
I said she was fine! Why'd you have
to make a big deal out of it?

46
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,958
What kind of care can you give, huh?

47
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,125
You're in hiding.
How can you take care of her?

48
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,458
I can do better than you did!

49
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,291
What do you mean?

50
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:07,708
[Kew] Huh?

51
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:13,708
If you had listened to me then,
your life would've turned out differently.

52
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,041
You came back home,
but you don't dare go outside.

53
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,416
Your kid is sick,
but you don't dare take her to the doctor.

54
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,666
You never gave me that option.

55
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,458
Think about your kids,
not just about yourself.

56
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,708
That's the pot calling the kettle black.

57
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,375
[Pond] Come here, kids.

58
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:09,125
Okay, everyone.
Look at the camera. Sit up straight.

59
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,708
One, two, three.

[knocking continues]

63
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,000
[man] Pond?

64
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,458
Pond, are you there?

65
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,250
[knocking continues]

66
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,500
Pond?

67
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,208
- [knocking]
- [man] Pond, are you there?

68
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,416
[Kew] Go and give them your statement.
Just make it clear.

69
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,750
- Then you won't have to hide.
- [man] Pond!

70
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,208
[Kew] Pond, you haven't been accused
of anything yet.

71
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:46,166
You can prove you're innocent.
Do it for yourself and your family.

72
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,458
[door sliding open]

73
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,375
[officer] We need you to come
and give your statement, Mr. Pond.

74
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,666
Come on, Pond. I'll go with you.

75
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,000
[Sodsai] It's okay.

76
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,750
I'll go with him.

77
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,791
[officer] All right. Let's go.

78
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:13,833
Come on, Mon.

79
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,083
And if I go to jail,

80
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,916
what'll happen to Mag and Mon?

81
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,458
[officer] Take your car and follow us.

82
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,541
[Sodsai] Pond, stop the car.

83
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,166
Just go, Pond.

84
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,666
Take good care of yourself.

85
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,958
Don't worry about anything.

[somber music playing]

93
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,500
I lied to Dad.

94
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,541
I lied to Mom.

95
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,583
Mom died without knowing the truth.

96
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,375

[sobbing]

98
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,375
I didn't even get the chance to apologize.

<i>I lied to everyone.</i>

101
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,375
Trust me.

102
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,166
I'm sure everyone will understand
why you did it.

103
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,791
What's this?

104
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,958
- [Pond] Hmm?
- [Lilly] Mm.

105
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,166
[laughs softly]

106
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,583
Told you, didn't I?

107
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,916
Your life isn't as shitty as others.

108
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,583
Some people have worse things going on.

109
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,000
What do you mean?

110
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,083
[Lilly sighs]

111
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,000
I have cancer.

112
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,041
What?

113
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,625
What stage are you at, and where is it?
Why didn't you tell me?

114
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,958
[Lilly] Hmm.

115
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,583
Why would I tell you?
There's nothing between us.

116
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,416
After this, we won't see each other.

117
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,291
It's all good.

118
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,500
How can you say
there's nothing between us?

119
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,333
And why do you still drink?

120
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,833
You can't drink from now on.
No more drinking.

121
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,833
[chuckles]

122
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,583
You cutting me off?

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,833
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

[Lilly laughs]

125
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,375
[Pond] That's not funny.

[gentle rock music playing]

128
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,750
- [Pupae] Is it locked in place?
- [Ruk] Yeah, should be.

129
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:32,833
[Pupae] Okay.

130
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,208
- [Pupae] You all right?
- [Ruk] Yeah.

131
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,250
Uh, we're closed today.

132
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,333
We're not here for photos.

133
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,875
Uh… so!

134
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,625
What's this about, officer?

135
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,916
This lady here says
that you and your friends

136
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,291
conned her grandfather
into giving you his money.

137
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,000
What? Money, sergeant?

138
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,458
Captain.

139
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,416
Oh! Uh…

140
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,458
Captain, there's been a misunderstanding.

141
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,250
Who are you?

142
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,791
I'm Mag, Kew's granddaughter.

143
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,333
How did you and your friends
get into my house?

144
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:54,083
[laughs nervously]

145
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:56,708
Are you crazy?

146
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,333
Just go ask the people in town.

147
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,625
Everyone knows I'm Grandpa Kew's grandson.

148
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:06,041
I'm Mon. My sister's Mag.
I'm Pond and Mam's son.

149
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,250
Captain, sir.
They're a gang of con artists.

150
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,500
They have pretended to be myself,

151
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,208
my little brother, and my mom.

152
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,916
Why are you doing this?
Do you want his assets?

153
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,875
What assets are those?

154
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,041
Since you're the one accusing me,

155
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,916
do you have any proof
that you're who you say you are?

156
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,291
[scoffs] How about we show you ID?

157
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,541
What? Come on.

158
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,250
[captain] Okay. Give them to me.

159
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,666
[scoffs] Hurry up, kid.
I've got other things to take care of.

160
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,750
Come on. Hand it over.

161
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,583
- What's your grandfather's last name?
- [together] Juengniran.

162
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,458
MR. RACHATA TECHAWAT

163
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,125
MS. LALITA AMORNPIYAPONG

164
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,666
[captain] Uh…

165
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,708
- That's neither of your last names!
- [together] I use my mom's name!

166
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,708
[Keg] Huh. You've got no proof then.

167
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,750
So… can I file a report against her?

168
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,458
What you're doing here

169
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,791
is committing slander.

170
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:36,416
When Grandma passed away, I was the one
who brought her back from Bangkok.

171
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,125
If you were the real Mag,
where were you then?

172
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,041
Well, I haven't seen my grandparents
for a long time now.

173
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,500
I also haven't seen my dad.

174
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,250
So, between the two of you…
I don't know who's lying and who's not.

175
00:17:56,666 --> 00:18:00,833
- We could always do a blood test.
- Why don't we just go ask Grandpa?

176
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,833
[man] You're always pissing me off!

177
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,083
[people arguing]

178
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,916
Hey, what's going on out there?

179
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,500
Hey, keep it down!

180
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,750
I can't deal with this right now.
Get out. Settle this on your own.

181
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,208
Hey! Hey! Keep your voices down!
This is a police station, guys!

182
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,291
[arguing continues]

183
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,583
I'm sorry… Mag.

184
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,625
Hey! So you admit it now.

185
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,083
- Sir! Sir!
- Hey! No! Wait, wait, wait.

186
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,500
Listen to me first.

187
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,458
Look. I'm not trying
to con Grandpa out of his money.

188
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,500
He was really sick a while back,

189
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,500
so your dad

190
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,625
hired us to…

191
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,333
um, act as you and your ma.

192
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,416
He didn't want Grandpa and Grandma to feel

193
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,458
that their family had abandoned them.

194
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,875
So why didn't Dad try to contact us?

195
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,333
I always thought that

196
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,375
the reason Dad didn't come see us

197
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,833
was because Mom stopped him.

198
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:42,041
But the fact
that he hired people to pretend to be us…

199
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:48,000
makes me realize
that he never really cared about us.

200
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
What you said about Grandpa and Grandma,

201
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,125
I honestly didn't know.

202
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,041
[melancholy music playing]

203
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,833
Your grandparents

204
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,666
are very kind.

205
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,083
They're so kind,

206
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,875
I almost felt like

207
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,458
they were my real grandparents.

208
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,500
[Mag] Mm.

209
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,375
Now I'm the one who…

210
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,291
doesn't feel like
they belong in this family.

211
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,416
Hey.

212
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,791
Why would you say that?

213
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,041
Well, it's like you said.

214
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,875
Even Grandpa didn't recognize me.

215
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,416
Can I ask you something?

216
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,208
Why now?

217
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,958
Why are you looking for your dad now?

218
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,041
I wanted to invite him to my wedding.

219
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,541
But I don't think it matters anymore.

220
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,875
He wouldn't care.

221
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,625
He might not even recognize me.

222
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,041
Anyway,

223
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,083
take care of Grandpa and Dad, Mon.

224
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,041
Hey. Hold on.

225
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,291
My name is Keg,

226
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,083
not Mon.

227
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,875
And you're Mag.

228
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:52,666
I think that Pond had
his own reasons for doing this.

229
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,250
Look.

230
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,333
Why don't you just meet him?

231
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,458
See what he has to say about it.

232
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,250
[Mag] Mm.

233
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,250
SAENG ARTHIT PHOTO STUDIO

234
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,041
[Mag] <i>But can you keep this</i>
<i>between us for now?</i>

235
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,958
<i>I wanna see if Dad'll recognize me.</i>

236
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,583
[Bung] Where've you been, Mon?
We were starving, so we ate without you.

237
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,625
[Lilly] Are you hungry?
I've saved some for you.

238
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,750
Well, I went for a walk.

239
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,333
This is Fiona. We met at the market.

240
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,583
She's visiting here alone,
so I invited her.

241
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,791
We met before.
She came here to get a photo taken.

242
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,458
Yes.

243
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,958
That's impressive, Mon.

244
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,541
You just met her at the market,
and you brought her home.

245
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,166
She's beautiful.

246
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,166
- [Bung] Huh?
- [both laugh]

247
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,541
I'm Mag, Mon's sister. You're on a trip?

248
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,416
[laughs]

249
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,958
Hello, Mag.

250
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,750
Yes. I got here two days ago.

251
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,458
- Oh, really?
- Dad!

252
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,208
This is my friend.

253
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,125
Uh, hello, sir.

254
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,375
Uh, hello.

255
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,583
I booked a boat for Grandma's
ash scattering tomorrow at 4:00,

256
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,416
but let's make sure
we leave here at 3:30, just in case.

257
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
[Bung] Okay, Dad.

258
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,958
- [Pond] Hey. Have we prepared everything?
- [Lilly] We've got everything we need.

259
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,916
- Haven't left anything out?
- Hmm, I don't think so.

260
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,250
[Pond] Hmm.

261
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:48,958
I'll check it tomorrow morning.

262
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,708
Well, um, I think I should get going.

263
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,416
[Keg] Oh, are you sure?

264
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:05,750
Mm-hmm.

265
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,541
[Keg] I'll see you out.

266
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,208
Fiona!

267
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,166
Are you okay?

268
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,750
I'm not, but I have to be.

269
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,750
I think I'll go back home tomorrow.

270
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:30,791
Hey.

271
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:33,291
Scatter Grandma's ashes with us.

272
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:44,083
I think it won't make any difference
whether I go or not.

273
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:45,708
Also,

274
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:49,166
I already paid my respects.

275
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,625
She'd be okay with it.

276
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:02,500
Take care of Grandpa and Dad, okay?

277
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,208
Hey! What's wrong?

278
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,291
- She's got a family problem.
- Oh.

279
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,041
Come on the boat with us tomorrow.

280
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,166
- The sea here's nice!
- [Bung] Mm-hmm.

281
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,666
Have you ever been here before?

282
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:27,500
Mm-hmm.

283
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,875
I came here once when I was little.

284
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,500
My dad brought me here.

285
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:37,416
You probably don't remember anything.
Hey, let me show you around like a local.

286
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,041
- It's okay, Mag.
- [Bung] Nah, it'll be fun.

287
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,083
Come on!

288
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,083
Let's go!

289
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,708
Did your dad take you around last time?

290
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:22,500
We didn't really go out much back then.

291
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,875
I wish I had a house here.

292
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,333
Hey, Mag?

293
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,708
How do you think we're similar?

294
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,125
[Bung] We're not similar at all.

295
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:40,916
[Mag chuckles]

296
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,625
I know, right?

297
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,708
[both laugh]

298
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:52,500
Um…

299
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,625
I changed my mind.

300
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:58,000
I will come with you to scatter the ashes.

301
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:01,083
Mm. That's great.

302
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,375
SRI TAKUA PA HOTEL

303
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,500
[Bung] Mm. You're pretty drunk! [chuckles]

304
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,583
- We're here.
- [Mag groans]

305
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:20,875
Are you okay?

306
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:24,000
Mm, yeah. [chuckles]

307
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,291
- [Keg] Take it easy now.
- [Mag] Okay.

308
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:28,875
RECEPTION

309
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:29,875
Thank you.

310
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,583
Fiona's cute, isn't she?

311
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:46,416
[Keg] Mm-hmm.

312
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,041
Very cute.

313
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:52,375
You like her?

314
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,416
Well…

315
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:01,000
if I didn't have my eye on someone else,
I might go for her.

316
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:08,500
If you want to, I'll help.

317
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,458
Do you really not know?

318
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,791
[Bung] I'm not into men.

319
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:31,666
I know,

320
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,500
but maybe if you tried,

321
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:39,875
you might like me.

322
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,875
[Bung] Don't waste your time.
Anyway, you're going to America.

323
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:55,625
Look.

324
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,541
Just put America aside for now.

325
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,583
What do you think?

326
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:07,208
You know, it's okay
if you don't like me now.

327
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,083
I can wait.

328
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,708
Well, you can do whatever you want.
I can't stop you.

329
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:26,875
Okay.

330
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:28,958
Deal.

331
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,208
[Ruk] This is the application form
for the language school there.

332
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,875
- [Pupae] Mm-hmm.
- I've prepped it for him.

333
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:52,875
At least if he has this,
his documents will be more credible.

334
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,666
- [Pupae] Hmm.
- And this is a bank book.

335
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,625
I already put some money in the account.

336
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:03,916
Tell Keg to submit these documents
for his visa application.

337
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,458
He should get it this time. Before,
he didn't have the right documents.

338
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:09,375
[Pupae] Hmm.

339
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,583
It's a shame
I don't have friends in America.

340
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,250
Why is that?

341
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:17,333
If he has a recommendation letter
from a family there,

342
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:19,666
his chances would be even better.

343
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,625
Oh wow. We don't know anyone?

344
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,875
[man sneezes, groans]

345
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:28,333
[sighs]

346
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,125
Okay, no problem.

347
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,541
Keg's like family to me. But…

348
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,458
can I have this picture?

349
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,333
- Yes.
- No!

350
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,833
What?

351
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:56,583
Just let him have it.
What's the worst he can do with it?

352
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:57,500
[Ruk sighs]

353
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,125
[Pupae] Mm.

354
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,500
[laughs]

355
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,375
Okay.

356
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,708
[chuckles]

357
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:13,000
Hey, Lil. You still up?

358
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,083
[Lilly] Mm.

359
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,875
I'm prepping things for tomorrow
so we won't be in a rush.

360
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:20,291
- Come on. I'll help.
- Yeah.

361
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,791
Um, hey.

362
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:32,500
Tomorrow we should find an opportunity
for Dad and his kid to talk.

363
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,166
- [Bung] Mm.
- [Keg] Mm.

364
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,666
- I agree with you.
- [Lilly] Mm.

365
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,500
I don't think they'll have a chance to
after tomorrow.

366
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,583
I did give Grandma my word.

367
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,458
[Lilly] Hmm.

368
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,041
Those two as well.

369
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:47,583
But Mag's about to leave town, isn't she?

370
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:49,625
You knew?

371
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,125
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I did.

372
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:53,916
Right away.

373
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,375
She seemed
a little too interested in Pond.

374
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:58,375
[grunts]

375
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:00,500
Huh?

376
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:02,500
What?

377
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,583
- Shit!
- Sh!

378
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,333
- Keep your voice down! People will hear!
- [tuts]

379
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,541
You let me pretend to be her.

380
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:11,166
Right in front of her like that?

381
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,541
- [Keg sighs]
- [Bung groans]

382
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,000
She asked me not to tell anyone.

383
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:16,291
She wanted to see
if Pond would remember her.

384
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,083
Oh!

385
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,875
Did Pond really
not recognize his own daughter?

386
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,166
That's so sad.

387
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:24,500
[Lilly] Mm.

388
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,666
Why is everything in this family
so complicated?

389
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,625
How about we consider this
our last mission

390
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,375
before we go our separate ways?

391
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:40,083
Talking to your own family

392
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,291
is always the hardest.

393
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,041
Classic.

394
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,291
[Keg sighs]

395
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:51,583
Classic.

396
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,583
I told Keg to bring his friend along.

397
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,875
We're not going on a vacation.

398
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,708
Well, there's still room on the boat.

399
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,708
[Lilly] It's all ready.

400
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,333
Oh, they're here.

401
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,208
[Bung] You still not gonna come with us?

402
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,708
Uh…

403
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,291
You all go, okay? I'll stay here.

404
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,916
I don't need to say goodbye
to Grandma again.

405
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,375
I'll be with her soon anyway.

406
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,000
[Pond] Let's go. We're late.

407
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,541
[Bung] Okay. Let's do it.

408
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:43,083
Mon said you're leaving
to go back home today.

409
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,666
Yes. I need to go back
and prepare for my wedding.

410
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,000
Congratulations.

411
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:57,666
Uh…

412
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:03,375
Here are some milk cookies.
It's a very famous brand.

413
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,333
Wanna try one? I bought them for you.

414
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:08,708
Hmm?

415
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:12,208
These cookies are great.

416
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,208
Thank you.

417
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,833
Would you like a milk cookie?

418
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,333
I don't like them. You go ahead.

419
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,708
[Pond] All right. Let's get going.

420
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,791
[engine turns over]

421
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:55,541
[reflective music playing]

422
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:10,416
[Keg] <i>Fiona, you're not gonna come?</i>

423
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,708
[Mag] <i>No. I think I'd better go.</i>

424
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:20,208
<i>Please say goodbye to Grandma for me.</i>

425
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,833
[music swells]

426
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,750
I know this is your favorite place.

427
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,250
I know where you are now.

428
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,041
If I miss you,

429
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:57,083
I'll come and visit you here.

430
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,916
There's nothing to worry about, Mom.

431
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:47,833
Nothing to worry about?

432
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:51,166
Do you really not know
what you've just done?

433
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,583
She's right. How can you be so cruel?

434
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,958
Mag's milk allergy isn't that bad.

435
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:18,500
It's just a rash.

436
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:21,000
It'll clear up
after she takes her medicine.

437
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,333
You knew it was her?

438
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,166
What dad wouldn't recognize
his own daughter?

439
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:44,750
It's been 20 years,

440
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,166
and I never once went to see her.

441
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:52,791
Now we meet,
and I've hired someone else to be her.

442
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:58,708
How can I let her know
that I'm her father <i>now</i>?

443
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,041
I'm cruel, just like Bung said.

444
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,875
Even though what you did was cruel,

445
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,250
you still love Mag, right?

446
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,375
Pond.

447
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,083
When someone is cruel to you,

448
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,541
it doesn't always mean
they don't love you.

449
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,458
They might have their own reasons.

450
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,708
Just like you do now.

451
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:49,166
[pager buzzing]

452
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:57,333
"Thank you for everything."

453
00:42:58,083 --> 00:43:00,458
"Please take care of my family. From Mag."

454
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,083
[Lilly] Pond.

455
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,375
Do you wanna regret this like
you regretted not telling Mom the truth?

456
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:12,083
Don't make the same mistake.

457
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:21,791
[sniffles]

458
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,500
She's at Phuket Airport.

459
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:30,666
Right.

460
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,375
Sir!

461
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:35,083
- Take us back to the pier!
- [Lilly chuckles]

462
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:36,833
[engine turns over]

463
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,750
[steady rock music playing]

464
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,000
[Keg] Gate three!

465
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,625
[PA chimes]

466
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:36,541
[over PA] <i>This is the final boarding call</i>

Pond!

- [beeping]
- [Keg] Wait!

474
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:01,541
Hey, Pond!

475
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:05,458
[man] That guy! He just ran through here!

476
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,208
- Get him!
- [man 2] Stop! Hey, stop!

477
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,916
[man 1] Hey, stop! Get him!

478
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,166
- Stop! Hey, stop!
- [Pond] No. Come on! No!

479
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,708
- [man 2] Stop it!
- [Pond] Please!

480
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:17,041
- [guard] No, you can't go in there.
- [man 1] Come on!

481
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:19,875
- [man 2] Please stop!
- [man 3] You'll have to come with us!

482
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:21,750
I need to see my daughter!

483
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:23,416

484
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:25,041
Just for a second!

[Pond grunts]

00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:40,375
- [man 2] Come on!
- [Pond] Let me go!

490

Mag.

496

Oh, Mag!

497
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:27,875
- I'm so sorry, Mag.
- [Mag sobbing]

498
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,416
I'm sorry, Mag.

499
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:39,375
I missed you.

500
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:42,958
[Mag] You <i>did </i>recognize me.

501
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:50,416
I…

502
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:11,041
[Pond] I missed you every single day.

503
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:26,208
I…

504
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:27,708
I… [sniffles]

505
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:30,125
I thought you'd forgotten about me.

506
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:35,375
I thought you had a good life…

507
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:43,208
and forgot about
the bad time you had with me.

508
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:54,250
Mag, I can't tell you how sorry I am.

509
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:04,250
Do you want me to forget about you?

510
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:09,291
No.

511
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,333
If you won't forget,

512
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,291
then I won't either.

513
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,666
[upbeat music playing]

00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:48,166
Mission completed. [laughs]

515
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:54,000
Hey… why are you crying?

516
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:58,083
- Too emotional?
- [Lilly] It's okay.

517
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:00,291
[Keg] Aw! [chuckles]
