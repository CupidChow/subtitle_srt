193
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,958
Ma!

194
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,750
Ma?

195
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,083
Ma, it's me!

196
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,583
- Hang on a sec.
- Hmm.

197
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,375
[Bung] Ma?

198
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,833
Ma.

199
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,750
What are you doing?
Why didn't you open the store?

200
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,416
Have you eaten anything yet?

201
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,458
I guess that's the new computer.

202
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,541

READY FOR Y2K

203

Your dad's got
a sense of humor. [chuckles]

204
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,541
Do you

205
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,791
think computers will explode
and airplanes will crash?

206
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,375
What if it's really bad? What if we were
in an accident and rushed to the hospital

207
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:02,208
on December 31st at 11:59 p.m.
when the clock strikes 12?

208
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,291
Will everything just shut down?

209
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,083
Sounds like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.

210
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,208
So what do you think'll happen
in the millennium?

211
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,166
[Bung] Hmm…

212
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,583
Well, Bhichit'll be governor
for a second term.

213
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,833
The baht'll probably keep going down.

214
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,541
<i>The Sixth Sense </i>will win an Oscar.

215
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,083
England will win the Euro.

216
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,125
And, uh,

217
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,958

[playful music]

220
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,791
[laughs] It's a drag!

221
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,250
They got disqualified.

222
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,583
Otherwise, they could win a triple.

223
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,500
Right?

224
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,000
Hmm.

225
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,333
[Keg] Uh…

226
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,750
You sure have a lot of movies.
How much is a membership?

227
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:05,458
Why do you ask? You live in Khao San.
Why come here to rent videos?

228
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:09,083
Well, we don't have
the selection that you do.

229
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,500
Two hundred for the membership.
Thirty for each rental.

230
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,166
Seven days per rental.
Five baht a day if you're late.

231
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Hmm.

232
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,000
Well…

233
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,833
Do you have any Chinese series?

234
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,500
You like watching them too?

235
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:32,291
Hmm. They're… really long.

236
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,125
How about <i>Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils</i>?

237
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,291
Mm-hmm.

238
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,583
Rent ten, get one free.
How many do you want?

239
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,083
I'll get one.

240
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:56,541

Oh. Hey, Bung.

244
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,166
This is from Pond.

245
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,875
Just give it back to him for me, okay?

246
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,541
I don't wanna get paid
for deceiving someone.

247
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,583
I don't want that car anymore.

248
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,750
[Keg] It's yours.

249
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,041
Do whatever you want with it.

250
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,625
- [door opens]
- Bung!

251
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,208
How's your dad doing?
Why didn't you tell me about it?

252
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,333
I was busy.

253
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,833
Let's go visit him together.

254
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,333
[Bung] Hmm.

255
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,375
Okay, baby?

256
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:59,750
- Oh, I missed you so much.
- [Bung] I missed you too.

257
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,208
This is Keg.

258
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:04,083
Oh! You went on that job with her.

259
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:06,333
Thank you for taking care of Bung.

260
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:12,500

263
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,916
[Yuyee] That's okay.
I'll recharge your batteries.

[Keg clears throat]

265
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,125

268
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,125
Thanks for sticking around today.
Don't be a stranger.

269
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:44,833

Hey, Keg, remember that magazine
that came to interview me?

[Keg] Mm-hmm.

284
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:48,208
Yai invited me
to do a swimwear photoshoot.

285
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:53,625
Listen. The top models'll be on the cover,
and all the models my age will be in it.

286
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,041
Except for me.

287
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,375
And me.

288
00:27:56,458 --> 00:28:01,458
Hold on. They invited you two,
but your husbands won't let you do it.

289

Honey, we're picking some swimsuits.

- Romantic!
- Um, no. That one's out of style.

294
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,875
- Out of style?
- Out of style?

295
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,916
Well, how about… Look at this one.
Pink makes you look young.

[woman 1] Hey, listen.

301
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,791
Since it's your big comeback, Pupae,

302
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,916
you should wear something like this.

303

- [Keg] Ooh.
- [woman 2] Wow! It would be awesome.

[groans]

353
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:10,500
[sighs] One more time. Again.

354
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,458
One, two, three, go.

355
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,958
[straining]

356
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:18,666
[sighs]

357
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:20,375
I can't do it.

358
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:28,875
What's the matter?

359
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,583
Are you okay?

360
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,125
I'm scared, Keg.

361
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,250
What are you scared of?

362
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,541
I'm scared it won't turn out well.

363
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:42,833
The more people out there,
the more comparisons there'll be.

364
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,958
I don't wanna be a failure.

365
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,458
Look at me now, Keg.

366
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,500
[sighs]

367
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,875
Mom.

368
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:54,291
I told you, didn't I,
that you have a nice body?

369
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:55,625
Hmm.

370
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,916
Having a nice body as a mom and as a model
are two different things, honey.

371
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:07,250
Mom.

372
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,416
If it stresses you out,

373
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,458
why'd you accept it?

374
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:18,125
Because it felt so good
for an old model like me

375
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,958
to be wanted again.

376
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:25,000
Today, I'm… I'm just that old model

377
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,291
who owns the "ex-nude stars' hostel"
listed in that guidebook there.

379
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,458
Keg, I…

380
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,333
I wanna prove to everyone

381
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:46,333
that I'm still good enough
to make the cover.

382
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:50,625
And that I'm not just
some random listing in a guidebook.

383
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,125
[sighs] All right.

384
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,416
Then, I'm gonna coach you, Mom,
and take you to the photo shoot.

385
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:09,458
- Mm-hmm.
- When is it?

386
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:10,916
January 15th.

387
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,541
Do we have time?

388
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,125
You'll be the prettiest one on the cover.

389
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,958
- Mm!
- You ready?

390
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:21,250
- Okay, let's do it. I'm in.
- All right! Let's stretch!

391
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,541
Okay. Just tell me what to do, all right?

392
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,166
Okay. One, two, three.

393
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,333
- Go. Exhale.
- [straining]

394
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,666
That's it. Good.

395
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:41,875
One, two. Come on, Mom!

396
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,958
- One, two, three.
- [panting]

397

[Keg] Two. One, two.

398
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,625
One, two. One, two. One. Okay!

399
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:54,000
I'VE ALMOST REACHED MY SAVINGS GOAL

- [Keg] It'll fit great right here.
- [Pupae] Right here? Okay.

403
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:09,583
- [Keg laughing] One, two, three.
- Yes.

404
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,416
Gosh! This is a real workout.

405
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,541
I CAN LEAVE AFTER 15TH JAN

406
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:17,750

Right, left. Right, left. Right, left.

COOL

410
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,291
SEE YOU

411
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,958
[man] Everything seems to be
an emergency with you.

412
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:50,125
Do you ever know when you need time off?

413
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,625
Ask for a day off ahead of time.
It gives us time to replace you.

414
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:58,375
- [Keg] I'm sorry.
- You can't just leave whenever you want.

415
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:03,041
If you don't, then next time,
instead of filling out a leave request,

416
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,750
fill out a resignation form.

417
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:06,583
Can you do that?

418
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,125
- Do you understand?
- [Keg] Yes.

419
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,208
Okay. Go.

How'd it go, Keg?

422
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,583
I got chewed out.

423
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:42,583
Boss told me to fill out
a resignation form if I take off again.

424
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,458

- [man 1] This turn's really rough.

00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,500

Hey.

00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:13,625
You got a crush on someone?

445
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:21,291
She doesn't seem to be into men,
but she's really cute.

446
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,500
Hmm? What's her name?

447

Bung.

00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:27,458
Sounds like a bug!

451
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:38,875
I just know
that she'll be a hard one to get.

[chuckles]

453
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:43,541
Well, that depends on
how hard you go after her.

454
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,208
Hey. Listen.

455
00:37:56,708 --> 00:38:00,625
When I started dating my girlfriend,
it was really fucking hard.

456
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,000
- [Keg] Yeah?
- Hmm.

457
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,791
No one in my entire family liked her,

458
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,791
so we decided to end it.

459
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,000
Twenty years later,

460
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,500
we got back together.

461
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,333
The timing worked out,
and we were both single.

462
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,041
Hmm. Mm.

463
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,041
Classic.

464
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,875
Are you still together now?

465
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:25,583
Uh, mm, yeah.

466
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:28,375
That's wild!

467
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:31,291
You've never told me that.

468
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,958
Wow! Hey!

00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,458
- Ruk?
- Hmm?

470
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm going to America.

471
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,416
What the hell?

472
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:47,708
You just got back from a trip.

473
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:49,833
And you're going away again?

474
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:53,125
Didn't you catch enough shit this morning?

475
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,208
I'm not going on a trip this time.

476
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:57,750
I'm movin' there.

477
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:01,000
What about your job?

478
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,500
Pagers are dying out, man.

479
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,333
Nothing is for sure today.

480
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:10,625
Also, the baht is
so freakin' weak right now.

481
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:14,000
Our country sucks.
I don't know when it'll get better.

482
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:16,083
So…

483
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,041
what'd your family say?

484
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:28,458
I haven't told them.

485
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,625
I'll tell them when I leave town.

486
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,666
Your mother's alone, right?

487
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,208
Well, yeah.

488
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:47,291
[sighs] But I can still
take care of her from there.

489
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,458
You should also
start looking for a new job.

490
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:54,166
They said our world would go through
three major changes.

491

[Ruk] Mm?

492
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:58,375
The first one was
when Columbus discovered America.

493
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,416
The third one was
the arrival of the Internet.

494
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:03,041
Okay. What was the second one?

495
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:08,166
- I forgot. [chuckles]
- You ass.

496
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,791
That went nowhere.

497
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,333
You know, at my age,

498
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,500
I'm not that scared of change.

499
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,166
Least, I don't think so.

[mellow rock music playing]

501
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,291
You mean, I won't be cured,
even if I get it taken out?

502
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,416
To be totally honest with you,
there's a chance that it'll come back.

503
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,666
If you have it removed and it returns,
the next step would be chemotherapy.

00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:03,083
Sorry about that.

Hey, Bung.

512
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:34,666
If you'd come any later,
I was gonna have to walk.

[Kanet] Uh…

514
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:40,416
So, Bung, how's the store doing
these days?

515
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:47,250
You know, I think your idea of turning it
into a DVD store is the right move.

516
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,625
Everyone else is doing it. We should.

517
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:06,250
Would you mind
taking me to Wat Suthi Wararam?

518

How could you do this to us?

520
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,708
Every time you left us,

521
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:36,166
I always thought
you were traveling for work.

522
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,833
I worried.

523
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,708
I waited for you.

524
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:43,916
I never complained

525
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,875
because I thought you had to work hard
to take care of me and Ma.

526
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,708
But this is what you did?

527
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:57,208
Dad, how can you sit here
and act as if nothing's happened?

528
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:01,833
But we had fun.

529
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,666
You were always happy, weren't you?

530
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:08,541
I took good care of you both, didn't I?

531
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,375
But that happiness was all pretend, Dad.

532

Bung.

533
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,291
You're an adult now.

534
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:28,750
You need to understand
that this is how life is.

535
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:32,958
No one ever gets
everything they want in this world.

537
00:45:38,666 --> 00:45:40,875
I feel like I don't know you anymore.

538
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,958
Did you ever love us?

Can you take Bie to buy some stuff?

560
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:11,875
He's still young,

561
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:13,958
and he's got no one right now.

Why are you still cooking so much food?

569
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,416
Well, I miss them.

570
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,458
This is Mon's favorite,
and this is what Mag liked to eat.

571
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,875
The veggie stir-fry is for Mam.

573
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:10,958
Before you eat,
did you take your medicine?

Oh, right. Not yet.

575
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:17,500
You have to take this one in the evening,
and half of these in the morning.

576
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:20,750
Hey. Are you sure about that?

577
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:23,291
What if you got it mixed up

578
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:25,625
and I collapse on the floor
in convulsions?

579
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:29,875
Mm. How can I get it wrong?
It's written right here on the packets.

580
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,750
You never know.
Maybe your eyesight's getting bad.

581
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,833
Hey. Why don't you page Mag
and ask her again?

582
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:40,375
Mm. [chuckles]

583
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,166
Look. Mag rewrote the instructions
in big letters.

584
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:49,083
But don't worry. I already paged her
and asked her again.

Hey! You bought them for him, didn't you?

594
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:24,375
You know what?

595
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:27,208
Dad never bought
this kind of stuff for me.

[Bie] You brought me some stuff?

600
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,375
Dad already paged me about it.

601
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,916
Just put it there.

602
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:15,083
Did you get everything?

603
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:18,541
They were out of sausages.

604
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:20,916
[Bie] It's okay.

605
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:22,916
You can get them next time.

606
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,875
But make sure
they're the crispy-skinned ones.

607
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:28,958
[Bung] I'm not your maid.

608
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,958

[Bung] Since when did Dad play golf?

612

[Bie] As long as I can remember.

613
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:38,333
Really?

[Bie sobbing quietly]

615
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:01,791
[Bung] Hey.

616
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:07,041
Don't be a crybaby.

617
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:19,125
You're gonna have to learn
to take care of yourself.

618
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:21,333
Make a list of what you want to eat.

619
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:24,125
But I won't be here all the time.

620
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,166
So write it down.

621
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,083
[Bie] Thank you.

[Bung] Ugh. I can't believe it.

624
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:54,166
I thought this only happened in movies.

625
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:59,125
Do you think your family's
hiding any secrets from you?

626
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:01,583
[Keg] What do you mean?

627
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,250
My dad plays competitive golf,

628
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,375
and I never had a clue.

629
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:11,791
In my family, he was just a salesman
who didn't play any sports.

630
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:15,416
Mine probably does,

631
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:18,125
but I don't think it's as bad as yours.

[Keg chuckles]

633
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:24,041
I told you what mine was.
What about yours?

634
00:59:24,541 --> 00:59:27,000
You didn't tell me about it. I was there.

635
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:32,250
If it's a family secret, you've gotta
be in the family to know them.

636
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:34,916
Fine, Brother Mon.

00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:37,791
