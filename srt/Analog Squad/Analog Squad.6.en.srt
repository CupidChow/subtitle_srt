00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,291
isn't all sunshine and flowers, Bung.

178
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,458
[Keg sighs]

179
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,916
It's too late anyway. You two should go.

180
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,250
[Keg] Pond.

181
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,833
You might not think of me as family,
but to me, she's my grandma.

182
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,875
Stop running away from things.

183
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:50,041
Grandma asked me to tell you,
you shouldn't wait for someone to die

184
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,125
before seeing your family.

185
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,875
[man] Hey! Hey! Your time's up!

186
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,208
You gotta go!

187
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,541
How did she go?

188
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,125
She died in her sleep.

189
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,291
How's Grandpa?

190
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,375
[Bung] He's doing okay.

191
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,000
He's been strong.

192
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,208
Hey! Pond!

193
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,833
Where the hell do you think you're going?

194
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,500
I'm not going anywhere.
Just showing them out.

195
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,291
So you can stop screaming now.

196
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:36,833
You may have been hot shit a while ago,
but I'm your boss now. You got that?

197
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,708
Just go.
Say goodbye to Grandma for me.

198
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,000
[tuts] Pond.

199
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,541
Go on.

200
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,791
Just leave.

201
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,875

205
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,708
[boss] Stop moping around!

206
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,416
Get back to work!

207
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,166

[door opens]

210
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,791
Hey. What are you doing?

211
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,125
Well, Sodsai once told me

212
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:45,750
to donate these things to those who
can make use of them when she died.

213
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,666
- Let me give you a hand.
- Okay.

214
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,125
Oh!

215
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,000
[laughs]

216
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,333
I bet she was hot stuff
when she was younger.

217
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,166
[Kew] Oh yeah.

218
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,166
She was the prettiest girl around.

219
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,125
Do you know

220
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,916
who I had to compete with
for her affections?

221
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,208
[Lilly chuckles]

222
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,666
A policeman,

223
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,708
a sheriff,

224
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,416
and a banker.

225
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,708
How'd you two meet, anyway?

226
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,708
Uh…

227
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,458
She needed her photo taken
for a job application.

228
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,666
Yeah. She wanted to apply

229
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,666
for this lucrative accounting job
in Bangkok.

230
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,291
I teased her and said my studio was
also looking for an accountant.

231
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,916
- [chuckles]
- [Lilly] Ooh!

232
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,208
[emotional music plays]

233
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,875
- And what did she say?
- Of course she said no.

234
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,250
- [laughs]
- She said that, uh…

235
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:50,791
Oh yeah. She asked me
if I could even afford to hire her.

236
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,208
[laughs] That must've left you
pretty stunned, huh?

237
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,916
Not really.

238
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,291
So I lied to her and I said
that the photo I'd taken wasn't good.

239
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,291
- Hmm.
- I asked her to come back for a retake.

240
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:06,125
After that, I kept making up excuses
for us to see each other.

241
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,500
Oh, you…

242
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,750
Then, finally, she just…

243
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,583
- changed her mind about leaving.
- Hmm.

244
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:13,916
She didn't go to Bangkok.

245
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,791
- Applied for a job at the mine instead.
- Oh! [laughs]

246
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,791
- So you got yourself a wife instead of…
- Yes.

247
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:21,791
…an accountant.

248
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,791
[both laugh]

249
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,166
[Lilly] Hah!

00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,416
[both chuckle]

251
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,000
This… is that first photo.

252
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,708
[doorbell rings]

253
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,083
Um… do you want me
to say we're closed today?

254
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,708
Uh…

255
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,083
No. We'd better keep it open.

256
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,833
We should do something,
or Sodsai'll complain.

257

[music fades]

258
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,750
Mam, you go mind the store.

259

If you need help, shout.

260
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,541
[Lilly] All right.

261
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,708
- Hello.
- Hello.

262
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,083
Are you here to get your photo taken
or to print photos?

[suspenseful music plays]

264
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,458
[Kew] Mam! Where are my pills again?

265
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,208
They're on the table in your bedroom, Dad.

266
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,541
Is your name, uh, Mam?

267
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:45,916
Yeah.

[Lilly chuckles]

269
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,916
Um…

270
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,625
I'm applying for a job
and I need my photo taken.

271
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,291
Oh. Uh…

272
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,458
Dad, uh, can you come?

DADDY POND

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,958
A customer wants her photo taken.

275
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,625
- Just a minute.
- Sure.

Oh.

Uh, miss?

283
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,000
Do you have one too?

284
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,083
I have a panda.

285
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,958
- Do you mind?
- Go ahead.

286
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,916
I've been so busy.

287
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,500
I haven't really had time
to look after it.

[Mag] Oh…

289
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,708
Your pet's fully grown now.

290
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,125
It's ready to have a family.

291
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,750
It'll be sad if you let it die.

[Lilly] Hmm.

293
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,666
I'll try not to.

just press these two buttons.

It'll pause the game.

When you're ready to play again,
press the same two buttons.

Really? I didn't know you could do that.

Has this studio been in business for long?

You don't live here, then?

No, I don't.
This place belongs to my in-laws.

I saw your family photo.

[Lilly] No.
He's working out of town right now.

312

Oh. Okay.

Hey.

You don't look familiar.
Are you new in town?

No, I'm just visiting here.

- Yes, miss?

Does my hair look all right?

Uh…

322
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,208
Maybe put your hair back.

323
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,916
And sit up nice and straight.

324
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:02,583
Okay.

325
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,833
- Hey, Mam.
- [Lilly] Yeah?

326
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,250
- [door opens]
- [Kew] Uh…

327
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,125
Say, have you heard
from Mag and Mon at all?

328
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:19,458
- It's a long drive and I'm a bit worried.
- [Lilly] Hmm…

329
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,708
That's sweet of you to worry about them.

330
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,708
- I'll page them for you, okay?
- [Kew] Thanks.

Y-your grandchildren on a trip?

00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,416
They went to get their father.

333
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,083
They should be back in a few days.

334
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,000
- Mmm.
- [Mag] Hmm.

335
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,916
- Uh, sir?
- Yes?

336
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,291
Do you remember me?

337
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,083
Hmm.

338
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,375
Well, have you had your photo taken here?
I don't remember you.

339

I'm sorry. I don't.

- [Kew] Oh really?

342
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:24,583
Well, you're all grown up now.
Yup. [chuckles]

343
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,625
You ready?

344
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,291
Hold still. Here we go.

345
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,791
You can give me a little smile.

346
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,708
- All right. I'll count to three.
- [winds camera]

347
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,416
One, two, three.

Dad's new wife is called Mam?

- Because he loves you.

- You don't know him better than I do.
- Of course I do.

You can only talk to him as a mom.

If he finds out, he'll never forgive you.

465
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:48,625
I had to become his friend
because you wouldn't let me be his father.

and never wants to talk to us again?

If this job makes her happy,

637
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:53,666
I should be the one to go.

639
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,166
