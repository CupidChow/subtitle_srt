00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:10,500
[photographer] Beautiful! All right.

[Pupae] <i>I used to believe a woman like me</i>

00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,833
<i>But then Ruk came along</i>
<i>and changed my mind.</i>

5
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:27,708

[Pupae] <i>We loved each other so much.</i>

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,250
Yeah. I got it.

00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:41,250
[Pupae] <i>But I knew that my career</i>

[dramatic music playing]

11
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,416
<i>I knew he loved me.</i>

12
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,375
<i>That day,</i>

13
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,458
<i>something in me died</i>

[baby crying]

15
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,125
[Pupae] <i>But many months later,</i>

16
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,375
<i>another life was born.</i>

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,750
There, there. It's okay.

18
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,708
[Pupae] <i>I never told him about it.</i>
<i>It never crossed my mind.</i>

00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,750
[Pupae] <i>He tried contacting me many times,</i>

22
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,833

23
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,583

[slow, mellow music playing over stereo]

28
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:22,958
Pupae.

29
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,625
[Pupae] Mm-hmm?

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
I don't wanna keep this a secret anymore.

31
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,875
I want to be Keg's dad.

32
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,583
[sighs deeply]

33
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,333
We've talked about this.

34
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,375
You and I can start over,
but don't get our son involved in it.

35
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,833
If you're gonna use the hostel
to blackmail me,

36
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,166
I'll find the money somehow
and pay you back.

37
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,041
I never said anything like that, Pupae.

38
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,416
But haven't you ever thought

39
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,916
that Keg might actually want a father?

40
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,291
I'm his dad, and I want him to know it.

41
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,125
How much longer
are you gonna keep lying to him?

42
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,583
I never lied to him.

43
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,583
As far as I was concerned,
Keg never had a father.

44
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,750
I know it was my fault,

45
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,750
but I've always loved you.

46
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,208
I never stopped.

47
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,791
And I really love my son as well.

48
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,583
A son I only just

49
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,416
found out about three years ago.

50
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,000
I've been waiting till you were ready

51
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,541
to build a family together.

52
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,166
Pupae.

53
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,208
It would be great

54
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,250
if we could do it now.

55
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,666
Do you know
why I don't wanna tell our son?

56
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,291
It's because I don't know

57
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,250
if you'll leave us again.

58
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,583
[tuts and inhales deeply]

59
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,125
Have the last three years

60
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,750
not proven anything to you?

61
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,833
I didn't expect anything,

62
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,416
so it was okay.

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,333
Look. I'm serious, Pupae.

64
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:41,166
So are you saying you're ready
to go and tell him that you're his father

65
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,250
and that you'll take care of him
and never leave him again?

66
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,958
[woman] Try to find it, dear.

67
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,708
It's probably in the cupboard
by the windows.

68
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,041
[daughter] Yes, Mom.

69
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,208
- [daughter] Which box is it?
- [mom] Mm, I can't remember.

70
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,541
It might be in the drawers.

71
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:36,166
I kept them because I wanted you
to wear them on your wedding day.

72
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,958
[daughter] Hmm. Is it the same pair
you wore at your wedding?

73
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,500
[mom] Yes! I think they'll go really well
with your dress.

74
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,166
[intriguing music playing]

75
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,208
19 FEBRUARY 1976
DEAR MAG,

76
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,875
THIS IS THE FIRST BIRTHDAY
WE WON'T GET TO SPEND TOGETHER

77
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,291
BE STRONG AND BE A GOOD, HEALTHY GIRL

78
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:39,500
THOUGH WE DON'T GET TO SEE EACH OTHER,
IT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T LOVE YOU

79
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,416
DAD

80
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,916
19 FEBRUARY 1985
DEAR MAG,

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,208
HAPPY 15TH BIRTHDAY, HONEY
DAD

82
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:55,625
19 FEBRUARY 1994

83
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,041
YOUR JOB MUST BE HARD…

84
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,083
…DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T LOVE YOU
DAD

85
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,916
[Mag] Mom.

86
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,500
- Did you find the earrings?
- I want to invite Dad to my wedding.

87
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,708
[mom] It's been 20 years.

88
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,583
Why are you bringing him up now?

89
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,083
Why do you care?

90
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,375
He's never cared about you.

91
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,375
You had every right

92
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,416
to get remarried,

93
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:10,000
but now I have every right
to… invite Dad to my wedding.

94
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,541
[mom scoffs]

95
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,500
You don't even know your father.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,375
I highly doubt

97
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,958
he'll even recognize you when he sees you.

98
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:27,833
I can understand
your anger and hatred towards him,

99
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,166
but why is it you want us to hate him too?

100
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,250
[dramatic music playing]

101
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,416
[Sodsai] My goodness!

102
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,333
Bangkok is really huge!

103
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,375
Oh! Look. There's the Skytrain!

104
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,250
[Keg] It just opened, Grandma.
It's always crowded.

105
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,291
[Sodsai] Mm-hmm.

106
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,166
[Keg] People line up for it
like it's a roller coaster.

107
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,958
[Sodsai] Mm-hmm. Hmm!

108
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,291
[shutter clicks]

109
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,125
Let me take a picture of you
so I can show it to Grandpa.

110
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,458
Hey!

111
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,333
[shutter clicks]

112
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,625
If you're afraid of heights,
why'd you bring me up here?

113
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,125
I'm not afraid. Uh, just not used to it.

114
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,458
[Sodsai] Mm. Come on. Come with me.

115
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,708
Come and stand over here.

116
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,791
[playful music]

117
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,708
Now, do as I say.

118
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,833
Stand up straight.

119
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:51,083
Keep your head up
so your nose is at 45 degrees.

120
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,041
Take a nice deep breath in.

121
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,583
Get the energy from the sky.

122
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,500
And then, as loud as you can, yell,

123
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,166
"I'm not afraid of you!"

124
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,833
[laughs] Okay! Now you try.

125
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,000
[Keg exhales]

126
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,625
[Sodsai] One, two, three!

127
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,208
[shouting together] I'm not afraid of you!

128
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,291
[Sodsai] How was that?

129
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,750
[both chuckle]

130
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,416
Okay, here. Take some photos of me.

131
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,875
- [Keg] Ready? One, two, three.
- [shutter clicks]

132
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,750
One, two…

133
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,875
Tell me if I look too old now.

134
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,625
You don't look old.

135
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,916
One more. One, two, three. Mm-hmm.

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,666
When Grandpa's feeling better,
I'm definitely bringing him up here.

137
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,833
<i>That's </i>why you wanna get back.
You miss him, right?

138
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,458
[laughs] Of course!

139
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,875
[Sodsai chuckles]

140
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,791
- [Sodsai sighs]
- So you're not… gonna wait to see Dad now?

141
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,500
Pond will get in touch when he's ready to.

142
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,583
[Keg] Hmm.

143
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,416
I know the truth now.

144
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,208
Why are you so surprised at that?

145
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,750
Well… you know the truth now.

146
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,958
It's normal
for a husband and wife to fight.

147
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:32,166
People who live together
don't always understand each other.

148
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,083
Your dad has been like that
ever since he was young.

149
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,666
He's never changed.

150
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,291
When he has problems, he always retreats.

151
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,250
But sometimes
he retreats a little too long.

152
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:50,250
That's the reason why… he hasn't
talked to Grandpa for ten years.

153
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,708
Grandma,

154
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,291
can I ask you something?

155
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,583
What did Dad and Grandpa fight about?

156
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,000
[Sodsai] <i>It's because of</i>
<i>that stupid Apollo moon mission.</i>

157

<i>a day that will go down in history.</i>

159
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,041

<i>but it is one giant leap for mankind.</i>

- Hey, Mek!
- [Mek] Hi, Pond.

163
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,125
- Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Let's celebrate.

164
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,416
[Mek sighs] You always get me
to do the weirdest things.

[both laugh]

166
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,875
- [Pond] Oh!
- [Mek] I hope I don't get fired!

167
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,041
I'm gonna shoot this up to the moon
like Apollo, buddy!

168
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,041
[Mek] Sure. Go ahead!

- [Mek] How about that? Whoo!
- [Pond laughs]

175
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,291
- [Mek] Why didn't mine go far?
- [Pond] Hold it higher.

176
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,833
- [Mek] Like this?
- [Pond] That's it.

177
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,958
- Wow!
- Whoo!

178
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,625
- [Pond] Apollo!
- [Mek cheering]

179
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,500
- This is fucking great!
- [Mek] Yeah!

180
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,000
- All right!
- [laughing]

181
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,208
[both yelling and whooping]

182
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,708
- [Pond] Look at it go!
- [Mek] Yeah!

183
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,333
[Pond] Check it out!

184
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,791
[crackling]

185
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:14,875
Pond.

186
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,416
FERTILIZER
60 KG

187
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,208
- [tense music playing]
- [Pond] Oh shit!

188
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,541
- We're screwed.
- Fuck me!

189
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,666
- Hey! Where are you going?
- I'm getting an extinguisher.

190
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,625
Let me take care of it. Just stay here.
If my boss finds out, he'll can me.

191
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,291
[Pond] What the hell are you doing?
Mek! Mek! What are you doing?

192
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,458
[Mek] You just stay here.

193
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,083
[Pond] Mek!

194
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,333
- [Mek] Shit!
- [Pond] Mek!

195
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,625
[dramatic music playing]

196
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,625
Mek!

197
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,875
[Pond whimpers]

198
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,375
Mek, where are you?

199
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,958
Mek! Get out!

200
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,375
Mek!

201
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,708
[Pond coughing]

202
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,166
Mek, come on!

203
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,666
[coughing]

204
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,625
Mek!

205
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,541
Mek!

206
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,041
[wood cracking]

207
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,750
[gasps] Mek, come on!

208
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,166
Mek!

209
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,541
Mek!

210
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,541
No! Mek!

211
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,250
[panting and coughing]

212
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,333
[dramatic music continues]

213
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,333
[music building]

214
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,541
[Pond screams]

215
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,500
[sobbing]

216
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,416
Pond!

217
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:51,958
Pond!

218
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,833
- What's wrong? Pond!
- [continues sobbing]

219
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,458
What happened?

220
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,416
- Mek's dead.
- Sh.

221
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,916
He's dead.

222
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,166
We have to go to the police.

223
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,500
We'll all go together.

224
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,125
But what if they arrest him?

225
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,166
How can they? It was an accident.

226
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,750
[Sodsai sighs]

227
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,458
But Mek died, Dad.

228
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,500
What if the police say I did it?

229
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,041
So are you telling me the truth?

230
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,500
Have I ever lied to you?

231
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,000
How can you ask that?

232
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,958
Have I ever lied to you?
I-- I have never done that!

233
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:59,375
- Then there's nothing to be afraid of.
- The police don't care what the truth is.

234
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,625
They only care about proof,
which I don't have.

235
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:07,375
- Listen. I won't let them put you in jail.
- [Pond] So what are you gonna do?

236
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,375
I told you. There were no witnesses!

237
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,000
So what do you want me to do?

238
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:22,750
If someone asks you, just tell them
I was at home all day. That's it.

239
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,875
You want me to lie?

240
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,916
Can you do that for me?

241
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,708
[inhales deeply]

242
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,375
One lie leads to another, then another.

243
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,666
And then we'll have to keep on lying.

244
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,083
Please help.

245
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,916
- [somber music playing]
- [Pond sobbing]

246
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,583
Help me.

247
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,791
[sniffles, sobs]

248
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,416
[motorbike approaching]

249
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,375
[man] Is Pond here?

250
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,208
[Kew] How can we help you, officer?

251
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,083
[officer] Last night,
someone lit some fireworks,

252
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,541
burned down the fertilizer warehouse.
Someone died.

253
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,291
The victim's name is Mek, and we were told
he was a close friend of Pond's.

254
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,125
Someone saw them together yesterday.

255
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,666
We'd like to ask Pond a few questions.

256
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,000
Do you know where Pond was
at 8:00 p.m. last night?

257
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,291
[Kew] I don't know.

258
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,958
He wasn't at home.

259
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,791
Why didn't you help our son?

260
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,458
If he runs from this,
he'll run the rest of his life.

261
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,458
Kew, he told you he didn't do it.
Why don't you believe him?

262
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,291
I do believe him. That's why
I wanted to take him to the police,

263
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,416
so he could tell them what he told us.

264
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,416
He told you why he couldn't.
There are no witnesses.

265
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,416
Then, we'll figure out something else.

266
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,166
We'll do whatever it takes.

267
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,833
This is our son's life.
How could you do this to him?

268
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,291
Do you think I don't love him?

269
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,208
If we want to help,
we have to do it the right way.

270
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,291
[tense music playing]

271
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,708
[Sodsai] <i>Pond ran away</i>
<i>for almost ten years</i>

272
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,208
<i>and came back</i>
<i>when you and Mag were little.</i>

273
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,208
[Keg] <i>If I were Dad, I'd be mad too.</i>

274
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,833
<i>Why was Grandpa so mean?</i>

275
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:40,500
He wasn't mean. I understood both of them.
But it doesn't mean I liked it.

276
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,875
Grandpa loves Pond very much.

277
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:48,583
But when Pond disappeared,
he tried to find any proof

278
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:52,541
or witnesses to prove Pond's innocence
in Mek's death,

279
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,875
but there was none.

280
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,416
I'm just so glad

281
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,083
that at least we got
to see each other again.

282
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,708
Can you do me a favor, Mon?

283
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,541
Tell your dad to talk to Grandpa, please.

284
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,208
Pond's a father himself now,

285
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,833
so he should understand
his own dad better.

286
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,375
Let's not wait
till someone gets sick or dies

287
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,416
before we see each other again.

288
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,375
Okay.

289
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,958
Pinkie swear?

290
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,416
[Bung] Hmm, it's pretty cloudy.

291
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,875
Think we'll be able
to see the sunset, Grandpa?

292
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,541
[Kew] Hopefully,
it should be setting soon.

293
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:12,333
The sunset here is
the most beautiful sunset of all.

294
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,958
Let's wait a bit longer, okay?

295
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:19,208
Sometimes waiting is
its own form of happiness.

296
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,416
[Bung chuckles]

297
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,833
You're okay without having Grandma around?

298
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:26,250
Uh… it's nice
to have the chance to miss her.

299
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,375
Oh! [chuckles]

300
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm gonna steal that one and send a page.

301
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,333
Hey! Who are you gonna page?

302
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,666
Have you got a lover, hmm?

303
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,625
I am seeing someone.

304
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,208
But it's a girl.

305
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:47,916
[Kew] Really?

306
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:49,916
[Kew] Hmm.

307
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,791
Do, uh, your parents know about it?

308
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,083
Do I have to tell them, Grandpa?

309
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,083
I just live my life.

310
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,708
Doesn't matter what I am, does it?

311
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,625
Listen.

312
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,541
When you spend time with your parents,
do you ever feel uncomfortable?

313
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,833
Do you ever feel
that you can't be yourself?

314
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:24,916
If so,

315
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:28,750
then I think you should just tell them.

316
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,000
Tell them now.

317
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,583
You'll feel so much lighter.

318
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:38,000
Secrets can weigh heavily on you.

319
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:51,833
[Sodsai] I'm leaving tomorrow night.
I should be there late morning.

320
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:56,000
[Kew] <i>Can you be more specific? Give me</i>
<i>a time so I know when to leave the house.</i>

321
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,166
Hmm. Don't pick me up.

322
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,833
I'll just grab a taxi.

323
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,541
By the way,
did you take all your medicine?

324
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:07,250
[Kew] <i>Of course.</i>
<i>Mag reminded me when to take it.</i>

325
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:11,083
So how's it going there?
How was your big trip to Bangkok?

326
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:14,500
Great! Mon is such a sweetie.

327
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,666
He took me to the Baiyoke Tower,

328
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,875
and he bought
a beautiful pair of leather shoes

329
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:23,166
at the World Trade Center for you.

330
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:28,041
[Kew] <i>Ah, my old pair are still good.</i>
<i>Why did he do that? It's a waste of money.</i>

331
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:31,500
Mon, Grandpa wants to talk to you.

332
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,916
- Yes, Grandpa?
<i>- Hey.</i>

333
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,666
Don't buy anything for me.

334
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:40,083
I'd rather you saved up your money
so you can come here.

335
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,125
- I'll go visit when I can.
<i>- Hey.</i>

336
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,291
How's it been babysitting Grandma?

337
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:47,958
Grandma?

338
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:51,125
She gets wasted every day.

339
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:52,208
[laughs]

340
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:54,583
[Sodsai] Hey! [laughs]

341
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:58,208
So how are you doing?
Is Mag taking care of you?

342
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,750
- Did you two go anywhere?
<i>- Well, why don't you ask her yourself?</i>

343
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:03,833
<i>Hey, Mag.</i>

344
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
- [Bung] <i>Hello.</i>
- When you coming back?

345
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:12,791
Miss you.

346
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,000
You'll see me when I get back.

347
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,375
I'll return the video then.

348
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,833
I'm just gonna wait
till Grandma gets here so I can see her.

349
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,000
<i>Okay.</i>

350
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,250
Uh, by the way, does Mom want me
to bring her anything back?

351
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,916
Mom, Mag wants to talk to you.

352
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,083
Oh. Okay.

353
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,291
- [Lilly] <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, Ma!

354
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,541
<i>Hello, my sweet daughter.</i>

355
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:44,083
How you doing?

356
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,875
I'm very happy.

357
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:48,583
- Do you want me to bring anything back?
<i>- No, no.</i>

358
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:51,125
So when are you planning
on coming back here, huh?

359
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,416
Your brother misses you.

360
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,750
Okay, Ma.

361
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,833
Later, Mom.

362
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,875
- [Lilly] Okay. See ya.
- [hangs up phone]

363
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,083
- Hey.
- [Lilly] What?

364
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,125
- Anything from Pond yet?
- [Lilly] No.

365
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,041

[Bung sniffles]

374
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:47,875
Grandpa Kew.

375
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:50,375
[Kew continues whistling]

376
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:52,500
Grandma died last night.

377
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,125
- [Kew stops whistling]
- [Bung sobbing softly]

378
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,583

00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:15,000
[mournful song playing]

380
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:08,708
[Boonmee] Hey. What's going on?

381
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,458
[Kew] Sodsai died last night.

382
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,875
[Boonmee] Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
If you need anything, let me know.

383
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:19,958
Take care of yourself, okay?

384
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,083
[Kew] Thank you. Thank you, Boonmee.

385
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:49,666
MRS. SODSAI JUENGNIRAN

386
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,250
BORN 25 DECEMBER 1924
DIED 22 DECEMBER 1999

387
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,666
[indistinct chatter]

388
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:17,500
[Lilly] Please have a seat over here.

389
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,416
Would you like some tea?

390
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:25,791
[woman 1] Sodsai's very lucky.
She died peacefully in her sleep.

391
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:30,916
[woman 2] So who's moving in with Grandpa?
Or are you gonna move him to Bangkok?

392
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:36,375
Uh… we don't know yet.

393
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,666
We haven't really made any plans.

394
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,583
[woman 3] Every morning, your grandma
would buy Dang's soy milk

395
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,333
for your grandpa.

396
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:45,500
You'll have to help each other
take care of him.

397
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:46,416
[woman 2] Hmm.

398
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,958
Your grandpa loves his house.
I don't think he'll wanna move.

399
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,833
By the way, where's your dad?
He should be here!

400
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,375
[gentle piano music playing]

401
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:19,708
[woman] Hello, sir.

402
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:28,083
My name's Jeab. I'm Mek's wife.

403
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,583
Do you remember me?

404
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,500
Of course I do.

405
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:36,666
After Mek's funeral,
I never came back here.

406
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,166
[Kew] Uh,

407
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,208
I'm sorry about what happened.

408
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,416
I've wanted to tell you that
for a very long time,

409
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,875
but I never had the chance.

410
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:51,000
This is Ken.

411
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,791
- Ken is our son.
- [Kew] Oh.

412
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:59,375
We met before when you were little.
You were so tiny then.

413
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,458
Is Pond here?

414
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:04,666
Unfortunately, he's out of town.

415
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,583
Today, I brought my son here
to say goodbye.

416
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:14,208
But I also wanted to see Pond.

417
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,708
I wanted Ken to meet Pond

418
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,666
because after Mek passed away,

419
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,791
Pond would always send us money,

420
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,083
until Ken finished school.

421
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:32,958
I just wanted to tell him

422
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:34,708
I appreciated it.

423
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,750
Did Pond really do that?

424
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,041
[Jeab] Yes.

425
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,833
Could you possibly
give him another message?

426
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:49,791
Hmm, sure.

427
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,666
No matter what happened that day…

428
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:02,041
I've forgiven him.

429
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,291
[Kew] Mm.

430
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,708
It was an accident.

431
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:14,041
Yes.

432
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:21,541
[sobbing]

433
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,458
Have a drink, Mom.

434
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,166
[exhales softly]

435
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,458
Guess you won't
be going to the hospital with me.

436
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:14,666
Thank you…

437
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:21,458
for making me
want to give life another chance.

438
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:23,833
[sighs]

439
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,166
Before I met you,

440
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,833
I'd decided not to get treatment.

441
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:38,791
I thought, "Fuck it."

442
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,666
"It's only death."

443
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,500
[sighs deeply]

444
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,208
But you made me feel that…

445
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:57,375
being alive is actually pretty wonderful.

446
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,458
[melancholy music playing]

447
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:11,208
Even though we only knew each other
a short time,

448
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:16,333
I'm pretty damn sure…

449
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,791
that if I died…

450
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:30,500
that you'd definitely cry for me.

451
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,666
[exhales deeply]

452
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:42,000
[sobbing]

453
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,416
But you…

454
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:49,916
You went and died ahead of me, damn it.

455
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,041
I promise, Mom,

456
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:07,958
that I'll live the rest of my life
the best way possible.

457
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,250
And we'll meet again one day, Ma.

458
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,583
Oh, right.

459
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:27,916
M-- Ma…

460
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,250
I'm actually not really
your daughter-in-law.

461
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:41,125
I'd really love to be,

462
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:45,791
but your son doesn't want me.

463
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:55,916
Cheers.

00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:26,541
[thunder rumbling]

465
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:52,708
Why are we so broken up about this?

466
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,375
We're not even her real grandchildren.

467
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:14,000
There are no real or fake bonds.

468
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,250
If we feel it, we feel it.

469
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:24,750
She loved us,

470
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:27,583
and we loved her.

471
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:33,041
That's all.

472
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,625
EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT
YOUR REAL GRANDDAUGHTER…

[Kew] Hmm?

- Hmm.

I told you, I'm looking for my dad.
I didn't come to steal.

It's Pond.

I, uh… I used to work for Pond.

521
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:37,083
Really? So where is he now?

522

Uh…

523
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:41,750
I haven't seen him for years now.

524
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:45,041
He was in jail for a while, and then…

525
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,291
But I don't know where he went
after he got out.

526
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:49,875
My dad was in jail?

527
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:53,458
His company went bankrupt
during the financial crisis.

528
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:57,083
He couldn't pay back his debts,
so he got sued.

529
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,375
They even confiscated this ship.

530
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,958
Oh, but he's a really good person.

531
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:05,958
I mean, even when he was broke,

532
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:08,416
he gave me this amulet
instead of my salary.

533
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,291
It's worth more than my pay.

534
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:13,333
It's a famous amulet
from Phang Nga, his hometown.

535
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:17,625
Thank you, sir.

536
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:19,291
[man] Huh? Where are you going?

537
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:22,750
[laughs] What's with this girl?

538
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:32,708
[Lilly] Excuse me. Can we get the check?

539
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:34,041
[server] Sure.

540
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:40,083
You're Sodsai's family, right?

541
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,375
- It's okay. It's on me.
- [Bung] Um--

542
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:44,458
- [Lilly] But we can pay.
- No, it's okay.

543
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:46,916
Don't worry. It's my treat.

544
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:00,500
Our lies are spreading
like the plague around here.

545
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:04,333
I feel like we're lying
to more and more people.

546
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:06,333
We can't stop now.

547
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:10,375
If we confess now,

548
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,333
it would be totally selfish.

549
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:18,208
We just don't wanna feel like we're bad,

550
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:20,833
Which we actually are.

551
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:25,000
But we have to remember
that Grandpa's got no one left but us.

552
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,833
I agree with Keg, Bung.

553
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:33,833
I think we should find Pond first,
and then tell Grandpa together.

554
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:46,000
[pager buzzing]

555
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:55,791
KEG, CALL ME BACK
WHEN YOU'RE FREE. FROM PAPA RUK

556
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,333
Hey.

557
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:03,833
I know how we can find Pond!

558
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:06,875
[Bung] Wait!

559
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:14,666
[line ringing]

560
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:15,708
[coins drop]

561
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,625
- [Ruk] <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, Ruk.

562
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:19,416
I need a favor.

563
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,916
<i>A favor? What is it?</i>

564
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,250
Can you check the messages
for this number?

565
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,875
Nine, zero, one, nine, nine, nine.

566
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:30,291
We're not allowed doing that.

567
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,708
I know that, but this is urgent.

568
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:39,208
Remember when I told you that I pretended
to be a family member for someone?

569
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:41,416
- Mm-hmm.
- [Keg] <i>Well, the grandmother died.</i>

570
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:43,750
<i>And we can't contact her son.</i>

571
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,750
There might be some messages in his pager.

572
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:48,250
Can you check them for me?

573
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:50,833
[sighs]

574
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:52,583
Mm. Mm-hmm.

575
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:54,000
Keg.

576
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,125
Are you okay?

577
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:05,000
I can't leave this family like this.

578
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,958
<i>I'm going to America soon.</i>

579
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:12,875
Uh,

580
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,458
you wanted me to call you?

581
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:18,083
Um, don't worry about it.

582
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,583
We can talk later
when you get back home, okay?

583
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:21,916
I've gotta get back to work.

584
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,958
<i>Okay, Ruk. Let's have a couple of beers</i>
<i>next week. My treat.</i>

585
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,083
<i>- I'll wait to hear from you.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

586
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:32,041

588
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:51,583
Uh, number seven, zero, zero,

589

<i>Seven, zero, zero, seven, three, seven.</i>
<i>May I have your message?</i>

590
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,416
I got your souvenirs.

591
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:00,583
You didn't have
to buy me anything in Bangkok.

592
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:03,833
But, uh, thank you very much.

593
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:09,750
Oh, uh, I can hold
for ten whole seconds on the triflow now.

594
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,791
[Lilly] Mm, come on, Dad!

595
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:18,458
He's lying! Don't believe him, Mom!
He only lasted five seconds.

596
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,500
Fine. Five seconds.

597
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,666
This is from Kew.

598
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,916
Let's really make it ten, Dad.

599
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:36,916
Okay. Let's do it.

600
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,250

- Okay.

One, two, three, four, five,

Fuck!

Santa Claus sent me a present!

Bung!

612
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:50,000
[Bung] Santa who? He sent you what?

613
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:53,333
I know where Pond is, Bung!
Get up and take a shower!

614
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:56,500
- Quick!
- Hey, Lil! I mean, Mom! Oh! Ma!

615
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:01,375
Tell Grandpa I need to borrow his car.
I'll bring it back in one piece.

616
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:03,708
- Drive carefully.

You won't have to steal his.

654
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:11,416
I should give him one next time
and not give him the whole pack.

655
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,666
Then you and I can split it.

Oh, I see. Tryin' to make a deal,
you little shit?
