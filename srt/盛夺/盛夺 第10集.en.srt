1
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,240
Have you heard

2
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,560
about Young Master Sheng Ze locking Gu Nannan in the wine cellar?

3
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,290
If it were me,

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,370
I would move to another planet.

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,080
How can she still shamelessly stay at the Sheng family?

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,720
Right.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,420
How can she have the nerve?

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,760
So shameless.

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:03,880
Clingy.

10
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
When I become the mistress of the Sheng family,

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,960
you'll all be kissing my feet.

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,280
Don't believe me?

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,120
Come here.

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,080
Miss Gu.

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,420
My shoes are dirty.

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,170
Alright.

17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,970
I'll clean them for you.

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,000
Gu Nannan.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,720
This is the Sheng family's party.

20
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,479
You have no right to bully someone from the Sheng family.

21
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,280
You should go now.

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
I'll handle this.

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,640
Don't be ridiculous.

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,960
She's not really part of the Sheng family.

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,800
After what happened last time,

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,730
she's just the Sheng family's dog.

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,639
Because you're both maids,

28
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,860
that's why you're so sympathetic to each other.

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,400
Qiao Wan.

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,160
I'm not done with you yet.

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,490
It's because of you, you bitch,

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,640
that A Ze treated me this way.

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,360
This is going to be interesting.

34
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,840
Mr. Sheng,

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,840
I...

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,540
Seems like Sheng Ze's lesson wasn't enough for you.

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,420
He might be gentle with women.

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,760
But I won't be.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,840
Mr. Sheng, you've misunderstood.

40
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,290
If you dare touch even a hair on Qiao Wan's head again,

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,320
I'll kill you.

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,160
Get out!

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Qiao Wan.

44
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,000
Be my woman.

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,000
Interesting.

46
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,040
Mr. Sheng.

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,240
You're drunk.

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,920
You should go home and rest.

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Don't panic.

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,060
I'll take care of everything.

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,610
Take it slow.

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,000
We have plenty of time.

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,730
What do you really want?

54
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,440
Remember.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,760
You've always been mine.

56
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,160
I'm the one who sent you to the Sheng residence.

57
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,920
Now

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,060
it's time for you to return to my side.

59
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Both uncle and nephew of the Sheng family falling for the same maid.

60
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,840
It sounds crazy,

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,440
but it makes sense when it happens to your family.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,720
Don't go! Hey!

63
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,519
What are you doing?

64
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,760
I wasn't looking where I was going, sir.

65
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,240
Let me clean this up for you.

66
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,170
How can you clean up all this water?

67
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,600
Then please come upstairs with me,

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,080
to change your pants.

69
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,159
Oh no.

70
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,040
Sir.

71
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,760
You like playing games like this, don't you?

72
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,680
Hanging onto my uncle with your words,

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,410
but secretly coming to find me.

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,400
Then I'll give you what you want.

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,920
Sir,

76
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
let me help you change your clothes.

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,140
I don't need your help.

78
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,090
That's impossible.

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,640
This can't be.

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,450
What's impossible?

81
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,040
Sheng An's thigh was injured by Sheng Huaijing.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Young Master.

83
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,810
Are you alright, Young Master?

84
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,560
Are you okay?

85
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,900
What could possibly be wrong with me?

86
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,010
This crippled leg of mine can't feel anything, no matter how many times it's stabbed.

87
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,440
Don't talk like that.

88
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,560
You'll get better.

89
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,120
You definitely will.

90
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,560
There should be a scar here.

91
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,770
Open your eyes and look carefully.

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,920
Who am I?

93
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,640
At this point,

94
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,040
you still refuse to admit it?

95
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,970
You are Sheng An.

96
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,810
Where's your proof?

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,090
Sheng An.

98
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,340
You think I'm an idiot?

99
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,880
Red chrysanthemums.

100
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,640
That was your favorite flower to paint.

101
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,770
You've been giving me hints since the day of the funeral.

102
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,000
Even if someone changes their name and identity,

103
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,210
their habits can't be changed so quickly.

104
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,440
Every time you hold me,

105
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,760
kiss me,

106
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,159
all these little details give you away.

107
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,760
This scar,

108
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,280
you had surgery to remove it too.

109
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,040
That's just your intuition.

110
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,370
You want more evidence?

111
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,640
Someone who paints for years

112
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,600
would have thick calluses here.

113
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,970
But Sheng Ze doesn't know how to paint.

114
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Is that enough?

115
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,880
Sheng An.

116
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:32,680
Yes.

117
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,920
That's right.

118
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,200
I am Sheng An.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,159
I'm not dead.

120
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,680
Are you disappointed?

121
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,240
Thank God you're alive.

122
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,360
Do you know

123
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,050
so much has happened during this time?

124
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,159
I was barely holding on.

125
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,040
I've been living with regret and guilt every day.

126
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,850
Thank goodness,

127
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
thank goodness you're still alive.

128
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,160
That's all that matters.

129
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,320
Young Master,

130
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,580
now that you're back on your feet,

131
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,840
you must live well.

132
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,000
Will you?

133
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,240
Madam,

134
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,799
look how exquisite this Buddha statue is.

135
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,740
The Young Master must have paid a high price for it as a gift for you.

136
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,320
Indeed.

137
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,240
Xiaoze is so thoughtful.

138
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,520
Mrs. Wang.

139
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,820
I'd like to have a word with the madam in private.

140
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,520
It's your birthday today.

141
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,180
I wasn't sure what you wanted,

142
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,220
so I took the liberty of deciding.

143
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Since when do you care about this old woman?

144
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
I don't deserve such attention.

145
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,930
I've made up my mind.

146
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,960
Now that Shengze has returned,

147
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,290
it's time for me as his uncle to step aside.

148
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,610
I will support him well from now on,

149
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,080
help run the company successfully.

150
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,280
That's enough for me.

151
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,640
If you truly think this way,

152
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,880
it's a blessing for Shengye.

153
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,160
Shengze will eventually take over the company.

154
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,560
I will clear all obstacles for him.

155
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,840
Rest assured,

156
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,080
that won't happen.

157
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
With Shengze and me here,

158
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,500
it's time for you to enjoy your retirement in peace.

159
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,280
If there's nothing else,

160
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,200
I'll take my leave now.
