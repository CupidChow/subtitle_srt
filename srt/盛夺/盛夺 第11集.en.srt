1
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,160
Madam.

2
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,640
Madam!

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,020
Someone come here!

4
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,960
Help!

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,880
Madam!

6
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,000
Madam!

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,480
Madam!

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,700
Someone come here!

9
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,240
Come quickly!

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,360
Help!

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,800
Madam!

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,160
Madam, wake up!

13
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,280
Madam!

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,760
Hello?

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,039
Hello? Is this the hospital?

16
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,080
Madam, please wake up!

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,560
This is the Sheng residence.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,240
I need an ambulance.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,520
Yes.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,160
Madam!

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,200
Please hurry.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,080
Sheng An.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,600
Knowing you're still alive.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm truly happy.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,010
But at the same time,

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,080
I can't face you anymore.

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,340
Mom's condition is improving day by day.

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,280
I don't want to be controlled by Sheng Huaijing anymore.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,140
When I've sorted everything out,

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,800
we'll meet again with new identities.

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,800
Not dead?

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,640
I heard Qiao Wan happened to pass by

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,440
and saved him.

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,050
Sheng Huaijing.

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,170
How dare you harm Grandmother.

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,400
Are you even human?

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
What evidence do you have that I did it?

38
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,330
The old lady values you so much.

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,960
Is making empty threats all you can do?

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,880
You bastard!

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,080
You!

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,010
Family members, please calm down.

43
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,360
Doctor.

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,180
How is my grandmother?

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,970
Don't worry.

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,040
The patient is now out of danger.

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,280
But when she will recover

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,970
is hard to say at this point.

49
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,720
Also,

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,079
Also what?

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
Also, her condition

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,640
has affected the nerve function in her lower limbs.

53
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,520
The patient may become paralyzed.

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,380
You need to be mentally prepared.

55
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Grandma, don't worry.

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,300
I will definitely avenge you.

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,480
Mr. Wang.

58
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,090
Why are you here?

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,040
Excuse me.

60
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,040
I called him.

61
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,720
The elderly lady signed an agreement not long ago.

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,240
Don't you know about it too?

63
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,880
Mr. Wang.

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Read it to him.

65
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,170
Alright.

66
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,920
Ms. Huang Guizhen.

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,480
I hereby transfer my ownership of

68
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,640
8% of the family shares in Shengye Group

69
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,360
to Mr. Sheng Ze.

70
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,520
Who is it transferred to?

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,720
Did you read it wrong?

72
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,280
Mr. Sheng.

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,400
The elderly lady confirmed this with me personally.

74
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,530
There's no mistake.

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,980
Additionally,

76
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,800
the 10% non-public equity

77
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,200
that old Mr. Sheng left to Ms. Huang Guizhen

78
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,970
has also been entirely gifted to Mr. Sheng Ze.

79
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,200
The above was drafted on August 6, 2025,

80
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,680
August 6th,

81
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,400
the day after Sheng An's burial.

82
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,610
You're all ganging up on me.

83
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,560
How dare you question me.

84
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,760
I did this

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,940
to prevent anyone from having ulterior motives about the shares.

86
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,410
Sheng Huaijing.

87
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,940
If you dare harm Grandmother,

88
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,880
I won't let you get away with it.

89
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,940
I also hope the culprit will be brought to justice soon.

90
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,880
I didn't even know

91
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,720
you had hidden shares.

92
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,800
You've hidden them well.

93
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,159
Have you searched around the house?

94
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,080
We've sent people to search everywhere,

95
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,680
but there's no trace of Qiao Wan.

96
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,200
I heard the old lady secretly dismissed her,

97
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,640
and she agreed immediately.

98
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,520
She must have planned to leave the Sheng residence for some time.

99
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,920
If she's deliberately hiding from us,

100
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,720
it will be difficult to find her anytime soon.

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,450
Uncle Chang.

102
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,060
I need to go somewhere.

103
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,640
Qiao Wan

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,320
Don't think about running away.

105
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,960
You're far from paying back what you owe me.

106
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,880
Get lost.

107
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,360
Got it.

108
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,320
Mr. Sheng,

109
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Qiao Wan is gone.

110
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,400
Hello.

111
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,600
Who are you looking for?

112
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,200
Where is Qiao Wan?

113
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,240
You're Young Master Sheng Ze.

114
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm sorry,

115
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,160
but I can't tell you anything.

116
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,320
I must find her.

117
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,440
Please tell me.

118
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,720
Pride,

119
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,880
wrath.

120
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,480
You've committed two sins.

121
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,920
Repent,

122
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,220
and the Lord will forgive you.

123
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Then add one more:

124
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,040
greed.

125
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,920
She is my greed.

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,960
Madman.

127
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,880
She only told me

128
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,800
that she rented an apartment on Langdun Road.

129
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
When I find her,

130
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
I'll come back to repent.

131
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,050
How did you find this place?

132
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,200
You know.

133
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,640
I'm very persistent.

134
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,370
Weren't you being so brave?

135
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,960
Keep running.

136
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,440
Run.

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,160
The gift I gave you.

138
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,840
Do you like it?

139
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,740
It's not like that.

140
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,890
It's not what you think.

141
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
After you made me take the medicine,

142
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,800
Assistant Hua entered my room

143
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
and secretly used my fingerprint.

144
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,530
How do you explain that?

145
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,480
I was being used by him at that time.

146
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,600
I didn't know what his purpose was.

147
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,240
What about that time at the beach?

148
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,159
Was it?

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,240
You pushed me down with your own hands.

150
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,120
It wasn't me.

151
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,560
It was Sheng Huaijing who did it.

152
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
Enough, Qiao Wan.

153
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,250
Are you trying to say

154
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
that you, who should have been pushing my wheelchair,

155
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,080
happened to be absent at that exact moment,

156
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,610
and then Sheng Huaijing sent someone to push me down, is that it?

157
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,000
Qiao Wan.

158
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,360
Do you think I would still believe that?

159
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,240
How long a liar can deceive depends on how long the fool believes.

160
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,720
It was this face

161
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,650
that deceived me back then.

162
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,640
At that time, I thought

163
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,160
as long as we could be together forever,

164
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,120
I could pretend I knew nothing.

165
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,799
But until that incident at the beach,

166
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,860
I finally realized

167
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,600
how naive I was.

168
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,280
Qiao Wan.

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,400
You just want me dead,

170
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,840
don't you?

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,400
No, it's not true.

172
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,940
You don't know yet.

173
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,760
Before my uncle stabbed me,

174
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,520
my legs

175
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,570
had already regained feeling.

176
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,570
Would you really cry for me?

177
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,840
Young Master.

178
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,580
Chang will take care of me.

179
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
You should go now.

180
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,600
Young Master.

181
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,880
Young Master.

182
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,120
Are you all right?

183
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,920
Hang in there.

184
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,520
The doctor will be here soon.

185
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,560
No.

186
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,000
We can't call a doctor.

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,560
It would expose everything.

188
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,160
Chang,

189
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,960
help me bandage it later.

190
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,640
Young Master,

191
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,040
why

192
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,370
are you doing this to yourself?

193
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Compared to my plan,

194
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,400
this pain is nothing.

195
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,160
In the future,

196
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,640
I'll pay them back a thousand times over.

197
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,520
Does it hurt?

198
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,280
Compared to the injury on my leg that can feel pain,

199
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,220
being pushed toward death

200
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,960
by the one I love

201
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,120
hurts more.

202
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,640
This pain...

203
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,880
I've wronged you.

204
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,850
I'm the one who hurt you.

205
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,960
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,480
I'm truly sorry.

207
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,640
Qiao Wan,

208
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,800
you owe me too much.

209
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,570
So don't think about running away.

210
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,720
Use the rest of your life to repay me slowly.

211
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,800
I know what I owe you can't be made up for.

212
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,680
But...

213
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,160
No good.

214
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,680
It's Uncle, isn't it?

215
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,000
You need to go.

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,060
He's coming for me.

217
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Perfect.

218
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,580
Let's lay everything out in the open.

219
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,840
No.

220
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,720
He doesn't know you're Sheng An yet.

221
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,240
You can't reveal your identity now.

222
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,560
I'm taking you with me today no matter what.

223
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,600
Qiao Wan, you said

224
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,480
you would make it up to me.

225
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,400
Fine.

226
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,040
I'll go with you.
