1
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,039
It's time.

2
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:09,960
I need to go.

3
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
You don't need to come back anymore.

4
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
Why?

5
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,050
It's because of Qiao Wan, isn't it?

6
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,120
Since you sent me to the Sheng residence

7
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,200
to monitor her, I knew.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,930
You have special feelings for her.

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,160
Don't tell me

10
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,440
you're staying celibate for her.

11
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,729
Isn't that ridiculous?

12
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,000
Do more, ask less.

13
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,440
Watch your mouth.

14
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,000
Feng Jing,

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,380
have you forgotten the rules?

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,880
Rules?

17
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,880
All these years, I've followed the rules

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,600
just to be

19
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,960
a qualified spy and bedmate for you.

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,200
What have I really gained?

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,060
Bedmates can be replaced.

22
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,580
But you're different.

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,770
You're someone I, Sheng Huaijing, value.

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,160
Do you really see me that way?

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,940
You're a smart person.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,370
You understand what I mean.

27
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,320
What we're facing now

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,250
is a more formidable opponent.

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,579
I need you to stay focused.

30
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,280
Young Master.

31
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,680
How's the investigation going?

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,320
I've investigated all the guests.

33
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,120
No suspicious individuals were found.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,760
And that spot happens to be a blind spot for the surveillance cameras.

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,680
This means

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,080
the suspect is very familiar with the layout of the house.

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,280
How interesting.

38
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,960
If Uncle wants to harm me,

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,960
excluding Qiao Wan,

40
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,450
who else could it be?

41
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,000
Looks like we need to draw the snake out of its hole.

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,050
Xiaoyun.

43
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,640
Is this the young master's breakfast?

44
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,720
Let me take it to him.

45
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,250
Oh, okay.

46
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,360
I'll go take care of other things then.

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,890
Go ahead.

48
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,840
Young Master.

49
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,120
This is seafood porridge I prepared specially for you.

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,320
Try it while it's hot.

51
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Giving me something so fishy early in the morning.

52
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,170
You want me to feel sick all day, don't you?

53
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,090
Take it away.

54
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,520
I'm sorry, Young Master.

55
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,920
I'll remove it right away.

56
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,480
I forgot.

57
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,200
Young Master Sheng'an doesn't eat seafood either.

58
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,660
He's allergic to seafood.

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,360
So...

60
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,920
Can you not eat it or do you just dislike it?

61
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,760
We're twins.

62
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,840
Disliking certain foods or being allergic to them

63
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,900
isn't that normal?

64
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,860
Drop your little schemes.

65
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,020
Don't try to be clever.

66
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,970
And don't test my patience.

67
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,960
Understood, Young Master.

68
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,020
I'll make something else right away.

69
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you satisfied with this package?

70
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,240
What is this?

71
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,370
Western breakfast.

72
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,560
Since you don't like Chinese breakfast,

73
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,120
you must like Western food, right?

74
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,320
Here, let me feed you.

75
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,040
You...

76
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,400
How is it?

77
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,920
Do you like it?

78
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,360
I love it.

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,480
What are you doing?

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Don't you want to know who tried

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,960
to harm me at the banquet?

82
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,320
There must be my uncle's spy in this house.

83
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,020
I didn't say it was you.

84
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,300
Why so nervous?

85
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you want

86
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,520
to join me

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,730
in catching the spy?

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,400
At this hour,

89
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,140
Uncle, shouldn't you be busy at the company?

90
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,770
Why do you have time to visit the family house?

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,400
I promised Grandmother

92
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,080
that I would take good care of you.

93
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,920
These are the group's upcoming key projects.

94
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,720
I brought them for you to review.

95
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,220
Should I say thank you?

96
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,360
Shengze,

97
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,560
you seem to have injured your leg saving Qiao Wan at the banquet.

98
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,620
Are you better now?

99
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,200
Uncle,

100
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,440
I'm perfectly fine.

101
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,560
My health is good.

102
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,480
Saving someone was just a simple gesture.

103
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
No need for your concern.

104
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,520
Young Master,

105
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,380
there's an agreement that needs-

106
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,880
Oh, Second Master is here too.

107
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,610
Uncle Chang,

108
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,810
my uncle isn't an outsider.

109
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,840
Go on.

110
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,080
The transfer agreement for Wendali Garden area

111
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,720
has been drafted

112
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,180
and needs your signature for confirmation.

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,930
What's wrong? Are you okay?

114
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,920
I'm fine.

115
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,480
It's all red from the burn.

116
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,440
What if it leaves a scar?

117
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
I'll take you to apply some medicine.

118
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,500
Hey, Young Master!

119
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm busy right now.

120
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,530
Put it on my desk.

121
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,840
Sir,

122
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,540
make yourself at home.

123
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,600
When did they become so close?

124
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,760
I don't know.

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,340
Isn't that land at Wendali Garden

126
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,440
under the old lady's name?

127
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
I'll find a way to get the agreement.

128
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,120
No.

129
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
They've started to make their move.

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,600
We're already one step behind.

131
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,730
Take me to his study.

132
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,170
This way.

133
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,200
Mr. Sheng, don't.

134
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,640
Uncle.

135
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,000
Qiao Wan and I haven't even started yet.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,760
Why are you barging in here all worked up?

137
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,680
What do you want?

138
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,160
You're being too loud.

139
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,240
I could hear you from downstairs.

140
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,370
It's disturbing me.

141
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,620
That's enough.

142
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,400
What?

143
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,600
You're upset because I kissed her, aren't you?

144
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,530
I'm warning you.

145
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,640
She's mine.

146
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,010
She'll be mine forever.

147
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,840
It's not certain who she belongs to.

148
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,800
But I've really underestimated you.

149
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,930
You've got more guts than that useless brother of yours.

150
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,920
Enough!

151
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,320
Mr. Sheng,

152
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,120
let me take you out first.

153
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,930
This is the first time I've seen

154
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,040
you so out of control that you've forgotten what you should be doing.

155
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Everything the old lady transferred to Sheng Ze,

156
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,440
whether it's shares or real estate,

157
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,700
I will take it all back.

158
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,480
Your neck.

159
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
So this is the favor you asked me for.

160
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,120
Young master,

161
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,360
the mole has been confirmed.

162
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,220
It's Feng Jing.

163
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,060
We lured her out with just one agreement.

164
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,600
It seems she was also the one who bugged the phone.

165
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,760
I'll detain her immediately.

166
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,960
Keep her around for now.

167
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,290
She'll be useful later.

168
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,440
But she works for Sheng Huaijing.

169
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,370
Keeping her around will only harm us with no benefit.

170
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,840
The more dangerous someone is,

171
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,720
the more we need to keep them under our watch.

172
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,040
Let's see what tricks she can pull.
