1
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,530
Why are you here?

2
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,640
Aren't you afraid Sheng Ze will suspect you?

3
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,520
What did you make me do to Sheng An?

4
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,130
Only now you remember to ask me?

5
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,960
That day,

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
you asked me to give Sheng An sleeping medicine.

7
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,800
I foolishly trusted you.

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,080
What did you do after I left?

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,800
Oh, right.

10
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,800
I was also behind the wheelchair incident.

11
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,259
You're insane.

12
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,729
Yes, I am insane.

13
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,360
That's why I let you use me like this.

14
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
You want to rebel?

15
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,400
Fine.

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,860
Who do you think is saving your mother right now?

17
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,160
Sheng An.

18
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
I've only come to confess to you now.

19
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,600
You must hate me.

20
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,800
I don't want to do rehabilitation anymore.

21
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,320
That won't do, young master.

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,200
The doctor said

23
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,400
there's definitely a chance for you to stand again.

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
As long as there's even a glimmer of hope,

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,920
we can't give up.

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,720
Hope.

27
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,400
If my uncle finds out my legs are better,

28
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,700
he definitely won't let me go.

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,680
Wanwan.

30
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,640
What's coming will be a fierce battle.

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,540
I can't drag you into this.

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,260
I'll help you leave first.

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,330
I'll come find you after I've sorted everything out.

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,320
Trust me.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,060
The world is so big.

36
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,560
You can go wherever you want,

37
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,760
do whatever you want.

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,770
Would you let me support you with my paintings in the future?

39
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,440
I'm sorry, young master.

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,079
Hello?

41
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,170
Qiao Wan.

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,660
How is my mother doing?

43
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Your mother's condition isn't looking good.

44
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,400
We can't determine the cause,

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,680
and the medications aren't working.

46
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,040
Then I'll go see her right away.

47
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,520
There's no point in you going.

48
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,250
Don't worry.

49
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,450
I'll find the best doctors to save her.

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,120
Wanwan,

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,080
you won't betray me,

52
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,840
will you?

53
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,000
Young master.

54
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,600
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,380
I was deceived by Sheng Huaijing for so long.

56
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,400
If I hadn't answered that phone call then,

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,690
the villains wouldn't have had the opportunity.

58
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,000
All this time, I've been numbing myself,

59
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,900
avoiding these memories.

60
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,600
I regret it so much.

61
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,840
Sheng An.

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
I'm truly sorry.

64
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
I will definitely avenge you.

65
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,920
It's over.

66
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,760
I cried all night

67
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,090
and my eyes are swollen.

68
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,680
Young Master.

69
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,340
You're up early today.

70
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,560
There are ice cubes in the fridge.

71
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,440
Oh, thank you.

72
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
I meant I want ice in my coffee.

73
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,440
I see.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,360
I've made soup as well.

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,680
Hot!

76
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,400
Conditioned reflex.

77
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,400
I don't usually lose my composure.

78
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,600
Please.

79
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,120
Thank you both for coming all this way.

80
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,000
The share transfer agreement from the old lady to Sheng Ze

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,159
Please keep it safe.

82
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,560
Please rest assured,

83
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,760
our law firm will keep it secure.

84
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,820
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

85
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,159
Go ahead,

86
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,680
please.

87
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,840
Let's go downstairs first.

88
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,170
Sure.

89
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,200
After you.

90
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,280
I've already bribed the lawyer's assistant.

91
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,080
Find a chance to meet with her.

92
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,520
Replace it.

93
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,000
Mr. Sheng.

94
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,140
Just as I expected.

95
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,500
The old lady has transferred 8% of her family shares

96
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,440
to Sheng Ze.

97
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,040
But even with these 8% shares,

98
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,680
he still can't surpass us.

99
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,640
That old woman

100
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,560
will definitely try everything

101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,090
to help Sheng Ze become CEO.

102
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,450
Such a nuisance.

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,160
The old woman is still quite healthy.

104
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,800
We can only wait.

105
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
Rather than waiting,

106
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,370
we should take the initiative.

107
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,600
Besides, I can't wait.

108
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,480
When someone covets what's mine,

109
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,490
it really pisses me off.

110
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,480
I need to get it back quickly.

111
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,280
Throw her into the sea,

112
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,159
teach her a lesson.

113
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,000
Understood.

114
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,159
But I've heard this person

115
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,799
has a special relationship with Sheng Huaijing from Shengye.

116
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,600
Not someone to mess with easily.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,920
After it's done,

118
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,880
I'll pay triple.

119
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,560
Young Master.

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,040
Qiao Wan is asking for leave to go to church again.

121
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
Approve it. Keep it quiet.

122
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,920
I'm relieved to see Mom getting better.

123
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Auntie, thank you for taking care of her all this time.

124
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,560
After all these years,

125
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,320
we've become family.

126
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,440
It's what I should do.

127
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Since my mother fell ill and was dismissed by the school,

128
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,570
we were evicted by our landlord and became homeless.

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,040
You took us in.

130
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,930
I'll never forget that.

131
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,160
Actually,

132
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,840
you should be more grateful to Mr. Sheng.

133
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,440
If Mr. Sheng hadn't continuously donated to our church,

134
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,920
and covered your mother's medical expenses,

135
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,200
and your tuition,

136
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,140
we wouldn't have been able to manage.

137
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,160
Auntie,

138
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,640
was my mother

139
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,080
really sick because of work pressure

140
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,360
as they say?

141
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,000
Whatever the reason,

142
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,440
let the past be the past.

143
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Your mother's condition is improving day by day,

144
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,200
isn't it?

145
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,240
Auntie, go back and rest early.

146
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,040
I'll come visit you another day.

147
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,540
Be careful on your way.

148
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,080
What are you trying to do?

149
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,840
You idiot,

150
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,880
gag her mouth.

151
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,160
You dare bite me?

152
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,080
Damn it.

153
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,120
What are you standing there for?

154
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,960
Come help me now.
