1
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,050
Aren't you leaving yet?

2
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
If I don't see you,

3
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,280
I won't leave.

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,720
Come here.

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,599
I begged you that day,

6
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,640
but you didn't come.

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,760
Now you regret it?

8
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,680
Qiao Wan.

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,080
What are you really up to?

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,960
I just suddenly realized

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,740
that you and I are the same kind of people.

12
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,160
Wanwan.

13
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,840
Let go!

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,560
Let go of me!

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,730
Sheng Huaijing,

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,640
just try to hurt Qiao Wan and see what happens!

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,600
Release her now!

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,610
You've misunderstood.

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,320
She came to me on her own.

20
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,539
Show him the proof.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,130
Let's end this here.

22
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,370
Don't come looking for me anymore.

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,240
Wanwan!

24
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,200
Qiao Wan!

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,320
Qiao Wan

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,440
I have no patience for you.

27
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,520
Don't play games with me.

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,240
Our relationship

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,560
can develop gradually.

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,200
But given what just happened,

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,280
isn't it more important to make Sheng Ze give up?

32
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,920
I'd like to see

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,490
how you plan to develop our relationship.

34
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Get some rest.

35
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,360
Let me know if you need anything.

36
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
You're locking me in this room.

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,920
How is this different from imprisonment?

38
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,600
Qiao Wan

39
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,200
I lost all trust in you long ago.

40
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,579
You have no right to make demands.

41
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,080
Sheng Huaijing

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,040
Making you face legal judgment

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,320
is the greatest punishment for you.

44
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,680
Young master.

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,930
Uncle Chang.

46
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,250
I know what you're going to say.

47
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,280
You don't need to comfort me.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,840
I don't know what I did wrong.

49
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,090
Was my proposal not formal enough?

50
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,280
Or was it because of Grandmother's objection?

51
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,560
Oh.

52
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
That makes sense.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,800
I treated her so poorly at first.

54
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,440
How could she ever truly like me?

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,240
Young master.

56
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,580
I've been with you for so long.

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,530
This is the first time I've seen you look so pathetic.

58
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
What did you say?

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,320
I mean...

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,480
People's hearts can change.

61
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,100
Sometimes the more you try to hold on,

62
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,519
the more it backfires.

63
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,000
When two people are together at the right time,

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,440
having been happy together is already enough.

65
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,090
When I was working for Sheng Huaijing,

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,960
I figured out the layout of his villa

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
and got the keys.

68
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
The warehouse in the back is used to hold prisoners.

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,020
Uncle Cao must be in there.

70
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,880
I'll go rescue him tomorrow night.

71
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,010
You'll cover for me.

72
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,080
Okay, please be careful.

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,370
What about Sheng Ze?

74
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Are you really not going to tell him?

75
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,200
We women can rescue people on our own.

76
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,360
Eat more.

77
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,360
Are you okay?

78
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Stop right there!

79
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,200
I'll get you!

80
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,440
Mr. Cao!

81
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Run!

82
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,680
If you want to kill them,

83
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,720
you'll have to kill me first.

84
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,960
Qiaowan, you've finally dropped your act, haven't you?

85
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,600
Yes.

86
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,640
I came to find you

87
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,300
specifically to save Mr. Cao.

88
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
You even dare to conspire with Feng Qing.

89
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,210
You've become incredibly brazen.

90
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,680
Haven't you considered?

91
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,840
In my territory,

92
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,720
how could she easily rescue someone?

93
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,040
Let go of me!

94
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,360
Today I'll show you

95
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,100
how the person you want to save

96
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,860
will die right in front of you.

97
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,200
No!

98
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,760
After them!

99
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,320
Stop!

100
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,560
Don't run!

101
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,120
Shengze.

102
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,650
Forgive me for lying to you.

103
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,940
This contains the truth about the car accident.

104
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,480
Take this

105
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,210
and you can avenge your father.

106
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,640
Fate is cruel.

107
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
If I had known it would end like this,

108
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,120
I shouldn't have wasted time

109
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,960
on hating each other.

110
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,540
Instead, I should have shared the same sky with you.

111
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
The same scenery.

112
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,520
Mr. Cao is innocent.

113
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
Why can't you just let him go?

114
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,840
Innocent?

115
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,690
If you take my money, you keep your mouth shut.

116
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I've been merciful enough to spare his life until now.

117
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,560
You're terrifying.

118
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,220
You think this is terrifying?

119
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,800
The worst is yet to come.

120
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,610
Do you like what you see?

121
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,280
Do you remember that day?

122
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,940
The two men who kidnapped you?

123
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,080
I buried them down there.

124
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,520
Look.

125
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,530
The flowers are blooming so beautifully.

126
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,600
I told you before.

127
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,560
Anyone who has ever hurt you,

128
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
I will make sure they die.

129
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
I kept my promise.

130
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,500
But what about you?

131
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,720
Why do you disappoint me again and again?

132
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,520
Sheng Huaijing, you're a monster.

133
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,360
Don't move.

134
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,100
Cooperate nicely.

135
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,280
I've already taken your photos and sent them to the police.

136
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,680
Just wait there quietly.

137
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,360
Mr. Sheng has already called the police.

138
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,760
You should hide quickly.

139
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,440
What exactly do you want?

140
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,120
You and Sheng have teamed up

141
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,580
to put on such a show for me.

142
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,080
How could I not play along until the end?

143
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,920
Hold on.

144
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,800
I'll be right there.
