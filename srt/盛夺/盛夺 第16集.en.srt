1
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
Auntie.

2
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,800
Qiao Wan.

3
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,080
Qiao Wan.

4
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,360
Don't.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,800
Stop.

6
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,920
How fun.

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Don't what?

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,760
Sheng Huaijing.

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,080
I'm begging you, don't shoot.

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,880
Please don't.

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,340
Get up and stand straight.

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,210
Sheng Huaijing.

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,240
Sheng Huaijing.

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,960
I was wrong.

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,440
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
What did you do wrong?

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,960
I shouldn't have betrayed you.

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
I shouldn't have.

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,160
Auntie.

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
Auntie! Qiao Wan!

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,400
Qiao Wan.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,250
Are you okay?

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Are you hurt?

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,880
I'm fine.

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,400
Hey, listen.

26
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,840
Don't you have something to tell Qiao Wan?

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,640
Auntie.

28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,680
Auntie.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,360
How long are you going to keep this from her?

30
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,600
Hatred doesn't fade with time.

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,240
Telling her the truth

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,100
is what's best for her.

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,160
Auntie.

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,920
Qiao Wan.

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,120
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,400
After all this time, I'm finally telling you this.

37
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,880
Your mother didn't suddenly fall ill.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,320
She was driven insane

39
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,040
by the Sheng family, by Sheng An himself.

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,040
What?

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,680
Years ago,

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,400
Sheng An's father was driving with him

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,840
when they had an accident on their way home.

44
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,000
Sheng An's father died on the spot.

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,560
And Sheng An was left disabled because of it.

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Your mother was the only witness at the scene.

47
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,080
But no matter what your mother said,

48
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,200
the Sheng family stubbornly believed

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,600
that she caused the accident.

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,800
So to get their so-called truth,

51
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,560
they tortured your mother into the state she's in now.

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,360
Impossible.

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,240
This can't be true.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,160
I know it's hard for you to accept,

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
but this is the truth.

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
You were just a child then,

57
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,000
so I kept it from you.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,200
I didn't want you to live your life seeking revenge.

59
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,880
After your mother went insane, she was fired

60
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,000
and lost her source of income.

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
You and your mother were forced to live on the streets.

62
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,120
It was Mr. Sheng who,

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,960
taking pity on you,

64
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,940
asked me to take you in behind his family's back.

65
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,079
Now that Sheng An is dead.

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,960
He got what he deserved.

67
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,520
No one in this world dares to betray me.

68
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,160
I really want to put a bullet in you.

69
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,000
Mr. Sheng.

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,360
Please spare Qiao Wan.

71
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,320
She knows she was wrong.

72
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,680
For you.

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,930
I've made exception after exception.

74
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,650
Can't keep her, can't kill her.

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,760
Qiao Wan, oh Qiao Wan.

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,360
Tell me what I should do.

77
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,480
You said

78
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,850
the Sheng family harmed my mother.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,120
Do you have any evidence?

80
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,180
You want evidence?

81
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,890
Go find it yourself.

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,800
Back then, I watched your mother

83
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,360
locked in a dark room for three days and nights.

84
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,920
It was truly miserable.

85
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,240
So

86
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,159
you're only telling me the truth now?

87
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,860
That's what you get for betraying me.

88
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,970
How does it feel?

89
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,050
Working for your own enemy - does it feel good?

90
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,880
Qiao Wan,

91
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,800
you deserve this.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,120
I'm curious

93
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,640
what you're going to do next.

94
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,040
Qiao Wan.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,360
You're finally back.

96
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,680
I was worried sick when President Sheng took you away.

97
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,440
Are you okay?

98
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,720
I'm fine.

99
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:44,920
That's good.

100
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,180
I almost called the young master.

101
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,159
Xiaoyun.

102
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,960
About me going out with Mr. Sheng,

103
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,040
please keep it a secret, will you?

104
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,920
I promise.

105
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,760
The young master is back.

106
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,560
Young master.

107
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,480
I left in a hurry today

108
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,920
and forgot to water the flowers when I got back.

109
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,840
Our plaster won the bid.

110
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Congratulations, young master.

111
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,360
I knew you would succeed.

112
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,540
This is the result of our collective effort.

113
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,760
What's wrong?

114
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Aren't you happy?

115
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,080
You're too kind, young master.

116
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,340
I didn't help you much.

117
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,760
Sir,

118
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,640
your coffee.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,730
Why is it you?

120
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,120
Where's Qiaowan?

121
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,800
Qiaowan said she had something to do

122
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,930
and asked me to bring this to you first.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,480
Wait.

124
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Xiaoyun.

125
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,890
What exactly happened after I left today?

126
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,810
Nothing.

127
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,440
Nothing happened.

128
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
Tell me the truth.

129
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,000
Mom.

130
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,380
I will definitely avenge you.

131
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,690
No matter how long it takes.

132
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,159
Sir!

133
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,040
Sir, something terrible has happened!

134
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,120
Qiaowan is gone.

135
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,480
She only left this letter.

136
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,000
What?

137
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,480
Shengze,

138
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,320
forgive me for hiding this from you yesterday.

139
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm going to the church to find Sheng Huaijing.

140
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,760
This confrontation between us was inevitable.

141
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,090
I don't want to involve you in this.

142
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,480
Wait for me to return.

143
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,480
Young Master,

144
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,000
you must take a look at this information.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,800
I need to go out now.

146
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,680
We'll talk when I get back.

147
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,540
Perhaps after seeing this, you won't want to leave.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,960
The only witness to that car accident from years ago has been found.

149
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,290
It's Qiao Wan's mother.

150
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,400
Qiao Wan said her mother suddenly fell ill.

151
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,260
Now it seems that wasn't the case.

152
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,810
It was probably related to that car accident.

153
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,210
To clarify the cause of that accident,

154
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,280
the Sheng family once invited this witness to their home.

155
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,440
But what happened afterward,

156
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,720
no one ever told me.

157
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,490
I never expected

158
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,960
it was Qiao Wan's mother.

159
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,640
If Qiao Wan finds out about this,

160
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,440
she will definitely seek revenge against the Sheng family.

161
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,970
This is the trap she has set.

162
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,440
Are you still going to jump right into it?

163
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,160
Right and wrong

164
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,440
are still undetermined.

165
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,080
Besides,

166
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,700
even if it is a trap,

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,260
it was prepared for me.

168
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,400
I can't let her wait in vain.

169
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,200
Young Master.

170
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,960
Qiao Wan.

171
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,040
Young master!

172
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,760
I told you not to come here.

173
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,360
Leave now!

174
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,680
You work for Sheng Huaijing, don't you?

175
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,960
I can give you anything you want.

176
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,000
Just let her go immediately.

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,640
Stay back!

178
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,480
One more step

179
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
and I'll kill her.

180
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,120
Fine.

181
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,890
I won't come any closer.

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,680
Don't move.

183
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,560
You know this is my trap.

184
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,220
Yet you still came.

185
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,580
Are you satisfied now?

186
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,160
Wanwan.

187
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,930
Since you already know,

188
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,930
I'll get straight to the point.

189
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,690
I found this in a room at the Sheng mansion.

190
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,610
Could this be

191
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,740
what Sheng Huaijing mentioned as

192
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,160
the dark room where my mother was kept?
