1
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
Everyone says Qiao Wan is with the young master now.

2
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,760
Is that true?

3
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,160
It's just one-sided seduction.

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,920
You can't call that a relationship.

5
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,120
The young master is just playing along.

6
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,680
He's just toying with her.

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
You're talking nonsense.

8
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,040
Qiao Wan isn't that kind of person.

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,160
I was there and saw it with my own eyes.

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,120
Xiaoyun, you're still too naive.

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,840
When judging people,

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,560
you can't just look at the surface.

13
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,289
Understand?

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,039
Xiaoyun.

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,039
Answer me.

16
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,720
You didn't seduce the young master, right?

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,800
Who told you that?

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,440
It doesn't matter who told me.

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,640
I don't want you to do anything foolish.

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,360
Say something!

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,039
She can't answer you

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,759
because she feels guilty.

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,800
She had an ambiguous relationship with Sheng'an before,

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,360
and now she's after my Aze.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,800
She's just a woman who would do anything to climb the social ladder.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,330
What do you mean 'your Aze'?

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,800
Aren't you Sheng'an's fiancÃ©e?

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,280
You!

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,680
Is what Miss Gu said true?

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,000
Xiaoyun, I...

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,840
You shameless woman!

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,920
Miss Gu,

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,060
hitting someone is a serious matter.

34
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,120
I'll teach you for seducing Aze!

35
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,480
An ugly duckling like you dares to aim so high.

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,320
Huh!

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,060
The ugly duckling has turned into a swan.

38
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,840
I'll take that as a compliment.

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,760
Enough!

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,400
Grandmother.

41
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,920
Grandmother, such a shameless woman.

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,280
Do you still want to keep her by Aze's side?

43
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,120
Whether she deserves Xiaoze.

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,960
She knows it herself.

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,840
But it's a fact that she has ruined Xiaoze's reputation.

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,160
I am kind-hearted.

47
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,640
So I'll just punish her to kneel.

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Qiaowan, you kneel right here.

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,960
Don't get up until dark.

50
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,880
Grandma.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,530
You're truly a kind person.

52
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,600
Is that all?

53
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,210
Isn't that letting her off too easily?

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,120
Young Master.

55
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,480
The Madam has ordered Qiao Wan to kneel as punishment for the entire day.

56
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
It's all my fault.

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,890
I was too hasty and caused this situation.

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,120
Please help Qiao Wan, Young Master.

59
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,250
I forced her to do it.

60
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,120
If she doesn't defend herself, who's to blame?

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,920
Xiaoyun.

62
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,079
If you trust someone,

63
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,210
trust them completely.

64
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,240
Young Master,

65
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,570
it's already five o'clock.

66
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,360
Suffering such a great injustice without fighting back

67
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,420
and just taking it.

68
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,409
This isn't like you.

69
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
What else can I do?

70
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,280
If I told the truth,

71
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,820
they wouldn't let it go so easily.

72
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,240
Mr. Sheng heard that Young Master Sheng An hasn't been sleeping well lately.

73
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,840
He's very worried about him.

74
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,980
Give him this sleeping medicine.

75
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,680
Young Master.

76
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,640
Sheng Huaijing,

77
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,080
you used me.

78
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
What did you do?

79
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,560
Why did you suddenly wake up?

80
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,360
It's nothing.

81
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,400
I just

82
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
remembered some old memories.

83
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,720
What memories?

84
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,580
None of your business.

85
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Give it back to me.

86
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,720
Is this scarf important to you?

87
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,650
It's none of your business.

88
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,800
It concerns me now.

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,560
Who are you really?

90
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,930
Who do you think I am?

91
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,480
Since you won't admit it,

92
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,920
I'll verify it myself.

93
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,240
Did you figure it out?

94
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,760
Yes, I did.

95
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,570
You're not Sheng An.

96
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,080
Of course I'm not.

97
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,410
Your kissing is worse than his.

98
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,400
What?

99
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
You must have it backwards.

100
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,680
Come, let's try again.

101
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,610
No need, no need.

102
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,580
Qiaowan, what's with that attitude?

103
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm a really good kisser.

104
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
What are you doing?

105
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,090
Dishes can be washed again.

106
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,970
But rumors can't be taken back.

107
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,240
Yes.

108
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,680
I spread it.

109
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,160
It's not true anyway.

110
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,120
Go prove it yourself.

111
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,240
Why should I have to prove myself?

112
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
Whoever spreads rumors should provide evidence.

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,260
If there's a next time,

114
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,420
I won't let you off.

115
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,840
Qiaowan, you really are...

116
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,520
Don't you want to know why you're so annoying?

117
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,480
No.

118
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,440
You're the one who did something wrong.

119
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,170
You should be the one looking for reasons, not me.

120
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Let me remind you:

121
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,760
Don't make the same mistake again.

122
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,220
While there's still time,

123
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,610
stop what you're doing.

124
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,400
What does she mean?

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,840
Could she already know my identity?
