1
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,240
Young Master Sheng'an.

2
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,090
Open your eyes and look carefully.

3
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,880
Who am I really?

4
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,800
Young Master Shengze.

5
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,260
Please show some respect.

6
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,680
So you finally recognize who I am.

7
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,210
My brother was just buried.

8
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,120
And you couldn't wait

9
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,800
to climb into my bed.

10
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,479
I didn't.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,479
I just woke up here.

12
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,740
I don't know anything.

13
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,280
Last night,

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,440
I think I saw Sheng'an.

15
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,880
He was running away

16
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,759
when he was attacked.

17
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,340
That's what happened.

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,080
Tell me more.

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,540
This Sheng'an you saw,

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,080
was he alive or a ghost?

21
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,600
Stop pretending to have a headache.

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
I'm not pretending.

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm telling the truth.

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,000
Whether you believe me or not,

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,130
I will find out the truth about what happened last night.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,960
Right now,

27
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,400
you're the prime suspect in Sheng'an's incident.

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,280
Be careful.

29
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,880
Don't implicate yourself in your investigation.

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,000
Is what she said true?

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,040
Yes, madam.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,000
Qiao Wan goes to church to pray every month.

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,850
This time was no different.

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,530
She also asked for my permission as usual.

35
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,640
I heard that

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,200
you're the only one who takes Sheng An to the garden for walks.

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,280
How is it that as soon as you're gone,

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,740
something happens to him?

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,560
Mrs. Wang.

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,120
Kneel down.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,680
You all

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,240
need evidence even if you suspect me.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,120
If you dare to take the law into your own hands,

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll fight to my last breath

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,840
to ruin the Sheng family's reputation.

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Still so defiant when death is near.

47
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,280
Hold her down.

48
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,920
Second Master.

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,450
I thought you invited me for a meal.

50
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,400
So early in the morning,

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,530
all this fighting isn't appropriate.

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,240
Uncle,

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,800
you don't seem like someone who meddles in others' affairs.

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,640
For the sake of my nephew who died tragically,

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,960
how can I not get involved?

56
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
Huaijing,

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,920
you're actually protecting this harbinger of misfortune.

58
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,800
Mother.

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,480
It's not that I'm protecting her.

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,320
It's just that right now there's no evidence,

61
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,160
and forcing a confession

62
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,090
wouldn't look good if word got out.

63
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,540
How about this?

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,340
I'll take her back with me.

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,480
She'll stay at my place.

66
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
She wouldn't dare to escape anyway.

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,400
Let's go.

68
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,980
Nobody's going anywhere.

69
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,480
She's a suspect.

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,300
And she's also my maid.

71
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
I need to keep an eye on her at all times.

72
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,400
To prevent her from conspiring with villains to harm my family again.

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,720
Since when did she become your maid?

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,040
Grandma.

75
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,800
No.

76
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,920
She has already harmed Sheng An.

77
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,130
If she dares to make any rash moves,

78
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,740
I'll be the first to turn her in to the police.

79
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,409
Oh well, never mind.

80
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,360
Ever since you came back,

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,920
I've been determined to make it up to you.

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,000
Once Sheng Ze joins the board,

83
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,080
you'll need to support him well.

84
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,200
Don't worry,

85
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,120
I'll definitely support him properly.

86
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Uncle,

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,930
please look after me in the future.

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,160
Last night,

89
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,760
Someone was drinking here.

90
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,240
Morning.

91
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,480
By the way, Feng Qing.

92
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,680
Did you hear

93
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,840
any strange sounds last night?

94
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,120
What did you hear?

95
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,200
A woman's scream.

96
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
It was pretty creepy.

97
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,520
Do you think it could be haunted?

98
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,159
Hello.

99
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,200
Hello.

100
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,520
This is Dongdao Sanatorium.

101
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
Is this Mr. Sheng Ze's residence?

102
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,880
Yes. What can I do for you?

103
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,240
Mr. Sheng Ze

104
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,360
left something in the drawer of his hospital room.

105
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,520
What is it?

106
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,400
It seems to be an envelope.

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,720
Please leave it where it is.

108
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,450
I'll send someone to pick it up.

109
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,320
Get the car ready.

110
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,000
We're going to Dongdao Sanatorium.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,530
Yes, sir.

112
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,930
They've already heard.

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,170
What do we do now?

114
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,680
Whatever it is,

115
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,960
we need to get it

116
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,320
before he does.

117
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,480
You did this, didn't you?

118
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,080
What is this?

119
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,920
I don't know.

120
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,640
Stop pretending.

121
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,850
I saw you meeting with my uncle at the funeral.

122
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,400
The word 'spy' is written all over your face.

123
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,760
At the funeral, Mr. Sheng and I were just having a normal conversation.

124
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,040
Young master, you need solid evidence for everything you do.

125
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Is that so?

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,760
Then come with me to Dongdao Sanatorium.

127
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,560
Prove your innocence yourself.

128
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,720
Young master.

129
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,960
Wait.

130
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,080
That nurse is calling you.

131
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,960
Uncle.

132
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,160
Are you looking for this?

133
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,000
Then tell me.

134
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,760
What's inside?

135
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,720
What's in the envelope

136
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,780
is obviously a letter.

137
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,490
All these years while I was bedridden,

138
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,720
whenever I was conscious, I studied medical formulas.

139
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,960
I dare not forget my father's instructions,

140
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,200
nor dare I forget

141
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,260
the original purpose of our company.

142
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,560
And you?

143
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,440
What have you done?

144
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,760
I think lying in bed has damaged your brain, hasn't it?

145
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,680
I'm a businessman,

146
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,080
not a philanthropist.

147
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,160
With your father's theories,

148
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,360
the company would have gone bankrupt long ago.

149
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,240
Fortunately, he died early.

150
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,840
Shengye's success today -

151
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
you should really thank me for that.

152
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,400
Mr. Sheng.

153
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,480
Shengze must have come prepared.

154
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,040
We can't be sure if that letter is genuine or fake.

155
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,400
He's eager to prove his identity to convince me,

156
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,120
so let's play along with him.

157
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,000
I should have dealt with that half-dead Shengze

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,130
from the beginning.

159
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,840
I was careless.

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,880
Put it down.

161
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,720
How dare you!

162
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,560
Touching my things.

163
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
What secret is hidden in this letter

164
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,170
that makes you point a gun at me?

165
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,080
Or perhaps

166
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,580
you don't know either.

167
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,060
You really think I won't kill you?

168
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,920
Young master, I was wrong.

169
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,120
I shouldn't have looked at your things.

170
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,080
But

171
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,920
I just helped you deceive Mr. Sheng.

172
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,650
Doesn't that

173
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,160
prove my loyalty?

174
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,640
You'd better think carefully

175
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,120
about how to get back.

176
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,760
What does he mean?

177
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,240
We're done for.

178
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,520
1 hour and 27 minutes.

179
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
Not bad. Faster than I expected.

180
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Thank you for the compliment, young master.

181
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,360
Young master.

182
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,040
Any other surprises?

183
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,520
Just tell me everything.

184
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,200
No rush.

185
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,120
Let me think about it slowly.

186
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,560
Shengze.

187
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,280
Who are you really?

188
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,520
Why did you happen to appear

189
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,180
right after young master Sheng'an's death?

190
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,680
What secrets are you hiding?

191
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,160
I will definitely find out.
