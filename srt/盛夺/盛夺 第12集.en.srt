1
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
You two come with me.

2
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,280
The rest take the stairs.

3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,480
We must find Qiao Wan.

4
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,800
If anyone tries to stop us,

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,860
you know what to do.

6
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,680
Yes.

7
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,080
Go hide first.

8
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
I'll deal with them.

9
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,600
No.

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,460
I can't let you take that risk.

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,600
The lovebirds can't even wait.

12
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,840
Here.

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,360
I've got it covered for you.

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,890
Carry on, please continue.

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,280
Did you find them?

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,800
No.

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,210
Then hurry up and go!

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,640
Let's go.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,729
So this is your brilliant plan?

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,120
What else?

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,920
Do you have a better idea?

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,690
I just know you've kissed me multiple times on your own initiative.

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,090
If this is your way of making it up to me,

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
feel free to do it more often.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,800
You're overthinking it.

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,360
It was just necessary under the circumstances.

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,080
Let's go quickly.

28
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,340
They'll catch up soon.

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,880
Damn it.

30
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,200
Young Master,

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,000
are you hurt?

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
Don't worry, I'm fine.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,440
Young Master, you're finally back.

34
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,320
Why are you here again?

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,720
Yes.

36
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,160
Qiao Wan has not only returned.

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,490
From now on, she's my personal secretary.

38
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,800
None of you can order her around anymore.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,600
Is that clear?

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,480
Let's go.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,600
But the old lady has already fired her.

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,440
If the old lady wakes up,

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,040
Mrs. Wang.

44
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,850
Grandmother was saved by Qiao Wan.

45
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,770
Were you serious about what you just said?

46
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,620
Of course I was.

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,610
Secretary Qiao.

48
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,840
Please take a look at this document.

49
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,280
Tomorrow at the board meeting,

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,610
Sheng Huaijing will likely put me in charge of this project.

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,260
This...

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,170
Just to prevent you from taking over Shengye?

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,360
Such a big project.

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Are you confident you can handle it?

55
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,900
This project means a great deal to me.

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,170
I must secure it.

57
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,960
Everyone.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Our Shengye company has been having one good news after another lately.

59
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,840
This pharmaceutical tender from Daoto International Medical Group

60
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,570
is one we're determined to win.

61
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,079
And most importantly,

62
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,800
our young master Shengze has returned.

63
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,490
Young Master Sheng,

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,320
on behalf of the board, I warmly welcome you.

65
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,320
Welcome.

66
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,080
There's nothing else to discuss,

67
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,320
so I'll head out now.

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,160
Shengze has returned to help develop the group.

69
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,279
As his uncle, I certainly welcome this.

70
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,120
But Shengze,

71
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,840
don't take this personally,

72
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,480
you have no management or decision-making experience,

73
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,720
yet you want to join the board right away.

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,760
Even if I agree,

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,370
the other board members

76
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,880
won't immediately approve, will they?

77
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,320
Isn't that right, Director Lin?

78
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,040
Though we should promote talent regardless of relation,

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,440
you must have real ability first.

80
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,320
Young Mr. Shengze lacks experience

81
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,500
and would struggle to gain everyone's respect.

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,560
Everyone,

83
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,080
I accept all your doubts,

84
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
but please give me a chance to prove myself.

85
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,400
Very well,

86
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,080
since Shengze has asked,

87
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,360
this pharmaceutical bidding project

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,290
will be your full responsibility.

89
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,300
How about that?

90
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,680
Shouldn't Director Lin be responsible for the bidding project?

91
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Yes, indeed.

92
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,320
This puts Director Lin in an awkward position.

93
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,200
Mr. Sheng,

94
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,760
this is our key upcoming project.

95
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,960
If we fail to win the bid,

96
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,520
who will take responsibility?

97
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,440
That's right, Mr. Sheng,

98
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,600
this project is no child's play.

99
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,240
Young Mr. Shengze has no experience,

100
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,080
I'm afraid...

101
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,720
No, no.

102
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,520
What makes you so sure Shengze can't handle it?

103
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,240
With such big talk,

104
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,920
if you fail,

105
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,120
will you take responsibility?

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,720
I...

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,200
I accept.

108
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,680
And I will definitely win this bid.

109
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,880
Our competitors

110
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,920
are all top pharmaceutical companies in the country.

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,200
What makes you think you can win?

112
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
If I fail,

113
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,409
I'll never return to the board.

114
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,080
Deal.

115
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,640
You seem very confident.

116
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,490
That's reassuring to hear.

117
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,880
I'd like all the board members to witness this.

118
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,520
I agree.

119
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,000
Director Lin.

120
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,840
I won't let any of you down.

121
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,760
If there's nothing else,

122
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
I'll be going now.

123
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,220
Hey, Sheng.

124
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,280
Since Shengze will be solely responsible for this project,

125
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,610
let me be clear upfront.

126
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,940
If anyone uses the bidding process as an excuse to help him privately,

127
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,890
I absolutely will not tolerate it.

128
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,010
Is that understood?

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,260
Then I'll wait and see.

130
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,520
Mr. Sheng.

131
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,330
What's going on?

132
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,800
Uncle.

133
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,160
Staring at my personal secretary like that

134
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,490
is quite rude, isn't it?

135
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,800
Personal secretary?

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,530
No wonder you two were avoiding me yesterday.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,530
So she's become your personal secretary now.

138
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,540
Are you playing me?

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
Uncle, you must be mistaken.

140
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,290
We only met at the hospital yesterday.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,240
I just want to tell you

142
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,280
that Qiao Wan is mine.

143
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,140
As long as I'm here,

144
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,690
no one should have any ideas about her.

145
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,480
We have this kind of relationship.

146
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,320
Maybe even more intimate.

147
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,620
Do you understand?

148
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,530
Secretary Qiao.

149
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,330
Let's go.

150
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,080
Mr. Sheng.

151
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,860
We can't trust this Qiao Wan anymore.

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,760
Mr. Sheng,

153
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,680
pawns that need to be sacrificed

154
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,800
should be discarded without hesitation.

155
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,240
Isn't that what you always tell me,

156
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,000
Mr. Sheng?

157
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,920
I've been too lenient with you lately.

158
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,380
Now you're trying to teach me how to do my job.

159
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Whether she's a useful pawn or disposable piece,

160
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,170
that's for me to decide.

161
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,480
Yes.

162
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,580
Although Shengze's leg doesn't have a scar,

163
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,130
we can't completely rule him out as a suspect.

164
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Have someone continue the investigation.

165
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,930
Understood?

166
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,640
Yes.

167
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,160
You took over the bidding case yourself.

168
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,690
You must have a plan, right?

169
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,620
No, I don't.

170
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,080
None at all.

171
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,480
Then how dare you agree?

172
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,280
You know he wants to use this opportunity

173
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,520
to kick you out of the board.

174
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,980
I have you, that's enough.

175
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,419
You'll help me, right?

176
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,650
Secretary Qiao.

177
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,050
Uncle Chang.

178
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,640
How's it going?

179
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,370
Have you reached Director Lin?

180
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,570
Can't reach him.

181
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
I expected this.

182
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,760
Director Lin is deliberately avoiding me.

183
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,820
The board meeting made it clear where everyone stands.

184
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,280
Director Lin is the second largest shareholder of the group.

185
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,800
His people have always been in charge of the related business.

186
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,330
Getting his support would help us win the bid.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,400
That's why he's even less likely to help me.

188
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,920
This was originally his project.

189
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,480
Wait.

190
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,920
Young master.

191
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,920
You just said the board has already taken sides.

192
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,560
Who's standing with you?

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,040
Mr. Sheng is here.

194
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,280
You wanted to see me?

195
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,000
Drink up.

196
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,800
Eat it.
