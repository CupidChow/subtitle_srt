1
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,240
Hey, Taek. Hey, Taek.

2
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,360
Good timing.

3
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,680
Your maid

4
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,600
She pushed me and threatened me.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,160
Just out of jealousy?

6
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,640
Am I Sung-hwa's fiancee?

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,650
Did you push her?

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:55,920
Yes.

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,170
Apologize to her. Okay.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,400
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,160
How is it?

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,240
Can you get up?

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,360
No.

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,140
Hold me.

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,680
Oh, right.

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,500
That plate is specially made.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,120
It's not expensive.

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,680
RMB 100,000, please. RMB 100,000, please.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,080
Uncle Chang will ask you for compensation.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,039
What?

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,080
100,000 won.

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,039
Taek.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
How could you do this to me?

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,720
Come here.

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,120
What are you doing, Young Master?

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,759
A slap and a date?

27
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,120
I can't take it.

28
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,240
I'll do it myself.

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,660
Why should I believe that?

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,760
a person who can't even take care of himself

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,920
can take care of me.

32
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,920
The police will be here soon.

33
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,160
You have to cooperate with the interrogation.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,730
Have you figured out what to do?

35
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,040
At this point,

36
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
do you still think

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,920
I killed Sheng Xi?

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,800
You know very well.

39
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,200
What's wrong? Are you scared? Are you scared?

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,060
Are you scared?

41
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
What's there to be afraid of?

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,890
I didn't do anything wrong.

43
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,120
Miss Qiao,

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,920
We have a few questions for you.

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,320
Please answer honestly.

46
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,079
Okay.

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,840
I heard you're the closest person to Sung-hwa.

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,540
Is there anything unusual about him?

49
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,440
Yes.

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Young Master Sung-hwa always has

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,800
a serious disdain.

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,760
It's just that he's good at hiding things.

53
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,880
No one noticed.

54
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
On the day of the accident,

55
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
you didn't push him to the back garden

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,890
to the back garden as usual.

57
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,090
You asked for leave.

58
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,200
Sung-hwa went to the backyard alone.

59
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,060
Then something happened, right?

60
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,880
Yes.

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,960
The police found out that

62
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,440
the wheelchair brake failed.

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,880
You're the only one

64
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,760
is you.

65
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,560
You're the one who committed the crime.

66
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,160
Yes.

67
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,820
I touch wheelchair every day.

68
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,080
But I just did a routine check on the wheelchair.

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,600
instead of tampering with it.

70
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,680
I also checked that day.

71
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
No problem.

72
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,600
Ms Qiao.

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,680
Please tell us the truth.

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,839
What should I say?

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,640
First,

76
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,959
I'm not at the crime scene.

77
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,560
Second,

78
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,400
I didn't touch a wheelchair that day.

79
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,520
If you want to suspect me,

80
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,780
Show me your evidence.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,800
We have no choice but to get on the lie detector.

82
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,480
Did you tamper with Young Master Sung-hwa's wheelchair?

83
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:39,960
No.

84
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,680
You want to kill Young Master Sung-hwa?

85
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,210
I didn't.

86
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Who ordered you to do this?

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,520
No one.

88
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,250
I'm not under anyone's orders.

89
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,640
You just mentioned the sadness of Sheng Xi.

90
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,360
Are you implying that

91
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
he has a tendency to commit suicide?

92
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,600
I'm not sure.

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,720
I don't know how Young Master died,

94
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,360
but I will find out the truth.

95
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,520
Young Master Sheng.

96
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,200
We've done as you said.

97
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,080
But I'm curious.

98
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,240
why you made us pretend to be the police

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,300
to act like police?

100
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,760
For an answer.

101
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,680
But I think

102
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
the final result

103
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,810
I'm sure he'll be able to rest in peace.

104
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,760
Yes.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,080
I lied.

106
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,180
I didn't go to the church that day.

107
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,720
I made up my mind

108
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
to confront Sheng Huaijing.

109
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,760
But I didn't expect something happened to you.

110
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,330
Sheng Huaijing.

111
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,280
I will record the evidence that you forced me to kill Sung-kyung.

112
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,800
For my mother and Sung-hwa.

113
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,720
this time,

114
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,890
I won't let you control me anymore.

115
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
Any news from Qiao Wan?

116
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,240
No.

117
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,520
You threatened her

118
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,840
to tamper with the wheelchair.

119
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
But I don’t think she’ll do it.

120
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,400
She already wanted to disobey you.

121
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,320
I don't think Qiao Wan can trust you anymore.

122
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,560
Of course I won't put all my stakes

123
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,240
on a piece.

124
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Hello, Uncle Chang.

125
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,400
What is it?

126
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,660
Something happened to Sung-hwa.

127
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,680
What?

128
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,800
After the accident,

129
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
I had to play along

130
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,280
to deceive Sheng Huaijing.

131
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,600
I killed you.

132
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,700
while stabilizing him

133
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,450
and investigate your real cause of death.

134
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,780
Congratulations.

135
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,540
You're cleared of suspicion.

136
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,400
When necessary,

137
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,640
the car must be changed for Wang.

138
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,880
Qiao Wan.

139
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,600
It's time for you to fight for me.

140
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,080
Doctor.

141
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,200
How is my mother?

142
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,560
Miss Qiao.

143
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,000
Your mother often fainted.

144
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,840
But we can't find out the reason.

145
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,240
I personally think

146
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,440
it's related to the side effects of antipsychotic drugs.

147
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,800
You can't take

148
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,520
these pills.

149
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,680
I'll prescribe medicine for her later.

150
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,040
Okay, thank you.

151
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,000
It's okay.

152
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,480
Your mother's illness

153
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,200
to all hospitals.

154
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,760
I'm the only one who can save him.

155
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,040
How are you going to thank me?

156
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,240
As long as you can cure her,

157
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,640
I won't owe you anything.

158
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,960
That's good.

159
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
He's awake.

160
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,040
Mom.

161
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,160
Mom.

162
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,080
Who are you?

163
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,400
I don't know you.

164
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,210
I'm not your mother.

165
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,960
Don't be afraid.

166
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,520
My baby is here.

167
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:45,960
Go to sleep, baby.

168
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:52,320
There will be a big wolf outside.

169
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,400
Keep all secrets in mind

170
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll take you to your dream.

171
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,760
Grey Wolf!

172
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,560
Don't take my baby away.

173
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,080
No.

174
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,400
It's okay.

175
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,760
It's okay.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,640
Qiao Wan.

177
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,240
Old Madam has agreed to let you stay.

178
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,000
Uncle Chang.

179
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,720
Should I say thank you?

180
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,000
The police proved you

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,080
to clear your name.

182
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,210
This is a good thing.

183
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,800
From now on, serve him as much as you can.

184
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,520
What about Young Master Sung-hwa?

185
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,160
Who will prove his innocence?

186
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,720
If he died for no reason,

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,730
will he be able to rest in peace?

188
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,000
I've been with Young Master Sheng Xi for so long.

189
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,600
He had a hard life.

190
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
It's a relief for him

191
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,920
to leave like this.

192
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,680
The dead can't come back to life.

193
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,050
We have to look forward.

194
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,300
You all want to forget him.

195
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,480
But I won't.

196
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,450
I will find out the truth

197
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,920
and avenge him.

198
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,320
Young Master.

199
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,760
Qiao Wan is very determined.

200
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,480
It seems that we must find out the truth.

201
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,320
Fine.

202
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,920
Let her investigate.

203
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,680
The show is about to start.

204
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,940
But she's still Sheng Huaijing's woman.

205
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,360
Aren't you afraid she'll tell her?

206
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,840
You should tell her.

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,120
Then Sung Huaijing will show his fox tail.

208
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,760
But this woman

209
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,480
is a liar.

210
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,250
She's very cunning.

211
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,280
What does she want?

212
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,730
I'm worried that

213
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,040
it's too dangerous to fake death to be reborn.

214
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,200
We must be careful every step we take.

215
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,760
Young Master.

216
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,970
Qiao Wan asked me to take a day off to church tomorrow.

217
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,920
I'm ready.

218
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,560
Don't worry.

219
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,600
We'll wait for tomorrow.

220
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,040
Did she notice anything unusual?

221
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,680
No.

222
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,120
She would never have thought

223
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,450
your leg has recovered.

224
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,080
We can take this opportunity

225
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,600
to start our first plan.

226
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,800
Even if they suspect us,

227
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,360
it's too late.

228
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,760
In the future,

229
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,520
in this world.

230
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,660
Only with secrets.

231
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,240
with secrets.

232
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,560
Sung-hwan.

233
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,160
I’m leaving.

234
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,840
Don't be sad.

235
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,120
There are too many regrets in this life that can't be realized one by one.

236
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,120
You have to pull yourself together.

237
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,560
Live on for me.

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,130
and lead Sheng-hyuk to the right path.

239
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,730
We'll be brothers in our next life.

240
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,100
Let me protect you from the wind and rain.

241
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,080
I will fulfill my father's last wish.

242
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,080
and my brother's wish.

243
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Next,

244
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
will be a tough battle.

245
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,280
Uncle Chang.

246
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,080
Young Master.

247
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,160
Master Sheng saved me

248
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,880
to save me, an orphan.

249
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,770
Without him, there's no me.

250
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,600
My loyalty to the Sheng family...

251
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,720
to you.

252
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,000
my loyalty to you.
