1
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,240
Qiao Wan

2
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,880
Everything is back on track now.

3
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,360
Stop pursuing my fiancÃ©.

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,380
Uncle Chang, please show her out.

5
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,520
I asked her to come.

6
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,760
Grandma.

7
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,560
Xiaoze.

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,040
I've decided.

9
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,120
Pick a date

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,200
and marry Nannan as soon as possible.

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,280
Grandma.

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,440
I won't marry anyone but Qiao Wan in this lifetime.

13
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,880
No one but her.

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,200
Do you know

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,880
your father died trying to avoid her mother?

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,360
That mother and daughter

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,320
are the curse of our Sheng family.

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,039
Are you still so unrepentant?

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,600
How my mother went insane,

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,760
you know better than anyone.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,720
Shengze.

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,759
Can you see clearly

23
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,200
what this woman's intentions are?

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
The truth of what happened back then

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,259
is not that simple.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,729
Qiao Wan and I will uncover the truth together

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,300
and clear the name of those who were wronged.

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,600
Let's go.

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,960
Unless I'm dead,

30
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,800
otherwise,

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
you two will never be together.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,960
Shengze,

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,020
you can't escape our engagement.

34
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,640
Grandmother,

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,680
look at him.

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,560
Shengze won't even listen to Grandmother.

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,480
I'll have to win him over myself.

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,880
Sleeping deeply, aren't you?

39
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,680
It seems

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
the drug is working.

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,680
Yan San?

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,720
Why is it you?

43
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Where's Shengze?

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,760
Why are you wearing Qiao Wan's clothes?

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,280
You...

46
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,920
Actually, you're not bad yourself.

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,760
I'll take what I can get.

48
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,720
Why pretend to be someone else?

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,800
Don't touch me!

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,880
Don't be shy.

51
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,880
Get away!

52
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,960
Keep me company for a while.

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Help!

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,680
Shengze, save me!

55
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Stop right there!

56
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,079
Better off dead.

57
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,760
If he wasn't the Sheng family heir,

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,440
would I willingly marry a cripple

59
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
and take care of his every need for life?

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,640
Heaven has helped me.

61
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,920
Now there's an able-bodied Sheng Ze.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,730
I must seize this opportunity.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,460
You had someone record me.

64
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,480
And set me up.

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,680
Stop dreaming about marrying me.

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Think carefully

67
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,960
about how to leave the Sheng family with dignity.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,880
Otherwise,

69
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,960
I'll give the recording to Grandmother

70
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,840
and let her know

71
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,570
what kind of person you really are.

72
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,720
It's useless, Sheng Ze.

73
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,920
Grandmother's words can't be taken back.

74
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,780
You have no choice but to marry me.

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,880
Who said that?

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Grandmother.

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,810
Don't call me Grandmother.

78
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,760
Those disgusting things you did

79
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,280
that almost harmed Shengze.

80
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,899
Did you really think I would let it slide?

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,640
Grandmother.

82
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,640
Didn't you ask me to come here

83
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,520
and say you would arrange

84
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,960
for us to get married?

85
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,920
You're so naive.

86
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,200
I was just using you

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,200
to end his thoughts of marrying Qiao Wan.

88
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,800
My grandson's wife

89
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
won't be Qiao Wan,

90
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,200
and certainly not you.

91
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
Grandmother.

92
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,520
Grandmother.

93
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,720
Mrs. Wang.

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,840
Did you understand what the lady said?

95
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,280
You're no longer useful.

96
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,560
Don't come back again.

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
Grandmother.

98
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,560
I was wrong, Grandmother.

99
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,920
Grandmother.

100
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,380
Please don't send me away.

101
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,440
Grandmother.

102
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,200
Grandmother, I was wrong.

103
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,200
Qiao Wan.

104
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,680
Remember this.

105
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,480
Avenging your mother isn't about reclaiming the past.

106
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,010
It's the reason that has kept you going until now.

107
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,000
Those evil people who haven't been punished,

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,260
especially at the end,

109
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,380
you can't show them any mercy.

110
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,440
Wan Wan.

111
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Why are you here?

112
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,880
You're drunk.

113
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,200
I'm not.

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,920
I just wanted to see you.

115
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,640
I've been suspended.

116
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,840
They call it suspension,

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
but the board is simply removing me.

118
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,300
Congratulations.

119
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,200
But this is far from enough.

120
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,410
Your retribution is still coming.

121
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,210
Do you believe that?

122
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,320
I just realized

123
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,000
that what I wanted most

124
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,520
was there from the beginning.

125
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,360
Wan Wan.

126
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,600
Come here.

127
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,200
Don't look at me like that.

128
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm no worse than Sheng Ze.

129
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,120
The fact that you said it means you've already lost.

130
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,040
Someone like you

131
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
doesn't even deserve to be compared to him.

132
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,970
Sheng Huaijing.

133
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,890
I suggest you turn yourself in.

134
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,820
Don't make more mistakes.

135
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,730
This is the last piece of advice I'll give you.

136
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,440
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

137
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,320
Have a seat.

138
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,370
It's just the two of us here now.

139
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,240
You don't need to pretend anymore.

140
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,120
I came here

141
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,960
to get justice for my mother.

142
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,360
You actually

143
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,200
want to expose everything.

144
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,400
Fine.

145
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,280
I'll tell you.

146
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,280
Yes,

147
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,980
I was the one who locked her in that dark room.

148
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
Why would you do that?

149
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,240
Why?

150
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,800
Does she dare say

151
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,520
she had nothing to do with the accident?

152
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,840
She destroyed my family

153
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,920
and almost confined Sheng Ze to a wheelchair for life.

154
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,240
She deserves to die.

155
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,730
Making her go insane

156
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,000
was actually letting her off easy.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,920
Condemning someone without knowing the facts -

158
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,840
do you realize

159
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,500
what crime you've committed?

160
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,560
So what?

161
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,600
It's been so long.

162
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,080
What can you do to me?

163
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,840
You think just because time has passed,

164
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
your crimes will disappear?

165
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,880
That the hatred in people's hearts

166
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,040
will be forgotten?

167
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,920
Why don't you ask

168
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,800
Sheng Huaijing?

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,120
He'll defend your mother.

170
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,320
After all, when she was locked up,

171
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
he never forgot to bring her food.

172
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,680
What did you say?

173
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,340
Sheng Huaijing also visited that dark room.

174
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,360
What are you doing?

175
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,240
Mrs. Wang!

176
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,679
Mrs. Wang.

177
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,440
What am I going to do?

178
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,820
Of course I'm going to lock you up too.

179
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,650
The suffering my mother went through,

180
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
you should experience it yourself.

181
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,180
That's fair, isn't it?

182
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,240
I didn't drive her insane.

183
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
I only locked her up for a while.

184
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,240
When she was released,

185
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,640
she was already insane.

186
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,640
It's not my fault.

187
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,880
You can't lock me up.

188
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,160
You can't lock me up.

189
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,200
It's me.

190
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,160
It's my fault.

191
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,280
It's all my fault, this old woman's mistake.

192
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,720
Back then, I

193
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,840
was blinded by anger.

194
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,760
I just wanted to teach her a lesson.

195
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,460
I never thought

196
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,960
she would actually go mad like that.

197
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,600
After all these years,

198
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,720
I've been suffering too.

199
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,080
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,540
How are the noodles I made?

203
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
Delicious.

204
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Then I'll have a bite too.
