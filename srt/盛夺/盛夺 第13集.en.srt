1
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,360
What is this?

2
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,400
The director just developed it.

3
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,730
It's supposedly a formula that makes people obey commands.

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm really curious about it.

5
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,970
Why are you doing this to me?

6
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,280
Because you don't listen.

7
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,000
You knew about Qiao Wan leaving but didn't tell me.

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,039
Eat it.

9
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,280
Hey! Take it easy!

10
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,300
You have no respect for women.

11
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,500
Can't you see you've frightened her?

12
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,220
Why are you crying?

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,300
I haven't even used force yet.

14
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,039
No!

15
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,520
Mr. Sheng,

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,320
I was wrong.

17
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,600
I won't dare do it again.

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,720
I won't ever dare again, Mr. Sheng.

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
I was wrong.

20
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,240
I sent you to the Sheng residence to keep an eye on people.

21
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,120
Useless things get thrown away like trash.

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,610
So put away your little schemes

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,220
and don't play tricks.

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,760
Be good and work for me.

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,440
Understand?

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,200
Yes.

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,320
I understand.

28
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,640
Get out.

29
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,250
Sheng Huaijing.

30
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,880
I gave you my whole heart.

31
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,360
Yet you couldn't care less.

32
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,840
You'd kill me for Qiao Wan.

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,640
In the end, I'm the biggest joke.

34
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,040
Fine.

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,440
I'll show you.

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,760
The true face of your beloved Qiao Wan.

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,180
Manager Zhang.

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
Our young master has only you now.

39
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,060
Please, you must help him.

40
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,210
Yes, indeed.

41
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,480
Of course I know that.

42
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,120
I'm risking getting cut off by Mr. Sheng

43
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,400
just to see you.

44
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,560
But...

45
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,400
But what?

46
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,800
I originally knew many

47
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,120
reputable clinical doctors in the industry.

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,560
But later when they heard about endorsing our Shengye,

49
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,480
they all backed out.

50
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,040
I'm guessing

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,120
Mr. Sheng probably put pressure on them.

52
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,380
I never thought

53
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,080
my uncle would go so far

54
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,290
to prevent me from winning the bid.

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,440
The current situation doesn't look good.

56
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,159
If no one in all of Niga is willing to help,

57
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,080
we'll have to seek outside assistance.

58
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,250
Young Master Ze,

59
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,940
it shouldn't be difficult for you to find connections, right?

60
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,520
Hello, Professor Bai,

61
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm Qiao Wan.

62
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,700
I have a favor to ask of you.

63
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,760
You're saying that medical scientist Bai En was your university professor?

64
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,480
Yes.

65
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,280
I've already contacted Professor Bai.

66
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,120
When I was studying at National University,

67
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,480
I worked as an assistant in his laboratory.

68
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,680
Although he's retired and living abroad,

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,720
if we can persuade him to help us,

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm confident we can win the bid.

71
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,400
Judging by your expression,

72
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,720
you seem quite confident about getting Professor Bai on board.

73
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,600
I'll do my best.

74
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,659
Let's give it a try.

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,980
Hello, Professor Bai.

76
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,600
About what I mentioned to you

77
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,730
last night, have you thought about it?

78
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,960
Well, Qiao Wan...

79
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,800
As you know,

80
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,120
I'm already retired abroad now.

81
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,760
I don't want to get involved with work anymore.

82
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
Professor Bai, I understand.

83
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,280
Asking for your help like this

84
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,740
is indeed inappropriate.

85
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,220
But I sincerely hope you'll consider it.

86
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,120
This bid is extremely important to my friend.

87
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,700
Hello, Professor Bai.

88
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,640
I'm Sheng Ze.

89
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
I've long admired your reputation.

90
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,560
Sheng Ze...

91
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,280
What's your relationship with

92
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,480
the late artist Sheng An?

93
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,280
Sheng An was my younger brother.

94
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,080
That's such a pity.

95
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,040
I really admire his work.

96
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,960
But his paintings were never for sale.

97
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,000
If you like,

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,659
I can give you one of Sheng An's remaining works.

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,720
That would be wonderful.

100
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,520
Thank you.

101
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,000
Your father is Sheng Zhenting, right?

102
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,740
You know my father?

103
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,280
I've heard about his work in Nicaragua.

104
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,320
The ointment he developed at a low cost

105
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,320
helped many people overcome insect-borne diseases.

106
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,760
I admire him greatly.

107
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,120
But the current Shengye Group

108
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
seems quite different from before.

109
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,520
Of course.

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,320
At my age,

111
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,880
I'm not qualified to comment on

112
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,800
a large corporation's marketing strategy.

113
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Indeed.

114
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,600
After my father passed away,

115
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,440
the group made significant adjustments to its business strategy.

116
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,170
But I've never forgotten my father's teachings.

117
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,360
This pharmaceutical bidding

118
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,240
is the first step to fulfill my father's last wishes.

119
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,100
Professor Bai.

120
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,720
I know you're a compassionate person.

121
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,159
I sincerely ask for your help this time.

122
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Qiao Wan,

123
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,120
your friend here is really quite bold.

124
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,920
She was too shy to mention it earlier,

125
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,040
but actually I'm her boyfriend.

126
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,320
Qiao Wan,

127
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,920
that wasn't right of you.

128
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,200
Seeing you've found such a good match,

129
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm truly happy for you.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
Why would you keep it from me?

131
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,360
No, Professor, I-

132
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,890
Alright.

133
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,640
Since that's the case,

134
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,520
I have no choice but to help.

135
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,900
This bidding project,

136
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,280
I'll take it.

137
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,440
Really?

138
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,320
Thank you, Professor.

139
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,120
Here's to a pleasant cooperation.

140
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,450
Pleasant cooperation.

141
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't forget the drawing.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
Absolutely.

143
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,360
Can you let go of me now,

144
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,840
boyfriend?

145
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,000
It was all about winning over the professor,

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,799
just playing along with the act.

147
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,679
This is your responsibility,

148
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,440
Secretary Qiao.

149
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,760
You-

150
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,960
Qiaowan,

151
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,690
come with me somewhere.

152
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,360
Be careful.

153
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,010
Let's go now.

154
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,300
It's getting dark.

155
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,480
This is...

156
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,840
When I was young, I loved painting.

157
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,720
My parents were focused on grooming me as their heir

158
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,250
and opposed anything that would distract me.

159
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,020
The butler secretly built this cabin for me.

160
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I would spend hours painting here when I had free time.

161
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,360
I guess this is my secret hideaway.

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,730
Come help me open these paints.

163
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Are you really painting a new piece for Professor Bai?

164
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,480
This might be the last painting I ever create.

165
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,800
I can never go back to my old life.

166
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,920
After all, I still have goals to accomplish.

167
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,080
You once told me

168
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,360
your dream was to be a free artist

169
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,560
and exhibit your work around the world.

170
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,220
After you achieve your goals,

171
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,580
I'll help you fulfill your dream.

172
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,500
What are you doing?

173
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,120
When Pinocchio lies,

174
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,160
his nose grows long and red.

175
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,080
You female liar.

176
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,960
You think I'd still believe your lies?

177
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,360
You...

178
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,040
In this world,

179
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,240
there's no longer an artist named Sheng An.

180
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,840
And you...

181
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,960
Remember your place

182
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,760
and act like a proper secretary.

183
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,560
What's going on?

184
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
The door is locked from the outside.

185
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,200
Someone wants to trap us in here.

186
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,600
Who's trying to harm us?
