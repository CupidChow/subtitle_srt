1
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,120
My patience has its limits.

2
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,760
You think I'll let you take her away?

3
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,060
Don't come any closer.

4
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,960
I'm not worth it.

5
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,880
Whether it's worth it

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,209
is not for you to decide.

7
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,160
No!

8
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,640
Stop hitting him!

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,880
Sheng Huaijing,

10
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,840
I'm begging you,

11
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,520
please let him go.

12
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,490
Sheng Huaijing.

13
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,080
Wake up.

14
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,280
Come on.

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,180
You need to be awake to see yourself become crippled again.

16
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,720
Sheng Ze.

17
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:14,960
Sheng Ze.

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,120
Sheng Ze, please wake up.

19
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,840
Sheng Ze.

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,370
I'm begging you.

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,880
I'll do anything you want.

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,960
Just let him go.

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,680
Stop crying.

24
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,480
He'll die if this continues.

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,440
Sheng Huaijing.

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,770
I'm begging you.

27
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,079
Please.

28
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,360
I beg you.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,120
He's not dead yet.

30
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,920
Even if he dies.

31
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,800
Why are you crying?

32
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
Qiao Wan, I helped you kill your enemy.

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
Why are you crying?

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,240
Mr. Sheng.

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,000
Mr. Sheng.

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,040
Someone reported us for illegal detention.

37
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,079
The police will be here soon.

38
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,560
Get out!

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
You think I'm afraid of the police?

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,520
I...

41
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,200
I knew you wouldn't sacrifice yourself for nothing.

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,000
Shengze!

43
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,920
Shengze!

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,079
Shengze!

45
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,920
Mr. Sheng.

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,560
We should get out of here.

47
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,480
I'm afraid they'll trace us to the medical school.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,340
Don't scare me.

49
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,200
Let's go.

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,760
I'm not leaving.

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,320
Mr. Sheng.

52
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,120
I'm not going.

53
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,360
Since Shengze called the police,

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
they won't give up until they find Qiao Wan.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,680
Let's go.

56
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,160
Come on.

57
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,800
Go.

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,560
Shengze.

59
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,000
It's okay now.

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,600
We'll go home right away.

61
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,800
We'll see a doctor.

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,320
Shengze.

63
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,540
Did you hear what the doctor said?

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,120
If he gets beaten a few more times,

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,780
the young master's legs will be crippled again.

66
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,000
You know very well how good the young master has been to you.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,060
But what about you?

68
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,490
You only bring him misfortune.

69
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,460
If you truly care about the young master,

70
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,160
then disappear.

71
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,530
Only then can he focus on taking down Sheng Huaijing.

72
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,490
Uncle Chang.

73
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,680
I know.

74
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,970
I've let the young master down.

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,320
But I've already promised the young master

76
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,920
that I won't leave him again.

77
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
Suit yourself.

78
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,120
You're awake.

79
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,640
Do you know how scared I was?

80
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,360
You almost didn't wake up.

81
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,980
I was even more afraid.

82
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,220
That I wouldn't see you when I woke up.

83
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,880
I'm glad you're here.

84
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,200
By the way,

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,960
You haven't eaten for so long.

86
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,920
You must be hungry.

87
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,840
I've already prepared something.

88
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,040
I'll go get it for you.

89
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,960
The porridge is a bit bland.

90
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,360
Add some nut powder to improve the texture.

91
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,380
If we could go back to those days when you took care of me.

92
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,460
That wasn't so bad.

93
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,120
That won't do.

94
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,410
Isn't it better that you can stand now?

95
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,480
Besides,

96
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,440
I don't want to take care of you forever.

97
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,840
Living on edge every day.

98
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,240
On edge about what?

99
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,530
Afraid I'd find out?

100
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,080
I've always wanted to ask you something.

101
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,080
I should have been the one pushing your wheelchair,

102
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,200
but I left instead.

103
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,280
And you got hurt because of that.

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,800
Do you still hate me?

105
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,500
Does it matter anymore whether I hate you or not?

106
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,360
I've already gotten what I wanted most.

107
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,920
How long are you going to keep me locked up?

108
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,960
Let me out!

109
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,400
I won't take the medicine.

110
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,880
I won't take it.

111
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
You won't?

112
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,440
If you don't take the medicine,

113
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,680
how can I continue my experiment?

114
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,480
You,

115
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,080
you're all devils.

116
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,760
What you're doing is illegal.

117
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,360
You'll pay for this.

118
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,560
For the world to progress,

119
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,360
someone has to make sacrifices.

120
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,560
You've been chosen as my test subject,

121
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
you should feel honored.

122
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
Take your medicine right now.

123
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,800
Hurry up and take it.

124
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,440
Take it!

125
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,840
Fine.

126
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,360
The old lady transferred 8% of family shares to Shengze.

127
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,320
Plus that 10% of hidden shares,

128
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,420
he now owns 18% of the shares in total.

129
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,120
He's about to surpass us.

130
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,760
But don't worry too much.

131
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,680
We have his personal share authorization letter.

132
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,720
We got his fingerprints.

133
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,880
It won't be easy for him to deny it.

134
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,600
Besides, Qiao Wan also helped at that time.

135
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,400
We're all in the same boat now.

136
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,780
This is getting interesting.

137
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Go invite Director Lin to my office.

138
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,140
Director Lin isn't...

139
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,120
I understand.

140
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,180
I'll go right away.

141
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,760
Okay.

142
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,360
Alright, I got it.

143
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,360
Wanwan.

144
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,920
Take a look at this information.

145
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,000
Shengxin Medical Academy

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,480
suspected of illegally producing and selling unauthorized prescription drugs.

147
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,720
Shengye Foundation is involved

148
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,919
in profit transfers.

149
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,160
My mom is still there.

150
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,160
The rumors about this private hospital aren't baseless.

151
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,090
I've secretly gathered evidence.

152
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,890
I recently discovered that

153
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,520
a newly established foundation under Shengye

154
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,840
made targeted donations to several medical institutions,

155
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,600
including Shengxin.

156
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,560
I suspect Sheng Huaijing

157
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,930
is using the foundation

158
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,880
to fund illegal experiments at Shengxin.

159
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,760
This Sheng Huaijing,

160
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,490
what exactly is he trying to do?

161
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,680
Will my mom be okay?

162
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,000
Wanwan, don't panic.

163
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,600
When I went to Shengxin to rescue you that day, I called the police beforehand,

164
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,120
hoping to find evidence of their crimes.

165
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,000
I've submitted all the evidence I collected to the police.

166
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,120
They just told me

167
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,360
that issuing a formal search warrant

168
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,490
will take some time.

169
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,850
That hospital director

170
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,850
is in cahoots with Sheng Huaijing.

171
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,360
He's also my mom's attending physician.

172
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
What should we do now?

173
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,440
The urgent priority is to get your mother out of there.

174
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,480
While the board meeting is happening tomorrow,

175
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Uncle Chang will take people to Shengxin to rescue her,

176
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
catching Sheng Huaijing off guard.

177
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,320
Shengze,

178
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,400
thank you.

179
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,380
Is there anything I can do to help?

180
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,240
You just

181
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,440
need to stay put.

182
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,370
Listen to me,

183
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,220
just stay where you are

184
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,020
and wait for my news, okay?

185
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,920
Okay,

186
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,760
I'll do whatever you say.

187
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,840
Everyone,

188
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,040
have you all heard the good news?

189
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,840
Young Master Shengze won the bid.

190
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,440
Our Shengye Group's performance is secured for the second half of the year.

191
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,170
Everyone can breathe easy now.

192
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,400
Indeed,

193
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,920
I underestimated Young Master Sheng.

194
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Director Lin,

195
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,760
you should have joined me earlier

196
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,960
in buying his shares.

197
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,960
Yes,

198
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,440
you all underestimated him.

199
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,490
You don't even realize how he's been playing you all.

200
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,780
You're defending him so much,

201
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,770
do you know who he really is?

202
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,060
Should I tell them for you?

203
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,920
No need.

204
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,320
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,300
I've deceived you all.

206
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,160
Actually,

207
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,320
I am Sheng An.

208
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,420
Not only am I alive,

209
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,880
my legs have also been healed.

210
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,810
Is that for real?

211
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,240
His legs are healed too.

212
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,200
The real Shengze is already dead.

213
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,400
He's been impersonating Shengze

214
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,330
and playing this fake death and resurrection trick.

215
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,880
I personally attended Sheng An's funeral.

216
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,960
You first appeared at that funeral.

217
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,480
Now it seems

218
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,600
this was all part of your scheme.

219
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,360
Sheng An,

220
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,720
you just wanted to use your father's will

221
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,980
to take control of the group, didn't you?

222
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,720
Now

223
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,720
Sheng An has returned to himself and signed

224
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,410
promising to give up his seat on the board.

225
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,580
This...

226
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,240
This is indeed Sheng An's signature.

227
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,800
This isn't reasonable.

228
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,970
Not reasonable?

229
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,600
He signed this while fully conscious and willingly.

230
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,240
You can't blame me, Sheng An.

231
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,320
Conscious.

232
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,080
But not willing.

233
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,200
Uncle, have you forgotten?

234
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,360
Documents signed under coercion have no legal effect.

235
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,640
You say I coerced you.

236
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,440
Do you have any evidence?

237
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,300
Manager Zhang,

238
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,520
please play the video I gave you.

239
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,320
Right away.

240
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,160
Tell me.

241
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,340
What will it take to release them?

242
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Sign this.

243
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,960
Promise that you'll never join the board of directors.
