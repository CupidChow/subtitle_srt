1
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,200
Mr. Sheng,

2
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,560
our men are ready.

3
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,480
Tell them not to hurt the woman.

4
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,920
Get out.

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,480
Hurry up.

6
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,360
Move it.

7
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,080
Don't move.

8
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,400
Quickly.

9
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,480
Get out.

10
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,479
Hurry.

11
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,200
Get in.

12
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,479
Your time is up.

13
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,479
Behave yourself.

14
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,120
This was painted by Sheng An.

15
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,890
How come I've never seen it?

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,640
Oh my!

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,920
Mr. Sheng,

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,040
what a coincidence!

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,440
Running into you here.

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,400
Look,

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,480
could you untie me first?

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,680
How could you mess up like this?

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,410
You got the wrong people twice.

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,320
We...

25
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,400
We did stop the car exactly as you instructed.

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,920
Mr. Sheng,

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
it's all a misunderstanding.

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,840
This...

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,660
Shengze...

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,280
That little bastard Shengze!

31
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,160
He forced me to come here.

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,020
I don't know anything about this.

33
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,320
It's just a small favor.

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,880
Relax.

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,740
This is just a small favor.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,120
Everyone knows Mr. Sheng's methods.

37
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
I might lose my life over this.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,280
You're a director of the group.

39
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,740
My uncle knows his limits.

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,360
No way.

41
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,340
Young Master Shengze,

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,020
please find someone else.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,180
If Grandmother finds out you refused to help me,

44
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,610
you'll have a hard time explaining yourself.

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,520
Taking my side for no reason,

46
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,540
Manager Zhang.

47
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,770
You're too obvious.

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,440
Did you think I wouldn't know you're Grandmother's spy?

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,600
Shengze,

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,480
how dare you trick me!

51
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,690
Let's go.

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,640
Hey man, slow down!

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
My legs are still tied!

54
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,120
My leg!

55
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,640
Ouch! Slow down!

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,079
My legs are still tied up!

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,079
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,160
I wasn't careful.

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
I've been exposed after all.

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Being a spy

61
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,320
means accepting the risk of being caught.

62
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,360
I won't blame you.

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,040
Mr. Sheng.

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,000
Please, I'm begging you not to send me away.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll do anything you ask.

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,850
I just want to stay by your side.

67
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,240
Kill you.

68
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,220
Then you won't be able to leave, will you?

69
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,560
You...

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,500
Why are you treating me like this?

71
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,450
Being a spy means being ready to die at any moment.

72
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,480
I only trust the lips of the dead.

73
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,480
Do you know who set up this trap today?

74
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,079
Qiao Wan.

75
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,140
Didn't you ask me to keep an eye on her?

76
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Well, let me tell you.

77
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,120
Your beloved Qiao Wan has been involved with Sheng Ze for a long time.

78
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,240
This is your karma.

79
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,000
Shut up!

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,720
Come on!

81
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,520
Kill me then.

82
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,640
Sheng Huaijing.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,159
Just consider it my own fault.

84
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,440
You don't deserve someone as good as me.

85
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,570
And you'll never have Qiao Wan either.

86
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,000
I've decided not to kill you.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
Dying like this

88
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,240
would be too easy for you.

89
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,810
I'll keep you alive to torture you slowly.

90
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,040
That's more fun.

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,880
Take her away.

92
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,960
Go.

93
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,520
Are you really going to bid at such a low price?

94
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,980
Can you even make a profit?

95
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,040
Winning this bid is just the first step of my strategy.

96
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,120
Low prices to gain market share.

97
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,480
Small profits but high volume.

98
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,140
So more people can access affordable medicine.

99
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,860
Our company's patches will expand beyond Niga.

100
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,120
Providing protection to more patients suffering from insect-borne diseases.

101
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,450
That's my real purpose.

102
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,640
Good.

103
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,130
Your bidding proposal is perfect.

104
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,280
With your data support and endorsement,

105
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,880
I believe

106
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,760
we will definitely succeed.

107
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,040
If your product isn't good,

108
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,400
no matter how eloquently I speak, it won't help.

109
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,920
The strength must come from within.

110
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,520
I'm just

111
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,240
adding a finishing touch.

112
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,040
By the way,

113
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,200
this 'Sailing on Azure Seas' painting

114
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,560
is my favorite work by Sheng An.

115
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,640
Thank you both.

116
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,080
I'll treasure it dearly.

117
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,960
We should be thanking you.

118
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,130
Let's look forward to a successful bid together.

119
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,560
By the way,

120
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,920
Qiao Wan,

121
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,340
when are you two planning to get married?

122
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,000
Professor,

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,480
we're just...

124
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,810
After this busy period,

125
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,640
Once we get through this busy time,

126
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,700
we'll get married.

127
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,200
Great!

128
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,000
I hope the next time I return to China

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,440
will be for your wedding.

130
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,680
We'll certainly try our best.

131
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,410
Absolutely.

132
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,520
Let's go.

133
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,640
You know,

134
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,200
Sheng Huaijing must have fallen for our plan by now.

135
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,240
He would never guess

136
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,800
that we invited Professor Bai to meet at our home.

137
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
Finding an identical car

138
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
and making the switch on the road wasn't difficult.

139
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,920
I just wonder how he'll treat Feng Qing.

140
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,000
You still have time to worry about others?

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
You've been exposed.

142
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,640
From the moment he kept me undercover by your side,

143
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,720
I was determined to uncover the truth

144
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,640
and avenge you.

145
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,320
This day was inevitable.

146
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,180
I'm not afraid.

147
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,320
But you,

148
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,080
your identity can't stay hidden much longer.

149
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,810
Have you figured out what to do?

150
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,240
Not really.

151
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,120
Why don't you help me think of something?

152
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,760
I don't think you need my advice.

153
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,360
You deliberately painted a new picture

154
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,560
and used the kidnapping to deliver it to Sheng Huaijing.

155
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,520
You wanted him to become suspicious of you.

156
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,560
You're already impatient

157
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,200
for him to discover your true identity,

158
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,660
aren't you, Young Master?

159
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,720
I really can't hide anything from you.

160
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,440
From now on,

161
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,140
you must stay within my sight.

162
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,480
Don't act on your own.

163
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,920
And don't hide anything from me.

164
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,600
Understand?

165
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
Young Master,

166
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,880
the doctor says your leg is healing well.

167
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,720
It's almost like normal now.

168
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,840
I never thought

169
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,320
I would stand again after that accident.

170
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,320
Unfortunately, I wasn't working for the Sheng family then.

171
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,160
Otherwise,

172
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,860
I would know the truth behind that accident.

173
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,000
Uncle Chang,

174
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,820
please help me find that witness.

175
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,480
I will.

176
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,679
I'll wait for your good news.

177
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,360
Young Master,

178
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,820
we need to leave for the bidding meeting now.

179
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,520
Wait for me to return.

180
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,000
So hard to forget.

181
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,600
Why are you here?

182
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,260
You shouldn't be surprised to see me.

183
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,180
Don't come any closer.

184
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,240
So afraid of me?

185
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,240
If you haven't wronged me,

186
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,320
why are you so scared?

187
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,400
What do you want?

188
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,410
Didn't you want me to teach you how to use a gun?

189
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,920
I happen to be free today.

190
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,020
Let me teach you properly.

191
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,640
What are you doing?

192
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,680
Don't resist. It's useless.

193
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,300
You know you can't escape.

194
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,360
Let me go!

195
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,160
Qiao Wan was taken away by President Sheng.

196
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,520
What should we do now?

197
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,400
Pick one.

198
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,200
Didn't you want to practice shooting?

199
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,320
What are you doing?

200
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,920
You need a target to practice shooting.

201
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,160
Aim at the target.

202
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,000
Load the gun.
