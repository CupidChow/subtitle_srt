1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,360
Sir, your flowers.

2
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,440
Chief An.

3
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,080
Thank you for taking time

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,960
to attend our young master's memorial service.

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,880
Please accept our condolences.

6
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
This way, please.

7
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,320
I apologize, everyone.

8
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,360
I'm late.

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,400
Nephew.

10
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,240
I am late.

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,760
I couldn't see you one last time.

12
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,880
It's truly heartbreaking.

13
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,640
Mother.

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,729
Please control your grief.

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,650
You must take care of yourself.

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,009
Don't pretend to care like a cat crying over a dead mouse.

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,800
As long as I'm still breathing,

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,479
I will never hand over

19
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,840
the company to an illegitimate son.

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,160
I respectfully call you Mother,

21
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,770
so why must you be so hostile toward me?

22
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,290
Although I'm only 9 years older than Sheng An,

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,160
I am indeed the old man's biological son.

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,520
You wouldn't want

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,250
Shengye to eventually fall into the hands of outsiders, would you?

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,560
Miss Qiao.

27
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,370
You tampered with the wheelchair.

28
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,200
You have an alibi.

29
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,840
The day of the incident,

30
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,500
I took time off to go to church.

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
Your undercover mission is over.

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,200
I'll find time to help you leave.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,880
Save my mother first.

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,260
You're trembling.

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,020
Mr. Sheng, please don't change the subject.

36
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,560
Put this on.

37
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,940
I'll save your mother.

38
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,800
Young master.

39
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,520
You must be my uncle.

40
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,480
Nice to meet you.

41
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,720
I've heard so much about you.

42
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,680
You're alive.

43
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,120
Uncle, you're joking.

44
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,480
I'm Sheng An's brother, Sheng Ze.

45
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,360
You're the one the Sheng family left on East Island to die.

46
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,320
Sheng Ze.

47
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,800
When I first became conscious,

48
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,060
Sheng An came to see me.

49
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,700
He often mentioned a name.

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Called Qiao Wan.

51
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,520
He said

52
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,520
the owner of this name was important to him.

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,460
My brother's body is barely cold,

54
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,680
and you couldn't wait

55
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,560
to hook up with my uncle.

56
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
I'm just kidding.

57
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,159
Why does he look exactly

58
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,690
like Young Master Sheng An?

59
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,040
What's going on?

60
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,480
Have we seen a ghost?

61
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,980
Brother came too late.

62
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,960
Leave everything else to me.

63
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,000
Rest in peace.

64
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,610
I am Sheng An's brother,

65
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,000
Sheng Ze.

66
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,960
I've been recovering on East Island

67
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,900
and never appeared in public.

68
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,920
When I heard about his death,

69
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,570
I came as quickly as I could.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,730
Sorry for startling everyone.

71
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,560
My apologies.

72
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,000
Sheng Ze, that living corpse.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,240
After lying in bed for so many years,

74
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,200
he suddenly recovered.

75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,840
What medical miracle is this?

76
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,040
Or is our Sheng family fortune

77
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,770
attracting all kinds of flies?

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,159
Is our Sheng family so easily fooled?

79
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
How dare I try to fool the Sheng family?

80
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,159
But Uncle,

81
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,220
your nephew has returned.

82
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,480
Why aren't you happy?

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,000
Whether you're an impostor or not,

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,930
we'll know once we open the coffin.

85
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,960
Master

86
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,680
please don't.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,930
Get out of my way.

88
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,080
No.

89
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,360
You're nothing but a servant.

90
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,920
And you dare interfere in my affairs?

91
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,120
Even if I am just a servant,

92
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,400
I am the young master's servant,

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
and I won't allow anyone to disrespect him.

94
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,200
Please show some respect

95
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,640
and let the young master rest in peace.

96
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
What if I don't?

97
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,800
Stop it, you ungrateful son!

98
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,760
I can prove

99
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,360
that he is indeed my grandson.

100
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,480
He's Sheng An's identical twin brother, Sheng Ze.

101
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,040
I'm not trying to gain sympathy.

102
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,520
If I can prove my identity...

103
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,800
Then is this

104
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,280
enough?

105
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,280
My father

106
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,600
before his death

107
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,320
left a secret will.

108
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,640
If I could recover,

109
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,320
then I would

110
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,040
inherit Shengye.

111
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Grandmother, I've been unfilial.

112
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,010
I've returned too late.

113
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,360
It's good to have you back.

114
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,560
You've been through so much these years.

115
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,120
Our Shengye company finally has a successor.

116
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,440
I said get out.

117
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,490
You're Qiao Wan, right?

118
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,880
You're fired immediately.

119
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
You're hurt.

120
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm the 17th one, right?

121
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,600
What?

122
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
The 17th servant you've fired.

123
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,280
You can't even keep track anymore, can you?

124
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,440
Young master, I actually envy you.

125
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,370
You can find your life's purpose in painting.

126
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,640
So don't put too much pressure on yourself.

127
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,520
Just feel it with your heart.

128
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,480
You think you know me well?

129
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,880
Don't be so presumptuous.

130
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,800
You can think I'm being presumptuous.

131
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,400
I just know that health is your greatest asset.

132
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,000
You need to eat properly.

133
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,960
What's this?

134
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
It's nut powder I ground myself.

135
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,280
Nuts are good for the brain.

136
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,680
They might even help you find inspiration.

137
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,960
I don't eat things of unknown origin.

138
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,890
What if you're trying to poison me?

139
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,480
Your hand is injured.

140
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,040
Let me feed you.

141
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,920
Sheng An, I only found out later.

142
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Our meeting was just

143
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,280
a carefully planned setup.
