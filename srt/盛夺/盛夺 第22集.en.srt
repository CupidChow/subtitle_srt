1
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,610
Where are you taking me?

2
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,480
Wait a bit longer. Don't open your eyes.

3
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,360
Wanwan.

4
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,320
Miss Qiao Wan.

5
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,039
Marry me.

6
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,840
Will you?

7
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,640
But...

8
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,160
I've hurt you before.

9
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,620
And I've paid you back.

10
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,650
Aren't you afraid I'll deceive you again?

11
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,440
If you're a liar,

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,000
then I'll be a fool.

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,060
I'm willing to be entangled with you for a lifetime.

14
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,920
This ring,

15
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,560
you must wear it well.

16
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,039
Wanwan.

17
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,850
You won't leave me again, will you?

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,800
What nonsense are you thinking?

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,720
Haven't you already trapped me?

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,199
Although the director has been arrested,

21
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,800
bringing Sheng Huaijing to justice

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,730
won't be so easy.

23
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,840
That director must have leverage against Sheng Huaijing.

24
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,840
He's actually safest with you.

25
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,280
I need to see him.

26
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,320
Okay.

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,079
Then you must be careful.

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,640
When Sheng Huaijing went to see my mother that night,

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,500
was he really just bringing food?

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,079
No.

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,530
It definitely wasn't that simple.

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Hey, Uncle Cao.

33
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,480
Is it convenient to meet now?

34
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,200
The old lady said before my mother went insane,

35
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,720
Sheng Huaijing visited her.

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,360
Uncle Cao,

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400
you must know about this, right?

38
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,520
Qiao Wan, I kept it from you.

39
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,720
Where's the evidence?

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,260
Where's the evidence?

41
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,400
Tell me.

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,160
Where did you hide the evidence?

43
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,640
Come here.

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,490
Voice recorder.

45
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,040
The voice recorder is in...

46
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,800
Butler Cao.

47
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,770
Sheng Huaijing called me at that time.

48
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,080
I didn't dare to stay long,

49
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,640
I just put down the tray and left.

50
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,000
Voice recorder.

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,880
Sheng Huaijing is naturally suspicious.

52
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,640
The next day he found me,

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,840
made me use poor health as an excuse,

54
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,170
and forced me to resign.

55
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,200
I know that all these years,

56
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,920
he's had people secretly monitoring me.

57
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,720
Only after his recent downfall,

58
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,800
do I dare to tell you all this.

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,880
You must quickly

60
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,200
bring him to justice.

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,840
I understand, Mr. Cao.

62
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,700
Please take care of yourself too.

63
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,600
Are you all insane?

64
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,040
How dare you kidnap me!

65
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,920
Shengze.

66
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,120
I advise you

67
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,140
to stop wasting your time.

68
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,640
Even if I die,

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,860
I will never betray Mr. Sheng.

70
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,000
Look at you acting.

71
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Don't worry.

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,080
I'm not the type

73
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,770
who uses threats or bribes.

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,480
Oh, by the way,

75
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,640
you probably don't know yet.

76
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,760
Sheng Huaijing

77
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,770
is already in deep trouble.

78
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,280
I've already handed

79
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,000
the evidence to the police.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
Your medical school will be shut down soon.

81
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,640
If you're smart,

82
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,640
you'd better confess everything

83
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,900
about your conspiracy

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,560
with Sheng Huaijing.

85
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
It seems your wife and daughter

86
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,980
are living quite well abroad.

87
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,360
Sending them overseas

88
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,780
doesn't separate them

89
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,440
from your crimes.

90
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,280
You!

91
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,720
What are you trying to do?

92
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,640
You just said

93
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,760
you don't use threats or bribes.

94
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,280
How I treat them

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,420
depends on your attitude.

96
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,280
Think carefully.

97
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,560
The real threat to your wife and daughter

98
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,320
isn't me.

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,440
Once he knows you're in my hands,

100
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,300
Sheng Huaijing won't spare them.

101
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,640
Confess your crimes honestly,

102
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,880
and I'll send people to protect them.

103
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,000
You.

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,800
Where would my mom

105
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,680
hide the voice recorder?

106
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,360
Go to sleep, baby.

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,520
There's a big bad wolf outside.

108
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,160
Keep all secrets in your heart,

109
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,560
mom will take you to dreamland.

110
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,080
Big bad wolf.

111
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,120
Don't take away my treasure.

112
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,080
Keep all secrets in your heart.

113
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,410
Sheng Huaijing is the big bad wolf.

114
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,370
Keep the secrets in your heart.

115
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,480
Cut the crap.

116
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,060
You must give me the prescription today.

117
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,800
You want the prescription?

118
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,080
Only over my dead body.

119
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,520
Don't push me.

120
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,920
Sheng Huaijing.

121
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,100
The real culprit who harmed Sheng Ze's father and my mother

122
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,880
is really you.

123
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,760
Hey, Uncle Cao.

124
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,580
Uncle Cao, say something.

125
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,200
Uncle Cao?

126
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,320
Uncle Cao?

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,880
Hurry up.

128
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,559
Something's wrong with Uncle Cao.

129
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,240
No.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,060
I can't drag Sheng Ze into this again.

131
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,560
Sheng Huaijing.

132
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,640
I know what you want.

133
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,560
All of this,

134
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,880
let me end it.

135
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,560
Young master.

136
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,300
He's already gone.

137
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,880
Yes.

138
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,120
Yes.

139
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,160
Qiao Wan.

140
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,140
How dare you come here.

141
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,840
I want to see Sheng Huaijing.

142
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,080
Get out of here now

143
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,410
before I lose my patience and hurt you.

144
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,440
Got it.

145
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
Mr. Sheng found the director's whereabouts.

146
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
He actually escaped.

147
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,410
He doesn't have the ability to escape.

148
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,440
You mean

149
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,760
Sheng Ze deliberately let him out?

150
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,520
And then

151
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,600
lure us out?

152
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
This old guy must have ratted us out.

153
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,880
Hua.

154
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,960
I know what you want to do.

155
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,730
Don't go.

156
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Are we just going to sit here and wait for death?

157
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,480
Mr. Sheng.

158
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,280
Brother.

159
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,690
I can't listen to you this time.

160
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,280
Get some rest.

161
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Did you find it?

162
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,500
Let me help you look for it.

163
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,130
You wouldn't be looking for

164
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
this, would you?

165
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,760
Mr. Hua.

166
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,080
I just escaped from Shengze.

167
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,880
I didn't say anything.

168
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,720
Indeed.

169
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
You don't need to say anything else.

170
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,200
Police!

171
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,860
Drop your weapon! Don't move!

172
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,840
You think you've won,

173
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
but you'll never beat Mr. Sheng.

174
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,040
That's none of your concern.

175
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
