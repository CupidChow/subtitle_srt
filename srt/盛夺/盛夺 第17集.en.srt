1
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,240
I can't imagine

2
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,650
what kind of torture she went through.

3
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,690
She wrote my name with her blood and tears.

4
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,970
I will definitely get justice for her.

5
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,720
The evidence is irrefutable.

6
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,560
What do you have to say for yourself?

7
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,760
I truly know nothing about this matter.

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,800
Do you think I'm a fool?

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,600
After the accident that year,

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
I was in a coma for a long time.

11
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,720
When I woke up,

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,760
By the time I regained consciousness,

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,000
my father had already passed away,

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,640
and my legs were crippled.

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,010
Are you trying to say

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,039
that you knew nothing about this from beginning to end?

17
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,200
I just found out

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,960
that your mother was the only witness back then.

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,120
You're lying!

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,320
Why would I lie to you?

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,039
Fine.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,130
If you're so certain

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,200
that the Sheng family harmed your mother,

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,080
then kill me.

25
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,160
Avenge your mother.

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,280
You think I don't dare?

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,880
Kill me.

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,440
Go ahead.

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,680
I will never let go of those who harmed my mother.

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,000
I will definitely uncover the truth about what happened back then,

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,480
and avenge my mother.

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,079
The servants at the Sheng family have all been replaced.

33
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,400
Grandmother is the only one who knows the truth.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
But she's lying in a hospital bed,

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,160
and no one knows when she'll wake up.

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,020
How are you going to investigate?

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,410
It's none of your business.

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,640
From now on,

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,200
you go your way,

40
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,480
and I'll go mine.

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
We won't interfere with each other.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,760
Wanwan.

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,000
Wanwan.

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,000
Wanwan.

45
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,560
Wanwan.

46
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,360
Sheng Ze is actually Sheng An.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,880
Mr. Sheng,

48
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,740
you were right.

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,240
Qiao Wan has known his true identity all along.

50
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,080
She's been helping him against us.

51
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,010
But now their relationship has likely fallen apart.

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,700
About this identity swap,

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,320
the old lady must have known about it.

54
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,400
From the moment Sheng An appeared at the funeral,

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,060
the old lady has been covering for his identity.

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
Damn it!

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,079
Everyone,

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,570
everyone has been helping him against me.

59
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,370
How could I let them have their way?

60
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,280
Sheng An...

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,880
You even faked your death and impersonated your own brother to bring me down.

62
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,680
I've truly underestimated you.

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,160
The company and Qiao Wan,

64
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,400
I must have them at any cost.

65
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,400
Yes.

66
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,640
Since we know his cards now,

67
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,480
let's keep quiet about it.

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,920
Wait for the right moment,

69
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,250
and catch him off guard.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,600
Mr. Chang.

71
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,240
I know

72
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,100
what you want to ask me.

73
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,440
You're the only one I can turn to now.

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,600
Please help me.

75
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,040
It's been so many years.

76
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,720
Before I came,

77
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,320
the Sheng mansion had already changed several housekeepers.

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,380
I truly don't know about this matter.

79
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,680
I want to ask you

80
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,040
to help me find the Sheng family's housekeeper from back then.

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,170
I believe you can definitely find out.

82
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,240
Mr. Chang,

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,839
please.

84
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,520
Young Master.

85
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,720
Qiao Wan asked me to help her find the former housekeeper.

86
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,680
If back then,

87
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,360
the Sheng family really did wrong her mother...

88
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,820
Finding that housekeeper

89
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,580
might make things even worse.

90
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,880
It's not just her.

91
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,050
I want to know the truth too.

92
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,560
I was in a coma for a long time after that accident.

93
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,840
Grandmother also forbade anyone from mentioning it again.

94
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,500
Don't you find it suspicious?

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
I want to help her,

96
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,400
even if she ends up hating me.

97
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,360
Mr. Cao,

98
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,120
sorry for asking you to come out.

99
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,050
I heard from Mr. Chang that you're not in good health.

100
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,040
It's just old ailments.

101
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,880
It's fine.

102
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,940
I just want to ask you about

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,690
the truth of what happened to my mother back then.

104
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,640
Back then,

105
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,120
there were indeed some rumors.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,159
They said there were traces of a third person in the car.

107
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,800
The old lady was furious when she found out.

108
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,320
She forced your mother to tell the truth.

109
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,760
But your mother insisted

110
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,820
there were only two people in the car.

111
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,920
In her anger,

112
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,890
the old lady locked your mother up.

113
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,290
When she was finally released,

114
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,120
she had already gone mad.

115
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,320
I believe my mother.

116
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,650
She had no reason to lie.

117
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
Miss Qiao,

118
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,520
your mother was a woman with a tragic fate.

119
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,280
I know you want revenge for her.

120
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,400
But I've heard

121
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,800
the old lady has been in a coma.

122
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,960
Isn't that the best punishment for her?

123
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,880
No.

124
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
She must wake up.

125
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,120
Only when she wakes up will the punishment begin.

126
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,620
By the way, Mr. Cao,

127
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,240
I heard you resigned shortly after that incident.

128
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,480
My health

129
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,000
was getting worse and worse.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,760
I really couldn't work anymore,

131
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,120
so I resigned.

132
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,760
Mr. Cao,

133
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,200
please don't hide anything from me.

134
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,680
Miss Qiao.

135
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,690
Do you...

136
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,480
don't you trust me?

137
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,520
I've told you everything about what happened.

138
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,800
It's been so many years.

139
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,920
You should let it go.

140
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,800
The housekeeper's expression was unnatural.

141
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,410
The reason for his resignation couldn't be that simple.

142
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,520
But how can I get him to talk?

143
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,980
Did you find out anything?

144
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,330
I should have known.

145
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,360
About me asking Mr. Chang to help find someone,

146
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,620
how could you not know?

147
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,520
Why don't you ask your grandmother?

148
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,640
She should know better than anyone.

149
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,640
If it was really because of Grandmother...

150
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,600
I won't stop you from investigating.

151
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
It's been so many years since it happened.

152
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,720
What's the point?

153
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,460
But things aren't as simple as they seem.

154
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,120
I want to find out the truth too.

155
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,920
What really happened during that accident?

156
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,720
We could investigate together.

157
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,000
No.

158
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,720
You have your own path to follow.

159
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,320
And I have my revenge to take.

160
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,480
It's you.

161
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,500
You kept saying you wanted to make it up to me.

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,280
You change your attitude faster than turning pages.

163
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,000
Shengze.

164
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,000
I did wrong by you before.

165
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,920
But I don't owe you anything now, do I?

166
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,050
I told you that you could take revenge.

167
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,000
If it makes you feel better.

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,640
Stab me.

169
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,360
Go ahead.

170
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,360
Let go of me.

171
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,240
I won't.

172
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,560
Did you never have any feelings for me at all?

173
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,340
Young Master Shengze.

174
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,770
We're not on the same path anymore.

175
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,280
There's no point in continuing this entanglement.

176
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,140
We'd better go our separate ways.

177
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,159
Qiao Wan.

178
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,000
You are the most

179
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,299
cold-hearted woman in the world.

180
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,780
Second Master.

181
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,960
Why are you back?

182
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,920
What?

183
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Can't I come back?

184
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,850
That's not what I meant.

185
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,400
If you'd let me know in advance,

186
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,360
I could have prepared.

187
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,490
Then go prepare now.

188
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,000
Haven't started dinner yet, right?

189
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,260
Get me some tableware.

190
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,040
Oh no,

191
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,970
make it two sets.

192
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,490
I've been missing the food from the old house.

193
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,120
Mr. Chang

194
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,400
you may go now.

195
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Congratulations

196
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,000
on winning the bid.

197
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,480
If it weren't for my uncle's surprise intervention,

198
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,360
things would have gone more smoothly.

199
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,090
When the company was in crisis,

200
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,440
I was the one who opened up sales channels,

201
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
raised the prices of Chinese medicine,

202
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
and turned the company profitable.

203
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,280
Your low-price bidding strategy

204
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,120
will make the company work for nothing

205
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,780
and repeat the same mistakes.

206
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,840
Wake up.

207
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,360
Your father's philosophy is outdated.

208
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,520
No.

209
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,260
I'll prove it's not outdated.

210
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,000
And

211
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,280
the company's overall profit won't decrease.

212
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,800
Fine.

213
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,570
You've got guts.

214
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,760
I caught these fish at sea today.

215
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,890
They're very fresh.

216
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,420
I rushed to bring them back for you to try.

217
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,680
I can't let my uncle's kindness go to waste.

218
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,040
You like seafood.

219
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,520
Not bad.

220
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,880
Sheng An can't compare in this regard.

221
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,010
He's severely allergic to this stuff.

222
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,020
He doesn't have the pleasure of enjoying it.

223
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,320
I'm full.

224
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,860
Uncle, take your time eating.

225
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,520
I need to get back to the company too.

226
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,440
Let's end it here for today.
