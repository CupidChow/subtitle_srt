1
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,650
You two split up and search.

2
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,800
Miss Gu.

3
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
What happened?

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,680
The young master is missing.

5
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,480
What?

6
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,480
I'm going to look for the young master.

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,440
Please help us search too.

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,040
Thank you.

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,560
Where could Ze have gone?

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,360
Miss Gu.

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,480
Feng Jing.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,960
Why is it you?

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,240
The young master is missing.

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,700
I'll search the back hill.

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,920
Did you find Ze?

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,960
No.

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,720
You bitch.

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,440
Can't even make up a better lie.

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,039
You're just like Qiao Wan.

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,280
Tell me.

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,280
Where have you hidden Ze?

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Are you crazy?

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
You actually hit me!

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes, I hit you.

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,600
Wearing that fake mask in front of everyone every day.

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,800
I've been going mad.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,440
It feels so good not to pretend anymore.

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,400
You...

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,979
Who are you really?

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,500
You don't need to know who I am.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,200
You should have expected this day would come when you were bullying others.

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,680
Better late than never.

33
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,620
I'll pay you back for everything.

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,410
Just take what's coming to you.

35
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,440
Thank you.

36
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,120
What's

37
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,079
that sound?

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,970
I don't know either.

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,040
There are many wild animals on the mountain behind my house.

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,000
Wolf packs.

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,890
Bears looking for food.

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,760
They have very keen noses.

43
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,760
They can smell humans.

44
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,890
What's the point of lying to me?

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,810
Young master, look.

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,480
Young master!

47
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,320
Young master!

48
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,960
Are you in there?

49
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,329
Uncle Chang.

50
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,440
We're in here.

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,020
Young Master, you.

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,480
Why did you come here?

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,160
Someone locked us in here.

54
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,800
This person has the key.

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,680
He must have known we were coming up the mountain

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,480
and followed us all the way here.

57
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,760
Help!

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,840
Ze, help me!

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,400
Ze, save me!

60
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,720
She's insane!

61
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,680
She wants to kill me!

62
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,640
Young Master,

63
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,760
Uncle Chang.

64
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,920
I didn't do it.

65
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,960
I went with everyone to look for Young Master.

66
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,520
Just as I got up the mountain, I ran into Miss Gu rushing down.

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,680
She beat me up.

68
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,360
I didn't dare fight back.

69
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,120
Feng Jing, keep acting.

70
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,120
You think Young Master will believe your lies?

71
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,640
You...

72
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,280
Gu Nannan.

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,360
What more do you have to explain?

74
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
It wasn't me.

75
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
No, really, it wasn't me.

76
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
It was this wretched woman

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,760
who framed me.

78
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
You're truly beyond help,

79
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,250
refusing to repent.

80
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,320
Uncle Chang.

81
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,000
Drag her out of the Sheng house

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,560
and never let her set foot here again.

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:46,960
Yes, sir.

84
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,159
Ze! Ze!

85
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,640
Miss Gu.

86
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,280
Ze, you can't do this to me!

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
Ze!

88
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,800
Ze! Ze!

89
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,960
Young Master.

90
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,120
I really don't know what I did wrong.

91
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,880
Miss Feng Jing.

92
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,880
We've played along with your little drama.

93
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,940
Isn't that enough?

94
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,120
So...

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,240
Identifying Gu Nannan as the culprit

96
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,240
was to make me lower my guard.

97
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,610
You've suspected me all along.

98
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,440
That's right.

99
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,360
You two did have an argument.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,330
But she didn't beat you.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,280
You beat her.

102
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,560
You took the opportunity to slip the key into Gu Nannan's pocket.

103
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,600
It fell out during the argument.

104
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,120
You thought your plan was flawless.

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,250
But unfortunately,

106
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
you can't fool me.

107
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,520
Because I

108
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,100
have known all along that you're my uncle's spy.

109
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,080
Young Master,

110
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,360
you're quite good at keeping your cool.

111
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,080
All these years my uncle has been controlling everything in the company.

112
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,280
You know all the evidence of his crimes.

113
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,320
Your only way out now is to work for me.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,400
Otherwise, I'll send you back.

115
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,080
You should know

116
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,960
what happens to a discarded pawn in my uncle's hands.

117
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,640
You can forget about it.

118
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,090
I will absolutely never betray Mr. Sheng.

119
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,360
Besides,

120
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,490
he wouldn't treat me like that either.

121
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,360
So confident.

122
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Young Master.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,640
Look.

124
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,780
This was found in her room.

125
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,610
Why did you secretly photograph me with Qiao Wan?

126
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,320
Young Master,

127
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,080
let me tell you a secret.

128
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,000
Your beloved Qiao Wan is also Mr. Sheng's person.

129
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,200
You didn't expect that, did you?

130
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,080
I know.

131
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,160
Although we've cut off all Shengze's connections in China,

132
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,600
Qiao Wan actually helped him contact Professor Bai

133
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,040
and even wants to give him Sheng An's painting

134
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,320
just so he can win the bid.

135
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,000
Mr. Sheng,

136
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,140
Qiao Wan has definitely betrayed us.

137
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,280
Go prepare.

138
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,700
We'll make our move on the road tomorrow.

139
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,679
Feng Jing has sent a message.

140
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,720
They absolutely cannot meet Professor Bai.

141
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,450
Understand?

142
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,080
Yes,

143
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,850
I'll arrange it right away.

144
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,160
Qiao Wan

145
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,600
You've got some nerve.

146
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,640
Aren't you ashamed of betraying Mr. Sheng?

147
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,200
I've chosen the right side.

148
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,720
What's there to be ashamed of?

149
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,400
As for you,

150
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,560
wake up soon.

151
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,960
Don't let yourself be used by bad people anymore.

152
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,360
Good luck to you.

153
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,640
I'm looking forward to

154
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,040
seeing how he reacts when he's betrayed

155
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,520
by someone he treasures.

156
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,440
Young Master,

157
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
what did you send?

158
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,960
You still don't trust me.

159
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,000
Who could completely let down their guard

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,730
with a female con artist who has hurt them before?

161
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,240
You're right.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,640
But I'll soon be of no use.

163
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,210
Sheng Huaijing will soon discover I've switched sides.

164
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Not necessarily.

165
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,000
Perhaps he'll give you another chance.

166
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
After all,

167
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,520
I was once captivated by that face of yours.

168
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,840
Knowing it was a trap,

169
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,280
I still jumped right in.

170
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,780
Enough of that.

171
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,730
Do you know how to play pool?

172
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,580
I'll teach you.

173
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,960
Here.

174
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,050
Keep your body flat.

175
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,940
Forearm vertical.

176
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
Relax your wrist.

177
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,460
Three points in a line.

178
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
Strike.

179
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,680
Didn't you say I need to atone for my sins?

180
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,810
What does this mean?

181
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,520
Part of your atonement.

182
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,360
That's enough.

183
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,090
Take it away.

184
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,280
Young master.

185
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,080
Be careful on your way.
