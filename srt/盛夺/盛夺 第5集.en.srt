1
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Thank you all for coming

2
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,200
to my grandson Shengze's welcome dinner.

3
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,000
Please take good care of him in the future.

4
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,240
No need for such formalities, ma'am.

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,200
We'll be the ones counting on young Mr. Sheng.

6
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,890
Hello everyone.

7
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,770
I'd like to propose a toast.

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,730
Cheers! Congratulations!

9
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,360
He's absolutely perfect.

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,280
Who's his girlfriend?

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,480
She really hit the jackpot.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,120
Hey, brother!

13
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,800
Welcome back home.

14
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,330
I'm the first one to throw you a welcome party.

15
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,920
Thanks.

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,520
But do I know you?

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,200
When Sheng An was alive,

18
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,240
I, Yan San, was his best friend.

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,640
By extension,

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,520
you're also my good friend.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,140
Come on,

22
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
let's drink to our deep friendship.

23
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,640
Yan San,

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,479
are you even close to Young Master Sheng Ze? You're just bragging.

25
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,120
You're really taking it too far,

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,450
talking such nonsense.

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
Mind your own business.

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,280
You're just jealous of my good relationship with the Sheng family,

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,160
I'm leaving.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,240
Ze, don't go!

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,760
Look, you've made Ze leave in anger.

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,800
Mr. Sheng, let me help you.

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,760
Miss Qiao Wan.

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,520
I've got wine stains on my clothes,

35
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,980
could you help me clean it?

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,920
Sure,

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
please follow me.

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,920
Young Master.

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
The doctor said

40
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,640
your leg can't handle strenuous exercise yet.

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,280
You need to continue with daily acupuncture treatments

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,610
and recover gradually.

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,480
Young Master.

44
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,520
What is it?

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,090
How did you pass the lie detector test?

46
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,320
As long as I have a way to succeed.

47
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,250
Don't you only care about results?

48
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,940
I heard the Sheng mansion was haunted a few days ago.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,040
They say Sheng An's ghost has returned.

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,440
Ridiculous.

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,170
I've never believed in ghosts or spirits.

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,079
If someone is using this to intimidate you for revenge,

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,320
then they must know what really happened.

54
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,120
It's nothing.

55
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,000
I just had too much to drink and had a nightmare.

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
I'm sorry for disturbing everyone.

57
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,280
Qiao Wan.

58
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,620
You know what happens to people who lie to me.

59
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Where is Sheng Ze?

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Nothing unusual.

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,440
My little chess piece.

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,140
When did you become so beautiful?

63
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,810
How did I not notice before?

64
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,120
Mr. Sheng, please leave.

65
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,220
How did Sheng Huaijing find out about the haunting?

66
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,250
Does he have other informants?

67
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,440
No.

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,580
I must find out the truth quickly.

69
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,340
Young master, what are you doing?

70
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,770
What were you doing with my uncle just now?

71
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,320
Mr. Sheng's clothes were dirty.

72
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,040
I was helping him clean up.

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,160
You were cleaning all the way to his face?

74
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,290
Why don't you try seducing me instead?

75
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,000
What's so good about him?

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,210
He's just an old man.

77
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,240
The company won't be his in the future anyway.

78
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,440
What do you see in him?

79
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,690
I don't mind that you've been with two men before.

80
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,880
Why do you have the same face as Sheng An?

81
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,760
It disgusts me.

82
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,800
Mr. Sheng, they've sent a message.

83
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,080
Everything is ready.

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,000
I understand.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You may leave now.

86
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,880
Young master!

87
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,520
Look out!

88
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,280
What's wrong with you all?

89
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,800
How is it?

90
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,530
Are you okay?

91
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,560
Young master,

92
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,090
Sheng Ze!

93
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,480
Ze,

94
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,520
are you alright, young master?

95
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,800
Why did Qiao Wan show up?

96
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,240
It's too dangerous.

97
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,560
How could you let this happen?

98
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,160
How is it?

99
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,760
Young master, your leg!

100
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,560
Uncle Chang.

101
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,640
Ze,

102
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,840
are you alright?

103
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,600
You scared me to death just now.

104
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,080
Grandmother, I'm fine.

105
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,810
Don't worry.

106
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Good to hear that.

107
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,760
Don't touch him!

108
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
How dare you!

109
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,960
Ze was in such danger

110
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,960
and still had to save a troublemaker like you.

111
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,480
Miss Gu.

112
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,520
If it were you,

113
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,800
you wouldn't do better than me.

114
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,200
You!

115
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,680
Stop arguing!

116
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,480
Hurry up and help the young master inside to rest.

117
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,960
Yes.

118
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,560
Go.

119
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,770
Shengze is destined to be mine.

120
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,960
A mere servant dares to compete with me?

121
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,800
Qiaowan.

122
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Just you wait.

123
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,120
I'll make you realize

124
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,240
what your true place really is.

125
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,440
Mr. Sheng,

126
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,520
Sheng Ze's leg

127
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,540
got injured so easily.

128
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,520
Interesting.

129
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,840
Really interesting.

130
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,880
Young Master.

131
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,400
Young Master.

132
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,560
There's no sign of rehabilitation.

133
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,360
Could he really not be Sheng An?

134
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,560
What are you doing?

135
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,640
Young Master,

136
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,640
you seemed to hurt your leg when you saved me.

137
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,840
I came to see if you're okay.

138
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,680
What if I am hurt?

139
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,330
How will you make it up to me?

140
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
You saved me.

141
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,920
I'll do anything for you.

142
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,600
Anything?

143
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,490
I want to take a bath.

144
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,690
Help me take off my clothes.

145
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,840
Keep going.

146
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,000
Serve me the same way you serve Sheng An.

147
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,880
Or are you already tired of that cripple?

148
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,920
His body may be disabled, but his heart isn't.

149
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,720
I serve him willingly.

150
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,880
Unlike some people

151
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,650
who have all their limbs

152
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,140
but aren't worth even one of his fingers.

153
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,160
You hypocritical woman.

154
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,020
So that's how you really feel.

155
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,520
Then why did you betray him?

156
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,080
Tell me.

157
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,200
Why?

158
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,960
I never meant to harm Young Master Sheng An.

159
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Get out.

160
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,260
Don't let me see you again.

161
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
Young Master,

162
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,410
happy birthday.

163
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,360
Qiaowan.

164
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,920
Thank you.

165
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,490
Let's blow out the candles now.

166
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,240
How are you feeling?

167
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,970
Does it hurt?

168
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,120
I'm fine.

169
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,660
Young Master, let's make a wish quickly.

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,200
What did you wish for?

171
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,650
I can't tell you.

172
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,320
I'm afraid it won't come true if I say it.

173
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,680
Actually, I don't celebrate my birthday.

174
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,810
On my 10th birthday,

175
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,200
there was a car accident.

176
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,760
My father died in that accident,

177
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,090
and my leg was disabled.

178
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,160
Since then,

179
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,000
I've never celebrated my birthday again.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,880
I'm so sorry.

181
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,080
I didn't know.

182
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,520
It's okay.

183
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,360
You prepared this surprise for me,

184
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,890
and I'm already very happy.

185
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,840
What?

186
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,360
All my passwords are this.

187
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,600
Why are you telling me this?

188
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,840
I don't know

189
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,640
how to treat you properly.

190
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,600
But I hope

191
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
this will make you feel more secure.

192
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,400
Aren't you afraid

193
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,330
I'll transfer all your money away?

194
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,540
It doesn't matter.

195
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,060
The money is all yours.

196
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,480
But you are mine.

197
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,240
Qiaowan.

198
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,520
You can go attend to your work first.

199
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,450
I'll take care of the Young Master.

200
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,960
I'm sorry, young master.

201
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,320
I didn't inform you

202
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,720
before investigating Qiao Wan privately.

203
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,320
She's been in constant contact with Sheng Huaijing,

204
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,640
continuously reporting your situation to him.

205
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,040
She is Sheng Huaijing's undercover agent.

206
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,060
Don't say anything and don't ask.

207
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,840
This matter

208
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,620
let's pretend it never happened.

209
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,730
Young master, please come to your senses.

210
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,360
She is Sheng Huaijing's person.

211
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,620
I'm completely sober.

212
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,360
Mr. Chang.

213
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,170
I'd like to be alone for a while.

214
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,730
Could you please leave?

215
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,360
Young Master.

216
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,120
Mr. Chang,

217
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,100
it's all right.

218
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,580
Whether you're the light that's come to save me,

219
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,320
or the abyss pulling me down,

220
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,370
as long as I pretend not to know,

221
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,040
you'll stay by my side forever.
