1
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,580
What are you doing?

2
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,220
Who gave you permission to enter my room?

3
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,360
What am I doing?

4
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,840
Don't you know it best?

5
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,040
You scared me the same way last night.

6
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,879
I just said I was attacked

7
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,200
and you immediately accused me of faking a headache.

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,480
That proves you know

9
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,289
I was drugged unconscious.

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,120
Go on.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,120
And this bottle of food coloring

12
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,240
was found on the table in your room.

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
What do you have to say for yourself?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,600
No, wait.

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,360
You deliberately left clues in what you said.

16
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,820
Putting this thing in such an obvious place.

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,340
You were afraid I wouldn't figure out it was you behind all this trickery.

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,160
Qiao Wan.

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,400
Your intelligence is finally online.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,680
So

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,280
you've been targeting me and intimidating me.

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,080
Is it because you suspect I harmed Sheng An?

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,400
Let go of me.

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,880
Listen to me.

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,940
What are you doing?

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,370
I came back this time

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,160
not only to avenge Sheng An,

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,400
but also to take back the company

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
and fulfill my father's dying wish.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,000
As for you.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Whatever you did to Sheng An,

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,450
I will do the same to you.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,760
I'll pay you back a thousand times over.

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,960
Do you understand?

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,560
Whatever you did to Sheng An,

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,820
I'll do the same to you,

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,760
a thousand times worse.

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,280
Understand?

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,180
Did I ask for your help?

40
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,200
You.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,570
Did I tell you to put it back?

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,000
Young Master,

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,280
what do you really want?

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,720
I hate when people take it upon themselves to help.

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,980
I don't need your pity.

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,970
You're overthinking this.

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,360
My life is hard too.

48
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,240
I have no right to sympathize with you.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Stop right there.

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,560
Take your things.

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,240
Get out.

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,040
This is my scarf.

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,840
You painted this.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,320
It's so beautiful.

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,160
Thank you, young master.

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,460
Of course my painting is good.

57
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Young master.

58
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,000
If you need anything,

59
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,610
I'd be happy to help.

60
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,880
Young Master.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,440
I heard a noise.

62
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
Did you fall?

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,880
Be careful.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,800
Young Master.

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,960
Sheng An.

66
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,840
If we could start over,

67
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,420
would you still choose to fall for me?

68
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,160
Mr. Sheng.

69
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,920
The police investigation shows

70
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,399
Sheng An's wheelchair brakes failed,

71
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,560
causing him to crash into roadside rocks and lose consciousness.

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,280
He was pronounced dead after 40 minutes of emergency treatment.

73
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,560
The way he died

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,520
is exactly like the accident

75
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,850
we originally planned.

76
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,440
Is Sheng An really dead?

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,800
Keep investigating.

78
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Report any news to me immediately.

79
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,360
Yes.

80
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,840
The most pressing issue now

81
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,120
is preventing Sheng Ze from joining the board.

82
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,159
Thinking a will is enough to gain entry

83
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,960
is rather naive.

84
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,840
Just make him back down.

85
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,850
The pharmaceutical bidding case,

86
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,320
has it started moving forward?

87
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,040
Not yet.

88
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,340
Isn't Director Lin in charge of that?

89
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,340
Director Lin has always been against us.

90
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,000
Your strategy is brilliant.

91
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,080
Come back soon.

92
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,480
I understand.

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
I'll go now.

94
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,200
I almost forgot.

95
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,840
Even the gentlest cat

96
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
will show its claws.

97
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,280
You promised

98
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,800
you would save my mother.

99
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,040
You dare threaten me?

100
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,320
I trusted you so much,

101
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,040
thinking you were really helping Sheng An with rehabilitation.

102
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,240
But I never imagined

103
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
you would threaten my mother's life

104
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,780
to make me kill him.

105
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,890
Sheng Huaijing,

106
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,240
do you have any moral bottom line?

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,120
Without me,

108
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,440
you and your mother would have starved on the streets.

109
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,480
Go ahead.

110
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,240
Die if you want.

111
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,890
I won't stop you.

112
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
You won't let me die,

113
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,560
because I'm still useful to you.

114
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,480
You still need me

115
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,720
to deal with Sheng Ze.

116
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,220
Good that you understand.

117
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,360
Just as

118
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,320
we got rid of one cripple,

119
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,740
another fake shows up.

120
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,520
Remember,

121
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,400
at all times,

122
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,620
keep your blade pointed outward.

123
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,620
As long as you obediently work for me,

124
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,320
I promise

125
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,370
I will cure your mother's illness.

126
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,890
There's no turning back for you now, is there?

127
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,970
Let's get back to business.

128
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,000
Don't you think

129
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,400
it's too coincidental

130
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,360
that Sheng Ze appears right after Sheng An's death?

131
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
What are you suspecting?

132
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,160
I saw with my own eyes that resuscitation failed.

133
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,200
Your current task

134
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,520
is to keep a close eye on Sheng Ze.

135
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,980
If anything seems off,

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,460
report to me immediately.

137
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
What's going on here?

138
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,020
Why did you take down all of Young Master Sheng An's paintings?

139
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
Kneel down.

140
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,200
Why should I?

141
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,320
I said kneel down.

142
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,120
You look

143
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,640
like you don't accept this.

144
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,960
This is Young Master Sheng An's studio.

145
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,160
So what?

146
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Now this place

147
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,280
is my billiard room.

148
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,560
Fine.

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,600
Even if you want to renovate,

150
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,720
these paintings on the wall are Young Master Sheng An's life's work.

151
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,039
How can you just throw them away?

152
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,960
He's gone now.

153
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,159
I don't understand art.

154
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,200
What's the point of keeping them?

155
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,000
But...

156
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,080
Be clear about

157
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
who your new master is.

158
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,320
You're insane.

159
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,400
To deal with servants who lie,

160
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,730
you must use this method

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,200
to break their will.

162
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,400
The remaining paintings,

163
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,760
will you take them yourself

164
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,020
or should I have someone throw them away?

165
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,560
I'll take them.

166
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,320
What are you thinking about?

167
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,490
If you don't tell me,

168
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,080
I won't let you go down.

169
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,520
I was thinking

170
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,760
even if I fall to my death,

171
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,560
I wouldn't trouble the young master to save me.

172
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,200
Is that so?

173
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,680
You can't even take care of yourself,

174
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,360
yet you're still worried about this worthless painting.

175
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,080
Such

176
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,930
deep loyalty between master and servant.

177
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,460
Sheng An down there

178
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,160
must be very touched.

179
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,120
Thank you for your praise, young master.

180
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,320
It's just my duty.

181
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,280
Xiao An loved to sketch.

182
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,760
He used to stay in this garden

183
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,600
for the entire day,

184
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,980
and wouldn't come back even when it got dark.

185
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,920
Now,

186
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,920
everything has changed.

187
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,280
Grandmother,

188
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,810
please don't worry.

189
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,540
From now on,

190
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,780
I'll spend more time by your side.

191
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,640
Having you by my side

192
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,440
brings comfort

193
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,000
to my heart.

194
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,480
Grandmother.

195
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,000
Nannan, why are you here?

196
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,360
Grandma.

197
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,680
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,500
I was on a business trip out of town recently.

199
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,780
When I heard about Sheng'an's accident,

200
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,560
I couldn't make it back in time.

201
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,400
He just...

202
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,760
I understand, dear.

203
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,080
Sheng'an is gone.

204
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,000
You must be the most heartbroken.

205
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,400
I know you're suffering inside.

206
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,080
Grandma.

207
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,520
It hurts so much.

208
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,320
Is this Sheng'an's brother?

209
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,800
Yes,

210
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,680
Shengze.

211
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,400
Say hello to Nannan.

212
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,040
Hello,

213
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,530
my name is Gu Nannan.

214
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,960
I'm Sheng'an's fiancée.

215
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,400
Hello,

216
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm Shengze.

217
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,680
You really look exactly like Sheng An.

218
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,360
Grandmother.

219
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,360
Why is it you?

220
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,560
Sheng An is gone.

221
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,000
Yet Grandmother still keeps you in the Sheng mansion.

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,560
Miss Gu.

223
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,000
If there's nothing else,

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll be going now.

225
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Stop right there.

226
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,680
Oh my!

227
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,600
Are you crazy?

229
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,920
How dare you play dirty tricks in front of the young master's memorial tablet.

230
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,480
Beware of karma.

231
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,370
Sheng An is nothing but ashes and dust now.

232
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,720
Who are you trying to scare?
