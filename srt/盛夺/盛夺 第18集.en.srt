1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,120
Whether you're Sheng An or Sheng Ze,

2
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,040
you must die today.

3
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,680
Sheng Ze.

4
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,040
Sheng Ze.

5
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,920
Sheng Ze.

6
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,960
What's wrong with you, Sheng Ze?

7
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,680
You're having an allergic reaction.

8
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,280
Wait here.

9
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,850
I'll get you some medicine.

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,080
It's useless.

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,200
My uncle is determined to get rid of me.

12
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,850
Even if I survive this time,

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,720
there will be a next time.

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,970
Are you really going to give up?

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,240
No way.

16
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,860
I won't stand by and watch you die either.

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,080
Qiaowan.

18
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,720
Then promise me.

19
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,160
You will never,

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
ever leave me.

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,320
I promise you.

22
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,800
I will never leave you.

23
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,410
You could have saved yourself.

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,920
You almost died just now.

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,850
Do you know that?

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,100
I just wanted to take a chance.

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,160
I wanted to see

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,130
if you would promise me.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,640
Shengze.

30
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,010
You're completely insane.

31
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:37,760
Qiaowan.

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,000
Admit it,

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
you have feelings for me, don't you?

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,520
What time do you think this is?

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Don't you realize

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
that Sheng Huaijing came this time

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,000
possibly to investigate your identity?

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,460
This day was bound to come.

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,780
I'm not afraid.

40
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,280
What I fear is

41
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,040
that you won't be by my side anymore.

42
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,560
Mom.

43
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,240
You've suffered so much,

45
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,079
and I'm only finding out now.

46
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,170
I'm such a terrible person.

47
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,240
Why are you crying?

48
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,360
You won't look pretty if you keep crying.

49
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,600
How about

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,480
I leave Beibei here to keep you company?

51
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,610
Please stop crying.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,040
Wanwan.

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,079
Hello, ma'am.

54
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,840
You were the one who called the police and saved me back then.

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,170
Do you remember who I am?

56
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
I remember you.

57
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,040
Don't come any closer.

58
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,400
I don't remember anything.

59
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,320
I don't know anything.

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,680
What's wrong with you?

61
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,880
I don't know anything.

62
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,960
It's okay, it's okay.

63
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,760
Mom, look at this.

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,930
It's all in the past.

65
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,560
All this time, I thought that car accident was just an accident.

66
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,160
But now it seems there must be more to the story.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,480
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,280
If I hadn't been unconscious then,

69
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,010
I could have cleared your name.

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,240
Mr. Sheng.

71
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,120
After Qiao Wan and Sheng Ze visited during the day,

72
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,370
she's been saying strange things.

73
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
You're here.

74
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440
You recognize me?

75
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,520
Come here.

76
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,400
Come closer.

77
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,440
What do you remember?

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,240
I remember

79
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
you big bad wolf.

80
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,240
Don't you dare bully Beibei.

81
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,740
Seems she's not crazy enough yet.

82
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,890
Send her to the medical school.

83
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,480
The dean knows what to do.

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,240
She must not remember anything.

85
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,440
Yes, sir.

86
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,640
Hello, Auntie.

87
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,520
What's the matter?

88
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,240
Qiao Wan,

89
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,810
your mother is missing.

90
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,120
The nurse said someone arranged a hospital transfer for her.

91
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,760
Okay,

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,240
I understand, Auntie.

93
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,040
You must keep this from Sheng Ze.

94
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,160
Alright, I understand.

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,120
Don't worry.

96
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,250
Sheng Huaijing.

97
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
What are you going to do to my mother?

98
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,360
I just moved your mother to a better care facility.

99
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,570
You're questioning me right away.

100
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,200
Is this how you talk to me?

101
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,100
Let me tell you.

102
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,290
I don't believe you.

103
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
Let me see her.

104
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,130
I need to see her.

105
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,920
Fine.

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,890
Come to Sacred Heart Medical Center at 8 tonight.

107
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,120
Mom.

108
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,480
Mom.

109
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,440
Are you okay?

110
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,880
Did they do anything to you?

111
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,200
Does anything hurt?

112
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,000
Nothing hurts.

113
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,480
They were very nice to me.

114
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,890
They even gave me candy.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,930
Do you want some?

116
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,720
What are you doing?

117
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,240
You're the doctor who saved my mother.

118
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,960
Yes.

119
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,400
I'm also the dean of this medical school.

120
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,320
The nurse

121
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,280
is taking your mother to get her medicine.

122
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,320
Her condition is stable now.

123
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Don't worry.

124
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,840
Mr. Sheng,

125
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,560
make yourself at home.

126
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,960
I need to get back to work.

127
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,120
I've met your mother.

128
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,900
You should feel relieved now.

129
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,520
Sheng Huaijing, what exactly do you want?

130
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,440
Take a guess.

131
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,300
Will Sheng Ze come to save you?

132
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,930
Have you forgotten?

133
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,480
Sheng Ze is now my enemy.

134
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,440
He won't come.

135
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,640
Don't even think about it.

136
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,700
Isn't that better?

137
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,800
I see you can't bring yourself to do it.

138
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
I'll take care of him for you.

139
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,360
Shen Huaijing.

140
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
You're despicable.

141
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,320
Let me go!

142
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,130
Release her.

143
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,720
What did I tell you?

144
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,880
Qiao Wan.

145
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,420
Your words are truly magical.

146
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,440
What's the rush?

147
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,460
Have a drink first.

148
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,220
I'm not wasting time with you.

149
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,040
Tell me.

150
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,090
How can I get them released?

151
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Sign this.

152
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,780
Promise you'll never join the board.

153
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,720
Wait.

154
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,680
Sign the right name.

155
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,920
Sheng An.

156
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Fine by me.

157
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,520
Then I don't need to pretend anymore.

158
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,880
Admit it, Sheng An.

159
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,080
You changed your identity and came back to fight me.

160
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,440
But you still can't beat me.

161
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,770
Until the final second,

162
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,320
who can declare victory?

163
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,840
Besides,

164
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,040
I enjoy making comebacks against the odds.

165
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,600
I'd rather hurt the enemy a thousand times

166
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,130
even if I suffer eight hundred wounds myself.

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,680
No!

168
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,760
Don't sign it!

169
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,800
You're too emotional.

170
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,000
A girl like Qiao Wan isn't right for you.

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,730
She and I are the perfect match.

172
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,320
Stop him!

173
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
My patience has its limits.

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You think I'll let you take her away?

175
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,460
Don't come any closer.

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,040
For my sake,

177
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
it's not worth it.

178
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,200
Whether it's worth it

179
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,160
is not for you to decide.
