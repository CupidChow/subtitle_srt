1
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,840
Why bother?

2
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,560
I don't even need to team up with Shengze.

3
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,880
You're already completely defeated.

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,200
What cards do you have left to fight us?

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,320
I suggest you turn yourself in.

6
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Who says I don't have any cards left?

7
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,700
Aren't you one of them?

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,360
Give it back to me.

9
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,480
A tracker.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,770
Shengze is that worried about you.

11
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,120
Wanwan.

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,720
Shengze.

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,360
Shengze.

14
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,039
Let her go.

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Let her go.

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,320
It's simple.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,680
If you die, she lives.

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,320
Even if I die, you won't escape.

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,860
You were the real culprit behind that accident.

20
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,850
Sheng Huaijing.

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,720
So what if I was?

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,320
What's so urgent that we need to talk now?

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,360
I still need to take Shengze to school.

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,220
Why did you destroy that formula?

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,080
I've already told you about this.

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,520
The production and market approval -

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,640
I can handle it all.

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,520
You just focus on the research.

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,720
I've told you many times.

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,040
That medicine works quickly,

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,160
but it's highly toxic.

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,360
It absolutely cannot go to market.

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,880
If this medicine goes to market,

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,960
then Shengyi will become the top pharmaceutical company in Nicaragua.

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,200
You know how difficult things are for Shengyi now.

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,840
Our company -

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,200
the livelihood of hundreds of employees

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,080
is in your hands.

39
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,960
What are you still hesitating about?

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,120
Even if my family's company goes bankrupt,

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,380
I won't do something that harms society.

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,120
I know you've just joined the company

43
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,680
and are eager to prove yourself.

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,800
But you must remember

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,760
that no matter what you do,

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,680
you should always

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,120
do the right thing and follow the right path.

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,920
Cut the crap.

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,120
You must give me the prescription today.

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,000
You want the prescription?

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,120
Over my dead body.

52
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,240
Don't push me.

53
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,200
Let go!

54
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,320
Will you give it or not?

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,840
Let go!

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,100
Will you give it or not?

57
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,200
Call the police quickly.

58
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,260
Call an ambulance.

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,840
Ma'am.

60
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,820
Is this your daughter?

61
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,960
You.

62
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,640
What are you trying to do?

63
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
The dash cam is already broken.

64
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,520
As long as you don't tell anyone,

65
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,320
and I don't tell anyone, no one will know I was here.

66
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,600
Otherwise,

67
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,320
I can't guarantee what might happen to your daughter.

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,680
You're a smart person.

69
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,610
You understand what I mean, right?

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,320
I understand.

71
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,420
Call the police after I leave.

72
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,480
Don't try anything clever.

73
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,280
I'll have someone watching you.

74
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,640
Kid.

75
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
Sir.

76
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,600
Hang in there a little longer.

77
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,840
The ambulance will be here soon.

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,520
Sir.

79
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,640
It's

80
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,280
too late.

81
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,080
Take this.

82
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,680
You killed

83
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,440
my father.

84
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
You drove Qiao Wan's mother insane.

85
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,440
Today,

86
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,720
I'll make you pay for it.

87
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,320
It's not enough. Still not enough.

88
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,120
That car accident should have taken you away instead.

89
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,170
It's all because of you.

90
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,880
I have nothing left now.

91
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,760
You must die in front of me today.

92
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,740
Let's start with the legs.

93
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
Watching you become crippled again

94
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,680
will be so much fun.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,320
Shengze, don't!

96
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Okay.

97
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,760
Shengze, stop!

98
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,440
Please don't!

99
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,480
Shengze!

100
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,360
The arm.

101
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,200
Sheng Huaijing, put down your weapon

102
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
and surrender immediately.

103
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,120
I'll say it again.

104
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,920
Put down your weapon.

105
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,280
Don't struggle in vain.

106
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,320
What's not meant to be yours

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,880
you can't have it no matter how hard you try.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,040
Shengze, are you okay?

109
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,320
Wanwan.

110
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,840
Do you know

111
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
how terrified I was of losing you just now?

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,000
I know.

113
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,120
I know.

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,560
Let's never be apart again,

115
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
okay?

116
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,200
No.

117
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,740
I'm afraid I can't stay with you anymore.

118
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,480
I need to go to the hospital now.

119
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,580
Shengze just fell asleep.

120
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
No need.

121
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,520
I won't go in to see Xiaoze.

122
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,960
It'll only make me angrier.

123
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,880
I told him to take care of himself.

124
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,800
But he keeps

125
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,040
getting hurt for you.

126
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,440
If you ever dare to let him down,

127
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
just remember

128
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,520
all these injuries he suffered for you.

129
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,840
Don't you agree, Mrs. Wang?

130
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,720
Yes, madam.

131
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,130
But Qiao Wan is also very stubborn.

132
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,580
Once she commits to someone, she won't change her mind.

133
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,000
Anyway, let's head back now.

134
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,530
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

135
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,090
I have a flight tonight.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What made you decide to join Doctors Without Borders?

137
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,260
Thinking about it now,

138
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,120
my life before

139
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,780
seems like I was always living for someone else.

140
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,600
After everything I've been through lately,

141
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,400
I suddenly realized something.

142
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,570
Life isn't just about romance.

143
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,920
There are many other important things.

144
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,840
It's time I lived for myself.

145
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,320
Feng Jing, thank you.

146
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,760
You're really brave.

147
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,210
Have a safe journey.

148
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,920
You too.

149
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,060
Shengze, I'll give...

150
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,680
Shengze.

151
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,560
Shengze.

152
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,960
Hello.

153
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,240
Have you seen where the patient from Room 205 went?

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,840
Oh, you're Mr. Sheng, right?

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
I just saw him going

156
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,080
toward the back by himself.

157
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Thank you.

158
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,560
Shengze.

159
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,960
Your leg...

160
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,920
My leg is disabled again.

161
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,960
Perhaps this is what fate intended.

162
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
You won't be in a wheelchair forever.

163
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,280
You'll definitely get better again.

164
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,320
I promise you.

165
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
You promise me?

166
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,440
Yes.

167
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,720
If I can stand again,

168
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,890
you'll marry me right away.

169
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,600
Miss Qiao, let's go.

170
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,760
We're going to get our marriage license.

171
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,320
Shengze, you're such a scoundrel.

172
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,690
That's enough, Wanwan.

173
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,160
You promised me yourself.

174
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,600
