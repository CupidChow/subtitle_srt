1
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,360
Sign this.

2
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,840
I promise you will never join the board.

3
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,400
That's impossible.

4
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,600
Look!

5
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,540
[He's showing his true form.]

6
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,930
Play tricks with me.

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
Same to you.

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,850
I'm sure everyone has made a decision.

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,039
This promise is invalid.

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:09,960
I...

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Okay. Okay. Okay.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,600
Okay.

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,320
It's okay if you don't recognize this one.

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,200
But this...

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,840
You stamped and stamped it.

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,370
the stamp and fingerprint.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,320
You have to admit it.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,160
Young Master Sheng.

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,640
Are you going to transfer all your shares

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,800
to Mr. Sheng?

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,960
Explain it to everyone.

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,600
What are you thinking?

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,039
Sheng Xi.

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,000
I want to see

25
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,920
your shares and Qiao Wan

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,840
which will you give up?

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,530
The anesthetic is working.

28
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,360
Put down the scalpel.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,360
Who are you?

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
Get out!

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,720
Don't delay my experiment.

32
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,840
You can't do experiments in your life.

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,520
Don't be stubborn.

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,800
Get out!

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,440
Get him to the hospital. Yes, sir.

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,920
Yes.

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,250
Untie me.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,040
Are you here to save me?

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,640
You're free!

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,329
Here we go. Let's go.

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,480
Thank you.

43
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
You know

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,680
who is more suitable to lead the group.

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,200
Congratulations.

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,460
You made a wise choice.

47
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,680
Everyone.

48
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,720
now,

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,079
or in the future,

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,520
I'll always be Sheng Zhe's biggest shareholder.

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,850
Who has any objections?

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,920
Objection!

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,000
Who are you?

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,360
How can you barge in?

55
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm Sheng Hua's secretary.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,060
My name is Qiao Wan.

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,200
I told you to stay at home.

58
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,280
I didn't mean to disturb the board.

59
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,560
to disturb the board.

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,890
I came to turn myself in.

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
Sung Huaikyung used me

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,720
to steal his fingerprints.

63
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,760
He had no idea.

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,200
So this letter of authorization

65
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,120
is invalid.

66
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,320
You know

67
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
what the consequences

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,680
the consequences?

69
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,920
I know very well.

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,800
And

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm willing to be investigated by the group

72
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,160
and be punished.

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,650
He can't escape either.

74
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,250
Qiao Wan, are you crazy?

75
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,600
What's so good about him?

76
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,200
worth doing this?

77
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,480
Okay.

78
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,120
Start the internal investigation now.

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,840
According to the rules.

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,560
Wait.

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,050
You haven't checked

82
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,740
the authenticity of the authorization letter.

83
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,840
Come in.

84
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,640
Mr. Sheng.

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,800
It’s a comparison. It’s a comparison.

86
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,760
The fingerprints on the document

87
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
is different from

88
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,820
are different.

89
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Young Master.

90
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,120
The fingerprint membrane is ready.

91
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,880
Whether it's for you or Qiao Wan,

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,360
I made a mistake.

93
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,880
Think about it.

94
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,100
Since the authorization letter is fake,

95
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,160
what you said is invalid.

96
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Uncle.

97
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,040
[You'd rather die]

98
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,160
you would rather

99
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,560
make a fake authorization letter to fool everyone.

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,840
Are you that afraid of me?

101
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,640
Sheng Xi.

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,520
Good for you.

103
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,840
Grandma, you're awake. You're awake. You're awake?

104
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
Old Madam.

105
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,840
Great.

106
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,560
You're lucky.

107
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,160
Your leg...

108
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,920
My old bones

109
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,880
in the gate of hell.

110
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,240
and almost died.

111
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,760
Even if we sit in wheelchair in the future

112
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
it's a blessing from heaven.

113
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,600
Dear directors,

114
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,240
I'm here to announce

115
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,920
my shares

116
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,720
all my shares

117
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,600
to Sheng Xi.

118
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,560
This...

119
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,000
What happened?

120
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,080
Old Madam.

121
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,000
Sung-hwa pretended to be Sung-taek?

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,930
You know, right?

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,600
I always knew.

124
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,680
I hid it for him.

125
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,800
You can blame me.

126
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Grandma.

127
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,160
Why did you do that?

128
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,160
Why did I do that?

129
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,880
You should all ask him

130
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
Sheng Huaijing killed me

131
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,520
He hurt me.

132
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,320
but you poisoned Sheng Hua several times.

133
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,480
That's right.

134
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,680
I want to take over the group.

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,320
[The current Sheng-hyuk]

136
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,880
[has deviated from the original intention of his father's creation.]

137
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,040
I want to correct it.

138
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,480
That's why I have to do this.

139
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Stop beautifying your ambition.

140
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,600
You've lost

141
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,840
the trust of all directors here.

142
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,920
Believe it or not,

143
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,800
Sheng-hyuk started from making plasters.

144
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,760
He became who he is thanks to the people.

145
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,960
Now,

146
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,720
it's time for Sheng-hyuk to return the society.

147
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,800
I'm not in a hurry.

148
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,640
This time,

149
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,560
I got the bid at a low price.

150
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,120
it proves my action.

151
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,680
Sheng Xi.

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,320
You didn't embarrass your father.

153
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,360
You all saw his ability, right?

154
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,560
The position of president has been vacant for too long.

155
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,890
Since everyone is here,

156
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,560
let's decide today.

157
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,000
I vote for Sheng Hua.

158
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,320
I agree.

159
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,720
Me too.

160
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,320
Mr. Lin.

161
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,600
Our shares would have surpassed him.

162
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
We'll be in charge of the group then.

163
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,040
We had a deal.

164
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,640
Think about it.

165
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,000
You can't let this young man

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,080
ride on your head.

167
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,440
Mr. Lin.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,040
I won't advise you anymore.

169
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,720
But you know best that

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
what kind of person

171
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,160
will be handed over to someone?

172
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,920
I agree to be the president.

173
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,600
Okay.

174
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,880
All votes. OK.

175
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,600
Now I announce

176
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Shengxi is officially appointed.

177
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,900
The president of Sheng Zhe Group.

178
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,880
In the future,

179
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,800
please call me Sheng Ze.

180
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,120
Mr. Sheng.

181
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,440
Mr. Sheng, we were attacked by Sheng Ze’s men.

182
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,600
and the director was caught by them.

183
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,360
Did you eat well today?

184
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,120
Yes.

185
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,200
Delicious, right?

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,880
Mom.

187
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,480
I'm going on a trip.

188
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,800
Are you here to see me off?

189
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
A trip?

190
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,640
It's all him.

191
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
who saved your mother.

192
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,380
and asked me to accompany her abroad for recuperation.

193
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,160
Your mother has been examined.

194
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,920
All indicators are normal.

195
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,280
I've arranged

196
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,340
to send her abroad for treatment.

197
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,480
Mom.

198
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
I'm leaving.

199
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,400
Let Penelope stay with you.

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Uncle Chang.

201
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,960
Thank you.

202
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,020
If you want to thank me,

203
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,320
thank him.

204
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,820
I just did what he told me to do.

205
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,520
What are you looking at?

206
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,400
Are we there?

207
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,320
Yes.

208
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,800
Did you set this up?

209
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,440
Yes.

210
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,280
You finally

211
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
what you want to do the most.

212
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,520
is drawing.

213
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,250
What I want to do the most

214
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,800
is this.

215
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,000
I only have one wish.

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
Can't you satisfy me?

217
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,840
As a president,

218
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,570
Can you stop being so childish?

219
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,000
Shouldn't you

220
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,640
listen to the president?

221
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,560
Secretary Qiao.

222
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,760
Alright.

223
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,080
Stop it.

224
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,280
Okay.

225
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,080
Do you want to know

226
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,920
why I have to take over the group?

227
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,400
Why?

228
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,680
Do you remember

229
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,980
you pushed me for a walk

230
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,200
to a slum.

231
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,930
I saw a few kids getting bitten by insects.

232
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,920
and were tortured.

233
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,960
That's when I realized

234
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
Sheng-hyuk is no longer the same Sheng-hyuk.

235
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
[I'm determined]

236
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,280
to be the president.

237
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,760
I want everyone

238
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,000
can still afford it.

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,280
our Chinese medicine.

240
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,800
So that time,

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,730
you pushed me there on purpose?

242
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,640
Thank you.
