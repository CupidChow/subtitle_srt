1
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,760
Hey, bro,

2
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,490
this isn't the way to the beach.

3
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,440
Use

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,760
Use that pig brain of yours and think.

5
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,040
Broaden your horizons.

6
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,090
Listening to that nasty woman.

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,400
We only take this.

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,840
If we give this to Sheng Huaijing,

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,040
we'll be set.

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,840
Got it?

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,840
You're brilliant, bro.

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,280
Hey, stop!

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,560
Who are you anyway?

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,380
Damn it. Someone's here to make trouble.

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,120
You fool with a death wish.

16
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,040
How did it go?

17
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm sorry,

18
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm late.

19
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,720
Sheng Ze,

20
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,080
thank you.

21
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,240
Watch out!

22
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,970
You're hurt.

23
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,770
Don't touch her.

24
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,320
Let's go home.

25
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,740
Let them go.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,240
I've dealt with these guys.

27
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,040
Uncle, please clean up the rest.

28
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,040
Mr. Sheng.

29
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,760
You're quite brave.

30
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,560
Got the guts of a lion.

31
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,220
Daring to touch someone under Mr. Sheng's protection.

32
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,610
Misunderstanding.

33
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
It's all a misunderstanding.

34
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,440
Mr. Sheng.

35
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
We were just about to send her to you.

36
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,040
We really didn't mean to harm her.

37
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,200
Is that so?

38
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,400
What's your opinion,

39
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,460
Mr. Sheng? How should we handle this?

40
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,280
Mr. Sheng, please spare me!

41
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,480
Mr. Sheng, have mercy!

42
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,280
Take him away.

43
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Mr. Sheng, please!

44
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,440
Move.

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,650
Hurry up.

46
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,680
Spare me!

47
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,360
Young Master is back.

48
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,640
Don't look.

49
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,880
Not suitable for children.

50
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,840
Uncle Chang.

51
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,620
That's enough.

52
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,010
What are you looking at?

53
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,160
Did you hit your head?

54
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,100
What are you doing?

55
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,680
When Young Master Sheng An was in pain before,

56
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,280
this is what I did.

57
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,400
I guess it's a conditioned reflex.

58
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,960
Gratitude aside,

59
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,840
I still want to know

60
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,360
why you followed me to church.

61
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,240
Yes.

62
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,320
I didn't go to church to pray.

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
I went to see my aunt.

64
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,480
The church is like home to me.

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,240
My aunt is my family.

66
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,800
Be gentle.

67
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,400
I still want to know

68
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,040
why you're investigating me.

69
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,740
This is how a master shows concern for a servant.

70
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,100
How can you call it an investigation?

71
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,420
Don't move.

72
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,860
Let me hold you for a while.

73
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,680
Ze

74
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,480
What are you doing?

75
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,280
Of course I'm taking you to play some exciting games.

76
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,120
Strong liquor to liven things up.

77
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,920
Try it.

78
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,880
This isn't right.

79
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,880
Wait.

80
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,320
You don't need to go this far.

81
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,100
You dared to send thugs to kidnap.

82
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,450
If I don't go big,

83
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
how can I satisfy your appetite?

84
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,880
I... what are you talking about?

85
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,810
I don't know.

86
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,290
Then remember this.

87
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,600
Qiao Wan

88
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,200
is not someone you can mess with.

89
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,240
I just wanted to teach her a lesson.

90
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,320
I was wrong.

91
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,040
Ze

92
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,480
Don't be fooled by this woman.

93
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Do you want to repeat An's mistakes?

94
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,460
Say that again. I dare you.

95
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,810
What's going on?

96
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,850
This isn't just for fun.

97
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,200
What did you put in it?

98
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,200
Nothing much,

99
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,050
just a little laxative.

100
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,280
Now,

101
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,010
no one will disturb you.

102
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,480
Enjoy.

103
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,520
Shengze, come back here!

104
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,000
Come back right now!

105
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,520
Ma'am,

106
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,650
you wanted to see me?

107
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,160
You may leave now.

108
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,720
Yes.

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,800
I heard Xiaoze got hurt again trying to save you.

110
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,680
Let me get straight to the point.

111
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,370
I'm dismissing you.

112
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,880
All right.

113
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,920
At least you understand.

114
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,680
Your birthday celebration is coming up soon,

115
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,740
you'll need staff.

116
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,560
I'll leave after the celebration.

117
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,320
Fine.

118
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,480
After the celebration ends,

119
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,080
you will leave quietly.

120
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,880
Don't appear in Xiaoze's life again.

121
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,040
Understand?

122
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,680
I understand.

123
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,820
Stay out of Xiaoze's life from now on.

124
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,960
Aren't you busy enough with company affairs?

125
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,890
Uncle, what brings you here today?

126
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,090
Listen to yourself.

127
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,920
I'm just checking on my nephew's health.

128
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,050
Is that not allowed?

129
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,050
Concerned about me?

130
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,930
About when I'll die?

131
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,680
You hired the best physical therapist and still look half-dead.

132
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,080
Might as well just amputate it.

133
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,040
So the old lady won't worry about you every day.

134
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,400
No hope means no disappointment.

135
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,770
Don't you agree?

136
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,040
I have no interest in fighting for succession rights.

137
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,840
My shares...

138
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,000
I can give them to you if you want.

139
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,360
Why are you still pressuring me?

140
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,520
Why am I pressuring you?

141
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,840
It's because

142
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,400
I want to help you get back on your feet quickly.

143
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,840
You...

144
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,970
Seems you're not faking it.

145
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,040
Good.

146
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,120
I hope you stay in that wheelchair.

147
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,100
Do you understand what I mean?

148
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,160
Mr. Sheng, we should leave now.

149
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,880
Hua.

150
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,120
I just thought of something interesting.

151
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,250
We'll find out soon.

152
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,120
Tonight,

153
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,840
there will definitely be a conclusion.
