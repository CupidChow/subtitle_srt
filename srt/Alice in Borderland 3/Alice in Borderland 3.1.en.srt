1
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:23,314
All surviving players
will be presented with two choices.

2
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:28,319
Players must now decide whether to accept
permanent residency in this country,

3
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,280
or decline it.

4
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,246
I decline.

5
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,668
I'm choosing not to stay here.

6
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,296
Same for me.

7
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,676
I don't want it.

8
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:57,599
PERMANENT RESIDENCE IN THIS LAND
ACCEPT / DO NOT ACCEPT

9
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,689
I accept. Naturally.

10
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,068
I'll gladly accept it as well.

11
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,365
There's still infinite potential
in this place.

12
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,720
I saw… a red light.

13
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,641
I figured…

14
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:45,897
I thought it was fireworks.
I didn't pay them much attention.

15
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,611
So my friends and I…
kept hiding in the bathroom for a while.

16
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,490
It's… pretty stupid, I guess.

17
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,033
But we hid there.

18
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:03,164
Then, everything…
became very quiet outside.

19
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,171
I don't remember anything else. That's it.

20
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,843
That's when you went into cardiac arrest.

21
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,345
Because of the meteorite
and the explosion, correct?

22
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,639
Yeah.

23
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,644
Do you remember anything after that?
Anything at all come to mind?

24
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,903
No, I'm sorry. I don't.

25
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:41,161
After the explosion occurred,
can you remember if you were dreaming?

26
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,872
Dreaming?

27
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,041
About games?

28
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,880
-Games?
-Yes, games.

29
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,382
Your life on the line.

30
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,593
Does that ring a bell?

31
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,897
Uh… no.

32
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,609
You didn't dream about games?

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,528
Uh… no, but…

34
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,031
But what?

35
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,037
I feel like I did dream,
but I was on a journey.

36
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,915
Tell me more.

37
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,544
Like I went off traveling

38
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,464
to some far-off place.

39
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,560
All right, that's enough for today.
You're free to go.

40
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,103
Thanks for your time.

41
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,692
Matsuyama, we have to be careful.
The process is delicate.

42
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,278
We run the risk
of implanting false memories.

43
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,821
We just have to try to be patient.

44
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,282
That's multiple survivors
who have mentioned games.

45
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,243
It's possible
those memories aren't accurate.

46
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,036
And he mentioned fireworks.

47
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,664
That's not the first time
we've heard it described that way.

48
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,916
That was probably the meteorite.

49
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,712
Deny it all you want.
They all saw the same thing.

50
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,643
I still can't believe a genius
like him is researching the afterlife.

51
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,769
He's finished.

52
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,605
He's a different man now, that's for sure.

53
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,233
The Shibuya meteorite changed everyone.

54
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,526
No, not that.

55
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,569
It's been five years.

56
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,405
A student of his died. Accident.

57
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,117
Oh. I didn't know.

58
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,165
There was nothing I could do.

59
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,960
If you could share your recollection
of the Shibuya meteorite incident.

60
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,379
-I'm sorry, I can't.
-Anything you remember.

61
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,091
I'm so sorry.

62
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,374
-The main hall is that way.
-Thanks.

63
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,251
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

64
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,377
Hello there.

65
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,634
That dream you mentioned about a journey…
I found it very interesting.

66
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,054
-You did?
-I would love to hear more about it.

67
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,013
Huh.

68
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,016
If you remember anything,
I'd appreciate you contacting me.

69
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,642
Okay. I will.

70
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,396
Anything at all, even if it seems silly.

71
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,358
What do you mean, "silly"?

72
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,736
Like, even if you think
no one else would believe you.

73
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,072
That sort of thing.

74
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,870
It's just down here.

75
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,545
Arisu!

76
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,716
Hey!
Hope you haven't been waiting too long.

77
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,885
Hey, you must be tired.

78
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,595
No, I'm okay. Are you good?

79
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,563
Oh, sorry. Uh, this is my wife.

80
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,691
This is Mr. Matsuyama.

81
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,194
-One of the professors here.
-Oh! Good to meet you.

82
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,530
My wife also had an interview here today.

83
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,449
So you were
also a victim of the Shibuya incident?

84
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,743
-That's right.
-I see.

85
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,164
Tell me something. Would you mind terribly
if I interviewed you next time?

86
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,794
-Uh, okay.
-My name is Ryuji Matsuyama.

87
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,842
ASST. PROFESSOR, DEPT. OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY

88
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,468
I'll be in touch then, miss.

89
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,555
Okay.

90
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,689
What did they ask you?

91
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,693
All sorts of things.
About my dreams, stuff like that.

92
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,155
Not that we could ever remember.

93
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,827
Ah! This university is the bomb!

94
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,537
Wish ours was…

95
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,833
Have you got news to your internship
at the counseling center?

96
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,460
Hmm… Pretty much.

97
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,380
I think after graduate school next year,
they're gonna officially hire me on.

98
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,299
Oh!

99
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,927
-Finally becoming a proper husband.
-Hey…

100
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,229

Shuto Aida.

106
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,700
For this investigation,

107
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,828
we interviewed ten people
who were in a comatose state.

108
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,207
We heard about their experiences.

109
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,376
And all of them…

COHORT STUDY ON TOKYO METEORITE SURVIVORS

111
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,297
…had the exact same dream.

112
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,675
An empty city.

113
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,969
A long journey.

114
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,222
Games.

115
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,933

MR. R, I FOUND A LEAD
THAT MAY INTEREST YOU

125
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,787
Whoa. They really
fixed up Shibuya fast, didn't they?

126
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,372
It's crazy.

127
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,040
Yeah, it's wild.

128
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,458
Yay!

129
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,919
What is that? Is that what you…

130
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,256
Oh, yeah.

131
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,015
This way, please.

132
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,944
Are you… Mr. R?

133
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:57,990
Yeah.

134
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,617
I am.

135
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,713
So, um,

136
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,383
this seminar.

137
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,386
You're hoping to attend as well, are you?

138
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:20,971
Yes.

139
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,557
Could you invite me to it?

140
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,560
I heard that getting a referral is tough…

141
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,189
Let me know when you're ready to order.

142
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,234
-Tea, please.
-And the same for me.

143
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,069
Right away.

144
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,699
So, Mr. R.

145
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,992
I don't recommend participating.

146
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,328
But you'll

147
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,581
understand when you do get there.

148
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,417
You'll know it's the real thing.

149
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,839
What kind of experiences did you have?

150
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,386
We do… strange things.

151
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,183
What do you mean by "strange"?
What kind of things?

152
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,771
Games.

153
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,068
Games?

154
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,113
Yes, games.

155
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,824
They can be… exciting.

156
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,203
They can be… sacred too.

157
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,887
In one week,
you will receive an invitation by email.

158
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,724
The location of the meeting
will be specified then.

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,647
WE LOOK FORWARD
TO YOUR ATTENDANCE, MR. R

164
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,724
Thank you all for coming.

165
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,519
Please. Take a seat.

166
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,793
Take a seat please, sir.

167
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,420
On that chair.

168
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,841
It would be best not to move
from the seat you've chosen.

169
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,995
Very well. Let us begin our game now.

170
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,664
Game?

171
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,043
I came here to have
a near-death experience.

172
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:47,923
You must win this game
to participate in the journey.

173
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,009
Journey?

174
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,056
Now, let us begin.

175
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,226
The game is Old Maid.

176
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,777
Please take your cards.

177
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:21,665
If there are pairs of cards in your hand,
you must discard them.

178
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,834
I've got a pair!

179
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,919
Whoever holds the Joker is the Old Maid.

180
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,423
And whoever holds the Joker
at the end of the game is the winner.

181
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,260
All right, then. You, start.

182
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,182
But be warned… when the Joker is drawn
from a player's hand,

183
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,267
that player will be eliminated.

184
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,519
Wait, what?

185
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,071
I thought I made myself clear.

186
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,991
It would be best not to move
from the seat you've chosen.

187
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,579
Because if you do…
you, too, will be eliminated.

188
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,041
She's dead.

189
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,921
She can't be. No way.
She's just pretending, huh?

190
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,463
This is starting to get interesting.

191
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,124
Oh my God!

192
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:31,104
There's no hope at this point, is there?
One of us will die.

193
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,804
Welcome… to the Borderlands.

194
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:37,999
Dad?

195
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,833
Are you okay?

196
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:21,960
Yeah.

197
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,009
You were having a bad dream.

198
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,512
You sure you're okay?

199
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,766
Yeah. I'm okay.

200
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,062
I'll get some water.

201
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,409
YUZUHA ARISU

202
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,661
RESIDENTIAL LEASE

203
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,290
We should probably think
about buying eventually, don't you think?

204
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,502
For that, we need to save money first.

205
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,045
Right.

206
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,256
We did splurge
on the wedding rings, after all.

207
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,635
True, yeah.

208
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,222
Look. Isn't this color kind of rare?

209
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,807
Oh yeah… I didn't mean to buy that one.

210
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,560
Well, I quite like this color.

211
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,562
Yeah? It's yours.

212
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,439
Really?

213
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,234
You need help moving?

214
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,403
No. I'll hire someone. I have to work too.

215
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,781
Arisu, will you take care of this?

216
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,949
Mm-hmm.

217
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,284
I should really get going.

218
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,079
-Take care!
-See you later.

219
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,418
Are you still brushing your teeth, Arisu?

220
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,129
-You'll be late. Hurry up!
-Mmm. Bye!

221
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,723
In other news,
police have discovered seven bodies

222
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,976
in an office block in Kōtō Ward, Tokyo.

223
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,771
Police say all seven were attending
a seminar when they died.

224
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,067
While there is some evidence to suggest
that it may have been a mass suicide,

225
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,860
the investigation continues.

226
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:17,534
The waterfront neighborhood
has gotten very popular with tourists.

227
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:21,079
We've already seen some start to visit,
and we're expecting more weekly.

228
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,582
Then a wide range of sizes would be best.

229
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,210
In Shinjuku and Shibuya, larger sizes that
don't sell at other stores do sell here.

230
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,169
-Ah! That's true!
-Yes.

231
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,546
You know, I didn't think of that.

232
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,552
Here's the referral letter.

233
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:39,306
This one's from a client affected
by the disaster at Shibuya.

234
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,601
Their PTSD has become chronic,

235
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,353
and flashbacks to the incident
seem to be getting stronger.

236
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,273
Right. Trauma from the meteorite.

237
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,443
-You can show them in.
-Got it.

238
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,738
Thank you for waiting.

239
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,907
Would you mind filling out
this questionnaire? No rush.

240
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,619
And don't forget your name and address.

241
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,749
Good morning. Thanks for your patience.

242
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,337
Would you mind coming next door?

243
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,853
Can I get you something to drink?

244
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,981
There's coffee, tea… We've got options.

245
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,651
And there's cold drinks if you'd prefer.

246
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,152
Arisu…

247
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,158
We've…

248
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,370
You and I have already met.

249
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,748
We have?

250
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,094
I know you. I've met you.

251
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,139
Some place very far from here.

252
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,017
No. I don't think so.

253
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,272
Among those who have had
near-death experiences,

254
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,734
there are many who said
they saw another world.

255
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,571
But what was it they saw there?

256
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,450
Was it hope, or did they see only despair?

257
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,163
You must have seen it

258
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,915
when you were near to death.

259
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,295
You must have memories of that world.

260
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,301
Arisu…

261
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,804
I see you've forgotten.

262
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,381
You don't remember.

263
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,843
I understand you might think
I'm out of my mind.

264
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:08,264
I know.
But that world between worlds exists.

265
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,726
You and I both were there.

266
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,104
We fought in that place, and we survived.

267
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,359
And because we survived,

268
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,570
we were able to return to this world.

269
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,554
But I can't remember everything.

270
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,264
I want to know what happened to us.

271
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,559
But here, there's only so much I can do.

272
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,604
I wanted to know if we could go back.

273
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,482
And I found a way.

274
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,194
We can return to that world
if we choose to.

275
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,075
If I administer a certain drug.

276
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,455
Thanks for your patience.

277
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,583
Please, take a seat.

278
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,886
INCOMING CALL
YUZUHA USAGI

279
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,223
You done at work?

280
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,308
Arisu…

281
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,352
Will I see you tonight?

282
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,525
Hey, Usagi.

283
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,527
Where are you?

284
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,822
Arisu…

285
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,533
Huh?

286
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,910
I'll come get you.

287
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,044
Usagi?

288
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,549
I'm sorry.

289
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,634
Wait. Where are--

290
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,940
We're sorry.
The person you are trying to reach is--

291
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,803
Usagi?

292
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,810
Usagi?

293
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,273
Based on the information
we received from you,

294
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,984
the Public Safety Division
is also looking into it.

295
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,405
Although I will say,
we haven't found anything suspicious yet.

296
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,742
Okay, but I called her company,
and they haven't heard from her either.

297
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:41,621
Uh-huh. We did find something
that we'd like for you to see.

298
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,748
Show him.

299
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,251
What we're looking at
is surveillance camera footage

300
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,212
from the hotel where
your wife was last seen.

301
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,425
It's a resort hotel near the waterfront.

302
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,599
Sir, do you know this man?

303
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,353
Yeah.

304
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,772
I met him a couple of weeks ago.

305
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,109
He's an assistant professor at Shushikan.

306
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,319
Did your wife also know this man?

307
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:18,366
We met him at the same time.
We were doing a study at the university.

308
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,205
So you're saying he kidnapped her, then?

309
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:29,210
No. There's another scenario
to consider, sir.

310
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,963
I don't want to be indelicate,

311
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,924
but is it at all… possible

312
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,760
she was having an affair
with this professor?

313
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,638
They did meet at a hotel.

314
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,057
And you told us they were acquainted.

315
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,102
This might be a possibility
for you to look into

316
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,272
before filing an official
missing persons report.

317
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,490
I'm looking for Professor Matsuyama.

318
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,033
My wife has disappeared.

319
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,744
And the last person
she saw was the professor.

320
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,706
Professor Matsuyama's also gone.

321
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,916
We lost contact with him
a couple days ago.

322
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,459
What?

323
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,967
The professor was absorbed
in very unusual research.

324
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,387
Near-death experiences,
the afterlife, things like that.

325
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,890
But he's not the type
to just take leave without notice.

326
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,642
So I wondered if something
had happened to him.

327
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,487
He was also investigating
various occult gatherings recently.

328
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,115
If I'm honest, I was getting worried.

329
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,116
MASS SUICIDES AND CULTS

330
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,242
NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES

331
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,786
Was your wife involved with a cult?

332
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,343
SHIGENORI USAGI COMMITS SUICIDE
FOLLOWING RUMORS OF STAGED CLIMB?

333
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,140
YUZUHA ARISU

334
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,650
YUZUHA ARISU: INTERVIEW

335
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,361
Do you have vivid dreams?

336
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,033
Pretty often, actually.

337
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,787
What kind of dreams do you have?

338
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,414
Give me as much detail
as you can remember.

339
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,882
I have the same dream, over and over.

340
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,885
This dream…

341
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,221
Is it more of a nightmare?

342
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,518
It's…

343
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,066
My father commit suicide.

344
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,319
I see.

345
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,531
Was there any bad blood between
you and your father?

346
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,283
Any unresolved issues?

347
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,451
Absolutely not.

348
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,539
My dad was wonderful.

349
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,334
Is it possible

350
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,879
you feel like you didn't get
to properly say goodbye?

351
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,550
Or is there something
you regret not telling him?

352
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,599
Don't push yourself.

353
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,980
It's all right. Please listen to me.

354
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,483
This is something
I can't tell anyone else.

355
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,403
Not even your husband?

356
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,907
I can't tell him.

357
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,160
Not even now.

358
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,124
I met my husband, we got married…

359
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,003
I should be moving forward
with him in life, you know?

360
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,966
But I can't stop thinking about my father.

361
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,561
When I dream,

362
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,606
I can feel him.

363
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,024
My father's presence.

364
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,777
As if he were still living and breathing.

365
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,158
And even if he dies in my dream,

366
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,952
even if it hurts…

367
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,375
Even if I have to watch
him die over and over…

368
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,169
If my dad is in my dreams…

369
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,726
Then, even if they're nightmares…

370
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,855
that's where I wanna go.

371
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:23,921
It's you. The player
who helped to beat every single game.

372
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,134
I became a citizen thanks to you.

373
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,726
I was hoping I'd meet you some day.

374
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,021
Won't you come back with me?

375
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,149
See that beautiful place again?

376
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,742
Pretty soon, you'll remember everything.

377
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,079
And when you do,
you'll return to that world.

378
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,376
Let's play a new game.

379
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:11,218
And by the way, your precious wife
will also be playing in the games.

380
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,221
The new games.

381
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,685
Let's have some fun.

382
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,125
Huh?

383
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,603
-How is she? What happened?
-She's currently in a coma.

384
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,814
But I wouldn't be surprised
if she went into cardiac arrest.

385
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:09,401
We don't know much yet.
No signs of struggle or resistance.

386
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,028
At least, not that we've found.

387
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,655
But the doctor's report suggests

388
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,574
the man who she was with made her
consume some sort of drug.

389
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,744
-What kind of drug?
-Might've been attempted suicide.

390
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,956
Doctor. They're here.

391
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,126
-You her husband?
-Yes.

392
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,504
I don't want to overwhelm you, sir,

393
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,298
but we performed standard
blood tests on your wife.

394
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,093
And it would seem that she is pregnant.

395
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:35,886
What?

396
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,557
It's still in the very early stages.
It wouldn't even have a heartbeat yet.

397
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,726
Your wife may not have even known herself.

398
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,812
Come with me.

399
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,590
Usagi…

400
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,012
Sir, this is the man we found
alongside her, comatose as well.

401
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,556
Would you mind taking a look?

402
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,902
You know him, don't you?

403
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,698
Maybe we could… have a quick word?

404
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:51,712
Tell us, are you aware
of the recent mass suicides?

405
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,339
The ones in Tokyo?

406
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,341
Not really.

407
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,803
So, what then?
You're saying this guy took my wife

408
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,514
and got caught up
in one of those mass suicide attempts?

409
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:06,602
This man had some apparent connection
to those "seminars."

410
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,813
We've confirmed their movements
from the hotel.

411
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:14,735
First off, she was taken
to the university where the man worked.

412
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:19,782
After that, they went together straight
to the building where they were found.

413
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,117
So what we're saying

414
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,496
is that there's a possibility
your wife was caught up in this.

415
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,001
I told you she might've been kidnapped.

416
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,422
I told you!
I told you this before, didn't I?

417
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,092
I know. I'm sorry.

418
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,721
But without evidence of a crime,
we can only do so much, sir.

419
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,563
Can we ask you, sir…

420
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:56,068
Would you mind checking
your wife's belongings for us?

421
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,361
Could you get that?

422
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,616
Uh… come take a look.

423
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,244
This is what your wife had on her.

424
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,621
Is there anything out of place?

425
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,549
Well?

426
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,427
Anything different, sir?

427
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,681
And by the way, your precious wife
will also be playing in the games.

428
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,270
Uh… Uh-uh.

429
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,274
What about that joker card?

430
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:21,236
The man who was with her,
Matsuyama, he had one just like it.

431
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,162
Even if it seems silly.

432
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,081
What do you mean, "silly"?

433
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:36,376
Like, even if you think
no one else would believe you.

434
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,003
No. I don't think so.

435
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,297
That world between worlds exists.

436
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,809
TAKINOGAWA SANATORIUM

437
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,605
A-choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo.

438
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,733
Choo-choo-choo…

439
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,860
-This way, please.
-Choo-choo…

440
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,571
Choo-choo! Choo-choo-choo…

441
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,997
My wife, she's

442
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,416
in a coma in the hospital.

443
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,794
And she's pregnant.

444
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,631
But her pulse is so weak, it's

445
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,008
just a matter of time.

446
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:31,348
There was a man.
He gave me one of these Jokers.

447
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,562
You said we had been to that other world.

448
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,689
We fought and lived.

449
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:41,483
And that's how
we returned to this world, isn't it?

450
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:46,113
The man who gave me this
said something… similar.

451
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,868
He might have her. My wife, my child.

452
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,995
He might take them to that place.

453
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,416
I know it might not make much sense.

454
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,963
But please, if there's a way
to bring my wife back here,

455
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,631
I'll do anything.

456
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,383
Help me, Ann.

457
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:15,809
Just two.

458
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:17,811
Huh?

459
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:23,191
From the time
that a person's heart stops beating

460
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,153
but before they actually die,

461
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,280
two minutes pass
where they're between life and death.

462
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:33,493
It varies from person to person a bit,
but for most it's about two minutes or so.

463
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,956
And then, you enter a special state,
which I believe

464
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,292
is a collective unconsciousness.

465
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,085
We experienced that world.

466
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,046
So if you go

467
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,299
and get her back safely
within two minutes,

468
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,136
she should be able to return.

469
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,806
Two minutes?

470
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,644
When we were in that place before,

471
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,146
our experience spanned days.

472
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,106
But our hearts

473
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,693
were only stopped
for a minute in the real world.

474
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,612
Does that make sense?

475
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,698
In the real world, time passes one way.

476
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,785
But in this collective unconsciousness
that we experienced,

477
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,411
time flows differently.

478
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,789
It's two minutes.

479
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,291
It's barely a moment for you.

480
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,669
There, you might fight a war.

481
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,508
Are you serious about this?

482
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,053
You came to me
because you do believe, don't you?

483
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,101
But this is all hypothetical, really.

484
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,769
I can't

485
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,397
say for sure that you'll come back.

486
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,732
What if I'm trapped there?

487
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,152
You'll die, obviously.

488
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,530
And they'll jail me for life.

489
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,491
Assisted suicide or murder charges.

490
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,921
Hello?

491
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,675
I see.

492
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,433
She's out of time.

493
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,900
I don't care what happens to me.

494
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,071
If there's a chance I can save Usagi,

495
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,323
I'll do whatever it takes.

496
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,507
INSULINACT

497
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,429
You're gonna use that?

498
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,723
Yes, it'll stop your heart.

499
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,308
For a time.

500
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,851
It'll stop my heart?

501
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:05,479
There's no time to second-guess. You in?

502
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,113
Two minutes.

503
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,074
Uh-huh.

504
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,924
Can you feel anything?

505
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,884
I don't think it worked.

506
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,972
We're running out of time, Ann!

507
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,314
The clock's stop--

508
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,577
Ann?

509
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,583
Ann?

510
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,947
PROCEED 15 KM SOUTH-SOUTHEAST
THE "GAME" STARTS AT SUNDOWN

511
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,049
Usagi?

512
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:30,225
THE "GAME" ARENA IS 6 KM AHEAD

513
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,581
"GAME" ARENA AHEAD

514
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,557
FRIED NOODLES

515
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,101
COTTON CANDY

516
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,073
Maximum capacity reached.

517
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,450
Registration is now closed.

518
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:56,955
A new team has been created
at Hikawa Shrine.

519
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,467
The game will now begin.
