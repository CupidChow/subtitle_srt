1
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,936
So it means that…
we've wasted another tank of oxygen?

2
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,815
Two gas cars remaining,
but only one canister left.

3
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,860
Which means that we can
never make it to the end.

4
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,373
We're gonna die.

5
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,670
Yeah? We are all definitely gonna die now.

6
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,300
-I'm sorry.
-Stop being sorry. It's not your fault.

7
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,012
I'm not blaming anyone.

8
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,639
I know this is my own fault.

9
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,853
But why on earth

10
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,773
did I listen to you
and bet my life on your hunch?

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,358
You're only the daughter of a liar.

12
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,403
Ugh! I hate myself for that!

13
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,989
Because I knew that
she was the daughter of a cheat!

14
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,824
Calm down!

15
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,950
Juri!

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,703
Please, you have to calm down!

17
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,915
What's the point? Huh?

18
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,170
Why me? Why?
Tell me! Why is it I have to die now?

19
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,810
Guys. I've got something to say.

20
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,816
The train just passed
through Jinbōchō Station.

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,444
And that means we'll soon reach
the point where the trains run parallel.

22
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,488
And that means that,

23
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,199
presuming the other train
is at the same speed, well, then,

24
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,619
they'll line up side by side.

25
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,081
What the hell are you talking about?

26
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,836
I get it. Is that the only option left?

27
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,004
Hmm.

28
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,801
-You really want us to jump across?
-What?

29
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:19,389
The players in that front car were
all dead. Oxygen doesn't matter.

30
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,308
The gas has already been released.
And the doors are open.

31
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,393
But we'll never make it!

32
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,605
We either do nothing and die here,
or we can fight to the end!

33
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,649
Impossible. We'll never make it!

34
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,027
Come with me if you want to live.

35
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,101
Count me in.

36
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,523
Mister, are you stupid or what?

37
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,026
Look at yourself.
How the fuck will you make it?

38
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,194
Have you gone crazy?

39
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,533
Timing is everything.

40
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,953
The train is almost here!

41
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,044
Don't worry. I know you can do it.

42
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,422
You've got this, okay?
Believe in yourself.

43
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,051
I got it… I got it. I can do it.

44
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,388
-I'm with you. You can make it.
-I can do it.

45
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,226
It's here.

46
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,992
Get ready!

47
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,081
Now!

48
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,048
Move!

49
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,926
I can do it! Here I go! Here I go!

50
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,138
Move your ass!

51
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,647
You died because she's a liar!

52
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,898
Out of my way!

53
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,568
Jump, Ryuji!

54
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,652
Hurry up!

55
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,913
Grab him, quick!

56
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,795
Help me. Help me, please.

57
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,554
You okay?

58
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,777
There's another train approaching!

59
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,702
Arisu!

60
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,787
Usagi!

61
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,965
Watch out!

62
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,426
Usagi!

63
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,511
Arisu!

64
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,888
Usagi!

65
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,906
She was with a guy.

66
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,199
-Hey!
-Oh.

67
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,956
The end of the line is approaching.

68
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,708
Please stop the train.

69
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,168
We have to stop the train!

70
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,003
Does anyone know how to stop it?

71
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,588
Why are you looking at me?

72
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,131
It's the end of the line!

73
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,260
-We have to do something, quick!
-No time!

74
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,595
-We can't make it!
-Hang on!

75
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,642
That's the accelerator!

76
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,727
Then this one?

77
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,983
It's too late! We're gonna crash!

78
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,771
Hey! Look! What about these?

79
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,525
Maybe… you can use them?

80
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:53,449
These are support braces.
Might be useful during a game.

81
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,409
-Thank you, Taro.
-Any time.

82
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,370
Look! We found one!

83
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,373
We found one!
Ryuji, look. We found you one.

84
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,209
Awesome.

85
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,628
-Would you like to try it?
-Sure.

86
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,797
All together.

87
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,215
One, two…

88
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,925
Lift. Careful.

89
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,427
Okay, there you go.

90
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,186
Arisu! Hang in there. Keep going!

91
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,618
Arisu…

92
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,830
Tetsu, you're the only one
who can save him.

93
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,998
Stitch him up.

94
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,252
What are you talking about?
I've never done that before!

95
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,670
You can do it.

96
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,882
You stopped the bleeding and saved my leg.

97
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,261
Look! I can almost walk now.

98
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:59,223
Sure, I can stop someone from bleeding!
But this isn't the same thing at all!

99
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,728
Okay, this was
all I could find at the store.

100
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,146
-It's a sewing kit.
-What?

101
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,524
-You wanna stitch him with that?
-That's it. That's all I could find.

102
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,192
Tetsu, please try!

103
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,902
Please, try.

104
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,615
I also found some water
and alcohol to sterilize it.

105
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,909
Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up!

106
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,286
He's dying!

107
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,123
Arisu! Arisu!

108
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,715
-Aah!
-What the hell?

109
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,884
That's to disinfect his wound!

110
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,261
It stops the shakes.

111
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,143
Why don't you get some sleep?

112
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,479
And what about you?

113
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,732
You were crying.

114
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,207
I can't sleep.

115
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,754
I keep having the same dream.

116
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,385
Something happened that you can't forget?

117
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,139
I was…

118
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,059
fascinated by death for too long.

119
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,104
And one day…

120
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,152
I crossed a line
I should never have crossed.

121
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,739
And there was no turning back.

122
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,407
That's everything for today.

123
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,955
Professor Matsuyama?

124
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,000
I had the chance to read your paper.

125
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,418
I found it very interesting.

126
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,964
So, are you interested
in research about mental illness?

127
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,508
Not really.

128
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,719
I was more interested in the part
about stimulating the temporal lobe,

129
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,514
and how it can reproduce
near-death experiences.

130
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:39,068
Well, looks like you are the only person
in the entire university who's interested.

131
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,780
I read in an article somewhere
that, through near-death experiences,

132
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,698
we might get a glimpse of the afterlife.

133
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,661
Yano, do you really believe
a land for the dead exists?

134
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,747
I'd need to have
a tangible experience first.

135
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,999
-Tangible?
-Yes.

136
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,586
I hope someday you'll prove that
the land of the dead exists, Professor.

137
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,215
I'm afraid there's
only one way to prove it.

138
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,758
What way is that?

139
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,096
You would have to simulate
a near-death experience.

140
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,482
How about this?

141
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,863
The side effects of that drug
haven't been clinically tested yet.

142
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,712
Professor?

143
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,215
I've made up my mind. I wanna try it.

144
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,385
Too early.

145
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,808
Don't you wanna discover
a world that nobody else knows?

146
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,478
Yes, of course, but… it's too dangerous.

147
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,858
I accept the risk. I wanna visit
the land of the dead no matter what.

148
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,736
Professor, I'm begging you.

149
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,070
Please let me try.

150
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,671
Yano?

151
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,882
Yano?

152
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:50,968
Yano!

153
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:51,927
Yano, wake up!

154
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,571
A medical student has died

155
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,157
while conducting an experiment
at Shushikan University…

156
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,619
-The cause was a drug overdose…
-…if it was suicide or foul play.

157
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,373
The professor in charge of the department
was suspected of assisting the suicide

158
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,625
but has not been prosecuted
due to insufficient evidence…

159
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,129
News is now coming in about
a serious road accident near Fuchū…

160
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,924
The driver of the car, a man in
his thirties, was discovered unconscious…

161
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,262
-He is in critical condition.
-…accident or attempted suicide.

162
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,432
There's a rumor on campus
that Professor Matsuyama's car accident

163
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,268
was a suicide attempt
after that incident with his student.

164
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,187
I heard his heart had stopped beating.

165
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,356
Well, I guess he finally got to
discover the land of the dead after all.

166
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,776
That's one way of doing it!

167
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,870
AFTERLIFE, SHARED CONSCIOUSNESS

168
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,580
NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES

169
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,915
NOT BOUND BY TIME

170
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,709
WHEN THE SUBJECT'S HEART STOPS…

171
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,171
…ONCE RESUSCITATED,
THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS RETURNS…

172
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,205
I learned that once you cross that line…

173
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,375
there's no way back.

174
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,012
There's always a way back.

175
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,019
Since coming back to this place,

176
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,480
I learned something important.

177
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,278
All of our wounds…

178
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,657
become our reasons to live.

179
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,748
You believe that?

180
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,342
Let's go back to our world together.

181
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,364
Arisu?

182
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,367
Oh! Arisu!

183
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,872
Thank God you're awake!

184
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,874
I'm sorry.

185
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,755
The new game… when does it begin?

186
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,134
At sunset today.

187
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,807
We're going to be late.

188
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,685
Kid… You're not ready yet.

189
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,157
Go ahead without me.

190
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,285
There's no way we're leaving you here.

191
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,164
It's true.
Arisu, we can't leave you here all alone.

192
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,710
Twice you saved me, Arisu.
The fortunes game, and the zombie game.

193
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,837
And me too.

194
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,340
Well, I suppose

195
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,259
you kinda saved me too.

196
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,597
And me too.

197
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,317
Attention, all players.

198
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,112
The semifinals are about to begin.

199
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,782
Players who survive this game

200
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,077
will be invited
to participate in the final.

201
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,123
Game, Tokyo Bingo Tower.

202
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,778
Game rules.

203
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,614
Play bingo on the Tokyo Tower.

204
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,326
Players must climb the Tokyo Tower

205
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,330
and press the different buzzers
installed at various points on the way.

206
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,873
You must complete a vertical,

207
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,126
a horizontal, or a diagonal line
on your bingo card

208
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,212
in order to clear the game.

209
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,631
Work together as a team.

210
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,092
-And complete your bingo card.
-I got you.

211
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,594
Look at me. Relax, Yuna. Calm down.

212
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,888
Make your way up slowly.

213
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,640
Easy. One step at a time.

214
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,558
Let's go!

215
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,359
Players, at the very top of the tower,
you will find a free buzzer

216
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:25,529
corresponding to the free space
at the center of the bingo card.

217
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,947
Good luck, everyone.

218
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,810
Game, Kick the Can.

219
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,646
Can one, start!

220
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,742
Whoa!

221
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,247
-Oh shit!
-Game rules.

222
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,999
Before your time runs out,

223
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,751
return the can
to its original starting spot

224
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,920
and insert the can into its base.

225
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,047
What? Whoa!

226
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,716
Oh!

227
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,094
-There are a total of ten cans.
-Hey, move it!

228
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,014
So, only ten of us can
make it through the game.

229
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,307
What?

230
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,018
Ah…

231
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,067
What the hell?

232
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,362
It seems like the escalators
have been shut down.

233
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,864
Ugh. That way!

234
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,205
Oh, what the fuck? There's no way through.

235
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,289
Shit!

236
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,875
-This one's closed too!
-Let me try!

237
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,627
Son of a bitch!

238
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,628
Damn it!

239
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,588
-Where is it?
-I don't see it.

240
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,797
-There, anything?
-No.

241
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,549
-Check in there!
-This way, come on!

242
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,229
Oh!

243
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,355
Gotcha!

244
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,774
The can is also a time bomb.

245
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,692
Safety mechanism deactivated.

246
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,778
Gotta go! Right now!

247
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:35,200
The countdown on the time bomb begins from
the moment someone is holding the can.

248
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,077
Fuck that!

249
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,544
The moment you release the can,
the timer resets

250
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,379
and a new countdown begins.

251
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,091
Damn it, I lost five seconds!

252
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:56,555
Every time the owner of the can changes,
the time limit decreases by five seconds.

253
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,474
Twenty seconds remaining.

254
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,560
Wait up!

255
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,937
What? No, no, no, no, no!

256
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,106
The can will be wasted
if nobody takes it, lady!

257
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,482
-But I can't!
-Get moving!

258
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,359
Reset. Fifty seconds.

259
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,819
-Run!
-This way!

260
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,903
-Go on!
-Hey, you!

261
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,530
-Catch her!
-We found it!

262
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,198
-Leave me alone!
-Stop!

263
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,579
-Leave me alone!
-Where do you think you're going?

264
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,915
-Reset. Fifteen seconds remaining.
-Give it to me! Get outta my way!

265
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:31,631
-Ten seconds remaining.
-Let go!

266
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,681
I made it!

267
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,066
First can. Game over.

268
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,863
Since the can has exploded,
no player has cleared the game.

269
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,866
Only nine cans left now.

270
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,787
Second can. Start.

271
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,398
Look out!

272
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,451
In this game, we've got no chance
of winning if we go it alone.

273
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,412
-We can relay the can between teammates.
-Natsu!

274
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,956
-Make sure someone makes it back to base.
-Rei!

275
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,085
-No chance!
-Gimme that can!

276
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,129
-Natsu, take it!
-I got her!

277
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,924
Reset. Fifty seconds remaining.

278
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,845
-Reset. Forty-five seconds remaining.
-Run, big sis!

279
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,472
-Outta my way!
-Run!

280
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,474
-Get the hell off of me!
-Got it!

281
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,852
-Nine cans left and eight of us.
-Get her!

282
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,562
-I see her!
-Got you!

283
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,022
Hey!

284
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,565
Got her! Easy…

285
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,318
-Bitch!
-Let go of it!

286
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,903
-Gimme the damn can!
-Give it!

287
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,613
-Shion!
-I got it! I got it!

288
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,490
-Arisu!
-Throw it!

289
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,922
Second can, game over.

290
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:41,302
During the game, cans will explode
if they are subject to intense impact.

291
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,304
Shit!

292
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,557
Eight cans left.

293
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,186
Nobu, get it!

294
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,690
-Arisu!
-Take it!

295
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,775
Reset.

296
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,318
Fifty seconds remaining.

297
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,905
Leave him alone, assholes!

298
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,991
Arisu!

299
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,745
They're getting away! Catch 'em! Quick!

300
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,872
Kazuya!

301
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:14,085
It's us or them, that's all!
Either they die, or we die!

302
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,546
-Run! There's no time!
-Get him!

303
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,922
Run!

304
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,924
He's right! Let's go, come on!

305
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,010
Hurry! Move it!

306
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,887
Get out of the way!

307
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,349
Gimme the damn can!

308
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,685
I gotcha! I gotcha!

309
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,772
-Give it!
-Give me the can!

310
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,732
Sachiko! Here!

311
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,609
Why give it to me?

312
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,069
Reset.

313
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,197
Twenty seconds remaining.

314
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,324
Oh, no you don't!

315
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,159
Lady, give it here! Pass!

316
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,453
What the hell?

317
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,039
-Oh, let me go!
-Stop her!

318
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,916
-Ten seconds remaining.
-Let me go!

319
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,128
-No! It's mine!
-Go on, Sachiko!

320
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,348
Third can. Game cleared.

321
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,809
Congratulations.

322
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,521
Thank you, Tetsu.

323
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,690
Ladies first, right?

324
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,692
Ow!

325
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:27,325
Players who clear the game are asked
to please wait in the elevator.

326
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,202
That's one person saved.

327
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,301
Seven cans left.

328
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,900
Himari!

329
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,238
Usagi! Help me!

330
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,282
Ryuji! I'm gonna help her.

331
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,072
Himari!

332
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,667
You're gonna be okay.
Take my hand. You're gonna be fine.

333
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,685
-I got you!
-Usagi!

334
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,565
Himari!

335
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,750
Hang on!

336
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,371
-Are you doing okay?
-Yeah.

337
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,290
Don't worry about me.

338
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,252
We're gonna make it together.

339
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,842
Leave her alone!

340
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,469
Back off!

341
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,389
Hey!

342
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,018
Get your hands off her, you piece of shit!

343
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,769
Take the can!

344
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,937
Take it. Run!

345
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,940
-We can clear it together!
-Reset.

346
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,151
-Fifty seconds remaining.
-Let go of me, bitch!

347
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,527
Fuck you, asshole!

348
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,537
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Wait!

349
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,165
Wait! I'm sorry! Let go of the can!

350
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,750
-Please!
-Get off her!

351
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,627
Leave her alone, you bastard!

352
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,588
Leave me alone!

353
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,051
Huh?

354
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,594
-Tetsu!
-What?

355
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,429
-Run!
-Huh?

356
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,181
Just run! Get outta here!

357
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,184
That can is mine, asshole!

358
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,692
Yes!

359
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,946
-No way! Come on! It's a fake! Fuck!
-Huh? Asshole!

360
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,623
So, there you are!

361
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,666
Get back here!

362
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,044
Hand it over!

363
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,339
Let go! Give it to me!

364
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,603
Shion!

365
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,189
No!

366
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,707
Big sis?

367
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,086
What have you done?

368
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,968
No…

369
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,896
What is this shit?

370
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,525
What the fuck is going on?

371
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,361
Tetsu, calm down.

372
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,489
I am calm. I'm fine. I'm perfectly calm.

373
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,492
-You have to stay positive.
-Shut up!

374
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,622
Let's get to it.

375
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,029
Yes!

376
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,837
Yuna! Stop looking down.

377
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,589
Eyes on me.

378
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,301
I can't go on anymore! I can't!

379
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,263
Keep going.

380
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,974
If we don't keep going,
the balls will target us.

381
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,893
And if we don't press the buzzers,
we can't clear the game.

382
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,272
Yuna… grab on to the rope, okay?

383
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,607
I've got you. You're gonna be okay.

384
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,150
Grab it.

385
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:02,613
That's it!
You're doing great! Don't look down!

386
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,356
-Are you okay?
-Yeah!

387
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,033
Forget about me. Just keep going.

388
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,619
I got this. I'm gonna clear the game.

389
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,586
Fifth can. Start.

390
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,879
Come and try!

391
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,506
Arisu!

392
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,300
You bastard! Give it to me!

393
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,260
Don't let him escape!

394
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,313
Rei, take it! Run!

395
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,815
Little girl! Come here!

396
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,987
-Stay where you are!
-Rei! Go!

397
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,328
Fifth can. Game cleared.

398
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,747
Thank you.

399
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,212
Sixth can. Start.

400
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,968
Nobu, Nobu!

401
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,097
Natsu!

402
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,266
Tetsu!

403
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,989
Nobu, over here!

404
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,951
Ten seconds remaining.

405
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,661
Give me the can!

406
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,663
-Give it to me!
-Run! Go!

407
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,665
Okay!

408
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,212
Seventh can. Game cleared.

409
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,673
I'm sorry…

410
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,092
I'm sorry!

411
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,597
Three cans left.

412
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,391
And there's three of us left.

413
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,101
Yeah.

414
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:42,606
I'm gonna win this time.
I'll win for big sis.

415
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,737
Thirty seconds remaining.

416
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,002
Twenty seconds remaining.

417
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,891
Reset. Thirty-five seconds remaining.

418
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,524
Reset. Thirty seconds remaining.

419
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,322
I'm gonna kill you!

420
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,954
It's mine!

421
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,917
Reset. Twenty-five seconds remaining.

422
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,922
Reset. Twenty seconds remaining.

423
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,933
Reset. Fifteen seconds remaining.

424
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,434
Get the fuck off me!

425
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,025
Reset.

426
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,944
Ten seconds remaining.

427
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,279
Gotcha! That can's mine!

428
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,366
Give it to me! Let go of my can!

429
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,535
-Let go!
-Hands off!

430
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:19,662
It's mine!

431
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,793
No!

432
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,882
Eighth can. Game over.

433
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,386
It can't be… Natsu…

434
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,682
It can't be.

435
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,601
I can't take this!

436
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,357
They're the last two left…

437
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,659
-One more to go.
-One more!

438
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,879
Help me! Help me! I don't wanna die!

439
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,465
Watch out!

440
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,509
Taro!

441
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,198
Hey! Gimme that!

442
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,787
Punk!

443
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,457
Hey!

444
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,794
-Twenty seconds remaining.
-Go first! Take it!

445
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,545
Arisu, leave now! Get outta here!

446
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,924
-You broke my arm!
-I said go!

447
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,307
-Stop him!
-Catch him!

448
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,816
Let me go, you bastard!

449
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,654
-Ten seconds remaining.
-Go!

450
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,989
There's no time! Run!

451
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,912
You can do it!

452
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:07,913
Go!

453
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,296
Ninth can. Game cleared.

454
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,928
We're even now, kid.

455
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,766
Don't worry about me.

456
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,436
There's one more can left.

457
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,021
I'll see you later.

458
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,691
Kazuya…

459
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,706
Safety mechanism deactivated.

460
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,169
It's mine!

461
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,089
No! Damn you!

462
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,932
-Kazuya!
-Kazuya!

463
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,060
-Run!
-Come on, you can do it!

464
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,979
-Run! You can make it!
-Go, Kazuya!

465
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,105
Go, Kazuya!

466
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,607
-What?
-Kazuya!

467
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,277
Give it!

468
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,965
-No!
-Shit!

469
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,842
Open the door!

470
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,303
-Stop it!
-Kazuya!

471
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,682
It's mine!

472
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,271
I got it! I got it!

473
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,234
You're going nowhere!

474
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,623
Fuck it!

475
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,595
Come on!

476
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,389
Let go of it, asshole!

477
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,020
Where you going?

478
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,630
Ten seconds remaining.

479
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,686
Kazuya!

480
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,769
Bingo.

481
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,860
CONGRATULATIONS

482
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,187
Are you starting to enjoy this place now?

483
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,191
I did what I promised.
I brought Usagi this far.

484
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,234
The next game will be the last one.

485
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,905
I'll need your help to ensure
Arisu stays here forever.

486
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,158
All this trouble for just one man?

487
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:23,080
This one man led us to clear
all the stages in the previous games.

488
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:26,374
And it's thanks to him
that I've become a citizen of this world.

489
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,878
Arisu will be perfect in this place.

490
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:35,133
Who are you? What do you want?

491
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,556
Are you the Joker?

492
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,815
I've experienced your world.
I've memorized everything.

493
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,943
If there's a person or an entity
that governs the land of the dead,

494
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,152
then I wanna know about it.

495
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,863
You're being too greedy.

496
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,534
You should concentrate
on what I've asked you to do.

497
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,494
Your job's not done yet.

498
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,378
In the final game, I want you to kill her.

499
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,006
Then, your work here will be done.

500
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,555
If you kill that woman,
no reason to return,

501
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,557
and he'll remain in this world.

502
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,519
And if I do what you ask of me?

503
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:37,445
If you kill Usagi,
I promise to grant your wish.

504
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,290
I promise you will learn
about who governs the afterlife.

505
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,751
I promise you will learn
about the land of the dead.

506
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,046
A world beyond your wildest dreams.

507
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,799
After that, you can do as you please.

508
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:02,971
You can become a citizen of this world,
or you can return to your own world.

509
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:09,394
To be honest,
I think you got a pretty good deal.

510
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,618
You know,
you really shouldn't use this place

511
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,870
as your own personal playground.

512
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:31,082
I was happy to become a citizen here.
But all the good players are gone.

513
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:35,712
I have learned that the only way to enjoy
this world is to have the best players.

514
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,839
I have to agree.

515
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,885
It so happens that, on my side,
there are no good players either.

516
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,013
We're going to need
good players in this world.

517
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:50,644
I hear you, but… let's be honest,
you're still enjoying yourself.

518
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,314
Hm. Maybe.

519
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,503
So this is it? The final game.

520
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,587
"GAME" ARENA THIS WAY

521
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,885
So, Shibuya is the final game arena.

522
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,430
Let's hope that we can make it out alive.

523
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,101
If I don't make it,
I hope you'll remember me now and then.

524
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,771
I wouldn't count on it.

525
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,856
Jeez, man.

526
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,484
You better not forget about me either.

527
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,029
You're someone no one could ever forget.

528
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,619
If, in the end, the only way out is
betrayal, no hard feelings, okay?

529
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,205
That's life, I guess.

530
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,168
Ready?

531
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,090
Let's do this.

532
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,947
I've got a really bad
feeling about this one.

533
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,991
Who goes first?

534
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,129
Ladies first, madam.

535
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,756
Age before beauty.

536
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,275
Huh?
