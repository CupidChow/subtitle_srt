1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,799
Was there a Vaccine card?

2
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,676
No. It was all for nothing.

3
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:11,886
What do we do now?

4
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,397
What's wrong?

5
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,315
You don't look so good.

6
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,945
-I… I'm fine.
-No lying, now.

7
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,450
Be honest.
Did someone turn you into a zombie?

8
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,289
I… Yeah. I was infected.

9
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,417
-He was trying to hide it!
-No! I was just about to tell you.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,919
And besides, I remember
the face of the guy who did this to me.

11
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,673
Then let's fucking kill him.

12
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,385
You. You're up next.

13
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,264
-Go kill that zombie.
-Me?

14
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,060
No. Send someone else.

15
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,771
This one's practically still a kid.

16
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,982
It's okay. Pick someone else.

17
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,236
Bro, how is that fair for the people who
already had to use their Shotgun cards?

18
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,076
What, you think anybody here
actually wants to take a life, huh?

19
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,788
No one should be forced to kill anyone.

20
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,336
You think you're better than us? Hmm?

21
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,714
I bet you've killed someone
in a game before.

22
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,059
Surviving these games is impossible
without some sacrifice.

23
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,689
Go on.

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,026
No. Stay!

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
Arisu!

26
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,196
-What the hell?
-Hold him down!

27
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,825
Now, if you don't go,

28
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,286
we'll shoot this guy instead.

29
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,292
Don't… do it.

30
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,547
Please, Ikeno.
There's gotta be another way.

31
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,099
Show your cards.

32
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,158
I'm sorry.

33
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,623
I'm so sorry.

34
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,014
Four rounds remain.

35
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,434
Please choose your opponent
and touch them.

36
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,246
You took your sweet time.

37
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,709
Yeah.

38
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,211
Did you do it?

39
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,302
Yeah, it's done.

40
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,687
Good job, kid. Yeah!

41
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,607
Clap for him. Clap!

42
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,944
Ah-he-hem!

43
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,113
Way to go!

44
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,054
Where's Nobu?

45
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,306
Oh, he said he was coming right back.

46
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,288
Nobu?

47
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,380
-Stop!
-Hey.

48
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,090
Let go of me!

49
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,099
This guy…
he turned that kid into a zombie.

50
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,517
What kid?

51
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,105
-Nobu's a zombie now?
-Yeah, that's right.

52
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,606
Not Nobu…

53
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,901
Well, where did he go?

54
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,238
I saw him! He went off that way, alone.

55
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,032
That son of a bitch.

56
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,493
Bring him back!

57
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,537
-Got it!
-Let's go!

58
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,332
The zombies are trying
to hide their infections.

59
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,211
Like Masato did. Nobu too, same thing.

60
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,672
Maybe there's even more zombies among us…

61
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,634
Yeah, you're right.

62
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,012
Some of you are suspicious.

63
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,526
N… no.

64
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,986
No! I'm not, no!

65
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,363
Wait, hang on! He's just…

66
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,740
It's symptoms of drug withdrawal.

67
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,953
Boss, what about the girl
who started all this? She's a zombie.

68
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,541
Come to think of it… where did she get to?

69
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,043
What if she's…

70
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,172
Maybe the zombies have been spying on us.

71
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,299
What?

72
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:50,011
Well, do we even know
if she has a Vaccine card?

73
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,180
What if it was all a lie?

74
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:57,310
Yeah, what if her plan was to infect
a bunch of us the whole time she was here?

75
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,478
Huh?

76
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,072
The game's almost over now, anyway.

77
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,995
I don't think we need the zombies
in order to win.

78
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,998
If you find a zombie in here,
just shoot 'em.

79
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,020
Sh!

80
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,982
What are you doing?

81
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,734
-What?
-Come on, let's go.

82
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,153
-They're not going to…
-No…

83
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,574
-Let's go.
-You're hurting me!

84
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,206
-He's getting away!
-Stop! Someone get him!

85
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,224
Hey!

86
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,187
Just a sec.
Uh, I need you to do me a favor.

87
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,106
What favor?

88
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,817
Can… can you… use your vaccine on me?

89
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,361
He's here!

90
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,241
-No. No, please, don't! Don't kill me!
-Stop running!

91
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,617
Don't! Get away from me!

92
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,536
Get up.

93
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,705
Three rounds remain.

94
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,125
Please choose your opponent
and touch them.

95
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,588
Fuckin' zombies.

96
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,090
Let's shoot them all!

97
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,009
Get up!

98
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,856
Please play your cards.

99
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,343
Nobu.

100
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,013
You're a zombie, aren't you?

101
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,182
Huh?

102
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,559
I can tell.

103
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,729
Listen.

104
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,482
I need you to do exactly what I say.

105
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,404
It's too bad, you know?

106
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,615
I really thought
you'd have figured it out by now.

107
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,493
How far the infection has
actually spread out there.

108
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,705
From where I'm sitting, you might be
better off as a zombie after all.

109
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,582
What?

110
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,043
How could you possibly know that?

111
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,631
Because I know that humans
are emotional creatures.

112
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,175
It takes a lot to shoot someone.

113
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,803
And those Vaccine cards are so precious.

114
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,389
You think they'd just
use one on a stranger?

115
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,101
And while the little humans
hold on to their cards,

116
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,937
the zombies will multiply and multiply.

117
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,564
And once you're infected,

118
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,527
there'd be no reason to hold off
on using your Zombie card to win.

119
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,990
When the game started,
there were four zombies.

120
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,743
If the infection were
to grow exponentially,

121
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,162
which is what
math would tell us to expect,

122
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:49,166
to go from four zombies to a majority
of the players would take

123
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,002
three rounds.

124
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,508
Isn't it obvious
which side has the advantage?

125
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,846
Mmm, not fallin' for that.

126
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,348
Why would I believe ya?

127
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,643
Whether you believe me or not is
completely besides the point.

128
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,146
Either you're gonna shoot me and I'll die,

129
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,315
which gives you
a couple more rounds before you're killed,

130
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,610
or you accept my deal now.

131
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,905
You become a zombie, and you survive.

132
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,722
Show your cards.

133
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,786
It's tempting.

134
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,996
But I'm gonna pass on your deal.

135
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,685
No.

136
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,062
Masato…

137
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,649
-We're too late.
-We're not gonna make it.

138
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,317
Rei'll be next.

139
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,444
-We're finished!
-Nobu.

140
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,821
-We're gonna die!
-Nobu!

141
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,157
Remember what I told you.

142
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,842
We're in charge. We're gonna win.

143
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,261
At what cost?

144
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,055
This has gone too far!

145
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:12,393
The zombies want to kill us
because we killed their teammates.

146
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,811
But we don't have to be scared.

147
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:18,190
You know zombies don't have a way
to kill humans in this game.

148
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,820
Although if you do wanna die,
you can get infected any time you want.

149
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,660
Those guys are losing it.
We gotta get out of here.

150
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,540
Nobu! Hey, Nobu!

151
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,042
Hurry! Stay down!

152
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,589
What's going on?

153
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,549
You gotta listen to me.

154
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,937
What's wrong?

155
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,363
Bitch tricked us.

156
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,724
Rei…

157
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,067
You're not dead.

158
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,697
Two rounds remain.

159
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,076
-Choose your opponent and touch them.
-We gotta find them!

160
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,914
Why did you pick me to play against?

161
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,377
Rei, I wanna know
who you think is gonna win.

162
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,384
The zombies, obviously.

163
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,555
-And that's what you've always believed?
-Well, yeah.

164
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,726
Either the zombies win because they grow
exponentially, which would make sense,

165
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,563
or the humans become merciless killers
and execute all the zombies.

166
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,650
I figured it would come down
to one or the other.

167
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,821
-Rei.
-Arisu?

168
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,864
Be honest with me.

169
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,534
You're not a zombie, are you?

170
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,371
Please play your cards.

171
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,670
Let's suppose you are a zombie.

172
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,048
You work hard to build
this trust barricade.

173
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,926
And then what? What's your plan?

174
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,972
If nobody opts to save you
with their vaccine, that means

175
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,182
you'd be killed by the game.

176
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,937
You wouldn't rely on someone
saving you out of gratitude.

177
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,693
A calculating mind like yours?
No way that's a part of your plan.

178
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,446
You might believe in humanity,
but you don't trust it.

179
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,365
I see. Keep going, Arisu.

180
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:18,662
Okay… Let's assume the zombie
thing was always just an act.

181
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,749
Your plan makes a lot more sense.

182
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,835
You think I'm that smart, Arisu?

183
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,339
Even if you weren't a zombie at any point,
it still helps you.

184
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,301
Because if you build trust
with a large enough group,

185
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,261
if they buy into your logic,

186
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,764
survival is guaranteed.

187
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,603
So you lie,
and trust is born out of the lie.

188
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,483
The illusion was the key.
That's how you survived.

189
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,155
I see. That's a fascinating theory…

190
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,325
And that's also why,
when you played against Ikeno last round,

191
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,785
he didn't kill you.

192
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,705
Because he still had
his Shotgun card, right?

193
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,666
But because you're not a zombie,

194
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,086
he would not have been
able to take you out.

195
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,672
Show your cards.

196
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,183
So?

197
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,812
After all that,
you still didn't answer my question.

198
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,188
Why play against me?

199
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,816
I'm playing you to save you, Rei.

200
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,159
A zombie?

201
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:50,129
Even somebody who's that honorable
can still tell a lie.

202
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,761
Now you're a zombie too.

203
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,306
But if the zombies were
always going to win,

204
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,642
why not become one right away?

205
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:09,314
I thought about that for a long while,
but I couldn't commit too soon.

206
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,902
The barricade wasn't a con. Back then,
I thought the humans had a chance.

207
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,071
That's why I built it in the first place.

208
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,576
But I couldn't really know.

209
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,995
My plan was to make a choice
late in the game.

210
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,666
But… after watching Ikeno and the others,

211
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,878
I started to see that ruthlessness

212
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,006
was just what the humans needed.

213
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,011
But now I see.

214
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,680
I know which side will win.

215
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,224
So thank you.

216
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,687
The final round will now begin.

217
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,981
We gotta go.

218
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,484
How long have you been a zombie, Arisu?

219
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,321
I always was.

220
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,202
Oh, he's good.

221
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,371
Natsu!

222
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,751
-Shion!
-Arisu!

223
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,840
I got infected, just like Nobu said to do.

224
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,009
Just one more round to make
sure we're all zombies.

225
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,887
Where's Nobu now?

226
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,805
He went to find Tetsu.

227
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,943
Shit!

228
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,653
Tetsu!

229
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,738
Tetsu!

230
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:46,954
Wait, please.

231
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,206
Just wait, hang on a sec!

232
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,793
-Ah.
-Get off of me!

233
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,631
-Not here.
-What about down there?

234
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,840
No, I checked!

235
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,095
-Hey! He's over here!
-Come on! Let's go!

236
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,514
Go, go! Get them!

237
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,696
Get back here!

238
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,912
-Run! We're out of time! Find Tetsu!
-Yeah! Okay!

239
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,585
Tetsu!

240
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,511
Over here!

241
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,264
That way!

242
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,516
Come on, quick! He's down there!

243
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,983
Please choose your opponent
and touch them.

244
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,152
Nobu! You have to do it now!

245
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,072
You can't kill me without a shotgun!
Bring it on!

246
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,745
Show your cards.

247
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,919
Tetsu.

248
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,047
Tetsu!

249
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,382
I can explain it all later.

250
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,099
No!

251
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,478
It's okay, Kazuya.

252
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,564
This is gonna save you.

253
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:40,776
Huh?

254
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,905
The final round is over.

255
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,369
Now announcing totals.

256
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,497
Zombies…

257
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,540
Thirty-two.

258
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,709
Humans…

259
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,670
Thirteen.

260
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,174
Zombies win.

261
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,349
Oh, I can't believe it!

262
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:24,945
With only 13 people,
it is game over for the humans.

263
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,912
Fucking hell…

264
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,469
-Yes! I can't believe it!
-We won!

265
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,055
You should come with us.

266
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,173
PLEASE PROCEED 16 KM SOUTHWEST

267
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,426
THE "GAME" WILL BE HELD
AT SUNDOWN IN TWO DAYS

268
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,693
You don't need to feel guilty.

269
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,202
I'm not feeling anything.

270
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,996
It's only a game.

271
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,291
That's right.

272
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,048
Let's get some sleep.

273
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,393
And finished.

274
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,895
Doing this will help
with the morning tangles.

275
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,398
Thank you, big sis.

276
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,984
I'm not your sis.

277
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,075
Hey, look.

278
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,161
Isn't Arisu gonna sleep?

279
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,625
He's probably thinking about his wife.

280
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,670
Yeah.

281
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,589
I wish mine were like that.

282
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,383
My husband would never.

283
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,302
Too busy getting angry.

284
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,053
Too busy hitting me.

285
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,224
Every day, I woke up wishing he was dead.

286
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:47,063
But that sort of devotion…
it must be really nice.

287
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,987
You bitch!

288
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,239
-You're worthless! Fuck you!
-No, please! Stop!

289
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,348
-Arisu…
-Will I see you tonight?

290
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,519
Hey, Usagi.

291
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,479
Where are you?

292
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,735
Arisu…

293
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,196
Hmm?

294
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,282
I'll come get you.

295
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,675
Usagi?

296
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,677
Please.

297
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,053
Wait, hold on--

298
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,473
Dad… I'm sorry.

299
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,518
When I dream…

300
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,730
I can feel him.

301
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,274
My father's presence.

302
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,237
I wanna see him again.

303
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,199
And even if he dies in the dream…

304
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,536
I want to feel that pain again.

305
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,960
Daddy. Don't leave.

306
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,963
Dad! Please, no! Don't do it!

307
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,007
Don't do it!

308
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,683
There's something
I wanna ask you about your father.

309
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,353
Can you help me?

310
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,026
If my father is in my dreams…

311
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,905
then I need to be where I can find him.

312
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,909
Even in a nightmare.

313
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,578
Hey, look out.

314
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,833
Get down!

315
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,503
Stop using these people as shields!

316
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,422
You should be looking out for yourself.

317
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,435
Whoa! Move!

318
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,672
Come on!

319
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,809
-Ryuji, when I move, you go.
-Uh-huh.

320
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,047
I still can't believe
you made it through with the wheelchair.

321
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,884
Yeah, well… I had a bit of help.

322
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,929
Usagi, are you, like, a pro athlete?

323
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,555
Nope.

324
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,600
I do climb mountains as a hobby, though.

325
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,813
It's like I've…
met you before or something.

326
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:08,236
Hang on. Usagi's, like,
your real name, not a nickname?

327
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,613
-Usagi…
-Yep.

328
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,450
Your dad was
a mountain climber, too, right?

329
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,913
Maybe I saw your name
in a sports magazine.

330
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,958
Wait, no. You mean
the guy who was all over the news?

331
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,377
Because he killed himself
after he lied about a climb?

332
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,337
Yeah, him.

333
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,131
Oh…

334
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,841
My bad.

335
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,429
Those magazines are trashy.
I wouldn't worry about 'em.

336
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,932
-Hey.
-Trashy but true.

337
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,184
You think the suicide thing is true too?

338
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,687
-Why don't you ask her?
-No way! I can't.

339
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,771
Ask her.

340
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,857
You don't really care
what they think, right?

341
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,820
My dad wasn't the kind of person
who would lie to anyone.

342
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,240
He wouldn't kill himself, either.

343
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,787
You probably have
to tell people that every day.

344
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,040
But, be honest, do you really believe it?

345
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,418
If it weren't for you,

346
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,546
I would never have come back here.

347
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:10,757
Really?

348
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,844
It's funny. When we first met,
I felt like we were the same.

349
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,057
That we were both consumed
by thoughts of death.

350
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,312
You wanted to be with your dead father.

351
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,816
Right? That's what you've always wanted
more than anything.

352
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,196
You would never have accepted
my invitation otherwise.

353
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,450
You're not wrong,
but I never wanted to come back here.

354
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,080
I didn't want to make Arisu suffer.

355
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,290
Deep down, you don't believe that.

356
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,334
No. That's not who I am.

357
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,131
I've always wanted to come here.
To see it.

358
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,258
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

359
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,803
This in-between place linking our world

360
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,888
to the land of death.

361
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,407
I knew you'd be the one to survive.

362
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,828
Who are you?

363
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,164
Tell me.

364
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,084
Do you know who I am?

365
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,128
Oh yes.

366
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,549
I've devoted my new life
to finding people just like you.

367
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,928
People with the right qualities
to become capable citizens.

368
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,013
What do you mean?

369
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,227
You've played these games
many times before.

370
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:50,231
Despite your condition,
you fought your way through, and survived.

371
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,983
You reached your goal.

372
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,486
You should remember now.

373
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,578
I have a request for you.

374
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,540
There's a certain woman
I want you to bring to this place.

375
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:12,336
And in exchange, I will make sure
you see the world you desire.

376
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,841
Am I right that you want
to see the land of death?

377
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,553
For far beyond this place between worlds,

378
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,055
you will find death's true domain.

379
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,767
So what will it be?

380
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,769
Do you agree to my terms?

381
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:34,775
If I do this,
promise me I'll get what I want.

382
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,653
-You will.
-How do I get her here?

383
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,407
This woman still carries within her heart

384
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,618
the shadow of her dead father.

385
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,623
Invite her to this place,
and she will come.

386
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,583
What do you mean?

387
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,710
How do I invite her?

388
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,382
Just have her drink this.

389
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,638
You do that,
and you'll get what you've always wanted.

390
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,683
So… are you in?

391
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,656
All right.

392
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,868
I'll do it.

393
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,762
I have to admit,

394
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,932
I didn't think he would agree
to bring her here.

395
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:54,063
But your plan is coming together.
And Arisu has joined as well.

396
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,567
Arisu won't abandon Usagi.

397
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,823
I've learned that human emotions are like…
invisible threads.

398
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,450
One only has to pull to make them move.

399
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,037
So what's your next step?

400
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,459
To put Ryuji to good use.
The man is quite an asset.

401
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,839
An asset, maybe, but odd too.

402
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,925
Who goes looking for the land of death?

403
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,011
He's far from normal, to be sure.

404
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,014
But he and Usagi are connected
in spirit now.

405
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,809
Those threads get pulled, and he's mine.

406
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,397
The game is finally getting interesting.

407
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,070
Wonderful idea.

408
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,156
Hmm.

409
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,389
The required number
of teams has been reached.

410
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,268
The game will now begin.

411
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,940
THE TRAIN IS ARRIVING

412
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:21,043
NOT IN SERVICE

413
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,219
Game, Runaway Train.

414
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:48,612
Game rules.
This train is operated without a driver.

415
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:53,534
If you can successfully move from
the starting car to the lead car,

416
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,119
and, after hearing the siren…

417
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,457
…stop the train, you clear the game.

418
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:05,463
When you move to the next car,
the door will automatically lock.

419
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,089
And after 30 seconds,

420
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,926
either oxygen or poison gas
will be released.

421
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,720
Poison gas?

422
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,597
Excluding this starting car,

423
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,057
you will proceed through eight train cars.

424
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,269
Poison gas will be released
in four of the cars.

425
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,646
Upon entering a new car,

426
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,984
you will have 30 seconds to decide
whether to put on your mask.

427
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:30,654
Each player will receive five canisters.

428
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,531
Please attach the canister

429
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,576
to the insertion port
on the right side of your mask.

430
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:41,624
Inside these canisters is
a neutralizing agent for the poison gas.

431
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:46,462
You cannot use other players' canisters.

432
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:52,092
Additionally,
you cannot return to previous cars.

433
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,723
Please secure the canisters to your arm

434
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,059
and collect your gas mask.

435
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,241
Game start.

436
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,327
Please proceed to the next car.

437
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,732
Why is there a bird?

438
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,029
The canary acts as a warning.
Just like in a coal mine.

439
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,699
If it dies, it's poison.

440
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,034
Okay.

441
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,497
Please make your choice.

442
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,579
What do we do?

443
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,793
Sohta…

444
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,893
It's not poison.

445
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,439
Wait. Does that mean we wasted a canister?

446
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,025
No, no. It's okay.

447
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:17,488
There are still four cars with poison.
And we still have four canisters.

448
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,504
Please proceed to the next car.

449
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,893
Please make your choice.

450
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,476
Oh my God!

451
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,772
It was poison!

452
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,358
It was and we're okay!

453
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,452
CAR 3

454
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,956
Please make your choice.

455
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,752
So? What do we do?

456
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,757
I'm not putting it on.

457
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,883
Why not?

458
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,926
Because they know we're afraid.

459
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,304
The game is betting
we'll use our masks early.

460
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,348
They probably want us
to waste all our canisters.

461
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,018
Then later… we get poisoned.

462
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,941
-I'm not gonna use it for this car.
-That's still just basically chance.

463
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,235
There must be a trick we're missing.

464
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,156
This is the third car.
We still need to get through five more.

465
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,160
We still have three more canisters
and three more poison gas cars.

466
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,456
What should we do?

467
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,419
No masks this time.

468
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,298
What if your brother got it wrong, though?

469
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,051
-Hey. What's your problem?
-You need to back the hell off.

470
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,969
No matter what you do,
you can't survive the gas.

471
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,734
It's not poison! We're okay!

472
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,825
We can make it.

473
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,410
She saved us.

474
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,813
It's heading toward Asakusa!

475
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,775
I know that line! I'm pretty sure
it's heading west to Omotesando!

476
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:24,735
You're a train nerd?

477
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,986
If we put our masks on
but it's not a poison car,

478
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,530
we won't have enough left to make it.

479
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,953
You. You know a lot about trains?

480
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:21,124
-Yeah.
-Those people on the other train.

481
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,585
It looked like it took a while
for them to die.

482
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,254
They must be using a gas
that's heavier than air.

483
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,716
They'd need a massive amount
to fill up a whole train car.

484
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,011
-So what?
-So there'd need to be a tank for the gas.

485
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,390
Any car with poison would need space
to house a tank that big.

486
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,474
Where would it be?

487
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,143
No, no. I have no idea. I don't know!

488
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,063
Hey! We're running out of time!
What do we choose?

489
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,274
What if that other train was a trick?

490
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,655
What if maybe they showed us that
on purpose, to try and scare us?

491
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,990
Yeah, maybe.

492
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:56,785
If we use our masks now,
we might not have enough for the rest.

493
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,454
Wait…

494
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:08,088
I'm not sure,
but… this type of… of train car…

495
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,716
It probably shouldn't have a pantograph.

496
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,592
What's a pantograph?

497
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,553
The thing on the roof?

498
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,013
Exactly.

499
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,598
It's the thing that draws
electricity for the train.

500
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,976
Because if it has one, it really takes up…

501
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,437
It takes up a lot of room
on the train's roof.

502
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:28,400
This car… shouldn't have one.
So the roof would be open.

503
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:33,655
Let me get this straight.
There's space up there for a gas tank?

504
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,785
Yeah. Should be.

505
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,955
Should be?

506
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,832
Are we really gonna trust this guy?

507
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,753
Please make your choice.

508
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,469
-What do we do?
-I don't know!

509
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,966
Let me out!

510
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,012
-I'm so sorry!
-Yuna! Get away! Move away!

511
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:34,860
Help…

512
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,850
CAR 5

513
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,651
There are four cars left,
including this one.

514
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,446
We only have two oxygen canisters left,
then we're out.

515
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:22,073
And we know there are still
two cars with poison gas.

516
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,034
What's this one?

517
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,579
This particular car

518
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,624
would have a pantograph on the roof.

519
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,502
So then… there's no room for a gas tank.

520
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,971
CAR 6

521
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,099
Wait…

522
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,603
The luggage racks are different.

523
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,274
-Oh no.
-What is it?

524
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,027
I was wrong.

525
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,904
I got the model of the train wrong.

526
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,197
What?

527
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,575
Uh, I'm sorry, but it's not
the type that I thought it was.

528
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:51,246
So the… positions
of the pantographs are different.

529
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,709
I'm sorry! I have no idea what to do!

530
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,171
So up to this point, it's all been luck?

531
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,717
-Yeah.
-You could have got us killed!

532
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,801
You piece of shit!

533
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,928
-You're supposed to be a train nerd!
-Ow!

534
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,180
Stop it!

535
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,473
We're out of time.

536
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,853
Please make your choice.

537
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:20,317
Two oxygen canisters left,
and two gas cars left.

538
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,861
We can't afford any more mistakes.

539
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,251
So we just go with our gut?

540
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,463
Mmm.

541
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,890
I'm with you. I'm trusting her gut.

542
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,604
Me too.

543
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,482
I'm betting on Usagi.

544
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,734
I've got a good feeling.

545
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,991
Sure, let's take a chance.

546
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,872
In the end, it's a game of luck.

547
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,682
Be poison gas.
Be poison gas. Be poison gas.

548
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,143
Be poison gas.
Be poison gas. Be poison gas!

549
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:00,708
It's alive.

550
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,086
This isn't poison!
