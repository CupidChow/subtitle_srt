1
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,143
What?

2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,131
This is just a screen.

3
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,127
These images are computer-generated.

4
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,879
Computer-generated?

5
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:51,963
All of this?

6
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,349
-Welcome home.
-I'm back!

7
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,684
-Here, I got this.
-Thanks.

8
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,312
Oh! I'm starving!

9
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,867
Usagi?

10
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,789
Arisu…

11
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,511
I missed you.

12
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,847
So much.

13
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,726
I'm sorry.

14
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,694
Let's go home.

15
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,824
Okay. Yeah.

16
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,911
Sorry.

17
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,870
It's you!

18
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,789
Whoa! Easy!

19
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,374
Why are you with Usagi?

20
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,000
-Stop it!
-You killed her!

21
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,877
-All this is your fault!
-Calm down!

22
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,170
-Come on!
-Arisu, stop it!

23
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,213
-Wait!
-Ryuji?

24
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:24,675
-Ryuji, are you all right?
-Hold on. There you go.

25
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,472
He's been fighting by my side
this whole time.

26
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,515
Usagi…

27
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,810
If he hadn't been there,
I wouldn't have made it this far.

28
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,355
-But what he did is--
-What he did is save my life!

29
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,358
What he did is bring us back together.

30
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,579
Registration is now closed.

31
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,750
Ten participants confirmed.

32
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,044
Ten participants?

33
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,339
But there are only nine of us here.

34
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,633
What do you think it means?

35
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,303
-A child.
-Huh?

36
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,641
A child.

37
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,185
What?

38
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,442
The doctor said you're pregnant, Usagi.

39
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,614
I… I'm pregnant?

40
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,034
You're carrying our baby.

41
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,540
Oh…

42
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,918
So that's why it's ten people. The baby.

43
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,754
Hey, kid, nice one!

44
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,049
But… a child in this situation is…

45
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,894
The game will now begin.

46
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,604
It's about to start.

47
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,649
Please put on your wristbands and collars.

48
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,417
Game. Possible Futures.

49
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,132
Game rules.

50
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,095
There are a total of 25 rooms,

51
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,264
arranged in five vertical columns

52
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,808
and five horizontal rows.

53
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,352
Each round, players must roll the dice

54
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,480
found on the platform
in the center of the room.

55
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:11,193
The resulting number determines how many
people can advance to the next chamber.

56
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,988
Repeat until you reach the exit.

57
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,116
You have a maximum of 15 rounds.

58
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,409
EXIT

59
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:25,708
However, those players who do not
advance because of the dice roll

60
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,627
cannot move.

61
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,131
A lockdown will activate,
forcing the player to stay.

62
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,507
FORCED STAY

63
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,677
To lift the lockdown,

64
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:42,725
two players must use their wristbands
on either side of the locked room.

65
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,520
UNLOCKED

66
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,483
Each player has been allocated 15 points.

67
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,614
To pass from one chamber to another,

68
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:01,952
one player must spend one point
and hold their wristband up to the door.

69
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,166
If you wish to return
to the room you just left,

70
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:12,046
you must wait for one round
before being allowed to do so.

71
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:16,842
Regardless of whether you remain
in a chamber by choice or by force,

72
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,888
one point will be deducted
from your total each round.

73
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:26,310
If a player's points reach zero,
they will be eliminated.

74
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:34,527
The walls of each chamber will display
images of your possible future.

75
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,281
The future you choose
from among those images

76
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,285
will become your reality
once you reach the exit.

77
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,125
We get to choose our own future…

78
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:56,632
THE FUTURE THAT WILL COME TO PASS

79
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,511
Proceed according to the dice roll

80
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:04,557
and choose your future
as you search for the exit.

81
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,562
Maybe the best strategy would be
to team up and work together.

82
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,235
Hey, you two. What are your names?

83
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,077
-I'm Sohta. This is my sister.
-Yuna.

84
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,204
I'm Arisu.

85
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,834
This is Sachiko, Rei,

86
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,628
Tetsu, and Nobu.

87
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:42,136
Begin. Roll the dice
and select the room you wish to enter.

88
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,555
The time limit is three minutes.

89
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,492
So the dice and the doors
are connected by color.

90
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,662
All right!
Dice games are sorta my specialty.

91
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,707
So then, you're a gambler too, are you?

92
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,419
Round one. Start.

93
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,092
Okay. Let's do this.

94
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,251
Are these really visions of our future?

95
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,713
All of this? No way.

96
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,641
Here we go! Come on, baby! Yeah!

97
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,644
-I hit the jackpot! Wow!
-You won!

98
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,107
Thank you for the meal.

99
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,441
What?

100
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,860
No way, seriously?

101
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,201
Look. I'm pretty sure
the future is different on each wall.

102
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,495
Ah! Fuck this!

103
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,000
Shit!

104
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,673
So our futures change depending
on which door we pass through…

105
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,973
Please, just read it, sir.

106
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,644
This again, Matsuyama?
I've had about enough of this nonsense.

107
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,606
No, Professor, please!
Just read the abstract! Anything!

108
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,400
If I quit my research now,
it'll be all for nothing!

109
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:12,745
No one's going to take this seriously.
Least of all the academic world.

110
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,539
At least read a couple of pages, please.

111
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,752
Maybe a magazine on the occult
would be more suitable?

112
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,730
Over here! Look at Mommy!

113
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,231
Smile!

114
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,817
Beautiful day, too.

115
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,111
Oh yeah, isn't it perfect?

116
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,406
I don't know about you guys,

117
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,825
but if that's the future, I choose blue.

118
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,328
Me too.

119
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,249
But we can't all go through.
Only seven of us are allowed.

120
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,086
Why doesn't one person take yellow?

121
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,465
-Yeah!
-Nice shot, Hida!

122
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,925
All right!

123
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,261
From what I see, yellow looks okay.

124
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,641
No. We should probably try
to minimize wasting points.

125
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,977
I'm pretty sure
that's the key to the game.

126
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,812
So we stick together.

127
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,855
We move through
as a group if we can, right?

128
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,111
Yeah… We can't all go through
blue, so let's split into two groups

129
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,196
and take the doors
with the largest numbers.

130
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,702
Sohta and Yuna.
You two will be on a team with Rei.

131
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,705
I want you three…

132
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,711
to go to the room east of here, D3.

133
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,755
The rest of us will go north, to C2.

134
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,926
That way we can all meet up again
to the northeast, in D2.

135
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,928
D3.

136
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,389
That's great!

137
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,683
-Yuna? Yuna?
-Ken? Is that you?

138
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,351
I didn't even see you come in!

139
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,936
This is my brother.

140
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,480
-Ken is a classmate from university.
-We can do that.

141
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,898
-Hi, I'm Ken.
-Hey there.

142
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,192
Plus, the red door isn't a problem for us.

143
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,235
See you!

144
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,113
One minute remaining.

145
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,950
-So that's the plan.
-Let's go.

146
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,369
You all trust this guy,
no questions asked?

147
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,624
If you don't like his plan,
try a different door.

148
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,557
Please hold your wristbands
up to your chosen door

149
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,226
to proceed to the next room.

150
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,356
Let's do it. It's time.

151
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,371
We'll see you guys in D2.

152
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,664
Okay.

153
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,764
I'm Rei Morikage.

154
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,848
RÉSUMÉ
REI MORIKAGE

155
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,769
I've loved anime ever since I was a kid
and… that inspires my drawings.

156
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,647
How quickly are you able to draw?

157
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,401
At the moment, it takes me
around three days to fill a page.

158
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,908
C2 is a minus one point room.

159
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,578
Please select the player
whose point will be deducted.

160
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,580
What do they mean, "minus one point?"

161
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,126
It means that some of these rooms
can remove points from us.

162
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,379
But we won't know how many points
until we're already in.

163
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,422
Which complicates things.

164
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:56,969
We took from Arisu's points last time,
so now we can take from mine.

165
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,477
Round two. Start.

166
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:19,283
Now, roll the dice and select
the room you wish to enter.

167
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,370
We can't go back the way we came
without waiting a round.

168
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:27,082
There are three rooms we can enter.
That's why there are three dice.

169
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,543
Okay! Stand aside.

170
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,594
Three, one, five?

171
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,026
If this shows the future we're gonna face,

172
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,529
then I wanna choose the blue door again.

173
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,323
MOVIE TICKET
EVERYBODY LOVES FAMILY!

174
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,534
-We should do this more often.
-I've been wanting to see this.

175
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,911
Huh.

176
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,498
CLASS 1 ARCHITECT
DESIGN DRAWING EXAM

177
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,460
Huh?

178
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,963
You're going to study
to become an architect?

179
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,592
What?

180
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,264
If you encountered bullying among
your students, what would you do?

181
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,391
Mr. Hida? What do you think?

182
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:30,270
-Sir, I would take a measured approach.
-This future could really be mine?

183
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,939
I'd listen to both sides.

184
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,191
I don't wanna choose the red door.

185
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,577
Hey. There's a seminar
you might like. Interested?

186
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,745
SKILL DEVELOPMENT SEMINAR

187
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,829
Ah, no, I'll pass.

188
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,582
-I don't have the time.
-But it's like investing in your future!

189
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,668
Time well spent, don't you think?

190
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,753
At least give it a chance.

191
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,340
Would you write your name, please.

192
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,884
All right, thank you.

193
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,053
Please take a seat in any available chair.

194
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,765
D2, where we're planning
to meet up, is behind the red door.

195
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,393
So I'll take that one.

196
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,646
I'll meet up with Rei
and the rest of the group.

197
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,898
Then I'm going with you.

198
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,820
Then as for the rest of you,
go through the blue one, okay?

199
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,446
To room C1.

200
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,492
Well done, Matsuyama!
The research funding you were hoping for!

201
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,704
-Is this really happening?
-It is. Congratulations.

202
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,163
Thank you so much.

203
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,418
I'll meet up with you later.

204
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,426
Well…

205
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,594
Let's go.

206
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,771
TO: YUZUHA ARISU

207
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,941
THANK YOU FOR THE OTHER DAY
CAN WE MEET?

208
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,365
I'm getting a weird feeling
from this game.

209
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,829
Is it actually reading all our minds?
Does it know what we're thinking?

210
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:21,923
All twos.

211
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,231
I'm going to head north to room D2.

212
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,901
Ideally, I'd like
the three of us to go together.

213
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,987
But we have to split into two groups.

214
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,406
That sounds good.

215
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:51,203
The two of us will go… east, to E3.

216
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,204
Right.

217
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,623
JOB OFFER CONFIRMATION

218
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,042
Oh my gosh!

219
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,258
-Whoa, this is so good!
-Hey, are you listening to me?

220
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,810
Rei. Let's meet up in room D2, as planned.

221
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,645
Roger that.

222
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,616
-All right.
-That's a relief.

223
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,951
Yeah.

224
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,453
Round three. Start.

225
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,331
Huh?

226
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,833
One and two?

227
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:54,057
Usagi counts as two people here.
So she has to go to D1.

228
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,602
And only one of us can go through to E2.

229
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,730
That means no matter what we do,
someone has to stay behind.

230
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,609
Attention, everyone.

231
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,529
This is Morikage.
She'll be starting today.

232
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,739
I look forward to working with you all.

233
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,074
I'm Rei Morikage.

234
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,285
It's nice to meet you.

235
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,205
Well, I guess it is what it is.

236
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,708
I'd like you to begin with this cut.

237
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,543
I'll stay behind this time.

238
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,794
What?

239
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,088
You have a baby who needs you.

240
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,507
-But…
-Rei…

241
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,469
I owe you one for the zombie thing.

242
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,015
Hmm.

243
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,981
Usagi, you meet up
with Sachiko and the others.

244
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,568
Sachiko, can you hear me?

245
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,825
Yeah, I can hear you.

246
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,786
How many people can go on to D1?

247
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,665
-Who gives a rat's ass…
-Four. We all can.

248
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,002
-But when you drink…
-That's great. Then do it.

249
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,880
-All of you go east to D1.
-All you ever do is nag.

250
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,799
-Would you keep your voice down?
-I want you to meet Usagi there.

251
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,219
Oh, sorry, I wouldn't wanna be heard…

252
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,180
-That's not what I meant.
-Who cares what you meant?

253
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,349
Got it.

254
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:23,230
Sohta, Yuna,
could you stay where you are for a minute?

255
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,151
Usagi and I will move this round.
And Rei's staying behind.

256
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,155
I want you to go back to D3 next round.

257
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,534
We can lift Rei's lockdown
and get her out.

258
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,995
Afterward, we'll meet up in E3.

259
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,289
It's probably best if we coordinate.

260
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,667
We should stay? Okay, will do.

261
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,801
All right, let's all go to D1 together.

262
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,471
Are you suggesting that because
Arisu said we should move as a group?

263
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,766
-Well, I mean--
-Listen.

264
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,185
We're supposed to be looking for the exit.

265
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,230
If we split up,
we might be able to find it faster.

266
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,607
And besides,

267
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,695
shouldn't we get to know
our futures a little better?

268
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,384
Mr. Matsuyama!
These numbers are incredible.

269
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:38,138
I think this data is enough to prove
your hypothesis, Mr. Matsuyama.

270
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,473
You did it! You did it!

271
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,438
And you get to sell these bottles
for not one, but 3,000 apiece!

272
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,066
Listen, if you don't like it,
the door is right there.

273
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,027
Only those who are super committed

274
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,404
to becoming entrepreneurs
should come with me.

275
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,156
You. Why are you here?

276
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,700
I'm here to develop my potential!

277
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,535
Very good, that's right!

278
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:05,582
In that case, your challenge will be
to sell this water for 30,000 a bottle.

279
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,127
You understand
why you need to sell it, don't you?

280
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,629
TRUE AWAKENING
LUCKY WATER

281
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,131
-Excuse me.
-Uh… no thanks.

282
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,967
No, thank you.

283
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,260
It's impossible!

284
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,554
-I need my money back!
-Are you serious?

285
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:24,309
It's all here in black and white, kid!
Absolutely no returns!

286
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,604
-Excuse me.
-What?

287
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,189
I'm so sorry, sir.

288
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,359
-He's drunk.
-Why are you apologizing, bitch?

289
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,152
-I asked you a question.
-Stop!

290
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,738
-What are you doing?
-Sir! You can't do that!

291
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,490
REJECTION LETTER

292
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,246
-You're hired.
-I am?

293
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,582
We look forward to working with you.

294
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,292
Thank you so much.

295
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,379
-Thank you for being here.
-I really appreciate it.

296
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,179
If it were me, I would put the exit
as far away as I could.

297
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,348
It makes sense for it to be in a corner.

298
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,226
It's a good point.

299
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,770
It might be worth trying once, at least.

300
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,106
All right.

301
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:16,319
Fine. We'll check the corner rooms
by splitting into two groups.

302
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,823
But also,
Arisu's plan is too good to ignore.

303
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,910
So we'll do both.
Let's you and I go through this door.

304
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,497
That way, I can meet up with Usagi,
and you can try your plan,

305
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,541
and hopefully, you find the exit.

306
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,793
Yeah, all right.

307
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:37,298
And we'll go this way. To B1.

308
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,426
Sound good?

309
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,803
Uh, yeah.

310
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,654
-We should break up.
-What?

311
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,406
I don't love you anymore.

312
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,033
Did I do something wrong, Ken?

313
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,869
-Did I hurt you?
-Look, Sohta.

314
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:06,995
I'm sorry.

315
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,247
No, wait! Please, Ken! Please!

316
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,375
Please stay!

317
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,212
We're… well, we're getting married!

318
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,090
We're hoping for your blessing.

319
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,468
Yeah! Of course.

320
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,386
-Yeah!
-Congratulations, sis.

321
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,555
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

322
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,000
Whoa, that lake is so freaking big. Look!

323
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,711
-Ah!
-Yuna, come on, it's a dam, not a lake.

324
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,754
That's a dam?

325
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,381
-It's a reservoir created by a dam.
-Come on, Dad!

326
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,550
Well, that makes Yuna half-right!

327
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,844
You see, I'm half-right!

328
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,554
You're pretty excited today.

329
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,972
Well, yeah, duh!

330
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,100
It's been so long since
we've had a vacation, all four of us!

331
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,268
-I love it!
-Me too!

332
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,120
We did everything we could.

333
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,334
I'm so sorry. Your parents
didn't make it out of surgery.

334
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,120
Hold your wristband up to your chosen door

335
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:57,206
and proceed to the next room.

336
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,924
Sohta, are you sure?

337
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,984
Lockdown.

338
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,739
You are completely useless!

339
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:35,912
No!

340
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,792
You are completely useless!

341
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,920
What is this?

342
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:45,922
1 ROOM

343
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,342
Point deduction confirmed.

344
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,053
Round four. Start.

345
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,931
-Let me roll the dice.
-Mm-hm.

346
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,709
If we wanna get to the corner,
we need to head west.

347
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,794
But only one person can go.

348
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,298
I don't think
it's a good idea to split up.

349
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,759
Let's try B2.

350
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,386
-You did it!
-Uh…

351
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,763
-You got the job!
-Nobu, you got the job?

352
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,682
-Congrats, man!
-That's amazing!

353
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,434
-Great job, dude!
-Nobu.

354
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,477
Nice work!

355
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,895
Did you hear me?

356
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,940
-Yeah.
-You did it! You got the job!

357
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,026
Nobu, you got the job? Congrats, man!

358
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,485
That's amazing! Great job!

359
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,697
Let's stay here
so we can release Rei from lockdown.

360
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,743
I'm still going next door
to the corner room.

361
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,369
And if it's a trap? What then?

362
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,079
I've still got 15 points.

363
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,998
I'll be fine.

364
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,335
Sohta?

365
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,880
I need to know what you rolled.

366
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,971
Sohta?

367
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,767
Sohta? Yuna?

368
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,770
You're in E3 now, right?

369
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,774
Can you move to D3?
We need to get Rei out.

370
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,109
Understood.

371
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,737
Are you sure?

372
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,699
Hey, look.

373
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,166
The green door leads to a corner room.

374
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,960
And maybe that's where the exit is.

375
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,754
I don't know Arisu well,

376
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:53,341
but if he had to choose between
saving us or Usagi,

377
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,468
no way he's giving up her or his kid.

378
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,973
We need to make sure that's our future.

379
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,268
We need to move forward for Mom and Dad.

380
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,280
Let's go.

381
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,199
Mm-hm.

382
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:23,788
Here we go.

383
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:31,838
Rei?

384
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,422
You okay?

385
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,259
I'm going crazy in here! Hurry up, please!

386
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,095
Sohta and his sister
are heading to D3 now.

387
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,888
They'll get you out.

388
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,143
Help me, please!

389
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,414
-Congrats, man!
-Great job!

390
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,291
Hey!

391
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,169
Let's go, come on.

392
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,672
I'll use my points for the door.

393
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:06,515
To Nobu! The kid
who can sell even the weirdest water!

394
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,561
Drink this and I'll buy one! Go on!

395
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:15,483
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

396
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:19,028
-Come on man, you got it! Chug!
-Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

397
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,781
-More! Get this guy another!
-Keep going!

398
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,574
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

399
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,494
-Why do…
-Nobu's got a drink

400
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,163
-Yeah!
-Got his glass, filled it up!

401
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,958
-Keep going!
-Drink it down, drink it down

402
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,335
Drink it down

403
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,837
No more, please! I'm dying.

404
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,756
He says he doesn't wanna drink!

405
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,925
Drink it down, drink, drink it down

406
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,010
Drink, drink it down
Drink, drink it down

407
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,762
-Drink it down!
-Drink! Drink!

408
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,265
Drink it down, ya gotta drink it down

409
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,559
Ya gotta drink it down
Ya gotta drink, drink

410
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,478
Drink it down, ya gotta drink--

411
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,313
Whoa!

412
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,773
-So gross!
-Crazy!

413
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,275
Sorry, I…

414
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,360
Here!

415
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,197
-Eat shit!
-Eat shit! Eat shit!

416
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,241
Eat shit! Eat shit! Eat shit!

417
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,534
Eat shit! Eat shit…

418
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,620
I'm sorry. I'm leaving!

419
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,414
Hey!

420
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,293
Nobu!

421
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,129
What the hell is going on?

422
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,893
So I guess it's just me now…

423
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,478
6 ROOM
NOBUAKI HIDA: 13

424
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,649
A1 is a minus six point room.

425
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,775
Are you kidding?

426
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,615
It's not the exit.

427
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,328
And there's only one other door,
because it's the corner room!

428
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:55,041
E5 is a minus four point room.

429
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,208
No…

430
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,503
4 ROOM
SOHTA ITSUKI: 13, YUNA ITSUKI: 14

431
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,671
Damn it.

432
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,049
We'll use my points.

433
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,592
But…

434
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,471
Point deduction confirmed.

435
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:11,932
It's okay.

436
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,604
Round five. Start.

437
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,736
Rei. Are you out?

438
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,949
No, I'm still trapped!
And I lost another point!

439
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:29,909
What?

440
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,249
-Come on in!
-Thanks! Here, for you!

441
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,876
-A housewarming gift.
-What is it?

442
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,544
-You shouldn't have!
-Ta-da!

443
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,171
-Sohta? Yuna?
-It's cute.

444
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:45,091
-Where are you?
-Sohta, you've got great taste!

445
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,344
Oh, this is far from over!

446
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,554
-Sohta? Yuna!
-You are completely useless!

447
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,558
Sohta! Yuna!

448
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,317
Oh, this is far from over!

449
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,611
-You are completely useless!
-That's it.

450
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,863
They made their choice.

451
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,699
Instead of helping each other out,

452
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,036
humans will choose
whatever's best for them.

453
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,038
We're all selfish.

454
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,666
Get out! Just get out!

455
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,001
Wait! Just let me explain! Please!

456
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,087
FROM: MOM
PLEASE JUST CALL ONCE

457
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,718
Oh, this is far from over!

458
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,179
You are completely useless!

459
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,808
Come to think of it… how is Mom?

460
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,393
I wonder how she is.

461
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,982
Oh shit.

462
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,780
Gimme another bag.

463
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,533
And this stuff's even better,
man, trust me.

464
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,724
No freaking way.

465
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,353
Didn't it show me throwing it all away?

466
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,069
No!

467
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,154
Ah, shit!

468
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,655
Help me!

469
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,283
Help me!

470
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,213
Mom?

471
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,923
What happened?

472
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,675
Your mother suffered
a cerebral hemorrhage.

473
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,843
Mom, no…

474
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,054
Nobu?

475
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,227
Even if she recovers, your mother
will need around-the-clock care.

476
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,062
No, it can't be true.

477
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,534
Usagi.

478
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:22,248
I'm going to D3 next to get Rei out
of lockdown. I need you to stay put.

479
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,332
Got it.

480
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,501
Ryuji.

481
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,171
Can you hear me? Anything over there?

482
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,925
E1 was a minus one point room, that's all.

483
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,220
-And no exit?
-No.

484
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,487
No… no way…

485
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,115
They're lying!

486
00:42:58,993 --> 00:42:59,868
Huh?

487
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,792
No way…

488
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,087
No way…

489
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,381
Impossible.

490
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,550
No way!

491
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,264
Mom, please…

492
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,143
It's all my fault.

493
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,025
I'm… I'm… I'm sorry.

494
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,397
Oh, this is far from over!

495
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,483
D2 UNLOCKED

496
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,276
Huh?

497
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:20,366
Room D2 has been unlocked.

498
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:26,372
Rei. You can leave now.

499
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,124
Let's meet up next round.

500
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,670
All right.

501
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,963
Thank you.

502
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,234
4 ROOM
TETSU SHIMAZAKI: 12

503
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:59,446
B3 is a minus four point room.

504
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,532
Minus four?

505
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,994
Point deduction confirmed.

506
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,961
-Tetsu? Nobu?
-Huh?

507
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,340
Nobu! Are you there?

508
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:25,597
Hey, don't worry. It's all right.
I still have some points left.

509
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,769
Point deduction confirmed.

510
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,032
Ah! Fuck!

511
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,704
Fuckin' hell!

512
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,876
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

513
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,423
That's okay.

514
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,927
Yukiko?

515
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,435
Hey, Yukiko.

516
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,519
Yeah?

517
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,272
Wanna go to the aquarium
for our anniversary?

518
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,107
Why there?

519
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,861
Because I've never been.

520
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,946
What? Not even as a kid?

521
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,491
Nope.

522
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,910
Sure!

523
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,541
Long time no see. You look good.

524
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,159
Would you look at you?

525
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,619
Wow!

526
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,373
Yeah, I'm working
at a construction company.

527
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,458
I can change.

528
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,669
What? Really?

529
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,756
I swear I can change, Yukiko.

530
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,904
No!

531
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,757
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

532
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,384
Welcome.

533
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,392
I've been waiting for you.

534
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,935
Sorry I'm late.

535
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,812
I didn't think you would show up.

536
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,398
What? As if I would miss this!

537
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,985
-Hey.
-Hmm?

538
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,029
Would you like me to build you a house?

539
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,155
For me?

540
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,324
Uh-huh. What kind would you want?

541
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,327
-Hm… a big house.
-Yeah?

542
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,828
-Lots of space.
-Uh-huh.

543
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:38,452
A3 is a minus eight point room.

544
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:46,334
Your points total is now zero.

545
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,295
Game over.

546
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,761
I'm done.

547
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,935
Police. We have a warrant
to search the premises.

548
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:07,898
Found it!

549
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,785
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

550
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,870
-I'm fine.
-I knew it. I knew you wouldn't change!

551
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,455
Get off me!

552
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,042
You're the one who doesn't trust me!

553
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,377
I did trust you!

554
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,171
I trusted you!

555
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,924
That's why it hurts so much!

556
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,766
Okay. I'm done.

557
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,456
This is my future, I guess. Huh.

558
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,597
It's my fault. I did this.

559
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,326
Nobu?

560
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,627
Why don't you tell me what happened?

561
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,007
Talk to me, please.

562
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,010
Don't come in.

563
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,806
Just tell me. I'm on your side.

564
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,785
No matter what happens, keep living.

565
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,366
I will, Mom.

566
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,578
I promise I will.

567
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,079
-Would you like to say a few words?
-Sure. Thank you.

568
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:54,666
I've just been appointed here.
My name is Nobuaki Hida.

569
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,335
And my mother's a teacher.

570
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:01,381
She's the one who inspired
me to be one too.

571
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:05,927
I'm looking forward to working
with all of you. Thank you.

572
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,518
NOBUAKI HIDA

573
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:18,148
Hold your wristband up to your chosen door

574
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:21,109
and proceed to the next room.

575
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,154
I need to go find Tetsu.

576
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,260
Nobu?

577
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,681
Nobu, tell us where you are. Nobu?

578
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,476
1 ROOM
NOBUAKI HIDA: 4

579
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,104
Nobu?

580
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,108
Huh? Yeah. Sachiko?

581
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,069
Are you all right?

582
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,988
I came back.

583
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,074
I'm back in room B1.

584
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,201
But Tetsu and I got separated.

585
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:15,914
Did you go to the corner room,
A1? That might be the exit.

586
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,917
Yeah. But there was nothing there.

587
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,504
We're in C1.
We're right next to you, okay?

588
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:25,924
We can meet up with you next round,
so stay where you are.

589
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,801
-Sound good?
-Okay.

590
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,681
Round seven. Start.

591
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,862
Oh no…

592
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,281
Only one each.

593
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,742
We'll have to split up.

594
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,838
Usagi. I'm in D3 now.

595
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,965
I finally met up with Rei.

596
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,635
If there's no exit in the A1 corner room,

597
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:13,388
then A5 and E5 are
the corners we have left.

598
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,057
The exit is probably in one of those.

599
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,353
But first,
let's look for Sohta and the others.

600
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,521
Got it.

601
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,368
You wanna do another interview?

602
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,245
I've been…

603
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,624
well, compiling my research, actually.

604
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,668
Near-death experiences?

605
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,505
I didn't think my story
was that interesting.

606
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,716
No, of course it is.

607
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,928
Look, I wanna thank you.
Can I buy you dinner?

608
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,348
Um, let me think about that.

609
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,324
Come with me.

610
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,785
We're going to the land of death.

611
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,943
In the final game, I want you to kill her.

612
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,320
Then your work here will be finished.

613
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:12,173
If you kill Usagi,
I promise to grant your wish.

614
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:16,010
I promise you will learn
about who governs the afterlife.

615
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,347
I promise you will learn
about the land of the dead.

616
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,645
Ryuji, are you there?

617
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,232
Ryuji?

618
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,776
-Ryuji!
-Hold your wristband up…

619
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,361
Yeah, I hear you.

620
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:36,197
-Proceed to the next room.
-We should meet back up.

621
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:39,200
Make sure we meet up in B4.

622
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,541
Oh! Sweet, thanks! Thanks so much.

623
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,821
-Nobu!
-I'm so happy to see you!

624
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,948
-Are you okay?
-Glad you're all right.

625
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:24,078
B1 is a minus one point room.

626
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,997
Better use my points here.

627
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,502
We still need to find Tetsu!

628
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,964
Tetsu? Tetsu.

629
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,551
Tetsu? Can you hear us, Tetsu?

630
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,636
Tetsu?

631
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,430
Round eight. Start.

632
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,362
Sohta!

633
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:01,282
-Oh, wow!
-Wow! It is yummy!

634
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,506
No!

635
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:17,757
Come to Mommy!

636
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,771
Hold your wristband up to your chosen door

637
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,399
and proceed to the next room.

638
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,033
Yuna.

639
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,868
Sohta!

640
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:50,456
Yuna?

641
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,126
Yuna!

642
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,672
Sohta! I can't get through.
It won't let me in!

643
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,341
-Sohta!
-Yuna!

644
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:06,848
-B4 is a minus two point room.
-What?

645
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,224
2 ROOM

646
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:13,813
Your points total is now zero.

647
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,108
Game over.

648
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:23,424
Sohta! Sohta! Sohta…

649
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,470
Sohta. No, no…

650
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:30,139
No, please. Please. I…

651
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,766
I… I…

652
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:34,310
-Yuna.
-Please… Please, please…

653
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:37,396
-This was a minus two room.
-No…

654
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,442
What? No, no…

655
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,362
No. No!

656
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:47,323
-No, no, no…
-I'm so sorry.

657
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:49,325
No, no…

658
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,828
-I can't keep my promise to you.
-No!

659
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,915
No! Sohta! Open the door!

660
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,084
Someone, please let me in! Please!

661
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,795
No! No!

662
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:04,257
No! Please don't leave me! Please!

663
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,551
Don't go! Please!

664
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,762
No, no, no, please!

665
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,473
Wait. Don't go, please…

666
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:16,477
Please! No, please, please…

667
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,567
No, please!

668
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,777
Please… No! No!

669
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,071
-Find happiness. I love you.
-No!

670
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:29,115
Wait! Please don't go!

671
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:32,994
Don't leave me! Sohta!
Sohta, don't go! Please!

672
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:35,079
No! No!

673
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,956
Please, no.

674
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,834
No, no, no…

675
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,211
Please… please…

676
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:34,805
YUZUHA ARISU: 9, RYUJI MATSUYAMA: 7
NOBUAKI HIDA: 3, SACHIKO MAKINO: 11

677
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,474
Sohta is…

678
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,268
Yeah.

679
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,563
I don't know where Tetsu is, either.

680
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,484
Tetsu?

681
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,528
Tetsu, are you there?

682
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,494
It's because I left him behind.

683
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,579
Behind?

684
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,916
We don't know for sure that he died.

685
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,794
He's just not answering you, that's all.

686
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:11,008
B4 is a minus two room.

687
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:12,843
Rei.

688
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:22,937
I want you to go south.
Take Yuna and head to C5.

689
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,356
Looking at the rounds,

690
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:27,900
Yuna and her brother
must have passed through E5.

691
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:33,781
If E5 wasn't the exit, that means
A5 is the only corner room left.

692
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:34,824
Right.

693
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:39,120
I'll meet up with everyone in B4,
and then we'll head to A5.

694
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,207
It's the last corner room.
It has to be the exit.

695
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:57,805
Yuna.

696
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,559
You're gonna have
to go with Rei to the exit.

697
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:06,480
Yuna. We have to go.

698
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:09,483
Let's get going. Okay?

699
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,527
Yuna.

700
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:15,573
Hold your wristband up to your chosen door

701
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:18,451
and proceed to the next room.

702
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,161
Yuna, come on. Let's go.

703
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,517
Sohta? Sohta!

704
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,061
-Yuna!
-Yuna!

705
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,438
You can't be in here!
You have to go with Rei!

706
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:50,149
-Yuna! Come with me! Hurry!
-Yuna!

707
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,234
-This door's gonna close!
-Get back!

708
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,282
-The player left in this room…
-No!

709
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:00,451
…will be under lockdown.

710
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:10,252
B4 is a minus two point room.

711
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:15,216
Please select the player
whose points will be deducted.

712
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,765
Point deduction confirmed.

713
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:31,732
B3 is a minus four point room.

714
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,776
We're losing four points.

715
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,445
We should deduct from my pool.

716
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,034
Point deduction confirmed.

717
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:45,579
Round ten. Start.

718
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,103
Oh no…

719
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:17,278
Usagi.

720
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,572
How's it going over there?

721
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,449
We're in room B3 right now.

722
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:26,996
But the numbers on the dice are
making us split up three ways.

723
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:30,749
On top of that, one of the four of us
will have to stay here.

724
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,294
And we don't know what happened to Tetsu.

725
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,507
He isn't in B4. So that must mean…

726
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:44,263
That must mean he's in A3.

727
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,557
Tetsu…

728
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:52,396
If he's in there…
that room might deduct a lot of points.

729
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,609
What are we supposed to do?

730
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,366
One of you will have to go in there.

731
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:09,914
Another to the confirmed minus two.
Another goes further away from the exit.

732
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:14,627
And one person…
will have to choose a lockdown.

733
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,137
Hey!

734
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,265
Shut up, you stupid bitch!

735
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:30,434
Please!

736
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:32,978
-Stop!
-Get back here! You're worthless!

737
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,356
-Worthless! Had enough?
-Stop!

738
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,371
Come with me.

739
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:52,373
We're going to the land of death.

740
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,533
Think of something.

741
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,037
Think of something.

742
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:35,541
Come on, think.

743
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:39,962
Think.

744
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,624
EXIT
