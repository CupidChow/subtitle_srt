1
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,443
I won't let anyone else die.

2
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,654
If we work together,
I'm sure we can all escape.

3
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,534
Let's try to beat this, together.

4
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,120
Sounds like a good idea.

5
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,832
Nobu, you'll be heading
away from the exit,

6
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,586
but can you return to C3
and meet up with Rei, who's in C4?

7
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:49,132
The starting room has no point deduction,
so it's the room with the least risk.

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,515
Understood.

9
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,310
Usagi has the most points left.

10
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,273
I have more points because
the child's with me.

11
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,319
Do you think you can head to room A3?

12
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,281
There's a risk that it's a room
with a high points deduction.

13
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,827
I got this.

14
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,081
That means one person

15
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,208
will have to stay behind.

16
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,460
No!

17
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,838
Huh?

18
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,803
Careful. Are you all right?

19
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,346
I'll take over from here.

20
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,890
Thank you, son.

21
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,491
Arisu, I'll stay here.

22
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,576
Why you?

23
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,289
Because I'm the eldest here.
And it's my choice.

24
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,127
Let us old folks take care
of the dangerous stuff.

25
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,005
And you kids,
your job is to take care of the future.

26
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:20,598
Players, hold your wristband
up to your chosen door

27
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,976
and proceed to the next room.

28
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,727
Don't worry, I'm okay!

29
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,446
B4 is a minus two points room.

30
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,826
Please select whose points will be used.

31
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,745
Let's use my points this time.

32
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,251
Points deduction confirmed.

33
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:05,305
A3 is a minus eight points room.

34
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,975
Please select whose points will be used.

35
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,814
I promise to protect you.

36
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,946
Points deduction confirmed.

37
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,699
Usagi.

38
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,034
What about Tetsu?

39
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,751
I get it.

40
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,341
Tetsu!

41
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,681
Tetsu…

42
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,777
A3 is a minus eight points room.

43
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,571
If we were in that room, we'd be dead.

44
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,201
I'm the last one.
None of us can come through here again.

45
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,537
Eleventh round.

46
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,705
Start.

47
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,708
Time to release Sachiko from lockdown.

48
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,883
To create a horizontal line
between A3 and C3,

49
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,344
Usagi and Nobu need
to stay where they are.

50
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,679
But Nobu only has two points left.

51
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,683
So even if he tries to meet up
with Sachiko once she's released,

52
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,936
we can't make it work with zero points.

53
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,898
Well, in that case,
I could meet up with Nobu at C3

54
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,191
and make a horizontal line?

55
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,275
No.

56
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,153
Even if you go to C3 to connect with Nobu,

57
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,657
you'll never be able to reach A5
even with both your points.

58
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,663
Rei, I want you to stay where
you are at C4, so you can save Sachiko.

59
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,957
And then meet up with Nobu there.

60
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,625
Understood.

61
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:03,256
If I head to A2, I can form
a diagonal line with Rei at C4.

62
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,675
I'll take my child to A2.

63
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,804
But, Usagi,
none of us have been in that room.

64
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:14,183
I know. But my child and I,
we both have seven points left.

65
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,770
There's a possibility that A2 has
an even bigger points deduction.

66
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,064
Even if your plan works, Usagi,
if you're in lockdown,

67
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,107
none of us can help you.

68
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,027
One mistake and we'll never be
able to make it back to A5.

69
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,449
We don't have time. What do we do?

70
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,492
What can we do?

71
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,705
How can everyone make
it out of here alive?

72
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,291
What can we do?

73
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,337
Arisu, there must be a way!

74
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,591
We've done it before.

75
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,802
We've fought and won all the games so far.

76
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,185
All those friends who kept me alive.

77
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,368
Every game includes

78
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,454
a clue on how to survive.

79
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,450
The wristband.

80
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,080
We use the wristband.

81
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,790
The wristband?

82
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,377
Usagi, in A2, place the child's wristband.

83
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,090
Place only the child's wristband.
Even though the child isn't wearing it,

84
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,259
it's been working so far.

85
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,970
And that means,
if we put the wristband inside,

86
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,680
the plan should still work.

87
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,979
Makes no sense.

88
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,733
He's right. What happens
if the poor child dies trying to save me?

89
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,152
I know.

90
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,030
Even if we clear the game,
if the wristband stays inside

91
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,907
and the points are zero, Usagi could die.

92
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,284
You've no way of knowing!

93
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,289
But what if… we find a way
to retrieve the wristband?

94
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,623
How do you do that?

95
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,460
If Usagi goes back for the wristband,
we'll be back where we started.

96
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,929
You can't be in here!

97
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,473
-You have to go with Rei!
-Yuna! Come with me.

98
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,601
-Come on!
-Yuna, please!

99
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,315
Earlier, when Rei was
about to enter this room,

100
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,526
her wristband was on the other side
of the door and it didn't react.

101
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:15,489
So that means, if my wristband
stays inside A3, then I should be okay.

102
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,910
You just reach your arm into the room
and you grab the child's wristband.

103
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,872
Usagi, can you do it?

104
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,250
I can do it.

105
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,502
Yes, but once the wristband
is back inside,

106
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,379
eight points will be deducted again.

107
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,424
Even if you return the wristband
from A2 to A3,

108
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,802
neither of them will have enough
points to reach the exit.

109
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,524
YUNA ITSUKI 11, RYOHEI ARISU 6

110
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,161
Yuna…

111
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,998
I need a favor.

112
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,713
Some of us will need your help to survive.

113
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,802
Yuna, we need you to save us.

114
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,642
Please, help us.

115
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,207
Nobu, move across to C4
and we'll meet up together. Got it?

116
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,667
Understood.

117
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,880
Players, hold your wristband
up to your chosen door

118
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,717
and proceed to the next room.

119
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,314
I'm sorry.

120
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,776
I'll come back for you. I promise.

121
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,863
You're worthless! I'll kill you!

122
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:23,677
Room B3 has been unlocked.

123
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,934
Thank you!

124
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:37,608
A2 is a minus five points room.

125
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,655
Points deduction confirmed.

126
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,418
Twelfth round. Start.

127
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,386
Okay, let's get the wristband back.

128
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,763
I'm coming.

129
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,224
We'll open the door from this side.

130
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,853
Yuna will go in and take
the eight point deduction.

131
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,189
Yuna, are you sure?

132
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,234
Yes. When I'm inside, Usagi,

133
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,028
retrieve your child's wristband
from inside the room.

134
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,447
Thank you.

135
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,032
We don't have much time.

136
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,577
We need to do this
before the doors open and close.

137
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,453
How long do we have?

138
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,790
It's hard to tell precisely.
The timing can differ.

139
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:39,044
The longest opening time is when
someone's standing in the doorway.

140
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,922
Longest opening time? So how long?

141
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,300
Ten seconds. Maximum.

142
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,094
It's enough.

143
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:51,015
Let's do it. Is everyone ready?

144
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,350
I'm ready.

145
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,496
MOM, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

146
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,751
Ready?

147
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,129
Ten seconds. I'll do the countdown.

148
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,346
I'm going in.

149
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,979
What?

150
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,440
Ten!

151
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,319
Nine!

152
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,616
Eight!

153
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,705
Seven!

154
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,625
Six!

155
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,588
Five!

156
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,924
Hurry, Usagi!

157
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,428
Four!

158
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,602
Three!

159
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,986
Two!

160
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,280
This is a minus eight points room.

161
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,325
-Usagi, run!
-Points deduction confirmed.

162
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,314
Arisu!

163
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,609
Usagi!

164
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,820
One!

165
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,493
Jump!

166
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,604
Thank you.

167
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,544
Arisu…

168
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,881
what did your future hold?

169
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:38,117
All the players remaining in this room
shall be forced to stay.

170
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,369
It's the last one, okay?

171
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,634
Thank you.

172
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,188
Points deduction confirmed.

173
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,905
Fourteenth round. Start.

174
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,978
-Yu, are you okay? We're here!
-Please wait here.

175
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,396
Yu!

176
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,114
You fool!

177
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,922
So what are you going to do about this?

178
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,673
I beg for your forgiveness.

179
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,551
Bowing your head isn't going
to solve anything, young man.

180
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,304
-This is a serious incident!
-I'm really… I'm sorry!

181
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,972
Mother…

182
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,994
EXIT

183
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,504
Arisu…

184
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,965
What does that mean?

185
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,467
I just saw an exit sign on the screen.

186
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,844
It's the last room, isn't it?

187
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,055
What's gonna happen now?

188
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:15,107
Players, hold your wristband
up to the chosen door

189
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,734
and proceed to the next room.

190
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,492
Let's go.

191
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,843
-Arisu…
-Nobu.

192
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,845
Thank goodness.

193
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,227
FIFTEENTH ROUND

194
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,355
It's the last round.
We've just about made it.

195
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,485
You have all successfully
reached the exit room.

196
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:08,410
EXIT

197
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,245
Congratulations to everyone
who has reached the exit.

198
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,207
It is time now to make
a final roll of the dice.

199
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,833
A final roll?

200
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,804
We have to play again?

201
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,646
I'll roll the dice.

202
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,918
I'll roll the dice

203
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,629
and accept my fate.

204
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,464
Arisu…

205
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,705
Seven players must now
proceed to the exit.

206
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,301
Only seven.

207
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,928
One of us has to stay.

208
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,072
Usagi.

209
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,909
You're in charge now.

210
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,869
Huh?

211
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,121
What are you saying?

212
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,664
You have to live.

213
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,794
Bring everyone back to our world.

214
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:09,090
One minute remaining.

215
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,301
-Usagi, please.
-Arisu!

216
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,803
-This is what my future is.
-No!

217
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,597
-You can't do this!
-Usagi.

218
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,140
No! Don't leave me!

219
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,475
-Usagi, please.
-No!

220
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,311
-Usagi! Usagi…
-No, no, no, no!

221
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,438
-No!
-Listen up, everyone.

222
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,150
-Take Usagi with you and live.
-No!

223
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,318
Don't leave me!

224
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,737
-Ryuji!
-Ryuji, please.

225
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,531
Make sure she gets back to our world.

226
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,241
-No!
-Please!

227
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,993
-No! No!
-Thirty seconds remaining.

228
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,287
-Hurry, all of you!
-You can't! Arisu!

229
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,915
There's no more time! Sachiko, hurry!

230
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,917
No, Arisu!

231
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,794
-Hey…
-Arisu!

232
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,381
Ryuji, make sure
Usagi gets back to our world.

233
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,049
Ryuji, please!

234
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,717
Promise me.

235
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,554
Arisu! Arisu!

236
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,723
No!

237
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,977
No, wait, Arisu!

238
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,563
Arisu!

239
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,484
No! Arisu!

240
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:24,351
Come with me… to the land of death.

241
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,984
If you kill Usagi,

242
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,445
I promise to grant you your wish.

243
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,658
I promise you will learn
about the land of the dead.

244
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,786
A world beyond your wildest dreams.

245
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,309
What is he doing?

246
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,440
Usagi!

247
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,194
Hey! Ryuji! What are you doing?

248
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,614
Ryuji! Hey! Stop it, Ryuji! Stop!

249
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,034
No! Stop it! Hey! Usagi! Hey!

250
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:27,247
Ryuji! Don't do it! Stop!

251
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,047
Stop it! Hey!

252
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:36,965
Stop it!

253
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,257
Congratulations.

254
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,595
You, the last remaining player
in this room,

255
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,556
have entrusted everyone
with their futures.

256
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,935
And for this reason,
you now also have a future.

257
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,731
To the player who has
remained in this room,

258
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,940
game cleared.

259
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,444
What?

260
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,319
Usagi!

261
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,948
Usagi!

262
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,934
Congratulations, Arisu.

263
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,908
It's you.

264
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,079
Because you have succeeded
so brilliantly in winning,

265
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,082
you now have the right
to become a citizen of this place.

266
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,126
Become a citizen?

267
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,629
I would never choose to stay here.

268
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,924
You've been running after Usagi,
but she'll be dead soon.

269
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,717
Come on, Arisu.

270
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,429
Why not stay here,
and we can enjoy more games together?

271
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,684
You brought me back to this place
just for your own entertainment?

272
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,353
Of course.

273
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,939
You had no right to do that.

274
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,944
I knew you weren't the type of person
I could just summon here.

275
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,113
So I decided to use Usagi as bait.

276
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,910
You accepted to play the games
without hesitation.

277
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,246
You bastard!

278
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,350
-Are you okay?
-Arisu!

279
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,352
-I can't hold on!
-Help!

280
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,520
Ryuji!

281
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,565
Ryuji!

282
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,568
Take my arm!

283
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,156
Sachiko!

284
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,700
Give me your hand!

285
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,622
Yuna, hold on!

286
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,833
-You guys stay here!
-What?

287
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,921
Usagi!

288
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,805
-Arisu!
-Arisu!

289
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,431
Arisu!

290
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,768
-Quick! Go inside!
-Arisu!

291
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,104
Usagi!

292
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,692
Usagi!

293
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,822
Arisu!

294
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,660
Usagi!

295
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,611
Usagi!

296
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,377
It's all over now.

297
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,881
Impossible.

298
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,968
Can you see me?

299
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,116
Damn you!

300
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,384
Arisu?

301
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,511
Arisu!

302
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,015
Arisu! Arisu!

303
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,058
You have to bring back Usagi!

304
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,561
Arisu!

305
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,687
I expected as much from you, Arisu.

306
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,282
Have you decided to stay here with me?

307
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,786
No matter how many times you ask me,

308
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,414
I'll never accept to stay here.

309
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,337
You've really disappointed me.

310
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,843
Goodbye, Arisu. Game over.

311
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,317
I misjudged him.

312
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,278
It appears he wasn't
quite ready for this role.

313
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:43,107
Ohhh…

314
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,709
Are you the Joker?

315
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,421
Who is the Joker?

316
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,590
Who could it be?

317
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,924
Is it God?

318
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,051
Or is it me?

319
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,390
Shall we play one last game?

320
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,312
Please, have a seat.

321
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,797
Kindly choose one of these cards,
if you please.

322
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,176
Your choice of card will
determine your fate.

323
00:41:55,221 --> 00:42:00,643
However, if you choose the Joker,
then I shall win the game.

324
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:04,813
And so your destiny shall
be decided by me alone.

325
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:59,034
So it is.
And now your destiny belongs to me.

326
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,997
Both cards are Jokers, isn't that right?

327
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,588
What a coincidence.

328
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,882
Cut the bullshit.

329
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,634
You're cheating, period.

330
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,845
Listen, young man.

331
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:22,641
Every deck of cards contains
four suits of 13 cards each.

332
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:27,062
Add up the value of each card,
you get 364.

333
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:31,400
When you then add the Joker, you get 365.

334
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:36,238
Exactly the number of days
as in a year in your world.

335
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,994
And if you add another Joker, you get 366.

336
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,371
The same number of days as in a leap year.

337
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,250
So you see,

338
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:53,297
the two Joker cards are necessary based
on the truth of human time constructs.

339
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,550
The Joker is a jester

340
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:01,013
who fills in the gaps between the cards,
between the gaps in time.

341
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:05,601
And he fills in the gaps
between life and death.

342
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,480
So are you the Joker?

343
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,523
You misunderstand.

344
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,901
The Joker is not a person.

345
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,696
Neither is it an entity
that controls this world.

346
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,949
Nor an entity that oversees
the games we play.

347
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,618
The Joker

348
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,703
is just a card.

349
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,544
You are a very interesting human.

350
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,674
And I believe
that it is not entirely a coincidence

351
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,886
that both the cards that determined
your destiny were Jokers.

352
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,015
Your fate is in my hands.

353
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,810
It is mine to do as I please.

354
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,230
But…

355
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,484
in consideration of this coincidence,

356
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,278
I have decided to offer you a choice.

357
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,580
You will find death

358
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,125
just over there.

359
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:46,577
That vortex will drag you down,
and you will die.

360
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,130
Over there, you will find life.

361
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:05,304
Life is painful,
filled with many trials to endure.

362
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,389
Death, on the other hand,

363
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:11,435
is accepting the way of the universe
until you reach its natural end.

364
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,272
Which path do you chose?

365
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,693
Everyone passes through this place.

366
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:24,698
This is… the world between life and death.

367
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,035
Even if you return
to the world of the living,

368
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,162
your time will come,

369
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,332
and eventually, you'll be back here.

370
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,626
In the end,

371
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,129
everyone takes the path of the dead.

372
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:44,343
All the same,
do you wish to return to your world,

373
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,678
even if it means suffering and pain?

374
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,227
If you choose to return to your world,

375
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,855
the woman you are searching for,
and the baby,

376
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,690
may no longer be there.

377
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,694
The path of death is the easier way.

378
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,824
Just throw yourself into the vortex.

379
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,787
It's quite… empty,
emptier than you can imagine.

380
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,790
There's no more pain.

381
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,667
No more suffering.

382
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,545
And no happiness, either.

383
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,847
What is your purpose in this place?

384
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,268
I am the watchman.

385
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,979
My purpose, you see,

386
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:40,274
is solely to watch the space
between life and death.

387
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,318
Everybody dies.

388
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,532
I serve as the watchman
at the gates of death,

389
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,786
and for my services, death passes me by.

390
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,499
You recommend death to everyone,

391
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,586
and yet you're afraid of death yourself.

392
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,048
You might be right.

393
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,595
Is that why you gave me a choice?

394
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:15,851
I was interested in the opinion of someone
who has survived death many times.

395
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,902
Soon this place shall be flooded
with many people.

396
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,529
Flooded?

397
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,368
What will happen?

398
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,872
Something

399
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,125
much, much bigger than before.

400
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,128
Much bigger than that
which brought you here.

401
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,382
How many people are going to die?

402
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,844
That is none of my concern.

403
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:58,143
Ohhh…

404
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,574
It is time for you to choose your path.

405
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,832
I will return to the world
of the living with Usagi.

406
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,545
No!

407
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,547
Usagi?

408
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,474
Usagi!

409
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,809
Choose…

410
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,187
your destiny.

411
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,202
You are indeed
a truly interesting specimen.

412
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,267
Usagi!

413
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,198
Arisu!

414
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,159
Usagi!

415
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,375
Let's go together.

416
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,460
Arisu!

417
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,671
Hey! Ryuji!

418
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,271
Let's go to the land of death together.

419
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,272
What?

420
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,441
No! Stop!

421
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,193
Ryuji!

422
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,737
Usagi!

423
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,197
Ryuji!

424
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,490
Don't die!

425
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,493
No!

426
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,081
Stop! Ryuji!

427
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,817
Arisu!

428
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,694
Arisu!

429
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,033
Usagi!

430
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,119
Usagi!

431
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,203
No!

432
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,164
Usagi!

433
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,293
Arisu!

434
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,837
Arisu!

435
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,755
Usagi!

436
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,403
Arisu!

437
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,530
Arisu!

438
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,867
Arisu! Arisu!

439
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,244
Promise me.

440
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,413
Make sure Usagi gets back to our world!

441
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,081
Ryuji, please!

442
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,252
Keep on living.

443
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,469
Ryuji!

444
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,715
Usagi…

445
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,567
My daughter.

446
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,945
Father?

447
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,179
Father…

448
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,267
I've missed you so much.

449
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,732
In the world of the living,

450
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,360
I was so happy with you.

451
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,074
Dad…

452
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,961
I want you to live, Usagi.

453
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,964
I want you to be happy too.

454
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,174
Arisu!

455
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,755
Arisu…

456
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,030
How long have I been gone?

457
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,784
Two minutes.

458
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,787
You just made it out.

459
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,709
A few seconds more
and you might not have made it.

460
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:52,505
And Usagi? What happened to her?

461
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,802
Well, you should know that
better than anyone, Arisu.

462
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:00,680
I gotta go.

463
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,098
Oh!

464
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,891
I'm okay.

465
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,361
Thank you… Ann.

466
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,226
Usagi.

467
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,251
You're okay.

468
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,638
I'm hungry…

469
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,942
Arisu!

470
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,449
Well, because the baby will
be born during the summer…

471
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,117
We can use the kanji sign for summer…

472
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,411
-Natsumi.
-Natsumi.

473
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,621
-And the kanji for beauty.
-Mm.

474
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,582
-Natsuki.
-Natsuki…

475
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,167
RINKA, NATSUKI, KANADE,
KOHARU, NATSUMI

476
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,838
-Let me think. What else?
-Mm…

477
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,590
Look! Generosity.

478
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:42,633
-Huh. Hiro?
-Uh-huh.

479
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,886
It's difficult.

480
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,597
We already picked a lot of good names.

481
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,141
But now we really need to narrow it down.

482
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,393
If we just keep making
a list of good names,

483
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,812
we'll never make our minds up.

484
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,648
Hmm. One more…

485
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:03,112
Usagi, let's pick the one you prefer.

486
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,864
Typical.

487
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,991
The usual answer from men who don't care.

488
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,409
No, no!

489
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,661
I do care and I am thinking about it,

490
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,872
but it seems to me that

491
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:15,333
your name can decide your fate.

492
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,585
Why me?

493
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,171
It's better that you decide.

494
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:22,423
No way! We decide together!

495
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,094
-Ah, I'm late!
-Hm?

496
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,346
I have to go.

497
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,058
You think you can just leave like that?

498
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,063
I will never leave you.

499
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,898
I promise, my love.

500
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,568
I love you too.

501
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,657
So then when you come back,
we find that name.

502
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,535
-Huh?
-Tonight we name our child!

503
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:51,994
Run! Until tonight!

504
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,413
I'll see you later.

505
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,851
I wanna say thanks, Mom.

506
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,395
It's all thanks to you
that I could graduate.

507
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:19,313
You know that's not true.

508
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,650
Well, it's my turn now.

509
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:23,901
Your turn?

510
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,822
To make you happy, Mom.
It's my turn to take care of you now.

511
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,493
I think I'm better at that game.

512
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:36,122
-I had an idea.
-Yeah?

513
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,374
-I'd like us to visit his grave together.
-Really?

514
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:42,128
Yeah. I think it's about time
I introduced you to my brother.

515
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,088
"Sohta, this is my boyfriend."

516
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:45,756
-You're right.
-Yeah.

517
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,551
-Well, then I have a lot to think about.
-Like what?

518
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,178
-Well, like, what to say, what to wear…
-None of that's important.

519
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,597
You have to do these things right!

520
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,391
-Okay, so what'll you wear?
-Hmm, let me think…

521
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:56,642
Maybe I should wear a suit.

522
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,645
You're no longer a child.
You have to take care of yourself.

523
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,397
You'll soon be in high school.

524
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,940
Yeah, I know.

525
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,401
Sometimes I wonder who you take after.

526
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,737
After you, Mom, that's obvious.

527
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,405
Really?

528
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:12,408
Obviously!

529
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,369
I read your letter.

530
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,706
Thanks, Mom, for watching the show.

531
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:23,002
Mmm. I got a job working
on a new anime project.

532
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:27,173
Mmm. And this time, it's gonna be a movie.

533
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:30,134
You and Dad can go watch it together.

534
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:32,094
'Kay.

535
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,014
ARISU

536
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,644
Thank you for your visit.

537
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,063
Would you like
to make your next appointment?

538
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:45,608
Do you have any availabilities
around mid-May?

539
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,526
Let me check the appointments.

540
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:53,032
What do you do
that gives your life a sense of meaning?

541
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,659
A sense of meaning?

542
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,292
Well, I guess when I'm in the dojo,
practicing karate.

543
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,503
I thought you had stopped karate?

544
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:09,048
Well, actually,
I started teaching at my father's club.

545
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,510
When I see all those kids
practicing so hard,

546
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,762
that's what gives me meaning.

547
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:16,555
It makes me happy.

548
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:25,189
Are you still having some flashbacks?

549
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:29,068
Lately, I've been sleeping a lot better.

550
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:30,945
And my job's going well.

551
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:32,989
Well, that's good to hear.

552
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,324
You told me that since the event,

553
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:38,369
you've been thinking a lot
about the meaning of life.

554
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:44,166
I ask myself,
"What's the point in living?"

555
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:50,923
Maybe for this hat?

556
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,759
Stopping the shop from going bust?

557
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:06,272
What are the things
that give meaning to your life now?

558
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:10,735
It's important to me that people see me
as a role model and as an influencer.

559
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:17,074
That way…
That way I can get to see the world.

560
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,498
You're very courageous.

561
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:32,423
What is it that gives you a sense
of purpose, a sense of meaning in life?

562
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,801
For a long time, I really didn't know.

563
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,888
I didn't understand why I was still alive.

564
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:42,016
But lately, I've realized that

565
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:44,894
coming to terms with my being alive
is my mission in life.

566
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,231
So, right now…

567
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,610
…I work with kids that are in trouble.

568
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:58,824
Meaning?

569
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,161
Hmm.

570
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:06,749
That's a good question.

571
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,346
Even if I don't know,

572
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,723
it's not that important.

573
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,975
Life can still be good.

574
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,812
That's very true.

575
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:32,108
And what about you?

576
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,653
What is it that gives
meaning to your life?

577
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:37,988
What keeps you alive?

578
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:39,490
Huh?

579
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,202
That's a really good question.

580
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,997
Hmm, today, I'd say…

581
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:51,168
it's about picking names for my child.

582
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:54,922
Wow.

583
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:13,149
-I'll leave this here.
-Thank you.

584
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:26,078
-Another one.
-Is it another earthquake?

585
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,246
Mm-hmm.

586
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:42,052
-I think it's over, right?
-Mmm.

587
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:45,389
-There was a big one earlier too.
-Mmm.

588
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,267
-We seem to be having a lot.
-Yeah, you're right.

589
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,935
I wonder if it's on the news?

590
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:54,106
Reports are coming in of an earthquake
off the coast of Chiba,

591
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:57,484
approximately 40 miles below
the earth's surface.

592
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:00,863
The government advised
that there is zero risk of tsunami.

593
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:04,366
News is coming in about another
earthquake in the Kantō region,

594
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,577
measuring five on the Richter scale.

595
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:10,247
It appears now that seismic activity
has been recorded simultaneously

596
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:14,335
in multiple locations around the planet,
including California in the United States.

597
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:17,755
Experts are suggesting this may be a sign
of tectonic movement on a global scale…

598
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:20,633
…regions in Japan,
parts of Europe and the US West Coast.

599
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:24,178
Experts are now suggesting
that global environmental changes

600
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:26,847
may be having an impact
on seismic activity

601
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,850
which could potentially trigger
these simultaneous tremors.

602
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:33,145
Seismologists are calling
the unprecedented series of earthquakes

603
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,481
an extremely rare phenomenon,

604
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,651
indicating a major concern
for the trigger effect…

605
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,861
Hey, guys, are you ready?

606
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,781
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

607
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:47,952
Everybody, right?

608
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,662
How you doin'? Can we get a table for two?

609
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,747
And, uh, by the window if you can.

610
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:52,873
Thank you.

611
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,125
Been watching the playoffs, right?

612
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:56,669
-Nah, I haven't.
-What?

613
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,295
-Yeah, man.
-Not one game?

614
01:10:58,379 --> 01:10:59,421
Has it been good?

615
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,841
Bro, best series
I've probably seen since 2010.

616
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:03,968
-No way.
-Easily.

617
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,427
-No, I don't believe you.
-Easily.

618
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,763
-I might have to check it out.
-You gotta check it out.

619
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:09,515
Can I have a beer on tap, please?

620
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:11,850
I'll do the same.
And then a couple waters as well.

621
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,812
-Best series since 2010?
-Yeah, bro, you gotta…
