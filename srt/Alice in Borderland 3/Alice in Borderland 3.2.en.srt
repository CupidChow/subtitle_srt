1
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,925
The game will now commence.

2
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,643
The game?

3
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,481
What game?

4
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,778
I don't get it.
A game? What's she talking about?

5
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:34,325
I'd like to know…
where did everyone disappear to?

6
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,203
There was no one
at Shinagawa Station either.

7
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,832
Damn it! Ugh!

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,335
Ugh. I guess I had too much.

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,385
Game, Sacred Fortunes.

10
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,685
Rules. Draw ten fortune slips,
and test your luck.

11
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,312
FORTUNES

12
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:07,692
If you decipher the sacred fortune slips
accurately and manage to survive,

13
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,611
then you will clear the game.

14
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:14,449
However, each person may
only draw a slip once.

15
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,745
The time limit is one minute per draw.

16
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,041
The game will now commence.

17
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,421
It must be some kinda ceremony
or festival, I guess.

18
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,090
I'm not so sure.

19
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,927
Didn't she just say we clear the game
if we manage to survive?

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,386
So that means

21
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,680
that we'll die if we get the answer wrong?

22
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,766
Nah, that'd be ridiculous.

23
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,602
Well, if you ask me,
this could be a lotta fun.

24
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:56,157
The guy's wasted. He's high on drugs.

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,701
Okay then!

26
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,796
17!

27
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,925
17…

28
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,095
17!

29
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,226
First draw. Start.

30
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,279
"Great fortunes and blessings."

31
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,032
"In everything you do, you will succeed."
And bingo!

32
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,326
-I don't believe it!
-You see?

33
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,912
We don't know if this is
a good thing or not yet.

34
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,299
Well, maybe nothing actually happens
when the slip reads "great fortune."

35
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,636
Okay. We should
continue drawing the slips.

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,054
But who's next?

37
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,764
Do you wanna do it?

38
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,392
I'll do it! I'll give it a try.

39
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,643
Be my guest.

40
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,572
21.

41
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,577
Second draw. Start.

42
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,165
"Good luck."

43
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,251
"Perseverance brings good luck.
Marriage prospects are good."

44
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:34,297
"Study hard and you will graduate.
West is your unlucky direction."

45
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,924
Hmm…

46
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,385
There's a math problem written here.

47
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,930
Do you mind if I take a look?

48
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,937
Are we supposed to… solve this?

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,105
Please provide your answer.

50
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,483
-It's 15.
-15, I guess?

51
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,609
-Hmm?
-15.

52
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,361
-Isn't it 18?
-What?

53
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,946
-It's five.
-It could be nine.

54
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,240
-So which one is it?
-We don't have time. Hurry up!

55
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,075
-Ten seconds remaining.
-Uh…

56
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,160
Uh, it's 18! The right answer's 18!

57
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,120
-The answer's 15.
-Isn't it 25?

58
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,373
The correct answer is… 15.

59
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,458
See?

60
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,751
-I was right.
-It's my mistake.

61
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,129
If your answer is incorrect,
fire arrows will be shot.

62
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,049
One for each margin of error
in your calculation.

63
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,635
Everyone, please be careful.

64
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,095
Fire arrows?

65
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,441
-What's happening?
-What's going on?

66
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,819
-Get outta my way!
-Hey!

67
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,906
Please! Please! Please!

68
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,789
It's 45.

69
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,166
45, 45. Forty…

70
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,006
Third draw. Start.

71
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,508
"Some luck…"

72
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,843
Is there a problem to solve?

73
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,222
"How many people need to gather

74
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:34,102
for the probability of two people having
the same birthday to exceed 50%?"

75
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,062
"One. 23 people."

76
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,772
"Two. 78 people."

77
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,857
"Three. 183 people."

78
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,151
"Four. 365 people."

79
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,986
Wow! I've absolutely no idea.

80
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,696
It's a probability problem.

81
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,782
I think it has to be
over one hundred people.

82
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,659
So it must be 183 people.

83
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,827
It's 23 people.

84
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,622
-Only 23?
-So, maybe 183?

85
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,958
20 seconds remaining.

86
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,167
Okay…

87
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,129
The answer is…

88
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,506
The answer is number two, 78.

89
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,091
What? Why'd you say that?

90
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,051
I just picked the number in-between.

91
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,595
-Oh, please!
-The correct answer is number one.

92
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,763
23 people.

93
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,349
-I told you so!
-Margin of error, 55.

94
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,114
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

95
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,700
Fourth draw. Start.

96
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,286
"How long does it take for
blood that is pumped through the heart

97
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:38,458
to circulate through the entire human body
and return back to the heart?"

98
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,751
"Answer one. Five seconds."

99
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,837
"Two. 30 seconds."

100
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,256
"Three. 80 seconds."

101
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,092
80 seconds! Answer number three!

102
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,636
The correct answer is number two.

103
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,054
30 seconds.

104
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,764
Margin of error, 50.

105
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,278
"At the city zoo,
50 animals flip over onto their backs

106
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,905
in a specific order."

107
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,283
"When it flipped on its back,
what number was the lion?"

108
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,410
Nothing else?

109
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,953
Is it a riddle?

110
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,164
The lion's 47th.

111
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,667
The correct answer is 17th.

112
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,627
How come?

113
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,465
When you flip the word lion onto
it's back, you get the number 17.

114
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,259
-That's bullshit!
-Margin of error, 30.

115
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,519
In Roman numerals, I equals one,
V equals five, and X equals ten.

116
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,979
What does the letter L equal?

117
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,357
A hundred!

118
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,068
The correct answer is 50.

119
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,904
-I'm sorry!
-Margin of error, 50.

120
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,661
-Margin of error, 55.
-Fuck!

121
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,469
Eighth draw. Start.

122
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,254
I'm starting to remember.

123
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,841
-Arisu. Live for us.
-Karube!

124
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,095
I remember.

125
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,601
I remember that I cleared
so many games in this country.

126
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,774
To hell with this!

127
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,943
I'm drawing "great fortune and blessings."

128
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,279
Yeah, go on! You can do it!

129
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,246
Ninth draw. Start.

130
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,206
"Small fortune and blessings…"

131
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,542
If it's another math question,
I'm finished.

132
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,877
Small is better than none.

133
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,629
-Read the problem.
-Okay.

134
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,761
"Milk is made from various nutrients
contained in the cow's blood."

135
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:42,099
"How many liters of cow's blood do
you need to make one liter of cow's milk?"

136
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:43,893
What?

137
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,478
Does anyone know the answer?

138
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,813
What kind of person would know
the answer to that nonsense?

139
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,939
I have no idea!

140
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,650
-20 seconds.
-Just give any answer!

141
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,235
Stop shouting at her.
She needs to clear her mind.

142
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,572
-We don't have any time! Hurry it up!
-I don't understand this kind of stuff!

143
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,907
Just give any answer!

144
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,245
Ten seconds remaining.

145
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,706
The answer is…

146
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,834
It's two liters!

147
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,214
The correct answer is 450 liters.

148
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,049
-What?
-450 liters?

149
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,427
It takes that much blood?
Uh, just to make one liter of milk?

150
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,472
-Margin of error, 448.
-I'm sorry!

151
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,226
You gotta be kidding me!

152
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,583
I'm so sorry!

153
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,044
Never mind, sorry! Help me with this!

154
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,046
God damn it!

155
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,843
Shit, it's too hot!
Damn it! It's too hot. It's too hot!

156
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,344
Don't move, okay?

157
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,848
Oh, this is gonna hurt.

158
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,395
Sorry, I have to do this.

159
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,528
-What are you doing?
-It's over now.

160
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,488
Stay with me, okay?

161
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,032
All right, I got this.

162
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,411
I'm surprised that
you know how to do that.

163
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,330
If I go to the hospital,
I end up getting arrested by the cops.

164
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,375
That's it!
How are you feeling? Stay awake!

165
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,432
-It's too hot!
-This is the last chance we have.

166
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,225
This is the tenth draw.

167
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,644
Succeed and we clear the game.

168
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,814
-We're counting on you.
-I can't take this!

169
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,982
Got it.

170
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,862
We're suffocating! The fire's
out of control. We're gonna die.

171
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,822
Please help us!

172
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,201
Tenth draw. Start.

173
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,336
NUMBER 58
EXTREME BAD LUCK

174
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,214
Well, I guess we're all screwed now…

175
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,091
Congratulations.

176
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,928
-I'm sorry.
-Read us the problem.

177
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,476
"What is the current
total population of planet Earth?"

178
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,061
Huh?

179
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:37,775
I once heard that the world's population
increases by 80 million people annually.

180
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,194
A few years ago it was about 7.88 billion.

181
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,781
If we get it wrong, they'll be shooting
millions and millions of arrows at us.

182
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,616
Don't be ridiculous. That's impossible.

183
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,536
20 seconds remaining.

184
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,628
Ten seconds remaining.

185
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,090
The answer is 7.9 billion.

186
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,178
The correct answer is… eight billion.

187
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,305
-You're joking.
-That's a margin of 100 million.

188
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,101
Shut the fuck up! That doesn't make sense!
How could anyone shoot that many arrows?

189
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,281
You gotta be kidding me…

190
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,118
A hundred million arrows
heading for us here.

191
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,911
What are we gonna do now?

192
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,122
We're doomed. What do I do?

193
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,749
Think, Arisu… Think!

194
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,505
If you decipher the sacred
fortune slips accurately…

195
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,842
"Study hard and you will graduate.
West is your unlucky direction."

196
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,386
DIRECTIONAL FORTUNE CHART

197
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,429
WEST

198
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,016
The direction…

199
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,851
-What?
-What did you say?

200
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,229
Maybe the direction written on the slip
is a hint to how to escape the arrows.

201
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,815
-I already threw mine away!
-What about yours?

202
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,984
It says… "West is bad luck."

203
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,944
Last time, the arrows came
from that direction.

204
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,863
Okay, so does anyone have a compass?

205
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,824
-Why the hell would I have a compass?
-Mine says northeast is unlucky.

206
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,452
-The arrows came from there!
-Mine says north is unlucky.

207
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,037
Southeast is unlucky for me.

208
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,788
-Mine says the east.
-And mine is southwest.

209
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,333
-Mine says south!
-My fortune slip is blank.

210
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,669
Which direction was "great fortune"?

211
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,672
I told you guys, I threw it away!

212
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,632
-You did what?
-Away!

213
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,967
-Look! Arrows!
-We have to do something!

214
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,969
Find somewhere to hide!

215
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,888
No one drew northwest.

216
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,808
-What?
-Northwest was the only direction missing.

217
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,894
It must have been
on the "great fortune" slip.

218
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,271
It might be the way to escape
"extremely bad luck."

219
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,232
-Come on! Hurry, everyone!
-Run! Move it!

220
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,411
Don't move!

221
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,246
What do we do now?

222
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,582
-There's nothing here!
-There must be something.

223
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,793
-Like what?
-Look, there's a well!

224
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,922
It's been sealed up!

225
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,179
On the way to the shrine, I noticed
that the stairs were quite steep.

226
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,056
Who cares about the stairs?

227
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,015
It means

228
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,393
that somewhere around here

229
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,979
there has to be…

230
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,819
…an underground tunnel!

231
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,076
They're on the way.

232
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,747
No way.

233
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,003
That's impossible…
There's a hundred million!

234
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,379
I need some help!

235
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,343
You're too late! Forget it.

236
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,529
It's a tunnel!

237
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,451
-Inside!
-Hurry!

238
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,619
Move it!

239
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,218
Hey! Hey!

240
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,035
This way, come on.

241
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,463
Game cleared.

242
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,756
Congratulations.

243
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,425
We made it.

244
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,129
PROCEED 17 KM NORTHEAST
THE "GAME" STARTS AT SUNDOWN TOMORROW

245
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,214
There's another game?

246
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,678
And what happens if we don't go?

247
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,306
Yeah, she's right.
We should just stay here.

248
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,476
Yeah, but if we decide not to go,
then what'll happen?

249
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,358
There's no running from the games.

250
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,529
So, does this mean…

251
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,866
Yeah.

252
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,870
All of us… have been here before.

253
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,033
Hey, big sis!

254
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,744
Aah!

255
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,704
Big sis?

256
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,874
Look what baby sis
just found for you. Look!

257
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,169
-What is it?
-It's a walking stick.

258
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,421
-Oh!
-I thought it might help you get around.

259
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,340
That's kind of you.

260
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,466
It's so bright and shiny.

261
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,593
Gyaru style suits you!

262
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,974
Hey, Arisu, look!
I found loads of stuff for everyone.

263
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,351
Well done.

264
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,811
-Woo-hoo!
-We got some food too.

265
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,854
Great!

266
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,610
He had these eyes
that really gave me the chills.

267
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,781
When he looked at me,
it was like he wasn't even human.

268
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,743
Now that I think about it…

269
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,620
Aah.

270
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,955
…I think I met the same guy.

271
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,334
Are you serious?

272
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,211
It was about two years ago.

273
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,799
Just after I… went and did this to myself.

274
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,301
You poor thing. That's terrible.

275
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,597
When the medics found me,
I was unconscious.

276
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,557
Anyways, I survived.

277
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,810
But then…

278
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,647
maybe because I'd been bullied a lot…

279
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,235
I became even more of a loner.

280
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,487
My life never got back to normal.

281
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,948
Then one day…

282
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,992
That man gave you the card.

283
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,494
Mm-hm.

284
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:37,916
Now that you mention it,
I think I also met him before coming here.

285
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,209
Where was he?

286
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,546
Well, it's a little embarrassing.

287
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,799
I was a member of a women's support group.

288
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,801
What kind of support group?

289
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,347
It was a support group for housewives
with family issues.

290
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,933
Groups like these exist, you know?

291
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,938
I realized that this man was
actually manipulating me.

292
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,152
So then… is this guy the Joker?

293
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,989
When we were in this place before,

294
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,366
we cleared all the games
from the deck of cards.

295
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,160
Every suit in the deck.

296
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,538
But we never fought against the Joker.

297
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,542
Are you saying that
that's the man we're facing now?

298
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,711
That we're going to have
to fight the Joker?

299
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,421
Probably, yeah.

300
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,882
And there's one other thing.

301
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,217
I think we've all got something in common.

302
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,180
I think that each and every one of us
today has been here before.

303
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,639
You're right.

304
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,851
My memories are starting
to come back to me now.

305
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:42,898
Yeah, it's the same for me.
I've played games here before.

306
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,275
And in my case,

307
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,111
I was supervising
club activities back in school.

308
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,031
And that's when
I went into cardiac arrest.

309
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,034
And I was assaulted by a stalker.

310
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,040
And I was in Shibuya when the meteor hit.

311
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,958
And those games…

312
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,505
I'd prefer not to remember them.

313
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:28,318
So, Arisu, have you been here before too?

314
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,655
I have, yeah.

315
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,770
Can you believe that guy?

316
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,274
He actually followed his wife
back into this place.

317
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,317
I feel sorry for you.

318
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,070
-You've never been in love, have you?
-What?

319
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,406
It's a husband's duty
to look after his wife.

320
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,241
To treasure and support her.

321
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:20,579
Okay, but what are the chances
he'll be able to find his wife here?

322
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,748
Hmm… I'd say his chance is around 5%.

323
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,210
-He's got absolutely zero chance. Fool.
-Be quiet, he can hear you!

324
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,214
He's not wrong.
We might all die in the next game anyway.

325
00:26:56,197 --> 00:27:03,204
"GAME" ARENA THIS WAY

326
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,971
Damn… this is creepy.

327
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,826
Well, looks like
were not the only ones here.

328
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,457
Game, Zombie Hunt.

329
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,960
Zombie Hunt?

330
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,129
Rules.

331
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:59,135
Each of the participants will now
receive seven playing cards each.

332
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,598
You are to use these cards
to play one-on-one games.

333
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:09,104
The games are to be played at designated
tables installed throughout this facility.

334
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,320
In these games, you will play cards

335
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,365
from the same suit
from the hand dealt to you.

336
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:25,453
The one with the highest
cumulative total wins the game.

337
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:30,333
The winning player then receives
one card from the losing player.

338
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,881
The one with the highest total wins.

339
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,217
The game seems pretty simple.

340
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,720
So what's this got to do with zombies?

341
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,433
This game also contains
three special cards.

342
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,768
The first one…

343
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,896
the Zombie card.

344
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,399
Now I see. Okay.

345
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:01,448
Only one person from each group
will receive the Zombie card.

346
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:11,458
The Zombie card trumps every other card
in the deck. It's an instant win.

347
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:15,503
The losing player then becomes
infected by the zombie,

348
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:20,008
and a Zombie card is added to their hand.

349
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:25,263
There is a card in the deck
to stop the zombies from multiplying.

350
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,515
The Shotgun card.

351
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,519
The Shotgun card is used to kill zombies.

352
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:37,358
Each player from each team is guaranteed
to receive a Shotgun card.

353
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:44,783
You can use the Shotgun card even if the
Zombie card is not placed on the table.

354
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,744
That means there's a risk
we'll be killed by zombies.

355
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:51,706
The Shotgun card can only be used once,
then it disappears.

356
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,959
The card is also ineffective
against humans.

357
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,546
If you prefer a peaceful
method for stopping the zombies,

358
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,507
there is the Vaccine card.

359
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,052
The Vaccine card will
be distributed randomly

360
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,012
between members of each group.

361
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,473
When this card is played,

362
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:12,185
it cancels out the Zombie card
placed on the table,

363
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,857
and it turns the zombie back into a human.

364
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,737
However, you cannot
use the Vaccine card on yourself.

365
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:29,744
Use both of these cards
to stop the zombies from multiplying.

366
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,582
The game ends after 20 rounds.

367
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:39,420
Those of you who run out of number cards
during these 20 rounds

368
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,589
will be eliminated.

369
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,676
Zombies or humans,

370
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,221
the side with the most players
at the end of the game wins.

371
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,223
LARGER SIDE AFTER 20 ROUNDS WINS
HUMANS / ZOMBIES

372
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,893
The side with the fewest players
will be eliminated.

373
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:59,440
Teams will enter this game through the
four entrances of the research facility,

374
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,777
with only one team allowed
at each entrance.

375
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,280
So that means there are other teams.

376
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,827
There is also one zombie
in each of the other teams.

377
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,037
So there are just four cards?

378
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,917
Ready. Game start.

379
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,087
Players, please take your cards.

380
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,981
No Zombie, please.

381
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,819
First round. Start.

382
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:50,950
Choose your opponent. Touch them,
and then move to the game table.

383
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,852
Please place your cards.

384
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,358
In this game,
the numbers on the cards aren't important.

385
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:28,154
After 20 rounds, we just need
to have at least one number card left.

386
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,822
Show your cards.

387
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,034
Sorry about that.

388
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,286
Stupid game.

389
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,247
We should probably avoid playing
against the other teams.

390
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,874
If we just play within our own team,

391
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,335
we can simply share
our number cards with each other.

392
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,254
-That seems to be right.
-Mm-hm.

393
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,799
Second round. Start.

394
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,009
The problem is the three special cards.

395
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,971
And the real problem is the Zombie card.

396
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,890
Show your cards.

397
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,353
-It means I win. Sorry.
-Hmm.

398
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,398
It's really cramped up here.

399
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,817
There are other game tables
on the lower floor.

400
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,154
-We could use it as our base.
-Good idea. There's lots of room.

401
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,454
-Whew! This place is huge!
-If we prevent zombies multiplying

402
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,082
over the course of 20 rounds,
then humans will win.

403
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,710
Take a look at this place!

404
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,921
So if I understand correctly,
there's a zombie on our team, right?

405
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,718
Yes, and it's highly unlikely that
they would even tell anyone on the team.

406
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,136
Why not?

407
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:37,515
Because if you're a zombie, you run
the risk of getting a Shotgun card.

408
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,267
That's for sure.

409
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,603
Third round. Start.

410
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,189
There's another group!

411
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,443
Come on! We gotta touch 'em first!

412
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,319
-Let's go!
-Right behind you.

413
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,155
Nice to meet you.

414
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,908
Show your cards.

415
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,120
In order to stop the zombies multiplying,

416
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:03,207
we need to identify the random players
who have received a Vaccine card.

417
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,878
This will be the key step
to ensure victory.

418
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,296
I'm the winner!

419
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,842
So far in our group, we haven't
confirmed the existence of a Vaccine card.

420
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,678
And that means there's a high chance

421
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,473
the holder is among
the players from the other teams.

422
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:22,101
INSTITUTE OF VIRUS RESEARCH

423
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,573
Sh. We have to find other teams.

424
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,825
Yes, but if we spread out
too much, it's risky.

425
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,453
Yeah. If we split and see all the floors…

426
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,789
-Mmm.
-That'll help, I think.

427
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,957
-Be safer. Safety in numbers.
-Yeah.

428
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,334
Less exposed.

429
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,294
-Usagi!
-And then we meet back here.

430
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,712
Excuse me, miss?

431
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,715
-What do you think?
-We need to identify special card holders.

432
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,634
We need to identify them,

433
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,762
and gather as many of the Vaccine
and Shotgun cards within our group,

434
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,222
to keep us protected.

435
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:05,478
Players, please choose
your opponent and touch them.

436
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,860
-Can I ask you something?
-About what?

437
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,864
I'm looking for a young woman named Usagi.

438
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,242
Any chance you've seen her?

439
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,787
Early 30s,
with short hair about this length.

440
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,205
She's around five feet tall.

441
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,333
Sorry, no idea.
You're describing half the women in here.

442
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,795
I suppose…

443
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,882
But I can tell you something.

444
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,220
This Joker stage seems
to be more like a tournament.

445
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,140
So even if you do find this woman,

446
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,059
you might end up
having to kill each other.

447
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,606
What does he mean, "tournament?"

448
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,526
He means we can't choose
which games we participate in.

449
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,444
And once we arrive in the arena,

450
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,490
we meet up with players
who have survived in other arenas.

451
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,743
He might be right.

452
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,914
That's definitely different
from when I played in this country before.

453
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:10,084
Back then, we could move freely
between the games.

454
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,460
You're right about that.

455
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,422
So this means
that when this tournament is over,

456
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,133
a small number of players will remain.

457
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,512
And most likely,
those players who do survive…

458
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,557
Will end up having to kill each other.

459
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,686
That's some scary shit.

460
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,698
Players, please choose
your opponent and touch them.

461
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,251
Please place your cards.

462
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,587
Ma'am, my guess is

463
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,964
you've been infected by a zombie.

464
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,258
I…

465
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,971
Ever since we sat down at the table,
you've avoided making eye contact with me.

466
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,433
If you wanted to generate trust
and survive by sharing cards,

467
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,143
you'd have looked me in the eye.

468
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,394
I…

469
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,022
And it also happens that until now,

470
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,692
you've always played against
the same woman since the game started.

471
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,404
And now, all of sudden,
you want to play against me?

472
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,532
So I gather that
you've turned her into a zombie,

473
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,660
and now you've split up and moved on.

474
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,287
Because once you become a zombie,

475
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,665
infecting other people is
your only way to win.

476
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,345
Spreading zombies here
would be very unwise.

477
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,597
Zombies can get shot.

478
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,101
But if you remain human,
there's no risk involved.

479
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,313
All the players on our team
still have their Shotgun card.

480
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:58,567
Once you're exposed as a zombie,
someone will try to kill you.

481
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,611
So what do you think?

482
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,448
When we find someone with a Vaccine card,
we'll cure you.

483
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,784
But for now, why don't you stay with us?

484
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,718
Show your cards.

485
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,009
I believe that zombies have
already started to multiply.

486
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,178
Are they… both zombies?

487
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,972
So what are we gonna do with them?

488
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,476
We have to find some Vaccine cards.

489
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,770
Listen, kid.

490
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,690
Stop overthinkin' this, okay?
Wouldn't it be better just to kill them?

491
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,401
It's not that easy for some of us to kill,
you know!

492
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,779
We have to find a way to stop
the zombies from spreading.

493
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,947
Does anyone have any ideas?

494
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,284
I know a way.

495
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,496
There is one way to stop the Zombie cards

496
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,707
without everyone here
having to kill each other.

497
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,007
-What way?
-You should be careful.

498
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,551
This one's never been part of our team.

499
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,054
She might be a zombie.

500
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,562
The only way to stop zombie proliferation
is to form a group

501
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,941
and promise to always use
the Vaccine card to cure each other.

502
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,569
That way, even if
a member of our team becomes a zombie,

503
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,113
they don't have to worry about it.

504
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:10,032
Seeing as we have the Vaccine cards,
we can cure 'em.

505
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,410
And then, once they're cured,

506
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:16,414
we get them to tell us who it was that
infected them with the Zombie card.

507
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,583
Once we know, we threaten to shoot them.

508
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,670
And then all the zombies
will become scared,

509
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,339
and they will stay far away from our team.

510
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,801
So we all make the promise to cure
each other with the vaccine.

511
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,928
And if someone doesn't?

512
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,473
Let's say, for example…

513
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,643
that you're a zombie.

514
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,727
Hold this.

515
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:44,275
And for the sake of argument, let's say
that you also hold a Vaccine card.

516
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,487
And then, you play your Zombie card

517
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,197
and reveal yourself to your opponent.

518
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,159
And then he's the one
who becomes a zombie.

519
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:57,329
At that moment, you can then promise
to use your Vaccine card to cure him.

520
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,666
So, what do you think will happen now?

521
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,502
What?

522
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,590
You confessed to your opponent
that you're a zombie.

523
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,341
What do you think will happen?

524
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,219
You've just told everyone
they can kill you at any time.

525
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,807
Make an alliance with your opponent
by using yourself as a hostage?

526
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,142
Very good.

527
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,644
And, of course, you will keep
your promise that you just made

528
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,188
because you don't wanna die.

529
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,399
If you break it, it's like you're giving
everyone a license to kill you.

530
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:30,404
My zombie friend has accepted
to deliberately become a human hostage.

531
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:36,619
We repeat the same process
and promise with multiple people.

532
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,080
And in this way,
we create a unified group built on trust.

533
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,083
We build this trust by making
the same promise to everyone we play.

534
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,420
If you become a zombie,
we promise to cure you with the vaccine.

535
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,756
But we've only got one Vaccine card.

536
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,176
I know. But we'll get other
Vaccine card holders to join us.

537
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,136
There won't be enough cards.

538
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,431
Well, you see, the beauty is

539
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,975
nobody knows
how many Vaccine cards there are.

540
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,894
All we have to do

541
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:05,314
is make everybody else believe
that we have enough cards.

542
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,567
Just enough Vaccine cards
to save everybody.

543
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:14,031
And that way,
the zombies won't come near us.

544
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:18,285
And that way, we increase our number.
And we clear the game.

545
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,997
And do you think that somewhere out there,

546
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,417
someone holds both a Zombie card
and a Vaccine card?

547
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,795
Well, naturally, that would be me.

548
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,338
Huh?

549
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:33,050
So, I guess that explains
why you came to see us?

550
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,844
Yep! I wanted to test my sales pitch.

551
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,139
So, what's your name?

552
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,519
Rei.

553
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,064
We'll share the Vaccine card…

554
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,899
The first thing that we need to do

555
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:53,112
is to explain our "trust barricade"
strategy to all the other groups.

556
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:56,073
Then the zombies will be
afraid to approach us.

557
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,868
They're afraid because,
even if they use their Zombie card on us,

558
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:03,664
that will expose them as zombies
and they run the risk of getting shot.

559
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,625
So, if we can increase
the number of players

560
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,544
in our trust barricade strategy,

561
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,837
then we can win.

562
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,464
I get it.

563
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,384
Okay, I'm in.

564
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,139
The team from below is promising
to use their Vaccine card on each other

565
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,682
in order to win the game.

566
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,185
By using the vaccine,
they can turn a zombie back into a human.

567
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,271
I really don't trust those people.

568
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,357
I heard they're sharing information about
the players who turned into zombies.

569
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,485
What it means is, if you turn
a member of their team into a zombie,

570
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,155
they will share your identity
and use it to have you killed.

571
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,825
So, just between you and me,
earlier during one of the games,

572
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,536
a player turned one of their team
into a zombie.

573
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,580
When they found out who that player was…

574
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,291
Well, that person didn't last too long.

575
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,250
Seriously?

576
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,044
Apparently, that group made a promise

577
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,172
that even if you become a zombie, they'll
cure you using their Vaccine cards.

578
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:56,842
At this stage of the game,
it might be safer just to join that group.

579
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,719
-They've got some balls.
-I know.

580
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,805
Do you really think
this trust barricade strategy will work?

581
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,141
Just sit back and hold my beer.

582
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,562
We'll manage the arrival
of the new members on the ground floor.

583
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,939
-My name's Miyano.
-Okay. Mi-ya-no.

584
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,192
Yes, sir. I have a Vaccine card.

585
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,570
Good. You're the third person. And you?

586
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,531
First, we'll try
to play games between teammates.

587
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,950
We can share our number cards as we play.

588
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:25,704
In other words, we'll lose
to players who have fewer cards.

589
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:29,750
Additionally, winners can take cards
with smaller numbers from the losers.

590
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,964
In that way, zombies will only battle
against other zombies.

591
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,884
If we keep to our plan,
zombies won't proliferate,

592
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,678
and we won't have to kill each other.

593
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,514
We won't run out of number cards either.

594
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,808
And if we keep doing this,

595
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,727
we'll increase the number
of Vaccine card holders.

596
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,538
It's already the 11th round.

597
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,958
At this stage, maybe we should
join that group on the lower floor?

598
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,210
I heard they've collected
all the Vaccine cards.

599
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,003
We don't know if that's true.

600
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,594
The infected humans
ought to be sequestered.

601
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,891
We won't be able
to gather any more Vaccine cards.

602
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:31,437
I mean, we don't even know
how many cards there are in total.

603
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,441
Threatening zombies with death
just isn't enough anymore.

604
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,819
But there is another way
of increasing our chances of survival.

605
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,696
What is it?

606
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,784
We simply reduce the zombie population.

607
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,250
That's not a bad idea.

608
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,795
Hey. This guy turned into a zombie.

609
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,049
Okay, put him in there.

610
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,731
So who was it that turned you
into a zombie? Do you remember?

611
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,318
-Yeah, I remember.
-Good.

612
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,990
Let's use a shotgun.

613
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,458
What about you?

614
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,753
Do you think you can handle this?

615
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,091
You'll get vaccine priority.

616
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:01,652
Players, please place your cards.

617
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,798
Show your cards.

618
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,070
What are you doing?
There's no way you can get outta here!

619
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,032
What's with the gun?
What are you doing? I'm your partner!

620
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,951
Stop!

621
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:15,684
Mr. Kazuya… you've got blood on…

622
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,980
It had to be done.

623
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,817
This is the game.

624
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,168
Hey! Good job, man!

625
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,212
Just what you'd expect from a true yakuza.

626
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,174
Listen up, everyone!

627
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:52,429
The people who were turned into zombies
have information about the other zombies.

628
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,515
It's time to get that information
from the other groups.

629
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,225
How do we do that?

630
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,649
You threaten them with Shotgun cards.

631
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,233
That'll make 'em talk!

632
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:12,157
I think I like you, bro.
When all this is done, come work with me.

633
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,985
No! No!

634
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,113
The other zombies, where are they?

635
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:54,074
Tell me and we'll help you
get vaccine priority.

636
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:58,286
Okay, I'll tell you! I'll tell you
where to find the other zombies.

637
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,295
If they find out we're zombies,
we're dead.

638
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,381
We need to get outta here.

639
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,091
Listen to me.

640
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,052
It's better if we track them down
and turn them into zombies.

641
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,055
Anyone will do now. Just do it!

642
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,642
-Come on. Let's go.
-Okay.

643
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,316
Show your cards.

644
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,460
Things are getting out of hand.

645
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,336
Yep, they really are.

646
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,464
Don't you even care?

647
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:55,302
All I care about is that
the trust barricade is safe. Don't you?

648
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,973
Yeah, but because of this,
the other zombies will come after us.

649
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,732
And finally,
this game is about to become interesting.
