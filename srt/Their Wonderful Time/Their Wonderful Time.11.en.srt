00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:57,036
You are awake?

30
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,574
Let's get up and have some breakfast.

31
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,756
Ms. Qi has got everything ready.

32
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:13,556
Are you

33
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:16,636
hiding something from me?

34
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:21,715
What do you want to know?

35
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:25,636
For example,

36
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:28,595
who Shen Xiangyu is

37
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:30,356
and

38
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:32,435
your engagement with her.

39
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:35,956
Are you jealous?

40
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,076
Yes, I am.

41
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:41,755
She knows so much about your childhood,

42
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,636
but I know nothing at all.

43
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,614
If you wish to know that,

44
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:48,715
I can tell you.

45
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:51,875
I want to draft the Boyfriend Rules.

46
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:53,414
Well.

47
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:54,815
Anything you say.

48
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:57,174
But for now, we should
get up and eat breakfast.

49
00:02:57,175 --> 00:02:58,315
Otherwise,

50
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:00,155
the food will get cold.

51
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:02,516
I haven't finished yet.

52
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,294
Boyfriend Rule No.1,

53
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:08,055
do not hide anything from me.

54
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:09,236
All right.

55
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:13,956
Tell me a bedtime story every night.

56
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,556
All right.

57
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:16,956
Also,

58
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:19,755
reply to my message on time
when you are on the phone.

59
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:20,495
All right.

60
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:22,236
Anything you want.

61
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:46,636
Password?

62
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:50,155
Should I try my birthday?

63
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:53,595
It can't be.

64
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,915
Well, I'm wrong.

65
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:59,159
Maybe it's his birthday.

66
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,480
(Enter password)

67
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,116
Not his, too?

68
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:07,195
The moment he picked up his phone,

69
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,595
Healing Hands immediately went offline.

70
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:12,875
Could this be just a coincidence?

71
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:15,236
But my instinct tells me

72
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:17,715
it's not that simple.

73
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:20,215
"Healing Hands"

74
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:23,076
definitely has something
to do with a doctor.

75
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:26,814
What are you doing?

76
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:29,555
I'm looking in the mirror.

77
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:31,695
What are you hiding?

78
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:32,695
Nothing.

79
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:33,775
Let me see.

80
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:34,455
Don't.

81
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:34,814
Show me.

82
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:36,436
- What are you doing?
- Give it to me.

83
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,294
What do you mean, Healing Hands?

84
00:04:58,295 --> 00:04:59,636
I don't know.

85
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,155
This is strange.

86
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:06,734
Are you hungry?

87
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:08,516
Let me fix something for you.

88
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:09,715
Hold on.

89
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:43,276
Here.

90
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:45,836
- This is yours.
- Thank you.

91
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:51,575
I ran through the whole game last night.

92
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:53,775
To make sure everything goes smoothly
in the alpha testing,

93
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:56,115
I'm meeting Xiong and the rest later.

94
00:05:57,576 --> 00:05:59,996
I'm going to meet Shen Xiangyu today.

95
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:05,155
Didn't you just meet her yesterday?

96
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:11,414
She just got back here from abroad.

97
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:14,095
Besides, our engagement
hasn't been canceled.

98
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:16,956
It's necessary
to have a meal alone with her.

99
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:18,996
I don't think that's necessary.

100
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:24,115
I smell jealousy.

101
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:29,595
I'm not jealous at all.

102
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,215
Meet her if you want.

103
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:32,675
You don't have to tell me.

104
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,895
Boyfriend Rule No. 1,

105
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,775
do not hide anything from you.

106
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:41,316
That's why I'm telling you.

107
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,675
Noted.

108
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:48,695
In fact, my dad will be discharged
from the hospital today,

109
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:51,335
so I asked Xiangyu to go with me

110
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:52,254
to tell my dad

111
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:54,355
that I don't agree with the engagement.

112
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:57,876
Well,

113
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:01,636
do you think your dad
will approve of us?

114
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,155
I will convince him until he does so.

115
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,575
Explain yourself.

116
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:12,675
What is this?

117
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:15,155
Healing Hands.

118
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,854
Didn't you say this is not you?

119
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,095
I was worried

120
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:21,636
you didn't want me
to watch your live stream,

121
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:23,836
so I didn't dare tell you this.

122
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:26,555
But I want to support your work.

123
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,054
Tell me,

124
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:29,595
how many times did you give rewards?

125
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:37,555
How many times exactly?

126
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:45,555
How generous of you.

127
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,196
I see

128
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:56,636
that you followed me a long time ago.

129
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,035
Not that long, really.

130
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:01,715
Speaking of which, I must thank you.

131
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:04,915
That was the worst time in my life.

132
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:07,254
Dr. Zhang,

133
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:09,135
the girl's condition has deteriorated.

134
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:10,775
The attending physician asks you

135
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:12,675
to issue a critical illness notice
to her family.

136
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,374
(Xi was the first patient)

137
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,196
(I treated after returning from abroad.)

138
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:19,215
(She holds a special place)

139
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:21,196
(in my career.)

140
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:26,854
I know my condition has worsened.

141
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:28,095
Yunfei,

142
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:30,076
I won't blame you.

143
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:32,254
(The tougher she was,)

144
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,675
(the more guilty I felt.)

145
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:36,774
I discovered

146
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:39,014
a cute sister today.

147
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:42,155
Her live stream is so interesting.

148
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,854
Let's wipe our tears away

149
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:45,095
and keep striving.

150
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:46,116
Go!

151
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:48,894
After Xi's passing,

152
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,596
I often couldn't sleep.

153
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:53,435
Sometimes, I dreamed of her.

154
00:08:57,976 --> 00:08:59,774
When I couldn't fall asleep,

155
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:01,374
I used to watch your live stream.

156
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,756
You gave me a lot of encouragement.

157
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:06,596
When I watched your live stream,
I thought to myself,

158
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:09,116
"This girl has a lovely smile.

159
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:11,134
She's like a sunflower

160
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,876
full of life and energy."

161
00:09:14,176 --> 00:09:15,596
I wondered

162
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:17,734
if a ray of sunlight

163
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:19,716
could shine on you forever

164
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:22,195
and give you energy

165
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:23,955
when you need rest.

166
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:26,774
So

167
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,795
your dream has come true now.

168
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:31,955
Meeting you

169
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:34,155
is my luck.

170
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:38,935
Hold on.

171
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:41,075
So,

172
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:44,555
did you pretend not to know me

173
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:47,055
when Lingling was hospitalized?

174
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:49,760
It's not that. You were wearing
a wedding dress that day.

175
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,455
You looked very different from how
you usually look during live streams.

176
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:55,155
I didn't recognize you at that moment.

177
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:57,335
But when I thought about it later,

178
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:59,315
I realized it was you.

179
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:03,095
In that case,

180
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:05,356
you had a plan.

181
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:10,014
I think you are hungry.
I will go and fix something for you.

182
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:11,415
Zhang Yunfei, you are deflecting.

183
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,095
Did you hide something from me?

184
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:14,295
No. You must be hungry.

185
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:17,200
- I will go and prepare breakfast for you.
- No? Then why are you avoiding me?

186
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,756
I'm not done yet.

187
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:21,455
When do you want to meet me so urgently?

188
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:23,134
Didn't we just meet yesterday?

189
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:24,134
Don't tell me

190
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:26,276
you are trying
to cultivate a relationship with me.

191
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:28,494
Tell me. How's it going on
between you and her?

192
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,716
Is there any new progress?

193
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:32,215
Stop gossiping.

194
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,555
Let's be serious.

195
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:37,276
Are you always this cold with Lan Yao?

196
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:40,815
You need to show
your soft and cute side.

197
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:42,596
Don't be so aloof.

198
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,695
I remember

199
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:47,396
you used to be the naughtiest boy
among us.

200
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,774
Why have you become

201
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:50,476
so boring now?

202
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:54,276
Boring?

203
00:10:57,816 --> 00:10:59,116
Xiangyu,

204
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,236
do you regret liking Qiao

205
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:04,276
after going through so much?

206
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:08,116
To be honest,

207
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,195
I wanted to say I regretted it,

208
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:13,516
but I have been telling myself

209
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:15,636
that I never do.

210
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:20,675
So

211
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,155
even though I'm not prepared,

212
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:24,534
I have no doubts

213
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:26,276
about running toward this path.

214
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:31,756
And I believe I'm already on it.

215
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:34,116
Good that you understand.

216
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,614
The priority now

217
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:39,716
is to show my attitude to my dad.

218
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:43,996
I don't want to hide my intention
to call off this engagement.

219
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:45,415
Since I have chosen her,

220
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,596
I need to make her feel secure.

221
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:49,476
But

222
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:51,435
I need your help.

223
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,276
What do you want me to do?

224
00:11:58,056 --> 00:11:59,675
My dad will be discharged
this afternoon.

225
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:01,195
I want you to come with me.

226
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:02,636
Sure.

227
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,516
Mr. Xiao.

228
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:10,996
Xiangyu.

229
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,815
When are you back here?

230
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,374
Why didn't you come and visit me before?

231
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,575
Come on and have a seat.

232
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:18,215
So here I am.

233
00:12:18,216 --> 00:12:19,815
I knew you were
getting discharged today,

234
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:21,596
so I wanted to give you a surprise.

235
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:23,835
It's good that you came.

236
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:24,534
Xiangyu,

237
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,175
you are also a sweet and sensible girl

238
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:27,315
since little.

239
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:30,680
I really appreciate that you came,
unlike someone.

240
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:33,215
How long has it been
since you brat came to see me?

241
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:34,695
You didn't even call.

242
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:36,955
Qiao has been with you.

243
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:40,155
That's different.

244
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:42,935
You have a great complexion.

245
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,455
Lin Qiao must be taking
great care of you.

246
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:47,756
He's patient and considerate.

247
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,215
Thanks to his care,

248
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:50,915
you have recovered so quickly.

249
00:12:51,176 --> 00:12:52,955
This is what I should do.

250
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:58,236
The three of you

251
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,374
have been close since childhood,

252
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,534
but now that you have all grown up,

253
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:04,014
it's better to keep

254
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:05,555
an appropriate distance.

255
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:06,774
Xiangyu,

256
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:09,254
your dad called me a while ago.

257
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,236
He asked me about your engagement
with Xiao Ran.

258
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,195
Why do you plan to get engaged?

259
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:16,894
I'm too young

260
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,335
to decide this.

261
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:21,175
I will listen to you on this.

262
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,075
Very well.

263
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:24,134
Your dad and I have discussed it.

264
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:26,815
Let's have the engagement banquet here.

265
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:29,215
We will invite all relatives and friends
from both families

266
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,996
to celebrate.

267
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:33,055
Men

268
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:35,134
should start a family

269
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:36,716
before they build a career.

270
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:40,315
Once your engagement with Xiangyu
is decided,

271
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:44,134
I can hand over the Shanhai Group to you

272
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:46,116
without worries.

273
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:48,254
Qiao and I

274
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:50,276
have run the company quite well now.

275
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,516
It has nothing to do with my marriage.

276
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:56,975
Childish.

277
00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:58,675
It's a different case.

278
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,534
You will understand

279
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,756
once you get married.

280
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:05,955
Dad,

281
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:08,435
let me be honest with you.

282
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,835
I won't agree with this marriage.

283
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,155
Besides,

284
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:14,155
I have someone I like.

285
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,415
I will decide

286
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,795
my own marriage.

287
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:18,996
What nonsense are you talking about?

288
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:22,155
I don't care who the woman is,

289
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:23,955
break up with her.

290
00:14:25,176 --> 00:14:27,335
I didn't care
how willful you were before.

291
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:28,215
How can you

292
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:30,014
decide this on your own?

293
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:31,116
Besides,

294
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:33,835
Mr. Shen and I have discussed it.

295
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:36,215
Mr. Xiao,

296
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:38,716
you can't force things
when it comes to relationships.

297
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:42,155
Since Xiao Ran has someone he likes,

298
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:44,516
please don't force him.

299
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:52,116
Dad,

300
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:55,254
I know the Shen Family
and we have a long-standing relationship.

301
00:14:55,255 --> 00:14:57,295
It's not ideal
to break off the engagement now.

302
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,435
But...

303
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:08,116
Qiao and Xiangyu

304
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:10,155
have always made a great pair.

305
00:15:10,615 --> 00:15:11,935
Why not let them be together

306
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:13,494
and get engaged?

307
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,035
Best of both worlds.

308
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:24,435
Did you hear yourself?

309
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,315
Dad,

310
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:28,795
calm down.

311
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:32,435
You are such a pain.

312
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,415
Did Xiao Ran and you

313
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,675
plan this?

314
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:48,835
Yes.

315
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,654
Dad just got out of the hospital.

316
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:54,035
You both only annoyed him for doing this.

317
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:55,415
Anyway,

318
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,315
he has to accept this sooner or later.

319
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:58,935
Why not just tell him?

320
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:00,435
But it shouldn't be so direct.

321
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:02,155
What should we do then?

322
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:04,215
At least we tried.

323
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:07,055
In the worst-case scenario, we fall out.

324
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:09,276
It's better than being hesitant

325
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:11,636
and not brave enough
to admit your true feelings.

326
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:15,155
Right.

327
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:17,835
I tend to overthink things,

328
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:19,675
but I have to.

329
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,734
In fact,

330
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,734
no one is forcing you to.

331
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,396
You are the one
forcing yourself into this.

332
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:32,734
Xiao Ran is braver than you.

333
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:34,854
At least when it comes to relationships,

334
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:37,795
he won't hide his real thoughts.

335
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:40,555
I will drive you home.

336
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,854
What kind of fun do girls like?

337
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,175
For example,

338
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:55,035
you could arrange a surprise date.

339
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:57,236
Take her to her favorite place,

340
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,734
or create a romantic ambiance,

341
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:02,195
and confess your feelings to her.

342
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,756
Couples need romantic vibes.

343
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,014
Mr. Wu, pull over in front.

344
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:11,494
I'm going to buy something.

345
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:12,676
All right, Mr. Xiao.

346
00:17:29,936 --> 00:17:30,996
What's wrong?

347
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:32,595
Nothing.

348
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:33,676
Continue with your work.

349
00:17:35,136 --> 00:17:37,334
Xiong and the rest found
that Xing Tian's code

350
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:38,734
wasn't running smoothly

351
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:40,175
while checking for bugs.

352
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:43,395
(How should I tell her about the date?)

353
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:46,476
We need to find another way.

354
00:17:47,575 --> 00:17:49,555
What did you say?

355
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,276
I was talking about fixing the game.

356
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:01,716
Well,

357
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:06,676
what's your plan for tomorrow?

358
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:08,956
Work, of course.

359
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:12,795
Why don't we

360
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:15,996
go out on a date?

361
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:18,676
A date?

362
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:24,516
Even though we live together,

363
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:28,355
we haven't had a proper date yet,

364
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:30,895
like other couples

365
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:33,236
who hold hands while shopping,

366
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:35,676
watch movies, or have a meal together.

367
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:39,014
If so,

368
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:41,395
where are you taking me to?

369
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:44,395
It's a secret.

370
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:45,734
Go ahead with your work.

371
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:47,516
I won't disturb you.

372
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:52,615
I didn't know

373
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:56,236
he could be quite romantic.

374
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:25,395
What's that?

375
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:29,875
It's a gift.

376
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:33,916
Is it for me?

377
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,436
Open it.

378
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,215
I thought it would suit you,

379
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:49,676
so I bought it.

380
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:51,875
Let me put it on for you?

381
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:53,156
Sure.

382
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:15,795
How many surprises have you prepared?

383
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:19,196
You will find out tomorrow.

384
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,756
Petty.

385
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,395
Are you sure you want to wear this?

386
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:03,635
Does this look bad?

387
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:04,975
You look great.

388
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:07,716
It's just that you might
get tired later.

389
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:09,975
It's fine.

390
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:11,494
After all, this is our first date.

391
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:13,635
I want to dress properly.

392
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:15,315
Let's go.

393
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:42,555
Since we're out on a date,

394
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:44,355
get off your phone.

395
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:46,415
Aside from the view,

396
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,956
what you can see

397
00:21:48,456 --> 00:21:49,595
is me.

398
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:06,695
Don't rest.

399
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:08,555
We are reaching the finish line.

400
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,875
I can't run anymore.

401
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:12,615
Just hang in there.

402
00:22:12,616 --> 00:22:15,075
Jogging is the most effective exercise
for burning body fat.

403
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:18,534
You are too fast.
I can't catch up with you.

404
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:19,655
It's not that I'm fast,

405
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:21,595
it's that your stamina is too weak.

406
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:23,916
He's blunt.

407
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,035
You are too slow.
I will wait for you at the finish line.

408
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,595
What an inconsiderate guy.

409
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:30,276
So typical.

410
00:22:45,535 --> 00:22:46,555
Come in.

411
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,455
Why are you here?

412
00:22:51,456 --> 00:22:53,756
I came to celebrate
the Qixi Festival with you.

413
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,415
Xiangyu,

414
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,375
I have got loads of work at hand.

415
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,655
I have to work long hours.

416
00:22:59,656 --> 00:23:01,455
- I can't spend time with you.
- I know.

417
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:03,215
Just continue with your work.

418
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,555
I will stay here with you.

419
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:35,996
The sunshine is pleasant.

420
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,415
Do you smell

421
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,534
a special scent

422
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:41,996
in the air?

423
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:46,236
What's that?

424
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:48,476
It's sweet.

425
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:55,156
If I had known we were coming outdoors,

426
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:57,436
I wouldn't have worn heels.

427
00:23:58,176 --> 00:23:59,655
That's why I told you

428
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:00,956
you might get tired.

429
00:24:15,176 --> 00:24:17,115
I prepared everything for you.

430
00:24:23,136 --> 00:24:25,756
Why didn't you tell me before we left?

431
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:29,756
It's the first time seeing
you dressed like this.

432
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:31,716
I wanted to look longer.

433
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,695
If you don't like heels,

434
00:24:36,696 --> 00:24:38,355
you don't have to force yourself.

435
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,516
Well,

436
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:40,574
I thought

437
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:43,094
you were taking me to a formal occasion,

438
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:45,875
so I cleaned up nicely.

439
00:24:48,335 --> 00:24:50,415
You should wear shoes
you are comfortable in.

440
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,615
Instead of wearing shoes
that don't suit you,

441
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,156
I prefer you to be your real self.

442
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:02,555
I can wear it myself.

443
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:05,756
No need to worry about others' opinions.

444
00:25:06,575 --> 00:25:07,875
To me,

445
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:10,075
you are the prettiest.

446
00:25:14,936 --> 00:25:17,676
This fits quite well.

447
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:21,635
Like you said just now,

448
00:25:21,976 --> 00:25:25,455
will you still think I'm pretty

449
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:27,035
when I grow old and have wrinkles?

450
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:36,075
You are also pretty.

451
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:41,734
Since you have performed so well,

452
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:43,476
I will give you one more opportunity.

453
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:46,115
What opportunity?

454
00:25:48,936 --> 00:25:51,075
An opportunity to get me.

455
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:54,516
What rewards do I have if I get you?

456
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:56,835
We will see about that later.

457
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,355
Got you.

458
00:26:12,815 --> 00:26:13,814
Look.

459
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:15,276
Did you see that?

460
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:17,075
This is the place.

461
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:18,254
Mr. Xiao was helping

462
00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:20,734
Lingling change her shoes.

463
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:23,294
It looks like
there might be a proposal today.

464
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:25,615
I'm kind of looking forward to it.

465
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:27,695
Yiyi, I don't think this is a good idea.

466
00:26:27,696 --> 00:26:28,734
What if

467
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:31,276
we disrupt his plan?

468
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:34,276
Why are you here?

469
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:36,094
What are you doing here?

470
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,635
I'm jogging.

471
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,516
Alone?

472
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:41,676
My student is behind.

473
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:47,196
Why didn't you wait for her?

474
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:48,494
Kiddo,

475
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:49,574
you don't understand.

476
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:52,115
This is how a coach interacts
with his students.

477
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:55,075
Why are you all here?

478
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:57,315
Isn't this Mr. Xiao's car?

479
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:58,975
Let me tell you this.

480
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:02,956
Today, Xiao Ran is going to
propose to Lingling.

481
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:04,534
Where are they?

482
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:05,595
I want to see it.

483
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:07,895
Come on, think about it.

484
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:09,054
How is he going to propose

485
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:10,635
if we all show up suddenly?

486
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:14,734
So we will hide from a distance

487
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:15,975
and capture

488
00:27:15,976 --> 00:27:17,756
some of their beautiful moments.

489
00:27:18,495 --> 00:27:19,375
Let's go.

490
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:19,975
Come on.

491
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:20,875
Come.

492
00:27:24,535 --> 00:27:26,734
Stop calling me kiddo.

493
00:27:26,735 --> 00:27:28,635
I'm more mature than you all.

494
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:38,276
Did you prepare all of this?

495
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:40,455
Yes, I set it up in advance.

496
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:42,115
Do you like it?

497
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:44,436
How long did it take you to prepare?

498
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:46,916
Do I need a long time to please you?

499
00:27:47,896 --> 00:27:50,996
Are you going to cook later?

500
00:27:52,176 --> 00:27:55,276
I will let you experience
the fun of a picnic.

501
00:27:55,616 --> 00:27:57,276
Can you even cook?

502
00:27:57,656 --> 00:27:58,975
Don't worry.

503
00:27:58,976 --> 00:28:01,875
I have looked up recipes online.

504
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:03,655
Chef Xiao,

505
00:28:03,656 --> 00:28:05,555
what are we having today?

506
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:07,175
Grilled meat.

507
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:09,455
Chop-chop. I'm so hungry.

508
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:10,315
All right.

509
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:19,395
