48
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:56,788
because of the game.

00:02:56,847 --> 00:02:59,007

00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:00,667
ate octopus,

51
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,547
went on dates,

52
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:04,788
and worked on the game together.

53
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:09,007
The game started

54
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:10,366

00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:11,827

I'm planning

72
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:02,068
to transfer all my shares
in the Shanhai Group to you. What do you mean?

73
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:03,966
I think

74
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,788
you can do better as the CEO.

75
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:09,987
Wait.

76
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:13,068
You have never made reckless decisions.

00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:15,267
What has happened?

78
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:17,607
I'm thinking about

80
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:22,468
after the game project.

81
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:25,047
Her condition is weak now.

82
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,028
I wish to spend more time with her.

83
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:27,987
But...

84
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:29,006
But you don't have to

85
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:31,307
give me all the shares.

86
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:33,427
Did you run into trouble?

87
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:34,647
If you do,

88
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:35,607
tell me.

89
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,766
We can resolve it together.

90
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:37,708
Qiao,

91
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:40,507
you should think about Xiangyu.

92
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:45,028
What's that supposed to mean?

93
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:47,847
I know

94
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:50,627
you don't care about
the identity and status in the company.

95
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:51,487
However,

96
00:04:51,488 --> 00:04:53,927
Mr. Shen will surely have concerns

97
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:55,627
since he's the head of the Shen Group.

98
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:56,847
Also,

99
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:58,927
you should back Xiangyu up

100
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:01,427
so that she can deal
with the Shen Group.

101
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:03,727
Is that the reason why

102
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:05,627
you transfer your shares to me?

103
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:07,588
Not just that,

104
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,566
there's also something

105
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,107
I have to do.

106
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,908
I have to look after Lingling.

107
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:18,468
Ran,

108
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:20,908
I know you are stressed out lately.

109
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,948
Don't endure it alone.

110
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,326
You have me.

111
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:26,627
Well, Qiao.

112
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:29,366
Keep this document well.

113
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:30,487
Don't forget to sign it.

114
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:31,047
But...

115
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:32,588
You will need it.

116
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:38,627
(What's going on?)

117
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:40,566
Old man,

118
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,107
when are you letting me out?

119
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,927
Just stay there

120
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,388
until everything is done.

121
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:47,468
You have gone too far this time.

122
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:49,867
I'm doing this for your own good.

123
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:55,107
I really can't stand this old man.

124
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:57,588
By the way,

125
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,828
what's he up to?

126
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:03,028
No.

127
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:05,487
Don't. Calm down.

128
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:07,287
The knife is sharp.

129
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:08,427
Shut up.

130
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,427
Move aside.

131
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:12,388
Mr. Shen said

132
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:13,747
you can't leave this room.

133
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:17,640
- Believe it or not, I will kill myself here.
- Don't be impulsive.

134
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:21,867
Move.

135
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:33,566
Once I get out of here,
you can't chase after me.

136
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:34,507
Did you hear me?

137
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:35,708
- All right.
- All right.

138
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:36,948
Turn around.

139
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:17,388
(Your necklace is fixed.)

140
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:20,187
(I'm going to)

141
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:22,468
(enter the game.)

142
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:26,107
(I don't know what will happen)

143
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,268
(and what dangers await,)

144
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:32,107
(but I will save you at all costs.)

145
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:33,908
(If...)

146
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:37,107
(If anything goes wrong,)

147
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:39,307
(I hope you can carry on well)

148
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,468
(without me.)

149
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:43,886
(But I guess)

150
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:45,747
(you will probably forget me by then.)

151
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,427
(It's good, though.)

152
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,307
(At least)

153
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:54,388
(you can start a new life,)

154
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,987
(as if)

155
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:00,867
(you never met me.)

156
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,547
Xiao Ran?

157
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:58,588
Qiao?

158
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:06,708
Shouldn't you explain to me

159
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,708
why you want to transfer
the shares to me?

160
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:10,867
Qiao,

161
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:12,527
I will explain that

162
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:14,107
to you later.

163
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:15,927
When did you learn

164
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:17,987
to bear everything alone

165
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:20,747
and think you can resolve
all the problems?

166
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:22,668
Do you think

167
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:25,047
beating the final boss alone

168
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:26,308
is easy?

169
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:29,486
How did you know that?

170
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:30,787
Who told you that?

171
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:32,668
Sorry.

172
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:35,027
It was me.

173
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:35,828
You...

174
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:40,428
I think I must tell him.

175
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:47,027
This is too risky.

176
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:49,267
I can't let you all
take the risk with me.

177
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:51,588
But the chance of winning is higher

178
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:53,627
if we go together.

179
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:58,367
Your combat strength is still lacking

180
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:00,308
if no one replenishes
your health points, right?

181
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,068
Nan Gongyu,

182
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:07,668
how many people did you tell?

183
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,287
They are all here.

184
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,668
No one else.

185
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:13,167
Xiao Ran,

186
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:14,787
how's Lingling now?

187
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:17,446
She took the calming medicine

188
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:18,548
and is sleeping now.

189
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:20,308
Sorry,

190
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,188
I failed to look after her.

191
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:24,647
I don't need your apology now.

192
00:10:24,648 --> 00:10:27,247
I hope you can focus
on solving this problem

193
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:29,308
and give it your all.

194
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:30,367
After all,

195
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:33,468
Lingling and I are going on a trip.

196
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:34,787
I will.

197
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:38,007
Why are you all

198
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:39,468
gathering here?

199
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:40,966
We're entering the game

200
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,548
to help Xian Ran fix it.

201
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,068
What's going on now?

202
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:48,086
It's urgent.

203
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:50,188
I will explain it to you after this.

204
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:52,367
Xiao Ran,

205
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:53,507
stop hesitating.

206
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,828
Decide now.

207
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:00,107
It's my fault.

208
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:02,107
I was wrong

209
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:04,348
from the beginning

210
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,387
when I decided to face it alone.

211
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,147
I always think I can do anything,

212
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:10,747
so

213
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:13,668
I hate to let you see my weak side.

214
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,428
However, I forgot

215
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:19,468
that you are my friends

216
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:21,147
and partners.

217
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:23,548
Friends

218
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:25,867
don't stand by when you need help.

219
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,507
Thank you so much.

220
00:11:32,248 --> 00:11:34,228
I have improved a lot

221
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:36,147
while practicing boxing with you.

222
00:11:37,648 --> 00:11:38,686
I really want to meet

223
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:40,267
this powerful character.

224
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:41,927
Now, it feels

225
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:43,167
like a real team.

226
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:44,027
Come on.

227
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,228
For Lanyao.

228
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:48,068
For my buddy.

229
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,428
For Yiyi's best friend.

230
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:58,987
We must win.

231
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:01,627
- We must win.
- We must win.

232
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:09,987
Why did you come here?

233
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,867
My old man

234
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,068
insisted on setting me up with Xiao Ran.

235
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:17,206
Xiao Ran must've decided
to transfer the shares

236
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:19,127
because of him.

237
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:20,206
He even locked me up

238
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,548
in a hotel room.

239
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,188
Why didn't you tell me about this?

240
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:25,047
I don't want you to worry.

241
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:26,206
I can handle

242
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:27,907
my old man well.

243
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:33,846
Once everything is over,

244
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:36,007
let's meet Mr. Shen.

245
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:37,308
I'm going to tell him

246
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:38,708
I will only marry you.

247
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:40,468
Do you mean it?

248
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:42,987
You can't take back your word.

249
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:44,267
I won't.

250
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:50,308
Are you afraid?

251
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,068
Can you really do this?

252
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:53,468
I'm not afraid.

253
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,548
Their combat strength is lacking
without me.

254
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:59,726
You seem frail, though.

255
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:01,867
Are you really that strong in the game?

256
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:04,387
Are you sure you can keep yourself safe?

257
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,747
What if

258
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:07,507
something goes wrong?

259
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,507
You are more nervous than me.

260
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:13,367
You must win.

261
00:13:13,368 --> 00:13:14,708
Don't lose.

262
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,107
Don't worry.

263
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:17,446
I promise you

264
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:18,867
I will come back.

265
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:21,747
Also,

266
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:24,348
when I come back,

267
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:25,987
I will propose to you.

268
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:31,387
Well,

269
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:32,948
will you say yes?

270
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:36,708
You can give it a try

271
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:38,548
when you are back.

272
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,588
Why are they

273
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,348
being so sentimental over a game?

274
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,206
It's just a game.

275
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:57,867
What's wrong
with those lovey-dovey couples?

276
00:13:58,368 --> 00:13:59,966
They should act like a real man.

277
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:02,428
Morale is what we need now,

278
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:05,188
not emotional nonsense.

279
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:19,708
Why are you here?

280
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:23,247
Mr. Lin asked me to come over.

281
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:25,068
He said you want to tell me something.

282
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:26,708
Me?

283
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:28,907
No.

284
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,548
No?

285
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:33,228
Are you sure?

286
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:38,606
If so, I will ask Mr. Lin.
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

287
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:39,548
Wait.

288
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:44,228
Actually,

289
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:49,228
there's a small thing I want to ask you.

290
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:51,387
What's it?

291
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:54,828
Do you

292
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:00,787
like me?

293
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,627
You just figured this out?

294
00:15:06,768 --> 00:15:08,468
I knew it all along.

295
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:10,948
Then why didn't you say anything?

296
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:13,308
I'm the coach.

297
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,507
Well,

298
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,828
your membership

299
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,428
has almost expired.

300
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:22,548
Do you want to renew it?

301
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:25,468
Well,

302
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,548
I plan to get
a lifetime membership plan.

303
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,228
Sure.

304
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:34,806
Mr. Xiao,

305
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:36,407
we are all set.

306
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:38,027
You can enter the game at any time.

307
00:15:38,248 --> 00:15:38,767
We will

308
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:40,767
monitor the game here.

309
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:42,086
Once Song Chongming is defeated,

310
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:44,387
we will adjust the statistics
right away.

311
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:46,068
All right.

312
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:48,326
Are you guys ready?

313
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:49,708
Yes.

314
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:50,828
Xiong,

315
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:52,828
we're entering now.

316
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:53,867
Okay.

317
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,440
(Metaverse of Love)

318
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:59,588
Battle begins.

319
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:32,907
Drat!

320
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,867
Do you know how to summon him?

321
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:36,708
We failed to summon him last time.

322
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:38,987
Just how powerful is the character?

323
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:40,548
Why are you so nervous?

324
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:41,907
I have tried it.

325
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,287
He will show up

326
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:44,507
without summoning.

327
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:47,527
You fled in shame last time.

328
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,228
How dare you come back today?

329
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,468
And you brought minions with you.

330
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:56,107
Still, you are no match for me.

331
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:57,907
You won't know.

332
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:00,348
You don't stand a chance

333
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,068
when fighting the strongest.

334
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:05,547
Since you have the guts
to offend the deity,

335
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:07,286
I will make you pay

336
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:09,507
a thousand times.

337
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:12,668
Feel the embrace of the deity.

338
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,468
Where is he taking us to?

339
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,246
I feel weightless.

340
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,547
Be careful.

341
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:23,307
Let him try.

342
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,787
Did you feel the power of the deity?

343
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:44,087
I'm the deity.

344
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,347
I'm formidable.

345
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:47,686
How did he suddenly become so powerful?

346
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:48,807
Is anyone helping him?

347
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:50,006
Maybe we should exit the game

348
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:51,668
and find other solutions.

349
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:53,668
We might not win
if we fight him head-on.

350
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,360
(Exit)

351
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:00,628
Looks like we can't leave.

352
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:13,486
Song Chongming

353
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,787
has sealed off the passage
to exit the game world.

354
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:17,547
They can't come out,

355
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:18,966
and no one can go in either.

356
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,167
What should we do now?

357
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:21,766
Can we wake them up?

358
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,628
No.

359
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:23,927
If you do,

360
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:25,006
their brainwaves

361
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,148
will be sealed
inside the game world forever.

362
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:29,006
There's nothing we can do?

363
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,868
Then what now?

364
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,668
They are on their own now.

365
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:00,027
You're too weak.

366
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:02,027
I'm so disappointed in you.

367
00:19:03,368 --> 00:19:04,446
In five minutes,

368
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,267
the game will be completely sealed off.

369
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:32,046
We are not

370
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,628
on the same level.

371
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:34,948
What should we do now?

372
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:37,787
If you can skip Song Chongming's battle,

373
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:40,787
there's a way you could give it a try.

374
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:42,780
I got an idea. I will be right back.

375
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:52,407
(According to the game's initial setting,)

376
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,880
(after the player completes
all the levels,)

377
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,667
(they will be given
the Spiritual Tortoise Pearl)

378
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,686
(to start the next chapter.)

379
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:01,327
(It possesses the great power
to purify and balance the world.)

380
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:02,486
(But the game world)

381
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:04,766
(is now chaotic.)

382
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:07,868
(I'm not sure if it will work.)

383
00:20:10,047 --> 00:20:11,547
With the will of the Universe,

384
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:13,367
gather the spirits
from Heaven and Earth,

385
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:14,868
I summon the power
of Spiritual Tortoise.

386
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:38,228
(How dare you challenge
the Deity of War.)

387
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,148
(How foolish.)

388
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:56,520
The will of the Universe,
the power of Spiritual Tortoise.

389
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:16,246
Currently, Song Chongming
has been defeated,

390
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:17,887
and the game is fixed.

391
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:19,908
The game world is back to normal.

392
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:22,468
The game world is back to normal.

393
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:32,006
We win!

394
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,347
Finally, we win!

395
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,628
We win! Finally, we win!

396
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,320
(Metaverse of Love)

397
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,228
The game is fixed.

398
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,148
Are you going to keep your promise now?

399
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:02,607
I think

400
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:04,428
you can propose to me now.

401
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:11,428
Coach,

402
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:13,246
does what you said

403
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:14,827
still count?

404
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:20,868
Well,

405
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:24,908
when will you renew the plan?

406
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,710
♪I see you now, I've taken you lightly,
I'm now lost in you♪

407

What has happened?

413
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,628
Do you want to log into the game
and check it out?

414
00:23:07,368 --> 00:23:08,587
Is the game

415
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:10,547
fixed?

416
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:12,547

My dear.

422
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,787
My dear,

423
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:26,966
I'm back.

424
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:27,868
My dear.

425
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:29,827
My dear.

426
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:32,388
Is anyone home?

427
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,948
It seems

428
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:46,987
Song Lingling was lying to me.

429
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:50,747
If my wife isn't here,

430
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,827
why did they send me back?

431
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:01,286
What are you back

432
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:02,948
so late?

433
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:04,507
My dear.

434
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,807
You don't know

435
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:09,027
how hard it was for me
to come back to you.

436
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,966
I finally understand why they say

437
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,428
missing someone feels like ages.

438
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:16,628
I have missed you so much.

439
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:20,468
You said you wanted to go hunting
a few days ago.

440
00:24:20,487 --> 00:24:21,966
I was waiting for you,

441
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,388
but you didn't come back.

442
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:24,286
Tell me.

443
00:24:24,287 --> 00:24:25,868
Why are you back so late?

444
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:27,587
I was so anxious.

445
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:29,987
I haven't heard your voice for so long.

446
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:33,148
It feels so familiar.

447
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:36,686
Oh my.

448
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:38,006
You are a general.

449
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:39,747
Why are you acting like a kid?

450
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:41,547
Acting like a kid in front of you

451
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:42,668
isn't embarrassing.

452
00:24:42,727 --> 00:24:43,868
Not at all.

453
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:46,087
My dear,

454
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:47,108
please sit.

455
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:49,148
Don't affect the child.

456
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:50,067
Come.

457
00:24:53,328 --> 00:24:54,628
It seems

458
00:24:54,648 --> 00:24:55,726
we shouldn't disturb

459
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,507
their reunion.

460
00:24:58,487 --> 00:24:59,887
To think that General Xing Tian

461
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:01,787
is such a lovely man

462
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:04,668
behind his fierce face.

463
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:06,267
He even cries

464
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:08,507
when he sees his wife.

465
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:11,787
Maybe

466
00:25:12,568 --> 00:25:13,827
he's just like me.

467
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:17,787
When did you cry?

468
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:24,428
My dear,

469
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,246
you know what?

470
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:27,708
A few days ago,

471
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:29,006
I ran into

472
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:31,388
a woman who looked exactly like you.

473
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:32,607
Really?

474
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:35,468
She's Ms. Yiyi.

475
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:36,766
Yiyi?

476
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:41,347
But she loves another man.

477
00:26:06,088 --> 00:26:07,188
I created this game

478
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,027
to keep my brother,

479
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:13,948
but it ended up like this.

480
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:19,267
Someone once said

481
00:26:19,687 --> 00:26:21,286
that before people

482
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:23,127
become family,

483
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:24,787
they must endure trials from Heaven.

484
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:26,228
I believe

485
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:27,747
it's also the same for your brother.

486
00:26:28,168 --> 00:26:29,307
Although

487
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:31,027
he has already left,

488
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:32,686
I believe

489
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:34,887
he's with you

490
00:26:34,888 --> 00:26:35,987
in another way.

491
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:41,307
I will keep my love for him forever.

492
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,347
Maybe

493
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:47,267
in another way.

494
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:53,267
(I designed this necklace)

495
00:26:53,527 --> 00:26:56,067
(to remember him.)

496
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:00,948
(Now,)

497
00:27:03,007 --> 00:27:04,708
(I will return it to him.)

498
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:39,708
(The Metaverse)

499
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:43,267
(is a connection between
reality and the virtual world)

500
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:47,027
(that used)

501
00:27:47,287 --> 00:27:50,027
(to make up for regrets in real life.)

502
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:54,148
(Unexpectedly,)

503
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:56,507
(a careless mistake)

504
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,787
(can lead to an obsession.)

505
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:19,547
(Hospital?)

506
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,507
(Why am I here?)

507
00:28:24,888 --> 00:28:26,108
You are awake?

508
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:29,407
You didn't get hurt too badly
from the electrocution,

509
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,766
but you need enough rest

510
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:32,228
and stay for observation for a few days.

511
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,188
I was electrocuted?

512
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:37,407
Don't get out of bed yet.

513
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:38,948
I will call the doctor to check on you.

514
00:28:57,088 --> 00:28:57,686
Hello?

515
00:28:57,687 --> 00:28:58,747
Boss,

516
00:28:58,888 --> 00:28:59,987
you are awake?

517
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:01,526
You really scared us.

518
00:29:01,527 --> 00:29:03,567
You were electrocuted and passed off.

519
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:04,868
Now...

520
00:29:05,007 --> 00:29:06,966
Don't worry about the game.

521
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:08,607
There were some small issues,

522
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:10,206
but we have already got them fixed.

523
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,286
Also, we have dealt

524
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:12,787
with the Shanhai Group.

525
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,468
What?

526
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:17,948
The game is fixed?

527
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:18,847
Yes.

528
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:20,280
What you need to do now is to rest.

529
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,027
Don't worry.

530
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:22,468
We got this covered.

531
00:29:35,928 --> 00:29:38,027
(What's going on?)

532
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:40,787
(Is everything)

533
00:29:41,287 --> 00:29:42,628
(a dream?)

534
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:44,908
(Is Xiao Ran)

535
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:46,827
(a dream, too?)

536
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,726
(Was I too focused)

537
00:29:50,727 --> 00:29:52,027
(on the game?)

538
00:29:53,848 --> 00:29:56,027
(If none of this is real,)

539
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:57,628
(why did it)

540
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,868
(feel so true to me?)

541
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:02,388
(What is all this)

542
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,587
(hinting at?)

543
00:30:35,527 --> 00:30:36,286
In a week,

544
00:30:36,287 --> 00:30:37,966
Shanhai Group and the creation team,

545
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:38,847
Lan Yao Studio,

546
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,286
will hold a press conference.

547
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:41,206
Mongrel!

548
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:42,507
Come out!

549
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:48,987
You...

550
00:30:50,007 --> 00:30:51,747
Why did you smash my TV?

551
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:56,887
Baby, didn't I ask you to wait for me
at the hospital?

552
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,428
Why did you come back here?

553
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:00,046
Are you all right?

554
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:01,607
Feeling sick now?

555
00:31:01,608 --> 00:31:02,726
I'm good.

556
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:03,686
Don't be nervous.

557
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:05,206
I was worried sick about you.

558
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:07,547
How did you get electrocuted?

559
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:10,807
It was an accident.

560
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:11,908
I'm all right now.

561
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:13,428
Yiyi,

562
00:31:13,568 --> 00:31:15,006
when did we

563
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:16,407
fix the TV?

564
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:17,628
TV?

565
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:21,046
Why would we fix the TV?

566
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,987
Nothing is wrong with it.

567
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:25,987
Nothing.

568
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:27,827
Maybe I remembered wrong.

569
00:31:29,007 --> 00:31:29,686
Lingling,

570
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,908
you are stressing yourself out
from work.

571
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,887
I know a great place.

572
00:31:35,888 --> 00:31:37,087
Let's go there this afternoon

573
00:31:37,088 --> 00:31:38,388
to relax.

574
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:39,246
It's fine.

575
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:40,787
You can go with Dr. Zhang.

576
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:43,507
Dr. Zhang?

577
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:47,708
Who's Dr. Zhang?

578
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:49,787
Lingling,

579
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:52,428
why do you keep saying weird things?

580
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:54,747
Are you sure you're all right?

581
00:31:58,487 --> 00:31:59,908
Give me a minute. I have a call.

582
00:32:00,928 --> 00:32:02,668
Hello, Hua.

583
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:06,827
A wedding dress live stream?

584
00:32:07,247 --> 00:32:07,847
I got time.

585
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:08,948
I can.

586
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:10,827
Yes, go on.

587
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:12,827
You...

588
00:32:12,928 --> 00:32:14,446
Why are you wearing a wedding dress?

589
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:16,807
I was doing a wedding dress
live stream just now.

590
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:19,167
When I heard you were in the hospital,
I came here right away.

591
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:20,547
I didn't have time to change it.

592
00:32:23,368 --> 00:32:26,587
(So it was a dream,)

593
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:27,966
(but)

594
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,027
(a sweet one.)

595
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:36,908
(Back then,)

596
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:38,286
(I used to trap myself)

597
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:41,027
(in the promise and memory
of my brother.)

598
00:32:41,368 --> 00:32:44,868
(Letting go has made me feel
so much lighter.)

599
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,847
(Perhaps the dream isn't an end)

600
00:32:47,848 --> 00:32:49,628
(but a beginning.)

601
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,827
(He's telling me)

602
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:57,108
(that I should pursue my own happiness.)

603
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:02,027
(If I ever meet Xiao Ran again,)

604
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:06,006
(I will definitely express my feelings)

605
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:07,428
