=Episode 16=

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,219
Xiao Ran,

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,180
when you first took over the position,

31
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,379
we were understanding.

32
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,939
But after all this time,

33
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,579
you have made such a big mess.

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,918
The game production is facing resistance

35
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,939
mainly because of Lanyao.

36
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,059
How do you explain the hot search?

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,758
Are you aware

38
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,919
of how damaging these scandals can be

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,339
to our company's stock market?

40
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:15,959
Shanhai Group

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,119
doesn't allow internal relationships.

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,540
Does this rule not apply to you?

43
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,679
Also, you have to know

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,519
that you are engaged

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,260
to the heiress of the Shen Group.

46
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,799
Whether or not the rumors are true,

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,038
I leave it aside first.

48
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,639
Shanhai is a game company, yet we are
on the hot search all of a sudden.

49
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,019
This doesn't make any sense.

50
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:37,780
Whether or not someone
is behind this farce,

51
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,558
you are more experienced than I am.

52
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,399
I believe

53
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,660
all of you have your own judgment.

54
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,899
Second,

55
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,459
Lan Yao Studio and Shanhai Group

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,500
are contract-based.

57
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,438
Lan Yao Studio

58
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,158
is not a department
under the Shanhai Group,

59
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,540
so Song Lingling is not my subordinate.

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,139
Besides,

61
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,179
my engagement with Shen Xiangyu

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,420
wasn't the focus of this incident.

63
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,139
We are not legally married either.

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,799
Hence, my relationship
with Song Lingling,

65
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,199
or even marriage,

66
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,998
is reasonable

67
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,100
and legal.

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,540
By the way,

69
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,420
you spoke of the stock market,

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,838
as long as the fluctuations

71
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,100
are controlled within normal limits,

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,859
they won't affect
the company significantly.

73
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,119
There is still some time
before the year-end financial settlement.

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,758
As long as I can ensure

75
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,179
a 30 percent increase in profit
from last year's.

76
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,318
It's stated in black and white

77
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,799
on the shareholder agreement you signed.

78
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,718
I assume none of you
have any objections, right?

79
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,758
Xiao Ran...

80
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,619
Calm down.

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,179
We are getting up in years.

82
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,500
There's no need to argue
with young people.

83
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:47,980
Mr. Xiao,

84
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,339
if your capability at work

85
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,459
were half as good as your eloquence,

86
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,679
we wouldn't be questioning

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,019
your performance.

88
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,718
We're not here to play games

89
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,660
with you and your girlfriend.

90
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,220
Also, we aren't being unreasonable.

91
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,579
Out of respect for Mr. Xiao Sr.,

92
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,660
we will give you two days.

93
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,859
But,

94
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,878
for the time being, we will freeze

95
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,619
your rights to the shares you hold.

96
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,179
If you fail to control the situation,

97
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,919
we will immediately stop investing

98
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,699
in the game,

99
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,558
and all the shareholders present

100
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,819
will announce their withdrawal publicly.

101
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:24,540
At that point, you will bear

102
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,859
all the consequences alone.

103
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,479
Lin Qiao,

104
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,619
look what you brought you.

105
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,379
These are your favorite food.

106
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,100
What's wrong? You looked worried.

107
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,819
Check on the hot search.

108
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,379
I want to go to Shanhai now.

109
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,699
Wait here.

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,839
Lin Qiao,

111
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,819
I know you are worried about Xiao Ran.

112
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,318
Stay calm.

113
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,719
You trained

114
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,279
Shanhai's PR Team,

115
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,438
so you have to trust them,

116
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,398
and also trust
that Xiao Ran can handle this.

117
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:18,839
But...

118
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,518
Lin Qiao, you have already resigned.

119
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,758
Even if you go now,

120
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,958
what role would you have

121
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,780
in solving the problem?

122
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,119
Besides, Xiao Ran is the CEO.

123
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,100
He has to face it sooner or later.

124
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,020
Let's eat first, all right?

125
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,919
I went all over the place

126
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,660
to find this delicious food for you.

127
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,900
You can't let my effort go to waste.

128
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,440
(Xiao Ran, how are you?
Please take care of yourself.)

129
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,680
(Ignore those comments.)

130
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,239
I have told you many times

131
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,179
not to get Lin Qiao involved.

132
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,438
I didn't do anything.

133
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,020
I just followed your orders.

134
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,518
The online speculations

135
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,758
involving Lin Qiao

136
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,239
were unexpected.

137
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,819
I can't control that.

138
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,460
It seems

139
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,259
the situation is worse than we thought.

140
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,379
This is getting out

141
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,859
of our hands.

142
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,179
It's quite interesting how

143
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,059
those netizens

144
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,420
could build a whole story
from just one photo.

145
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,859
Make sure Lanyao and Qiao
aren't attacked

146
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,619
while you guide public sentiment.

147
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,159
All right, Mr. Xiao.

148
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,239
Although Laoyao's mental state

149
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,078
has always been discussed,

150
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,878
psychological issues

151
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,939
and mental illness

152
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,919
are sensitive topics.

153
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,359
If we steer the discussion

154
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,140
towards her condition

155
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,078
and frame her as a patient

156
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,039
instead of a game designer,

157
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,518
we can evoke empathy

158
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,438
from netizens

159
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,819
and stop the attacks.

160
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,438
But as for your image, it's difficult
to change for the time being...

161
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:55,998
Are you still

162
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:57,900
the Xiao Ran I used to know?

163
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,839
What's this?

164
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,059
Fire away.

165
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,980
Are you even a man?

166
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,259
How could you frame your brother?

167
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,460
What are you on about?

168
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,998
Why would I do that to him?

169
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,299
Did I say something wrong?

170
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,679
You kicked your brother
out of the company for a woman.

171
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,839
Do you know how terrible

172
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,980
those online comments about you?

173
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,758
They are just baseless speculations.

174
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,239
You and Xiao Ran
have been friends for years.

175
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,919
You can't point a finger at him

176
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,540
merely because of online gossip.

177
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,620
It's fine. He's always like that.

178
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,459
I'm used to it.

179
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,420
You tell me

180
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:39,339
what really happened.

181
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,260
I have nothing to say.

182
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,660
I will explain for him.

183
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,540
The backend data I gathered

184
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,140
shows that this was a scheme
against Mr. Xiao.

185
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,179
Someone orchestrated the whole thing.

186
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,620
Who's behind it?

187
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,579
As my close friend,

188
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,780
shouldn't you investigate this?

189
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,798
This is tricky.

190
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,420
I need help.

191
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,479
All right. Get back to your work.

192
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,099
Uh... It's not that I trust you,

193
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,260
I trust your PR team.

194
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,599
What took Xiong so long
to collect the takeaway?

195
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,339
I'm starving.

196
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,819
Me too.

197
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,599
Xiong,

198
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,479
what takes you so long?

199
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,239
Boss,

200
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,798
don't go downstairs.

201
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,819
There are a lot of reporters outside.

202
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:01,798
Go away.

203
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,579
What are you guys doing here?

204
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,758
Boss, I'm hanging up now.

205
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,079
Don't go downstairs.

206
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,860
They came here to look for you.

207
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,660
There are many reporters downstairs.

208
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,699
Am I that popular?

209
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,038
Boss, check this out.

210
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,278
The latest hot search.

211
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,939
They are discussing you

212
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,500
and Mr. Lin.

213
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,900
What happened to me and Mr. Lin?

214
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,020
They made up a love triangle story
from the photo?

215
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,860
No, I must explain myself.

216
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,059
Boss.

217
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,339
Yiyi.

218
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,059
Baby, I'm so worried about you.

219
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,140
I saw those hot searches.

220
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,740
You have to stay calm.

221
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,319
But the reporters

222
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,079
are downstairs at my company.

223
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,380
I must clear things up with them.
Otherwise, they will think I'm a coward.

224
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:03,959
I knew

225
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,500
you wanted to explain
to those reporters.

226
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,878
But believe me,

227
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,638
no matter how you try
to explain to them,

228
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:12,299
those tabloid reporters
won't let you off.

229
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,359
Even if you explain
everything logically,

230
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,278
they will twist your words

231
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,860
and create new rumors.

232
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,099
I have been through this a lot.

233
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,819
What's important now is

234
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,620
to leave the office.

235
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,299
Wait for me. I'm coming for you.

236
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,079
My assistant

237
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,079
came here to get me
a game advertisement deal.

238
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,719
Just after they called,

239
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,179
then you guys were already here.

240
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,719
I didn't know

241
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,740
words travel so fast.

242
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,819
Didn't you read the hot search?

243
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,420
We came here for Lanyao.

244
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,059
While you...

245
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,979
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,020
Forget it.

247
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,998
I thought you were waiting for me.

248
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:35,359
So many of you.

249
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,278
If not,

250
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,459
I'm going upstairs.

251
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,179
Qiao.

252
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,440
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

253
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:17,620
I'm fine.

254
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,020
Don't worry about me.

255
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,878
That day, Lanyao and I...

256
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,699
Qiao,

257
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,860
don't take it seriously.

258
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,638
It's rumors.

259
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,260
You don't have to explain to me.

260
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,579
I know you trust me.

261
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,900
But they have accused me
because of the scandals.

262
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,579
I'm not worried about being attacked,

263
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,559
but you

264
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,660
have finally met someone you love,

265
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,620
I'm afraid this incident will affect
both of you.

266
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,579
Ms. Song might be forced
to keep her distance.

267
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,939
I'm worried you both would grow apart
after this incident.

268
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,020
To be honest, I'm more worried
about you and Xiangyu.

269
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,780
After all, both of you
went through so much...

270
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,020
You are the one being attacked.

271
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,800
Why are you worrying about me instead?

272
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,860
Well, Qiao.

273
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,638
I have something urgent to handle now.

274
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,740
I'm hanging up.

275
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,620
All right.

276
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,959
(It's obvious)

277
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,020
(that things are out of Ran's depth.)

278
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,500
(Besides, he took a lot of heat)

279
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,459
(due to my resignation.)

280
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,860
(If the love triangle rumor
can't be stopped soon,)

281
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,620
(Xiangyu might also overthink.)

282
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,299
(No way.)

283
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,059
(Only I can clear this up.)

284
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,179
(I must come up with some solutions.)

285
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,979
Someone's here.

286
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,620
Why are you guys still here?

287
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,518
What's wrong?

288
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,559
Lanyao hasn't shown up yet?

289
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,439
We wanted to ask you

290
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,719
where she is.

291
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,380
I don't know where she went.

292
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,678
You guys can't just
wait around for nothing.

293
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,459
Why don't you

294
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,559
interview me?

295
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,199
I have quite a bit
of public recognition.

296
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,239
Maybe next time.

297
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,780
If there's a chance.

298
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,620
Did you see that, Hu?

299
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,400
That's the treatment
an unpopular influencer gets.

300
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,660
Forget it. Let's go.

301
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,979
Tell me everything
only when we get home.

302
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,780
I'm really upset.

303
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,439
I wish I could tell them

304
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,699
I'm not a psycho.

305
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,239
But I don't know how

306
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,059
to explain it to them.

307
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,299
It's so frustrating.

308
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,660
How about this?

309
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,239
You should announce your relationship
to the public.

310
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,540
Perhaps you will gain some couple fans.

311
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,319
Absolutely not!

312
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,660
This would only make it seem like

313
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,119
I'm incompetent

314
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,579
and relying on Xiao Ran.

315
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,059
This is wrong.

316
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,059
By that logic,

317
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,918
you are his game designer.

318
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,339
You are the cash cow.

319
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,620
You are a self-man woman.

320
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,839
If you ask me,

321
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,119
Xiao Ran is the freeloader,

322
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,038
(Xiao Ran)
not you.

323
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,798
Those people are just spewing nonsense.

324
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,860
They know nothing at all.

325
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,638
I'm not done yet.

326
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,219
Why are you picking up the call?

327
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,420
Yes?

328
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,660
Are you

329
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,900
all right?

330
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,380
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,860
It took me so long to call you.

332
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,579
Are you all right?

333
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,540
Did those reporters harass you?

334
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,359
Nothing could happen to me.

335
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,339
I'm still in one piece.

336
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,699
I'm fine.

337
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,140
Uh,

338
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,579
don't worry too much

339
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,380
about the hot search.

340
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,979
I'm fine.

341
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,478
They are rumors.

342
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,179
I won't take it personally.

343
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,539
Qiao and I were just having a meal.

344
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,060
It was not a date.

345
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,699
Are you serious?

346
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,900
You are worried that I'm jealous?

347
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,100
It's not that.

348
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,660
I just...

349
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,539
I just think

350
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,380
those online comments about you

351
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,939
are awful.

352
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,660
I'm worried you might be affected.

353
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,759
It's a good thing
to be on the hot search.

354
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,039
We can save a lot

355
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,140
on advertising.

356
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:42,799
As for the rest,

357
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,979
leave it up to Ai and Nan Gongyu.

358
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:47,660
Come in.

359
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,939
You have a meeting right now, right?

360
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:52,238
Go ahead.

361
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,179
It's fine.

362
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:56,119
I'm sorry that you have to
wait for me at home.

363
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,100
I will go home as soon as I can.

364
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,939
Don't be. I'm staying
at my own place, after all.

365
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,900
I will come to see you at night.

366
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:09,420
All right.

367
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,380
Bye-bye.

368
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,539
Bye-bye.

369
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,259
I was right.

370
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:21,259
Someone's manipulating
the hot search this time.

371
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:22,478
Besides,

372
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,638
when we were tracking down
the mastermind,

373
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,179
we encountered some

374
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,259
resistance.

375
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:29,860
I get what you are saying.

376
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,478
Given your personal image,

377
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,459
combined with the current
public sentiment,

378
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,939
the PR team had a discussion.

379
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,158
If you and Ms. Lanyao

380
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,198
are really a couple

381
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:40,699
as rumored,

382
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,340
you could admit it.

383
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,539
Plus, with Ms. Lanyao's mental state,

384
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,839
we can create a persona of a devoted man

385
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,438
who refuses to leave

386
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,499
his ailing partner.

387
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,759
Later,

388
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,718
we can publish proof

389
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,259
of Ms. Lanyao's mental condition

390
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,140
to show she has recovered.

391
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,438
As for the photo
of Mr. Lin and Ms. Lanyao,

392
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,918
there are many interpretations.

393
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,580
We can claim it's a family gathering.

394
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,939
Forget about that.

395
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,319
Stick to the PR plan

396
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,459
we discussed earlier.

397
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,359
All right. We will come up with more plans.

398
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,939
I can't understand this.

399
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,699
Look at this.

400
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,100
Many people are shipping you two online.

401
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,559
I think

402
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,039
you should just announce it

403
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,420
to get rid of the identity
as a single man.

404
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:38,359
That way, you can get yourself out
of the current dilemma

405
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,900
and also avoid other women.

406
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,979
Isn't this plan perfect?

407
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,718
Why are you giving more work

408
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:46,060
to your PR team?

409
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:48,019
What are you hesitating for?

410
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,459
She's proud.

411
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,140
If people call her scheming

412
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,019
and unscrupulous,

413
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,060
it will hurt her pride.

414
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,878
Does he hesitate this much

415
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:23,820
as the CEO, too?

416
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:37,799
I have found

417
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,638
the source of the imbalanced data.

418
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,519
This is likely

419
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,739
to be more complicated than we thought.

420
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,119
I can contact Lanyao

421
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,459
to fix this now.

422
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:46,779
What do you think?

423
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,759
From your experience,

424
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,100
do you think Lanyao
can fix all this on her own?

425
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:54,519
Without my help,

426
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,739
it's impossible.

427
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,539
Setting aside Lanyao's abilities,

428
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,319
all the manpower and resources,

429
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,198
including financial

430
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,638
and technical support

431
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,119
provided by the Shanhai Group,

432
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,820
still aren't enough for her
to handle it independently.

433
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,499
If they intend to push the game forward,

434
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:11,459
they need our help for sure.

435
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,300
Understood.

436
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,620
No rush.

437
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:19,340
We can take it slow.

438
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,999
Considering Xiao Ran's personality,

439
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,319
he will only seek help

440
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,620
until he is at a desperate end.

441
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,620
But he won't give up easily.

442
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:31,620
What we need to do is wait.

443
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,939
Before the fish takes the bait,

444
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,779
be as patient as necessary.

445
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,499
Darling,

446
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,019
how's the thing I asked of you?

447
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,638
Those videos of Lanyao in our hospital

448
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,638
have mostly been deleted.

449
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:09,759
I have also talked

450
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,678
to some of the employees privately.

451
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,499
There won't be more news
getting out of the hospital.

452
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,779
I know I can count on you.

453
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,140
When I noticed someone wearing
your hospital's uniform

454
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:24,478
in the video,

455
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,900
I thought of you immediately.

456
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:26,799
All right.

457
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,359
I'm hanging up.

458
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,860
Don't let me keep you.

459
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,040
Don't miss me too much.

460
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,738
Lingling hasn't slept
for one day and one night.

461
00:22:32,738 --> 00:22:34,060
I need to check out on her.

462
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,060
Bye.

463
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,179
So

464
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,499
this is how it feels to be alone.

465
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,380
No.

466
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,739
You have me.

467
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,580
Why are you here?

468
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,438
♪Never leaving through all seasons♪

469
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:45,939
Why are you dressed like that?

470
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:48,939
To hide myself from being noticed.

471
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,279
Anyway, I'm lucky.

472
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,638
Just as I wondered how to get up here,

473
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,839
I saw a group of people
moving computer equipment,

474
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,820
so I blended in and came up with them.

475
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,340
Why do you come here so late?

476
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,238
It's dangerous.

477
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,580
Did anyone follow you?

478
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,238
If you keep nagging,

479
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,259
you might lose your image

480
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,001
of a bossy CEO.

481
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:16,117
♪I send a love sign
with a playful expression♪

482
00:24:16,118 --> 00:24:19,483
♪But you pretend not to respond♪

483
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,979
Sorry

484
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,219
to put you through all this.

485
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,499
It's fine.

486
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,580
You too

487
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,259
can't go home.

488
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:34,300
You haven't answered me

489
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:36,499
about why you came here at this hour.

490
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,539
I came here to seek help, Mr. Xiao.

491
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,839
If you don't hold my hand,

492
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,420
I can't fall asleep.

493
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:46,398
If Xing Tian comes up and makes a mess,

494
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:48,638
I would really turn into a psycho

495
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:50,019
and become famous nationwide.

496
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,100
Just because of this?

497
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,259
Not because you worried about me?

498
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:59,380
Maybe a little bit.

499
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,100
You have to sleep here tonight. Sorry.

500
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,259
It's fine.

501
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,499
I believe

502
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,739
this will be an unforgettable night.

503
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,779
Good night, Mr. Xiao.

504
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,699
I couldn't protect you.

505
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:38,939
If you must say this,

506
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:41,100
it's my fault, then.

507
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:44,539
I shouldn't have asked you
to invest in my game

508
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,939
and the game wouldn't have had bugs.

509
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,799
If I didn't...

510
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,779
Well.

511
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:55,499
No matter what we are experiencing now,

512
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,699
it's a trial for us.

513
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,580
I believe we will sail through smoothly

514
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:02,939
and reach the end.

515
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,860
Shouldn't it be

516
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:10,198
that the game

517
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:11,660
finally goes online successfully?

518
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,779
I mean everything,

519
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,019
including us.

520
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,420
Sleep.

521
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:38,799
Sorry.

522
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,900
It's fine.

523
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,779
Mr. Lin,

524
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,599
the time you requested an interview

525
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,238
is quite unusual.

526
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,860
It's late at night.

527
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,400
I have been dealing
with a lot of reporters recently.

528
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,678
This is the only option

529
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,079
to avoid them.

530
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,039
Are you ready

531
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,580
to answer our questions now?

532
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,359
Mr. Lin,

533
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,478
were you forced to leave the company
due to misjudgment,

534
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:02,259
or did you take the fall
for someone else?

535
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:05,140
My resignation is because of my problem.

536
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,340
I made a mistake in judgment,

537
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,799
and I don't think

538
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,739
I can continue working at Shanhai Group.

539
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,559
The "someone else" you mentioned

540
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,420
is my brother, Xiao Ran, right?

541
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:17,179
Yes.

542
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,079
It's said that Xiao Ran

543
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,398
kicked the board members out.

544
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,359
Mr. Lin,

545
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,718
did this cause you and your brother

546
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:24,420
to drift apart?

547
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:26,398
Was the misjudgment

548
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,918
due to the change in shareholders,

549
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,279
or was it the repeated
alpha testing failures

550
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,100
that drifted you and your brother apart?

551
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:35,699
Ms. Shen, calm down.

552
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:38,300
You can't help Mr. Lin
even if you go up there.

553
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:43,140
I know he would do this.

554
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,459
I must stop him.

555
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,380
Ms. Shen, the reporter has made
full preparations for the interview.

556
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,279
If you really want to intervene,

557
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,580
you need to think through
your words and statements.

558
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,380
You can't ruin your image for Lin Qiao.

559
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,398
Did Xiao Ran's decision

560
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,638
cause you

561
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:01,539
any distress?

562
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,340
This is all my fault.

563
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,860
It has nothing to do with Xiao Ran.

564
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,620
Therefore,

565
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,140
I would like to apologize to Xiao Ran,

566
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,620
who has faced a lot of backlash,
through this interview.

567
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:14,999
Mr. Lin, are you sure this is the truth?

568
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,759
You weren't bribed

569
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,060
or forced?

570
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:20,499
Xiao Ran and I are blood brothers.

571
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,300
We will admit to our mistakes

572
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,739
with each other honestly.

573
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,620
No one was bribed.

574
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,060
Understood.

575
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,878
Next

576
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:31,198
is about the love triangle scandals

577
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:33,499
between you, Lanyao, and your brother.

578
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:36,459
The rumors about Lanyao and me
aren't true.

579
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:38,459
We are completely innocent.

580
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:41,420
Ms. Lanyao is
an excellent game designer,

581
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:43,300
and she's upright and kind.

582
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,100
We were just having a meal.

583
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,060
Since we chose to dine
in a public place,

584
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,580
we weren't afraid of being talked about.

585
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,699
You never liked Lanyao,

586
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,519
or is this an excuse...

587
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,119
You can go now.

588
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,440
Because you failed to win her over?

589
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,958
Besides, you have only clarified
the rumors between you and Lanyao.

590
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:00,878
But you didn't address

591
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:02,900
the rumors
between Lanyao and your brother.

592
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,660
Does that mean

593
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:07,100
something is going on between them?

594
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,499
Lin Qiao.

595
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:11,219
Why are you here?

596
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,878
May I know who she is?

597
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:13,739
Me?

598
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,979
I'm Shen Xiangyu of the Shen Group.

599
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:19,060
I'm also Lin Qiao's girlfriend.
