00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:46,208
Xiao Ran is coming. Please calm down.

30
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,548
Qiao, be careful.

31
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:53,687
Brother Lin, I trusted you so much,

32
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:55,168
yet you and this mongrel

33
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:57,788
are actually in cahoots behind my back.

34
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:01,728
Our friendship

35
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:04,749
ends here.

36
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:06,527
What's wrong with her?

37
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:08,549
Qiao, I will explain to you later.

38
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:10,568
Get her control first.

39
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:11,589
The pair of you!

40
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,709
What are you trying to do?

41
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:16,068
Calm down.

42
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:17,327
Talk nicely to her.

43
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:18,948
She's a girl, after all.

44
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:22,408
Qiao, it's hard to explain now.

45
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,749
Here's your death wish!

46
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,068
So you are saying

47
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:01,869
that Miss Song's possessed
by Xingtian from the game?

48
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,668
This is bizarre.

49
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:08,989
Besides,

50
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:12,508
is this the only way

51
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:16,068
to stop the general
from appearing again?

52
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,869
I thought something was wrong
with her here.

53
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,989
I used to think that way at first.

54
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:30,087
Plus, he beats me every time he sees me

55
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:31,989
because of his wife.

56
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,228
Have you come up with a solution yet?

57
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:38,709
I found a specialist,

58
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:40,549
but the condition

59
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,908
of Lingling is unique,

60
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,989
there are no results yet.

61
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,549
Given her condition,

62
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:51,528
the game

63
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:53,188
might get suspended, right?

64
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,228
What worries me the mos

65
00:03:58,048 --> 00:03:59,388
is Lingling.

66
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:01,647
Could this

67
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:02,528
also happen

68
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:04,388
to other players?

69
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:06,469
I have had Big Ding investigate.

70
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:07,688
As of now,

71
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,848
no one from the alpha testing

72
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,469
has experienced anything abnormal

73
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:12,989
like Lingling.

74
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:16,429
That's a relief.

75
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:22,908
I know the board has pressured you

76
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:25,428
because of the testing failure.

77
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,589
Still, you need to be patient.

78
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:30,308
Take your time.

79
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:34,908
Qiao,

80
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:38,428
do you really have to go?

81
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:50,908
Stop convincing me.

82
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:54,389
Leaving here

83
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,389
is the best choice.

84
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,269
David, what have you done?

85
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,469
You may leave.

86
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:09,668
Me?

87
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:11,589
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:14,127
Shanhai Group's alpha testing

89
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:15,428
failed again.

90
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:18,328
Lin Qiao took all the responsibility.

91
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:20,509
He claimed it was his fault.

92
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:23,469
I have no idea about this.

93
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:27,168
Should we apologize

94
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,868
and tell them

95
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:29,768
that

96
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:32,228
it has nothing to do with Lin Qiao?

97
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:34,127
We are not sure why

98
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:35,389
the testing failed.

99
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:36,487
Once we admit this,

100
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:37,908
it might turn out to be a terrible lie

101
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:39,709
and make things worse.

102
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:41,927
Not only will it not help Lin Qiao,

103
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:43,788
but it could also bring up past issues.

104
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:47,228
If the company finds out that
he covered up the virus issue for me,

105
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,988
his condition will only be worse.

106
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:50,069
Right.

107
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,389
You should leave this place now.

108
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:53,888
Do not let anyone discover scandals

109
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:55,548
against Lin Qiao.

110
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:57,269
Do we really have to do this?

111
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,509
Yes.

112
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:00,968
I don't want Lin Qiao

113
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:03,069
to leave the company in disgrace.

114
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:05,428
Only I can help him now.

115
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:33,998
(Sir: Your flight will depart in two hours.
Please check in 60 minutes before departure.)

116
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:41,509
(Ran, I know what you are thinking.)

117
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:44,548
(But I just need a reason
to leave this place.)

118
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:46,709
(I hope you can forgive me
for being selfish.)

119
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,240
(Shen Xiangyu)

120
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:32,648
Excuse me.

121
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:34,189
Let's have some fun.

122
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:35,088
Go away.

123
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,367
I'm in a bad mood today.

124
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:37,428
Don't mess up with me.

125
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:38,728
Why are you in a bad mood?

126
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:39,968
Share with me.

127
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:42,328
I can help you.

128
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:42,968
Let go of me.

129
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:45,069
- You have such a temper, young girl.
- Stop!

130
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:48,988
What are you trying to do?

131
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:51,567
You mind your own business.
We are friends.

132
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:53,228
We are talking now.

133
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:59,168
Leave now, or I won't let you off.

134
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:00,308
Please, mister.

135
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:02,007
Don't take us wrong. We are drunk.

136
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:02,848
We are confused now.

137
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:03,668
Get lost.

138
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:09,927
Luckily, you came.

139
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:11,949
I was so scared.

140
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,949
Everything's all right. They have gone.

141
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,189
Ask Steven to accompany you next time.

142
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,927
I won't be able to show up
on time every time.

143
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:22,149
You screened my calls.

144
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:23,968
If I didn't know

145
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,868
you were going abroad today,

146
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:28,428
I wouldn't have hurried here.

147
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:33,909
Go home, Xiangyu.

148
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,309
I should go now.

149
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:46,388
Don't go.

150
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,748
Let go.

151
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:59,748
Lin Qiao, I sprained my foot.

152
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:01,589
I can't move.

153
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,069
It's broken.

154
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,148
Even though you try every way
to keep me here today,

155
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:15,909
I will also try every way to leave.

156
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,148
Even though you have ways and means
to leave,

157
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:22,549
I will also have ways and means
to make you stay.

158
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:27,829
I really don't know what to do with you.

159
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,949
Lin Qiao,

160
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:33,189
when you rushed to protect me just now,

161
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,669
it reminded me of what happened
back in the school.

162
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:40,248
What are you doing?

163
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:41,589
Mind your own business.

164
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:45,528
You busybody.

165
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:46,927
Beat him.

166
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:47,447
You busybody.

167
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:49,128
Beat him.

168
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,008
You busybody.

169
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:50,988
Beat him.

170
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:53,128
Miss,

171
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,248
over there.

172
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:55,789
What are you doing?

173
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,429
It was in the past.

174
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,789
We have all grown up now.

175
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:19,508
Yes,

176
00:10:19,808 --> 00:10:21,087
after growing up,

177
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,988
things changed.

178
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:25,248
But my feelings for you

179
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,789
never change.

180
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,148
I know.

181
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:31,408
Do you know why

182
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:33,687
I put so much effort

183
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:35,189
into the Shen Group?

184
00:10:38,568 --> 00:10:43,909
You want to inherit the family business
and become the chairwoman.

185
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:47,847
I hope I can

186
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:50,628
protect you like how you protected me.

187
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:52,469
I want to be someone you can rely on

188
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,589
and keep you away from harm.

189
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:57,429
But I didn't know...

190
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,309
Well,

191
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:04,189
I didn't blame you.

192
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:06,709
Everyone makes mistakes.

193
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:10,108
I'm to blame, too.

194
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:13,028
It's not entirely your problem.

195
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:15,967
It's enough for me

196
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,268
to bear the cost alone.

197
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:20,549
No.

198
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,789
I said I wanted to protect you.

199
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:24,648
Even though things went
against our will,

200
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,868
I must find a way to make amends.

201
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:30,128
But I want to clear steer

202
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,909
of the company business.

203
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:35,309
I know you well.

204
00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:37,108
Even though you are leaving now,

205
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,469
you still won't let go deep inside.

206
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:41,128
Since you wish to leave,

207
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,829
why don't you settle all the issues
before leaving?

208
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:46,789
Leaving now

209
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:49,148
is evading the problem.

210
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:52,288
It's your way
of tying all the loose ends

211
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:55,108
before leaving, isn't it?

212
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,709
Xiao Ran is under tremendous pressure,

213
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,508
he needs you very much.

214
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:06,469
Many things have happened recently.

215
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:09,028
I just want a change of scenery

216
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,268
to sort my thoughts out.

217
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,789
If so, you can move into a hotel.

218
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,967
Only I know where you are.

219
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,949
Other people won't be able
to disturb you.

220
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,528
I think

221
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,228
you are up to something again, right?

222
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:28,687
I'm trying to help you,

223
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:30,148
but you wronged me.

224
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,189
All right.

225
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,829
So, are you leaving?

226
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:39,309
I'm not leaving.

227
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:42,669
So, how's the pain?

228
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:43,988
It still hurts.

229
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:15,628
(When did I come back here?)

230
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:18,748
(Didn't I go to Mr. Lin's place
last night?)

231
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,608
It's you, Brother Lin.

232
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:23,888
It has been a long while.

233
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:26,108
I have missed you so much.

234
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:28,868
My friend...

235
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:34,128
(Is this)

236
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:35,709
(Xingtian's memory?)

237
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:37,949
(Why do I have Xingtian's memory?)

238
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,309
Song Lingling,

239
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,829
you know you can't hold liquor well.

240
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,628
Why did you mention drinking?

241
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:13,028
I wanted to talk some sense
into Mr. Lin,

242
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:15,028
but it turned out...

243
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,789
Why are you up so early?

244
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:47,348
Xiao Ran,

245
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:49,789
I was trying

246
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:52,807
to talk Mr. Lin out of resigning.

247
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,567
I didn't expect Xingtian to come out.

248
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:57,348
I didn't want that to happen.

249
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:59,748
I know why you went to see Qiao.

250
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,268
Don't worry.

251
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,469
I'm not mad.

252
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,429
But Mr. Lin...

253
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:11,069
Qiao wants to resign.

254
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,087
I tried to talk him out of it
many times,

255
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:14,709
but I couldn't persuade him.

256
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:16,868
Just like you,

257
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:19,429
I don't want him to leave.

258
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:22,108
But there's not much I can do.

259
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:33,228
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:37,567
I didn't want Mr. Lin

261
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:40,429
to bear all this for me.

262
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:42,429
But

263
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:46,628
I neglected the pressure
you have been enduring.

264
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:49,508
I know

265
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:52,687
Mr. Lin made this decision
for the sake of the game

266
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:54,069
and also for you.

267
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:56,669
You must be feeling worse than me.

268
00:15:57,568 --> 00:15:59,589
Yet, I spoke harshly to you.

269
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:02,268
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:04,748
It's my fault.

271
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:07,268
I thought

272
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:09,348
you wouldn't talk to me.

273
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:11,228
Unexpectedly,

274
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:13,469
you are consoling me now.

275
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:20,469
It seems I don't know you well enough.

276
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:25,927
The priority now is

277
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:27,909
to fix the game.

278
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:30,868
I need to work harder.

279
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:44,628
Morning.

280
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:46,228
Morning, Boss.

281
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:52,429
Boss, did you not sleep well last night?

282
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:55,189
Never mind me.

283
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:56,768
How's the game fixing

284
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:58,508
coming along?

285
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:00,508
Sorry, Boss.

286
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,967
We are still looking for the reason

287
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:05,548
for the bugs.

288
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,648
We reran the game many times,

289
00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:08,848
but we couldn't find

290
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:10,788
where the bugs were.

291
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:13,669
So we can only filter
from the basic layer.

292
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:16,028
If that's the case...

293
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,727
In that case,

294
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:19,247
the fixing can't be completed

295
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,368
as planned.

296
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,389
Boss,

297
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:23,228
um... We...

298
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,447
You guys get back to your work.

299
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:26,788
I will try to come up with something.

300
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:34,088
Mr. Lin has resigned, and you said
you would take all the responsibility.

301
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:35,527
But it has been a while,

302
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:36,527
how come

303
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:37,368
Lan Yao Studio

304
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:39,168
still hasn't given us a reasonable
solution plan?

305
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:41,109
Plus, you didn't want A to take over.

306
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:42,767
What about the game now?

307
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:45,028
Shouldn't you give us an explanation?

308
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:47,168
I have already told you.

309
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:48,888
Lan Yao Studio is investigating.

310
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:50,028
Mr. Xiao,

311
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:52,508
we don't have time to wait anymore.

312
00:17:55,928 --> 00:17:57,068
Why are you here?

313
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:01,608
Leave him alone.

314
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,028
I insisted on coming here.

315
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:06,828
I have something to discuss with you.

316
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:10,629
Directors,

317
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,447
on behalf of my team,

318
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:14,548
I will reply to your suggestions.

319
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,548
I agree with A taking over the project

320
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:20,268
and leading the subsequent work
on the game.

321
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,109
Song Lingling.

322
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:29,268
Besides, I have two requests.

323
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:31,469
First,

324
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,909
my team and A's team

325
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:35,687
must cooperate

326
00:18:35,688 --> 00:18:38,228
until all the fixings are done.

327
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:41,268
Otherwise, my team will not withdraw
from the project.

328
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:42,909
Second,

329
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,228
the project period must be extended.

330
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:03,648
Is your wound this serious?

331
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:05,247
Do you want me to take you
to the hospital?

332
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:06,687
No need.

333
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,048
I just need more rest.

334
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:11,828
It's just that I have a problem
moving around.

335
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:13,109
Sit.

336
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:17,588
Here.

337
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:21,909
Look, I'm already injured.

338
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:24,109
Can you do me a favor?

339
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:25,168
What favor?

340
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:27,189
Sit down first.

341
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:34,848
Last time, I told you

342
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,527
about the expert Vic.

343
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:38,788
He's arriving this afternoon.

344
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:41,848
But I sprained my leg,

345
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,487
and I can't walk.

346
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:45,709
Can you pick him up for me?

347
00:19:46,488 --> 00:19:48,588
You want to introduce him to Ran?

348
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:49,527
Yes.

349
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:51,748
I went to great lengths
to invite him over.

350
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:55,487
I know you want to stay away

351
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:58,149
from work right now.

352
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:01,207
But my foot

353
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,909
is injured.

354
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,247
Just bring him to David's studio,

355
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,909
and I will handle the rest.

356
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,949
Sure, no problem.

357
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:13,869
Is that a yes?

358
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:24,389
It was in pain just now.

359
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:27,508
Why did my foot recover so quickly?

360
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:30,927
It has been years,

361
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:34,308
and your lying skills
still haven't improved.

362
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,808
(Shanhai Group)

363
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,487
The high concept of this game

364
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:45,828
is the setting you value the most.

365
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:47,709
But I must tell you,

366
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:49,608
if this game can't be completed,

367
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,287
it's still a work in progress.

368
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:52,648
No matter how novel the concept is,

369
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:54,268
you can't show it to the public.

370
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:57,788
This is a pre-sale product.

371
00:20:57,928 --> 00:20:59,808
If we change the core concept

372
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:02,207
just to meet the release date,

373
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,788
it's outright fraud

374
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:05,487
to our consumers,

375
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:08,088
that's the players.

376
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:09,527
If we really have to change,

377
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:10,408
I'd rather

378
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:12,588
suspend this project.

379
00:21:13,728 --> 00:21:15,308
You are too stubborn.

380
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:18,287
And right now, in the country,

381
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:19,687
no one besides me

382
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:21,487
has the time and ability

383
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,408
to fix this.

384
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:23,988
You can't find anyone suitable.

385
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:26,447
Unless you hire someone from abroad...

386
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:28,608
And that's Mr. Vic.

387
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:29,949
Am I right?

388
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:32,568
What brings you here, Xiangyu?

389
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:34,268
Of course I'm here to help.

390
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:38,349
Lanyao, I assume
you know Mr. Vic, right?

391
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:41,588
Are you talking
about the world's top gamer?

392
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:42,447
Exactly.

393
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:44,408
What do you think

394
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:45,709
if I invite him over?

395
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:49,508
Is he really coming?

396
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:51,408
Judging by the time,

397
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,469
he should be touching down by now.

398
00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:56,469
Why?

399
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:58,648
You are asking me why

400
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,588
I'm helping you, right?

401
00:22:02,248 --> 00:22:05,389
Because I want to prove
Lin Qiao's innocence.

402
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:08,629
I want him to come back
to the Shanhai Group.

403
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:11,909
And?

404
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:13,629
Mr. Xiao,

405
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:15,869
if you want to talk
about serious business,

406
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:18,469
shouldn't we go somewhere else?

407
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:29,788
If I'm not wrong,

408
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:31,848
the design of the NPC at the final level

409
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:33,447
is too complicated,

410
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:35,028
causing an imbalance in the game.

411
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:35,967
That's why

412
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:38,128
many uncontrollable bugs are appearing

413
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:39,869
and they can't be fixed.

414
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:41,287
I made this analysis

415
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:43,088
merely based on my experiences

416
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:44,949
without examining
the internal aspects of the game.

417
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,767
As for a more specific solution,

418
00:22:46,768 --> 00:22:49,007
I need you to

419
00:22:49,008 --> 00:22:49,927
authorize me and my team

420
00:22:49,928 --> 00:22:50,988
to join the game.

421
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:53,149
No problem.

422
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:55,149
What kind of authorization do you need?

423
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:02,268
I need full authorization.

424
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:05,709
Well...

425
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:09,788
I agree.

426
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:10,648
Besides,

427
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:12,287
I'm not used to working in the same room

428
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:13,808
with other teams,

429
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,168
so I need to retrieve the data

430
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:16,247
and work here.

431
00:23:16,248 --> 00:23:17,149
No.

432
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:19,709
The player data is personal privacy.

433
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:22,648
Aside from the original development team
and our company's technical staff,

434
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:24,389
no one can access it.

435
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:25,848
Besides,

436
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:28,048
you are requesting it
from our encrypted database.

437
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:29,068
Not a chance.

438
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:31,808
If that's the case,

439
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:34,909
you should find someone else, Ms. Shen.

440
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:35,949
You...

441
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:41,048
This is my principle.

442
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:42,429
If you don't agree,

443
00:23:42,448 --> 00:23:43,669
there's nothing I can do.

444
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:50,548
I would like to say something.

445
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:52,368
If this is about trust,

446
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:55,007
the Shen Group will represent Vic

447
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:57,088
to invest in this game

448
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:58,349
as a shareholder

449
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:00,408
with a small-scale investment.

450
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:01,128
That way,

451
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:02,608
you can build trust with Vic

452
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,207
in a short time,

453
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,648
and it won't affect the structure
of the shareholders.

454
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:09,389
At the same, Vic will issue
a letter of guarantee.

455
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:10,669
What do you say?

456
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:15,967
Like I said,

457
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:18,068
it's only a small-scale investment.

458
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,608
I have the money.

459
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:21,888
I don't need money from my dad.

460
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:22,727
I'm doing this

461
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:25,168
to create a community
with shared interests.

462
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:26,088
We win

463
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,168
and lose together.

464
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:28,247
I also want to prove

465
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:30,469
that I'm doing all this for Lin Qiao.

466
00:24:33,528 --> 00:24:36,508
I agree with Vic joining the team.

467
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:38,588
But as for your investment,

468
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:39,949
I don't accept it.

469
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:42,687
Even if you are investing
under your name,

470
00:24:42,688 --> 00:24:45,669
you will eventually take over
the Shen Group.

471
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:48,007
So no matter whose name it's under,

472
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,548
it's the same to me.

473
00:24:52,248 --> 00:24:53,189
Here's my suggestion.

474
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:55,548
I think

475
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:58,228
you should think it over again.

476
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:00,869
All right.

477
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,909
Xiangyu, we are leaving.

478
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:06,748
Let me see you off.

479
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:20,828
Whether or not
you invest in this project,

480
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:23,949
I have lowered myself
to accept this job.

481
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:29,748
Ms. Shen,

482
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:31,447
why did you try so hard

483
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,189
to join this game project?

484
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:36,888
As long as I gain control of it,

485
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:39,308
I will hand everything over to Lin Qiao.

486
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:42,949
This is my gift to him.

487
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,389
A unique gift.

488
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:50,988
But things aren't
as simple as you think.

489
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:55,109
This is only the beginning.

490
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,727
Ever since the alpha testing failed,

491
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:00,888
everyone in the studio

492
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:02,088
has been running a full checkup.

493
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:03,848
Right before the day
of the alpha testing,

494
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:06,088
someone maliciously logged
into this account twice

495
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:08,247
and each session was around two hours.

496
00:26:08,248 --> 00:26:09,088
We suspect

497
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:10,447
this person implanted a virus

498
00:26:10,448 --> 00:26:12,168
into the system during this period,

499
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:13,527
causing the game to lag...

500
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:14,629
Wait.

501
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:17,447
Are you saying

502
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:19,767
something's wrong with the account
during this session?

503
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:20,527
Yes.

504
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:24,088
From our preliminary assessment,
this is a possible reason for malicious actions

505
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:25,669
to cause the game to lag.

506
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:28,048
But...

507
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:29,588
This is impossible.

508
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,527
What's wrong, Big Ding?

509
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:32,909
Did you discover anything?

510
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:34,487
I...

511
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:35,349
Speak.

512
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:36,588
Well,

513
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:39,408
While I was preparing for the meeting
before the alpha testing,

514
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:42,247
Mr. Lin mentioned
project confidentiality,

515
00:26:42,248 --> 00:26:43,168
so

516
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,869
I was in charge of everything.

517
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,368
I didn't give it

518
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:49,548
to any team or anyone.

519
00:26:49,928 --> 00:26:51,268
I...

520
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:53,588
Wu, check it.

521
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:03,469
Big Ding will be suspended without pay
for a month.

522
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:05,629
Go to the HR Department now.

523
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:06,988
I...

524
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:25,109
Wu needs time to investigate this.

525
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:28,949
But do you really think it's Big Ding?

526
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:32,988
Certainly not.

527
00:27:33,008 --> 00:27:34,389
He has been with me for five years.

528
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:35,608
He's my staff

529
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:36,869
and my friend.

530
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:39,268
He wouldn't betray me.

531
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:40,608
The investigation

532
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:42,469
is an explanation for the company

533
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:44,748
and also a reason to buy you more time.

534
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:46,308
How can this be?

535
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,548
I can't let Big Ding take the blame.

536
00:27:48,688 --> 00:27:50,727
No, I must explain to everyone.

537
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:51,869
Hold on.

538
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:58,308
If we don't use this situation,

539
00:27:58,488 --> 00:28:00,088
those shareholders from the board

540
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,268
will take this opportunity
to replace you and your team.

541
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,389
We should play along with this

542
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:07,168
and make them believe

543
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:09,028
we have fallen into their trap.

544
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:10,447
What you need to do now is

545
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:11,967
track down the cause of this failure

546
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:13,629
as soon as possible.

547
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:17,469
You must promise me

548
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:19,088
that once everything is done,

549
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:20,727
you will get Big Ding back

550
00:28:20,728 --> 00:28:23,669
and pay him double.

551
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:26,828
Don't worry. I will.

552
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:31,888
But since you have lost Big Ding

553
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:34,109
as a reliable assistant,

554
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:37,028
things will be tough for you
for the time being.

555
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:38,268
That's good.

556
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:40,788
I will handle everything myself

557
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:42,888
and stop those

558
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,548
who try to prevent
the game from going live.

559
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:45,487
Besides,

560
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:46,447
as for the alpha testing,

561
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:47,927
including the launch,

562
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:50,389
I will personally deal with your team.

563
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:53,028
I'm heading back to the office now.

564
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:01,988
Mr. Xiao.

565
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:07,228
Good luck.

566
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,588
Good luck, Lanyao.

567
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:36,680
Hello, Reporter Chen.

568
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,927
It has been a long while
since we last talked.

569
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:40,308
How are you doing recently?

570
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:43,869
Have you hit your KPI this year?

571
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:46,007
Do you want some information?

572
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:47,869
Exclusive scoop, indeed.

573
00:29:58,609 --> 00:29:59,927
What a shame.

574
00:29:59,928 --> 00:30:02,608
I heard the advanced AR game upstairs

575
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:04,848
failed in its alpha testing again.

576
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:07,629
I don't care much about games.

577
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,848
But I'm kind of interested

578
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,508
in the investor, Mr. Xiao.

579
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:14,869
He's hot.

580
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:16,268
Stop drooling.

581
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,199
(The impact of the resignation
of vice president of Shanhai Group)

582
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,559
Look at this.

583
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,629
Xiao Ran was betrayed
by his brother and friends.

584
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:23,007
Where's it?

585
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:24,308
It's on the hot search.

586
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:29,727
The vice president of the Shanhai Group
has resigned.

587
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:32,247
Metaverse of Love might
end up being a stillborn project.

588
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,207
Xiao Ran dominantly

589
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,949
kicked the board members
out of the game.
