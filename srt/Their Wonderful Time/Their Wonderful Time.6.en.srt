00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:45,998
Mr. Lin.

30
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:49,937
This is the dress we prepared
for Goddess Lanyao for the press conference.

31
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:51,098
Please take a look.

32
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:52,358
You guys can decide it.

33
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,978
Her outfit also
represents the company's image.

34
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,378
We have no time.

35
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:58,039
We have to decide it by now.

36
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:03,358
If so, I can only decide
as per my preferences.

37
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:16,017
This will do.

38
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:17,478
Okay, Mr. Lin.

39
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:22,417
Wait for me.

40
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:24,017
My legs aren't as long as yours.

41
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,378
Hurry. We're going to be late.

42
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,959
Why didn't you learn early
when you were in a hurry?

43
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:29,198
Brother.

44
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:31,758
Ran.

45
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:34,338
You should head to the lounge.
All of them are waiting for you.

46
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:35,598
Okay.

47
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,457
If so...

48
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,697
You can go ahead.

49
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:39,318
I'll confirm with her
the subsequent steps.

50
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:41,239
Alright.

51
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,760
What time will
the press conference be held?

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,758
At 3:30 P.M.

53
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:20,318
This is bad.

54
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:29,359
Li,

55
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,959
have you heard of this gossip?

56
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,438
What gossip?

57
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:37,279
The young lady's back.

58
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,498
Young Lady is finally back.

59
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,538
I've been waiting for her for so long.

60
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:42,938
Get up. Stop drinking.

61
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,918
Let's pack up and pick her up.

62
00:03:45,578 --> 00:03:47,878
You're muddle-headed indeed.

63
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:49,519
What do you mean?

64
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,258
Do you think it's appropriate
for us to do so now?

65
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:54,417
What if Xiao Ran discovers us

66
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:56,799
and gets rid of us?

67
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,978
You're intelligent indeed.

68
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,799
Young Lady came back all of a sudden.

69
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,857
Do you think she came back
for the press conference

70
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:09,697
or for her engagement?

71
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:13,079
Isn't Young Lady going
to be engaged to Xiao Ran soon?

72
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:16,038
Lin Qiao is not ambitious at all.

73
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,698
This is...

74
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,937
Although Lin Qiao isn't ambitious,

75
00:04:19,938 --> 00:04:21,377
we are.

76
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:23,297
It's just a game of tug-of-war.

77
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:24,798
It's...

78
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:30,718
You're right.

79
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:33,018
But I think Young Lady came back

80
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:35,598
for the press conference.

81
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:37,358
You're right.

82
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:40,999
If not, why would she check into
a hotel right after landing here?

83
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,879
Will you head there or not?

84
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:46,678
No.

85
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:49,118
I have to stay in the company.

86
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,319
Are you not daring enough to go?

87
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:54,199
Do you have a guilty conscience?

88
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:57,598
Did you prepare a special program

89
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,918
to cheer her up?

90
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:02,118
Chen,

91
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:05,158
you're an evil dude indeed.

92
00:05:05,818 --> 00:05:07,519
I didn't.

93
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,879
Did you?

94
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:11,839
I didn't.

I don't really wear
high heels before this.

100
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:51,478
And, this dress is too long.

101
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,399
It's easy for people to step on it.

102
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:56,959
Xiaoxiao,

103
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:58,319
since she feels uncomfortable,

104
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:00,138
let her dress normally.

105
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:00,898
Mr. Xiao,

106
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,257
this is one of the highlights
of our event.

107
00:06:03,258 --> 00:06:04,458
We must make Goddess Lanyao

108
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,857
appear as the top goddess
of the video game industry.

109
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:07,778
This can

110
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,698
also serve as our marketing stunt.

111
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,098
Besides that,

112
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:12,138
Mr. Lin was the one

113
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,558
who selected this dress
out of the three.

114
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:19,079
Mr. Lin selected this personally?

115
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:21,879
Alright, then.

116
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:24,678
Alright. I'll head there now.

117
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,879
Mr. Xiao, I'll resume my work first.

118
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:27,959
Go now.

119
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:32,177
You're still wearing it

120
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:33,238
when you feel uncomfortable.

121
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,798
You won't be able to catch up to me

122
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:38,678
even if you extend your legs.

123
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:40,558
Boss.

124
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:46,038
Wow, Boss.

125
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:48,319
I never expected

126
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,238
to see you

127
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:53,199
looking like a goddess.

128
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,138
Where's the one
I told you to prepare for me?

129
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,158
This one.

130
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:03,959
Alright. You may head back.

131
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,257
Stop taking pictures of me.

132
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:09,218
You have plenty of
restoration work to do.

133
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,399
You have to complete them by today.
Go back now.

134
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:15,959
You're so beautiful.

135
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:24,177
This is the original
surveillance camera footage.

136
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,778
We already tried our best to restore it.

137
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,218
But it's still blurry.

138
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:28,238
What should we do?

139
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,737
Just leave it to my brother.

140
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:33,358
I'm sure he can handle it.

141
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:41,257
Brother.

142
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:41,817
You're here.

143
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:43,038
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

144
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:44,639
Mr. Lin, I'll return to work.

145
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:50,519
You look great in this blue dress.

146
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,497
Mr. Lin, you do have great taste indeed.

147
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:56,417
It's just that this dress is too long

148
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:58,238
and my high heels are too high.

149
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,978
Sorry about that. I was negligent.

150
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,038
Brother,

151
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:04,358
you should stop finding excuses
for her short legs.

152
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:05,439
You!

153
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:07,038
By the way, Brother,

154
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:08,338
we suspect

155
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:10,218
that the virus was related
to a person clad in black.

156
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:11,617
This is the surveillance camera footage

157
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:12,937
of our company.

158
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:14,279
Please investigate it for us.

159
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:18,257
Mr. Lin, we had trouble
identifying the culprit

160
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:19,297
due to the low resolution.

161
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,098
You might have to find someone
to process it before handling it.

162
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:23,018
No problem.

163
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,639
I'll tell the Tech Department
to handle it.

164
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:25,817
And,

165
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:27,598
please don't blame me
for being long-winded.

166
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:29,138
This file is very important

167
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:30,639
as we only have one copy of it.

168
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:33,798
You do know your position well, huh?

169
00:08:36,258 --> 00:08:37,418
If we, the second party,

170
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,698
are as frugal with our words
as the first party,

171
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:42,239
we might starve to death, you know?

172
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:44,038
Don't worry.

173
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,399
I'll handle it.

174
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:47,698
Are you okay?

175
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:50,438
Why has the host fallen unconscious?

176
00:08:56,378 --> 00:08:57,938
I suppose

177
00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:00,479
the press conference will begin soon.

178
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:02,678
Is everything ready on your side?

179
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,639
Everything is proceeding
according to plan.

180
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:08,999
If there's no accident,

181
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:11,759
the press conference will
definitely be jeopardized.

182
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,999
How could you treat Xiao Ran like this?

183
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,438
We watched over him
as he grew up, you know?

184
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:23,999
We have a bond.

185
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,239
Speak for yourself.

186
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:32,678
Understood.

187
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,078
The fastest host we could hire
would only arrive in 40 minutes.

188
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:48,639
Brother, you should do it.

189
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:51,418
This is the job of a host.

190
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,978
We can't just let a random person do it.

191
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:55,578
Mr. Lin

192
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:57,497
was once the rising star
of the MC industry.

193
00:09:57,498 --> 00:10:00,240
He was the winner
of the MC Cup three times in a row.

194
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,698
You shouldn't bring up
the affairs of the past.

195
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:04,239
It's been so many years since then.

196
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,578
Brother, I trust you.

197
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:08,879
You can do this.

198
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:13,759
Even if I can,

199
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:15,599
I have to follow the script.

200
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:17,838
I can't possibly go off-script now.

201
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:22,017
No problem.

202
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:23,198
It's my turn to shine.

203
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:25,178
Get me a laptop.

204
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:26,279
Alright.

205
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:55,058
Initially, I wanted to cheat

206
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,918
so that I could show off on the stage.

207
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:58,818
I never expected to be caught this soon.

208
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:00,458
But for the sake of our sponsors,

209
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,137
I'm willing to embarrass myself.

210
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:04,399
You better jot this down
as my contribution.

211
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:23,017
You uploaded your script

212
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:24,338
onto your lens, huh?

213
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:29,399
If you put them on before heading to the stage,
you can read them directly.

214
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:34,058
Mainly, it's because
my script is too long.

215
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,897
I've never delivered such a long speech
on a stage before.

216
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,639
I'm afraid I might commit some errors.

217
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:40,759
I'm doing it for the sake of our game.

218
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:43,818
This is practically
a godsend for all cheaters.

219
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:44,777
If I must say,

220
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:47,038
you should develop this market directly.

221
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:49,599
Maybe you'll earn more
than developing video games.

222
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:52,838
There are certain things
a gentleman will do and will not do.

223
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:55,098
I would never make money

224
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:57,000
by exploiting people
like those heartless merchants.

225
00:11:57,858 --> 00:11:59,698
Send an e-copy of my script to me.

226
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:00,298
Alright.

227
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,137
No need for that.

228
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,279
I know what to do.

229
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:12,418
Let's get ready.

230
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:13,399
Alright.

231
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:15,838
Mr. Lin, put this on.

232
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,520
(Metaverse of Love
Game Press Conference)

233
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:43,058
Everyone, welcome

234
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,698
to the press conference

235
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:48,137
of Metaverse of Love,
a highly innovative game.

236
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:51,218
Shanhai Group has always
prioritized innovation.

237
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:53,017
With a focus on high-level concepts...

238
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:55,200
This is what a launch event
should look like.

239
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,777
We hired the famous game developer,

240
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:57,897
Lanyao Team.

241
00:12:57,898 --> 00:12:59,857
Upon reaching a consensus,

242
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:00,737
we've decided

243
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,078
to invest in the game
that's developed by them.

244
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:07,038
After four years of adjustment
and optimization,

245
00:13:07,258 --> 00:13:10,458
Metaverse of Love, a game that will lead
the video game industry,

246
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,038
has been born.

247
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:15,377
This game has addressed the shortcomings
of traditional video games.

248
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,017
Thank you. I forgot about it.

249
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:19,418
Both the settings and equipment
have been upgraded.

250
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:21,040
I just don't want you
to mess up our image.

251
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,137
No matter when and where you are,

252
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:24,897
as long as you put on
the Metaverse of Love's goggles,

253
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,098
you can interact with other players.

254
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,777
Next, let's welcome our CEO,

255
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:31,798
Mr. Xiao Ran.

256
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:38,377
Xiao Ran!

257
00:13:38,378 --> 00:13:40,318
It's been so many years.

258
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:42,719
I never expected him to grow this much.

259
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:45,520
Seems like the old man's
strategy of hastening his growth

260
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,038
did work out in the end.

261
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:51,360
Mr. Lin has already given us
the perfect description.

262
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
- (Aren't they overreacting?)
- I won't waste your time.

263
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,639
Let's proceed to the concept video.

264
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:37,857
Alright.

265
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:38,857
Next, let's welcome

266
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,537
the heart and soul of our video game,

267
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:42,798
Ms. Song Lingling, to the stage.

268
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:59,639
This dress...

269
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:02,657
Next up is the media's Q&A session.

270
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:04,198
Sky blue, huh?

271
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,377
Hello, host.

272
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:06,698
I'm from Huaxin Daily.

273
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,257
I have a question for Goddess Lanyao.

274
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:10,240
Regarding the video game
that will be launched today,

275
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,137
no matter if it's the concept,
the way the game works,

276
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:13,377
including the hardware and so on...

277
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:15,999
I might have to stay here
for a few more days this time around.

278
00:15:16,258 --> 00:15:17,838
Cancel the flight tonight.

279
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:19,519
Miss,

280
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:22,038
we were going to return to the U.S.
after today.

281
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:24,218
Should we follow Master's plan?

282
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:26,480
We can devise a new plan
and come back again next month.

283
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:28,377
It'll be too late by then.

284
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:29,737
I said, cancel the flight ticket.

285
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:31,257
Goddess Lanyao, can you please

286
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:33,318
tell us about
the background of the video game?

287
00:15:34,538 --> 00:15:35,578
Tell us.

288
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,279
I also wish to know
the story behind our video game.

289
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:44,198
Alright, then.

290
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:46,298
If so, let me introduce

291
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:48,519
the background story of our video game.

292
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:51,438
I'm also doing it
for our video game's sake.

293
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,479
When I was young,

294
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,158
(my parents often argued.)

295
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,017
(Whenever they argue,)

296
00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:02,719
(I would cover my ears
and hide under the table.)

297
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:05,978
(I would console myself and tell myself)

298
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:07,399
(not to be scared.)

299
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:11,359
(After that, my brother found out
about my secret.)

300
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:20,558
(By keeping me company, my brother
provided me with a sense of security.)

301
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:22,698
(That moment of happiness)

302
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:24,838
(became the most important memory
of my life.)

303
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:31,818
(After that,)

304
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:34,777
(my brother got himself
a second-hand laptop as a reward)

305
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:37,639
(for his excellent grades.)

306
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:40,178
(That became the happiest world)

307
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:42,038
(my brother and I could enter.)

308
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:51,338
Before this, he was
an unbeatable champion

309
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:54,158
in Glory of Love.

310
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:56,239
But after that, he...

311
00:16:57,258 --> 00:16:58,639
He...

312
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:01,879
He stopped playing the game.

313
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:05,598
Suddenly, one day,

314
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,537
I saw on the news

315
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:10,638
that the company that developed
the game went bankrupt.

316
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,097
The game server was shut down.

317
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,878
His record

318
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:17,439
was sealed within that system forever.

319
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,719
In a way,

320
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:28,759
I designed this game for my brother.

321
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,418
So, are you saying

322
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:34,560
that the data of Metaverse of Love

323
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,138
came from Glory of Love, a game
that was developed over ten years ago,

324
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,418
instead of your data,

325
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,439
which you stated in
the press conference.

326
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,378
If so, can we see it
as a form of plagiarism

327
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:46,658
or thievery?

328
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:48,458
The data from Glory of Love

329
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:49,737
has no contribution

330
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:51,257
to our current game.

331
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:53,737
I just included it to fulfill my wish.

332
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,120
Everyone, don't let her mislead you
with her words.

333
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,418
I received a piece of news
from a reliable source too.

334
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:00,378
A huge bug appeared in the game

335
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,017
during their alpha testing,

336
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:03,777
causing the game to freeze

337
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,439
even until now.

338
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,638
Is that true?

339
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,598
Who leaked the news to you?

340
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:15,838
It's illegal to procure
confidential business information.

341
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,598
As for the bug,

342
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:20,318
it was just a minor hiccup.

343
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:23,118
As investors,

344
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:25,159
we believe that Lanyao

345
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:27,199
can fix the bug easily.

346
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:35,878

00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:32,297
Mr. Xiao.

368
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:33,458
During your cooperation

369
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:35,178
with Goddess Lanyao,

370
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:36,497
is there anything special

371
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:37,998
that you'd like to share with us?

372
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,590
♪Compromising while lying to my heart♪

373
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,798
(Lanyao is quite special.)

374
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:45,759
(She'll turn into Xing Tian
when she falls asleep.)

375
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:49,598
(And, I'm the only person
who can turn her to normal.)

376
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:52,439
(There's one more thing.)

377
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:56,159
(I found out about how beautiful
she looked today.)

378
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,726
♪Pretending to be funny
with no pride at all♪

379
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:06,233
♪So that you won't feel guilty♪

380
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:25,878
What should I reward her with?

381
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:28,279
Mr. Xiao, what did you say?

382
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,479
Sorry, I didn't hear you just now.

383
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:32,218
The special thing is that she's special.

384
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:33,558
Next question.

385
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,017
Are you sure Lin Qiao is at the lounge?

386
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:37,817
That's right.

387
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:38,378
Mr. Xiao.

388
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:40,257
Mr. Xiao!

389
00:20:40,258 --> 00:20:41,537
Please give me a few more minutes!

390
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:43,017
I have one last question!

391
00:20:43,018 --> 00:20:43,658
Sorry.

392
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,618
I'm in a rush today.

393
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,919
You guys can arrange an appointment
with my assistant. Sorry.

394
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:48,519
Mr. Xiao!

395
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,038
Here's our chance.

396
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,159
Is the interview over?

397
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,358
That's right.

398
00:20:57,818 --> 00:21:00,038
All of their questions were repetitive.

399
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,719
There was no need to answer them again.

400
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:05,279
Where are you going?

401
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,398
Dear Party A,

402
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:11,218
Party B wishes to use the restroom.

403
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,398
Is that okay with you?

404
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,038
I have to monitor you.

405
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:22,999
You can sprain your ankle
for all I care.

406
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:24,519
But what if you hurt your hand again

407
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:26,838
and delay the launch of our video game

408
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:27,959
again?

409
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:30,497
You're truly calculative, aren't you?

410
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,479
Don't worry.

411
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:46,439
Who's there?

412
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,240
(Lin Qiao)

413
00:22:01,298 --> 00:22:04,519
Lin Qiao, I knew
you still cared about me.

414
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:11,318
Send me your location.

415
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:01,519
Xiangyu, why did you deceive me again?

416
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:03,798
It's not like this is our first meeting.

417
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:05,959
Look at you.

418
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,118
You're so mischievous.

419
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:11,959
Look at you.

420
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:13,959
What exactly is on your mind?

421
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:17,279
You.

422
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,378
Why did Mr. Lin

423
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:22,777
leave in a hurry?

424
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:24,598
He even told you
to relay his message to me?

425
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:25,898
Why would he do so

426
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:27,398
if he wasn't in a rush?

427
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:38,638
Mr. Xiao, thank you
for opening the door for me again.

428
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:40,978
Next time, walk faster

429
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:42,358
and open the door for me.

430
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,057
Mr. Xiao,

431
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:46,418
I've lost count of how many times

432
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:47,737
you mocked me for my short legs.

433
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:50,017
If you keep this up,
I'll be in a bad mood.

434
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:51,097
If I'm in a bad mood,

435
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,858
I won't be able to work.

436
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:55,279
If so, what should we do
about the bug, then?

437
00:23:58,538 --> 00:23:59,759
Get in the car.

438
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:05,519
This guy is unpredictable indeed.

439
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:12,178
Mr. Xiao, it's rare for you
to be in the mood

440
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,519
to treat the hardworking
Party B to a meal.

441
00:24:14,778 --> 00:24:17,698
Shouldn't you invite everyone there?

442
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:19,838
Don't you think
it's inappropriate for us

443
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:21,358
to go for a meal without them?

444
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:24,297
We can talk about them

445
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:25,719
next time.

446
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:27,057
What about this?

447
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:28,398
This meal is on me.

448
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:30,337
Are you sure?

449
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:31,878
Of course.

450
00:24:32,578 --> 00:24:34,698
Mr. Xiao, I have to lick your boots.

451
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,919
Please take care of me in the future.

452
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:38,398
I was asking you

453
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:40,679
if you were sure
that you could afford the meal.

454
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:43,138
Since it's my treat,

455
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:45,078
of course I'll choose the venue.

456
00:24:45,498 --> 00:24:46,858
I cannot afford

457
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,619
the restaurant you choose.

458
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,240
(Shangshui Street Street Food Stalls)

459
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:58,719
Are you sure you want to eat here?

460
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:00,978
It may look lowly,

461
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:02,777
but the food here is delicious.

462
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:04,138
I often ate here

463
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:05,698
when I worked overtime.

464
00:25:05,699 --> 00:25:08,618
The food here is just as good
as the Michelin-starred restaurants'.

465
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:11,138
Most importantly,
the price is reasonable.

466
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:13,038
They don't exploit you.

467
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,458
Are you Ms. Shen?

468
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:25,218
That's right.

469
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:27,497
Your room is ready.

470
00:25:27,498 --> 00:25:28,719
Over here, please.

471
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:33,658
We're already here.

472
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,178
Just give it a try.

473
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:36,638
Come on.

474
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:37,537
Madam.

475
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:38,898
Young girl, long time no see.

476
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:40,159
Looks like you're free today.

477
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:42,618
It's so crowded here.
Business is booming as usual, huh?

478
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:43,257
Yeah.

479
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:45,378
They'll finish their meal soon.
You can take your own drinks.

480
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:46,439
Okay.

481
00:25:48,498 --> 00:25:50,698
Lin Qiao, let's drink today.

482
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:52,719
I want to drink until I drop today.

483
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:55,398
Since when were you this lazy?

484
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,097
I still missed the days

485
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:01,479
when you called me Big Brother Lin Qiao.

486
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,817
That was so long ago.

487
00:26:05,818 --> 00:26:07,759
Don't you think it sounds old?

488
00:26:08,939 --> 00:26:11,679
Xiangyu, you know this too.

489
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:14,959
I always treated you
as my dearest younger sister.

490
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:17,398
Who wants to be your younger sister?

491
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:20,038
I want to be your girlfriend.

492
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:22,898
If you keep this up...

493
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:25,679
You should seize the moment.
It might not come again.

494
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:26,858
Lin Qiao,

495
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,439
if you miss out on me,

496
00:26:28,578 --> 00:26:29,777
you might never encounter

497
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:31,817
someone else who treats you this nicely.

498
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:33,838
You're still
as confident as always, huh?

499
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:36,598
- How would you know that?
- I just know it.

500
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:38,938
I've already confessed
to you many times.

501
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:41,558
When will you accept me?

502
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,458
Are these sanitized?

503
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:50,838
Yeah.

504
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:53,398
What about the table?

505
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,279
Is it unsanitary?

506
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:03,978
Mr. Xiao,

507
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:06,558
you shouldn't be this strict.

508
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,497
Although this place might look crude,

509
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:10,577
I promise

510
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:12,257
this place is sanitary.

511
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:15,798
And, I promise that the ingredients
are fresh and the food is delicious.

512
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:17,719
Just sit here.

513
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,838
We've been sitting for some time.

514
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,558
No one served us water.

515
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:26,938
The service here is terrible.

516
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:29,017
Please have some common sense.

517
00:27:29,018 --> 00:27:31,297
Look at how busy they are.

518
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:33,057
They have no time for us.

519
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:34,057
Besides,

520
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:36,798
we can do that ourselves.

521
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:49,638
Pour me a cup.

522
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:51,978
You do take me as a waitress, huh?

523
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:53,898
Since there's no waiter here,

524
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:56,679
I'll leave the task to you.

525
00:27:58,578 --> 00:27:59,798
What? Are you unhappy to do so?

526
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:03,598
Of course not.

527
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:10,558
Please enjoy your meal.

528
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:18,318
I never expected this
to still be your favorite meal

529
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:20,798
even after this many years.

530
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,239
That's not the only habit
I haven't changed. There's you too.

531
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:28,777
When we were young,

532
00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:31,118
Ran and I were terrified

533
00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:33,479
when we first
had this together with you.

534
00:28:34,098 --> 00:28:35,898
So, you were terrified of this as well?

535
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:38,458
I only remember that Xiao Ran cried.

536
00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:40,418
You were consoling him
with a calm demeanor.

537
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,297
You caused him

538
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:42,458
to be terrified of octopus

539
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:44,279
even until now.

540
00:28:45,018 --> 00:28:46,759
He's still terrified of octopus?

541
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:51,358
I wonder how he'll react
when he sees an octopus.

542
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:54,999
Here are your dishes.

543
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:56,919
The best dish has arrived.

544
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,737
This is the best octopus dish
in the world.

545
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,858
Try it. All of these ingredients
were freshly caught.

546
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:03,118
They're fresh.

547
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:05,279
I think I had too much for lunch.

548
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:06,719
You should eat first.

549
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:09,418
You don't like octopus, huh?

550
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:11,439
That's not it. I love them.

551
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,017
Are you shy?

552
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,598
Come, let me serve you.

553
00:29:15,939 --> 00:29:17,038
No need for that.

554
00:29:20,538 --> 00:29:21,257
I feel sick.

555
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:22,759
I need to use the restroom.

556
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,919
Of all the things,
why did she have to choose octopus?

557
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:33,337
What if she finds out

558
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,398
that I'm terrified of octopus?

559
00:29:36,338 --> 00:29:37,638
What should I do?

560
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:39,537
What will you do

561
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:41,218
if someone wants you to eat something

562
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:42,178
that you don't like?

563
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,817
Just tell her directly

564
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:45,577
and order something you like.

565
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:47,737
What if you don't want her
to know that you don't like it?

566
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:48,497
Mr. Xiao,

567
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:50,577
eating is
the most important thing in life.

568
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:51,658
You mustn't compromise.

569
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:52,938
Why don't I break the news to her?

570
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:53,959
No need for that.

571
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:56,558
I'm just asking you whether
or not you have an alternate solution.

572
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:57,618
Just pretend to be drunk.

573
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:00,118
You can skip it
when you pretend to be drunk.

574
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:03,318
Mr. Xiao, what exactly did she order?

575
00:30:04,258 --> 00:30:05,759
Octopus!

576
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:18,719
You finished everything?

577
00:30:18,738 --> 00:30:20,057
You do have a great appetite.

578
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:21,719
Let's go and have something else.

579
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:23,138
That's not it.

580
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:25,679
You didn't eat much just now.
I order a new set for you.

581
00:30:27,018 --> 00:30:28,719
Octopus again?

582
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,118
Order some liquor for me.

583
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:54,118
Now,

584
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:56,959
I'm going to eat some octopus.

585
00:30:58,338 --> 00:30:59,959
It's just an octopus.

586
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:02,919
Do you need to
go through all of that trouble?

587
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:20,078
I feel giddy.

588
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:27,558
He's drunk already?

589
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,479
He can't hold his liquor well at all.

590
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:34,658
Mr. Xiao.

591
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,159
Your phone is ringing.

592
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:38,239
Mr. Xiao, wake up.

593
00:31:46,258 --> 00:31:46,978
Mr. Xiao.

594
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:47,978
I found a solution

595
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:49,497
that can help you
avoid the octopus dish.

596
00:31:49,498 --> 00:31:50,838
Big Ding,

597
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:54,519
so, your boss doesn't like octopus?

598
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,038
Lanyao,

599
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:58,097
you're with him, right?

600
00:31:58,098 --> 00:31:59,057
You should save him.

601
00:31:59,058 --> 00:32:00,577
Someone is forcing him to eat octopus.

602
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:02,838
He's terrified of it since young.

603
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:05,817
Alright.

604
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:07,118
I got it.

605
00:32:11,818 --> 00:32:13,458
He's trying so hard

606
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:14,919
just to conquer his fear, huh?

607
00:32:28,338 --> 00:32:29,577
Mr. Xiao.

608
00:32:29,578 --> 00:32:30,737
Wake up.

609
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:31,337
We're done here.

610
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:32,658
Let's go.

611
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,178
Mr. Xiao?

612
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:34,519
Wake up.

613
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:36,038
