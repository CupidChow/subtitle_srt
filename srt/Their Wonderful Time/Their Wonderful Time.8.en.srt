29
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,211
Mr. Xiao

30
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:51,792
did a great job
at decorating your backyard, huh?

31
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,551
He even prepared flowers too.

32
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,551
Ms. Qi prepared them.

33
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:02,011
Since it's the celebratory banquet
for the game launch event,

34
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:03,371
I thought it should be lively.

35
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:04,952
That's why I invited them here.

36
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:05,811
What do you think?

37
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:06,872
Are you surprised?

38
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,632
I am.

39
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:10,151
I'm so surprised.

40
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:13,450
I just don't know if we have enough food

41
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:14,591
for everyone here.

42
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:16,591
So many of us are here today.

43
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:17,792
What should we do?

44
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:20,431
You guys have arrived already?

45
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:23,730
Don't worry. I, Big Ding, is here.

46
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,530
I won't let you guys starve.

47
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:27,352
I'll go and prepare some food later.

48
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:28,091
Yeah.

49
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:29,352
I can help him out too.

50
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:32,352
You guys can go ahead.

51
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,290
Let's begin the party!

52
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,672
Let's have some fun!

53
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:44,591
(Did I do the wrong thing?)

54
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:47,871
(After all, David and the rest
did that because of me.)

55
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:50,512
(I might be able
to hide this from them for now,)

56
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:52,792
(but I can't hide it from them forever.)

57
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,651
(If Ran finds out,)

58
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:56,450
(I'm afraid)

59
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:58,472
(he'll think that
I'm an irresponsible brother.)

60
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:05,751
I think he'll ignore me forever.

61
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:08,551
I'm sure he thinks

62
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:13,831
that I made you do it.

63
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:15,730
Initially, I wanted to use this virus

64
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:17,952
to help Lin Qiao gain control
over the game project.

65
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:20,130
I never expected it

66
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:21,632
to cause such a huge mess.

67
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,232
Although you had kind intentions,

68
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:25,591
you're indeed harming

69
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,031
Lin Qiao by doing so.

70
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:30,311
Since I committed the deed,

71
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,792
I'll receive judgment for it.

72
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,751
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,232
I shouldn't have implicated you.

74
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:44,031
I did it of my own accord.

75
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,192
I should drink.

76
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:51,431
I won't be upset

77
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:54,271
once I get drunk.

78
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:04,211
The pizza is ready.

79
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:05,611
Hurry!

80
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,250
Put it over here.

81
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:07,112
Over here.

82
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:24,450
A celebratory banquet
should be lively indeed.

83
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:25,250
Look.

84
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:26,832
They're having so much fun.

85
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:27,991
Mr. Xiao,

86
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,672
thank you for your hospitality.

87
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:34,090
What's wrong?

88
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,191
Are you upset?

89
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:38,592
No.

90
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:40,731
If so,

91
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:42,191
what's with your expression?

92
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,210
Have I done something wrong?

93
00:04:44,211 --> 00:04:45,472
You did great.

94
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,592
You did a great job.

95
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:47,991
Enjoy yourself.

96
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,551
Candlesticks?

97
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:58,391
Delicious food?

98
00:04:58,412 --> 00:04:59,712
Fine liquor?

99
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:01,792
And a beautiful view as well?

100
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:04,250
This isn't a gathering!

101
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:07,751
It's a candlelit dinner
meant for Boss and a certain person!

102
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:09,450
Do I look like someone

103
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:11,631
who'll prepare a candlelit dinner
for someone else?

104
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:14,450
Hi.

105
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:15,431
Lingling.

106
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,551
I think you shouldn't have
invited us here today.

107
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:20,991
But why?

108
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:24,871
Don't you think these decorations

109
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:27,511
look like something

110
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:30,071
Xiao Ran prepared for a certain person?

111
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:32,071
Is that so?

112
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:34,440
Just now, Yunfei told me
that there was a gathering here.

113
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,291
I didn't believe him.

114
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:36,511
Seems like he wasn't lying.

115
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:37,751
Brother.

116
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,450
Lanyao is resourceful indeed.

117
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:42,672
She actually invited all of you here.

118
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:45,311
Nangong Yu told me to keep him company.

119
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:48,240
I'm looking for you
to discuss other affairs.

120
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
Coincidentally, you guys
are having a gathering here.

121
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:52,411
But why didn't you notify me

122
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:53,832
about the celebratory banquet?

123
00:05:57,571 --> 00:05:59,171
Don't tell me

124
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:00,171
this is a candlelit dinner

125
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:01,551
you prepared for a certain person?

126
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:05,511
I held it on a whim.

127
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:08,210
But judging from the decorations,

128
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,912
it doesn't seem like it.

129
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:11,311
Brother,

130
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:12,250
since you're here,

131
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:14,592
you should give us a speech
on the company's behalf.

132
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:15,712
Come.

133
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:16,991
Mr. Lin.

134
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:19,232
Dr. Zhang.

135
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,112
Okay.

136
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:22,531
The game launch conference went well.

137
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,352
It must've been tough on you guys.

138
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:25,811
Today, I heard

139
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:26,611
that Lan Yao Studio

140
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:28,631
has fixed the bug.

141
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:31,472
That means the game
can be launched soon.

142
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,171
If so, you guys should
enjoy yourselves today. Cheers.

143
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:36,991
Come. Cheers.

144
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:40,592
There's progress in the investigation
on Uncle Chen and Uncle Li.

145
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,411
They secretly took
the company's bidding projects

146
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:44,311
and accepted kickbacks
with clear prices.

147
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,650
The bank statements and related lists

148
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:48,071
have already been specified.

149
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:50,280
If so, we should hand
the evidence to the police station

150
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,352
and let the cops handle this.

151
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:58,191
I think we shouldn't

152
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:00,991
get our company in societal issues

153
00:07:01,492 --> 00:07:03,311
to prevent unnecessary trouble
and criticism.

154
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:07,951
Why don't you

155
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:09,291
let me talk to them?

156
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,531
It's best if I can make them resign.

157
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,690
This way, we can reduce
the negative influence

158
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:14,912
to a minimum.

159
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:17,112
After all, the game
will undergo alpha testing soon.

160
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:19,631
If we get ourselves
involved in legal procedures,

161
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:21,880
I'm afraid it'll shift
public attention to the wrong issue.

162
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:23,712
Alright.

163
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:25,450
We can do what you say.

164
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:26,371
However, I don't think

165
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:28,112
they'll give up that easily.

166
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:35,672
If so,

167
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:37,672
regarding the virus,

168
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,592
what's your opinion on it?

169
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:41,832
If we look at it from this perspective,

170
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:44,631
it's highly likely they hired someone
to plant it in our game.

171
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,240
(David)

172
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:53,570
Who's calling you?

173
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:54,330
It's nothing.

174
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:55,592
It's someone unrelated.

175
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,051
You should answer it.

176
00:07:58,052 --> 00:07:59,912
What if it's an important call?

177
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,291
It's late. What do you need?

178
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:09,712
Xiangyu is drunk.

179
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,272
You should take her back.

180
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:15,032
I have something to do now. I'm busy.

181
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,311
Lin Qiao,

182
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:17,832
we've known each other for many years.

183
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:18,770
Xiangyu and I

184
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:20,511
have been defending you all this while.

185
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:22,191
It's already in the past.

186
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:23,592
I don't want to bring it up again.

187
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,751
But can you please
try to understand Xiangyu's feelings?

188
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:28,071
Although she's high and mighty usually,

189
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,272
her feelings for you

190
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:30,951
had never changed.

191
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:33,352
Although she does mess around sometimes,

192
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:35,011
it's all because

193
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,370
you treated her mediocrely

194
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:37,671
all these years.

195
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:41,592
I think

196
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:43,592
you should have a chat with her.

197
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:48,592
She's in my studio now.

198
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:50,312
You should pick her up.

199
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:06,391
You knew that I fancied you.

200
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:09,391
Why aren't you willing to
give me any responses?

201
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:12,751
Yiyi,

202
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:14,690
Dr. Zhang

203
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:16,631
was staring at you just now.

204
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,112
Listen.

205
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:21,800
I posted a picture
on my WeChat moments that day.

206
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,520
I said that the guy was my husband.
He actually got jealous, you know?

207
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:27,171
Lower your volume.

208
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:28,791
He's looking at us.

209
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,312
This is hilarious.

210
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:35,291
You should hurry
and chat with him, then.

211
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:36,952
Go and create an opportunity.

212
00:09:43,932 --> 00:09:44,771
Do you believe

213
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:45,811
that he'll come to me

214
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:47,592
in three seconds?

215
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:53,791
Must you be that accurate?

216
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:58,490
Hello.

217
00:09:58,491 --> 00:09:59,330
Dr. Zhang.

218
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,552
You guys can go ahead.

219
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:01,712
I'll head over there.

220
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:03,511
Hello.

221
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,072
Aren't you going to drink?

222
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:09,131
There are often emergencies
in the hospital.

223
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:10,991
That's why I rarely drink.

224
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:15,791
You were staring at me just now, right?

225
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:21,850
I hope that you can drink less alcohol.

226
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:24,352
It's bad for your body.

227
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:30,751
I prepared something for you.

228
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:33,472
I prepared some medicine for you.

229
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:35,850
As a live-streamer,

230
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:38,131
I know that
you have to speak all the time.

231
00:10:38,132 --> 00:10:40,232
And, you definitely stay up late.

232
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:41,970
Therefore, I prepared some

233
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:43,370
throat medicine

234
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:45,751
and medicine that can boost
your immunity.

235
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:48,352
I hope you'll remember to take them.

236
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:50,312
Take care of yourself, okay?

237
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,552
You're quite considerate, huh?

238
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:03,712
If so, why didn't you contact me

239
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,592
after our last meeting?

240
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:10,312
I was too busy.

241
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:13,192
You were busy, huh?

242
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:16,751
If so, does that mean doctors have no time
for their relationships when they're busy?

243
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,151
You can do this!

244
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,472
Lingling, you can do it!

245
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:36,112
Lingling is amazing indeed.

246
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,871
Goddess Lanyao,

247
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,690
why can't you go easy on Boss?

248
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:41,490
It's his first time playing such a game.

249
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:43,051
I already went easy on him.

250
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,151
I didn't expect him to be a total noob.

251
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:47,490
I need to use the restroom.

252
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:48,952
You guys can go ahead.

253
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:53,472
Let me join you.

254
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:54,131
Yiyi.

255
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:55,850
I knew you were the best.

256
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:57,090
But I saw some...

257
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:57,850
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,730
Let's go. Stop talking.

259
00:11:58,731 --> 00:11:59,210
Let's go.

260
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:00,051
Be careful.

261
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:00,690
Xiao,

262
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:01,751
let's play.

263
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:02,570
Boss,

264
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:03,850
you should change your character.

265
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:04,330
Use that guy.

266
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:04,970
The muscular one.

267
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:06,151
Use that fatty.

268
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:10,271
I'm sure he's strong.

269
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:11,210
Hurry.

270
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:12,312
Let's begin.

271
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,151
Lingling.

272
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:17,970
How is it?

273
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,232
Are you done?

274
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,511
She's not talking at all.

275
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,251
You can go first.

276
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:27,891
Kick him.

277
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:29,051
I'll head to the restroom.

278
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:29,370
Okay.

279
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:30,472
Hurry!

280
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:31,832
Kick him!

281
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:33,472
Kick him!

282
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:36,730
This loo is strange indeed.

283
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:37,832
Are you done?

284
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:40,472
Darling?

285
00:12:41,491 --> 00:12:42,531
What's going on?

286
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:43,751
Darling.

287
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:46,391
It's been a long time.

288
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:48,090
I missed you.

289
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:50,011
You're spouting nonsense
after getting drunk.

290
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:52,011
I'll take you to your room.
Time to sleep. Let's go.

291
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:53,232
Sleep?

292
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:56,192
It's been a long time

293
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:58,991
since I had some fun with my wife.

294
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:00,151
Darling.

295
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:01,011
Come.

296
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:02,131
This... What are you doing?

297
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:03,131
What do you mean by this?

298
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:04,720
Lingling! Can you stop messing around?

299
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,360
Stop messing around! You're making me...

300
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,112
Yiyi, what's wrong?

301
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:10,832
Who are you?

302
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,011
How dare you touch me?

303
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:13,690
Are you so drunk

304
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:14,730
that you can't recognize him?

305
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:16,511
This is Dr. Zhang.

306
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:17,730
Darling,

307
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,051
I don't care who he is.

308
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:20,911
I'll never let another man
hold your hands!

309
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:22,490
I'm going

310
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:24,511
to beat you up!

311
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:25,931
Beat him up?

312
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:27,552
What's wrong with you?

313
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:28,991
Darling.

314
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:30,232
You...

315
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,411
How dare you try to defend him?

316
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,791
This gigolo,

317
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,291
he wants to seduce you!

318
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,090
What are you saying?

319
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:36,411
You...

320
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:37,690
Listen to what you're saying.

321
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,710
- Are you done? Stop messing around.
- What's wrong?

322
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,370
Mr. Xiao, you're here.

323
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,671
I'll leave Lingling to you.
Look after her on my behalf.

324
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:47,472
Crook.

325
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:50,712
I have questions for you.

326
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:53,090
Lingling loves to act strangely

327
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:55,610
after she gets drunk.

328
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:56,690
Don't be scared.

329
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:59,570
I think she was just trying
to get into character

330
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:00,610
after designing the game.

331
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:01,570
She went berserk.

332
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:04,391
But she definitely harbors no ill will.

333
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,031
That's fine.

334
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:09,131
But I'm pretty happy

335
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:10,671
that you were defending me.

336
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:14,592
You have to learn
how to protect yourself.

337
00:14:14,652 --> 00:14:16,871
I can't protect you all the time.

338
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:26,832
What if I say

339
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,832
I want you to stay by my side?

340
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,690
As a doctor, I know

341
00:14:33,691 --> 00:14:35,991
that I don't get to take breaks often.

342
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:37,432
But I...

343
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:40,570
I'll spend all of my breaks

344
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:42,151
to keep my girlfriend company.

345
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:45,232
So...

346
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:47,631
So, are you willing to be my girlfriend?

347
00:14:58,091 --> 00:14:59,671
It's fine if you're not willing.

348
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:21,552
Raise your head and look me in the eyes.

349
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:25,472
Raise your head.

350
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:37,552
Who said I wasn't willing?

351
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:45,391
In the past,

352
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:49,592
Darling still loved me.

353
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,631
She promised me that
we would be together forever.

354
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,511
But now,

355
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:55,911
times

356
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:58,192
have changed.

357
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:02,432
Another man actually won her heart.

358
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:03,832
General,

359
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,411
I didn't expect you

360
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:07,751
to be this cultured when you're upset.

361
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:09,991
Crook,

362
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,911
stop trying to mock me.

363
00:16:13,412 --> 00:16:14,391
However,

364
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:16,712
you should do an analysis for me.

365
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:18,391
Why did Darling

366
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:20,712
have a change of heart?

367
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:23,751
Did you discover the issue here?

368
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,552
You have two wives.

369
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,552
One is in the video game

370
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,472
while the other is here.

371
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:30,911
Why do you think that's the case?

372
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:32,432
I have no idea

373
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,232
what you're talking about.

374
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,850
You only appeared in this world

375
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:39,112
through some means.

376
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:40,651
The woman in the game

377
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:41,891
is your wife.

378
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:42,811
But the woman here

379
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:44,832
is just a reference model
for your wife's character.

380
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,151
To put it bluntly,

381
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,432
you're just an NPC.

382
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:50,952
You're not a human.

383
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:53,511
You crook!

384
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,730
How dare you say that I'm inhumane?

385
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:57,631
I'm going to tear your lips apart!

386
00:16:58,012 --> 00:16:59,251
Crook, don't run!

387
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,210
Did you even listen to me?

388
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:02,490
I shall not be humiliated!

389
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,112
I will fight you to the death!

390
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,051
Crook!

391
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:08,312
Stop right there!

392
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:53,552
Let's go.

393
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:23,072
Xiao Ran.

394
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,752
Although you have a terrible temper,

395
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:28,992
you do look dashing

396
00:18:30,532 --> 00:18:32,352
when I look at you like this.

397
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:37,325
♪You are my world♪

398
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,774
♪Never leaving through all seasons♪

399
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:44,184
♪I wish I could hold you tight
in my arms♪

400
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:47,750
♪And turn into the wind to be with you♪

401
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,255
♪You are my air♪

402
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:54,769
♪I breathe you in,
yet get lost in the wind♪

403
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,179
♪I wish we could get closer♪

404
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,637
♪So you could fill my whole world♪

405
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:04,792
Was that

406
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:06,352
Xing Tian?

407
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:08,752
Or was that Song Lingling?

408
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:15,760
♪So you could fill my whole world♪

409
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:37,792
Sit closer to me.

410
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:55,272
I feel sleepy all of a sudden.

411
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:58,112
Look at the time.

412
00:19:58,411 --> 00:20:00,631
It's time to sleep.

413
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:05,592
Why don't I sleep on the sofa tonight?

414
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:07,431
It feels pretty comfortable.

415
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:14,352
Suit yourself.

416
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:29,112
(Was I drunk last night?)

417
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:31,752
(How did I end up on the bed?)

418
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:40,610
Guo.

419
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:41,410
What's wrong?

420
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,531
Hurry and help me out.

421
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:44,011
I forgot about the passcode
to my luggage.

422
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,312
Do you remember?

423
00:21:46,611 --> 00:21:48,072
Let me think.

424
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:49,930
It should...

425
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:51,051
It should be your birthday.

426
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:52,352
Give it a try.

427
00:21:55,891 --> 00:21:57,971
Of course I remember it.

428
00:21:57,972 --> 00:21:59,051
I was just finding an excuse

429
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:01,431
to call you.

430
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:03,531
This...

431
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,330
Something's off.

432
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:07,251
This bed isn't yours.

433
00:22:07,252 --> 00:22:07,850
Didn't you

434
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:08,850
sleep at home?

435
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:09,811
Where are you?

436
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:12,512
I got drunk last night.

437
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:16,711
My friend sent me
to the hotel next door.

438
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:18,011
Hotel?

439
00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:19,512
Did something happen between you?

440
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:20,850
Show me the surroundings right now!

441
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:21,992
Hurry up!

442
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:23,792
Wait.

443
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:27,112
Mom,

444
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:28,032
look.

445
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,072
No one's here.

446
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,151
No one's here.

447
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:32,890
No one's here.

448
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:34,032
I'm the only person here.

449
00:22:34,732 --> 00:22:36,011
My girl,

450
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:37,850
do you know how old you are?

451
00:22:37,851 --> 00:22:40,051
You should be concerned
about your love life.

452
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:41,072
My classmates are...

453
00:22:41,252 --> 00:22:42,352
Alright.

454
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:45,151
You see,

455
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:48,072
it was an emergency.

456
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:49,251
Sorry about that.

457
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:51,231
Are you that terrified
to show me to your mother?

458
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:53,792
No.

459
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:55,391
That's not it.

460
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,691
I was afraid that your reputation
might be damaged.

461
00:22:57,692 --> 00:22:59,951
That kick was pretty...

462
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,597
It hurt.

463
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:19,711
What's wrong with you today?

464
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:21,191
You're not talking at all.

465
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:24,151
I don't feel like talking.

466
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:27,992
Are you angry?

467
00:23:31,131 --> 00:23:31,951
That's not it.

468
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:33,151
I'm done.

469
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:00,671
Boss,

470
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:02,191
what's on your mind?

471
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:04,871
Say,

472
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:06,610
do girls who wear earrings

473
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,391
look more attractive?

474
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:10,032
Should I wear earrings?

475
00:24:10,212 --> 00:24:12,552
You usually dress yourself plainly.

476
00:24:12,611 --> 00:24:14,391
It doesn't matter
if you wear them or not.

477
00:24:17,812 --> 00:24:19,090
If so,

478
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,640
how do you think
a girl can be attractive?

479
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,840
Boss, I have something else to do.
I'll proceed with it first.

480
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,112
You can figure it out yourself.

481
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:33,752
Why didn't he explain himself to me?

482
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,832
(Why didn't she ask me about it?)

483
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:47,570
(Xing Tian shows up and causes a mess
from time to time.)

484
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,512
(This won't do.)

485
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:58,352
Dr. Xue.

486
00:24:59,772 --> 00:25:01,871
I have something to ask you.

487
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:16,792
Why are you looking for me?

488
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:19,832
The company has arranged medical
checkups for our employees.

489
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:20,992
I'm here to pick you up.

490
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,211
I'm doing fine.

491
00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:23,552
I don't need a medical checkup.

492
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:25,650
Everyone has to go for it.

493
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:28,231
But Xiong and I need to
perform alpha testing this afternoon.

494
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:30,631
We can talk about it after this.

495
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:15,130
I'll do it myself.

496
00:26:15,131 --> 00:26:16,112
Don't move.

497
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:18,592
Raise your head.

498
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,130
Yiyi,

499
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:28,072
did you lose an earring?

500
00:26:28,972 --> 00:26:30,072
Which one?

501
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:34,792
You're right.

502
00:26:35,692 --> 00:26:36,771
What a shame.

503
00:26:36,772 --> 00:26:38,272
To think that I barely put them on.

504
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:41,032
Are they special to you?

505
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:44,671
They're quite special to me.

506
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:49,832
Did your ex-boyfriend buy them for you?

507
00:26:53,052 --> 00:26:53,971
I got these earrings

508
00:26:53,972 --> 00:26:57,650
when I first won a huge prize in a mall.

509
00:26:57,651 --> 00:27:00,650
These were branded earrings
I bought at a 90% discount.

510
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,072
They're valuable to me.

511
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:04,231
I wouldn't even put them on

512
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:05,752
if it wasn't for you.

513
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:09,992
Really?

514
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:11,471
You don't say?

515
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,032
Are you happy now?

516
00:27:21,851 --> 00:27:22,711
Come here.

517
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:31,951
Hello?

518
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:33,032
Lingling.

519
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:36,330
I think I left one of my earrings
in Xiao Ran's villa last night.

520
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:37,971
Locate it for me.

521
00:27:37,972 --> 00:27:39,011
Keep it for me

522
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:40,671
once you find it.

523
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:42,671
So, it was your earring, huh?

524
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:43,871
What are you doing?

525
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:45,072
Lingling!

526
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:47,531
What's wrong?

527
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,731
Did you suspect

528
00:27:48,732 --> 00:27:51,552
that Xiao Ran was...

529
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:52,951
Not at all.

530
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:54,610
Fine.

531
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:56,090
Anyway, you should keep it for me

532
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,731
if you do find it.

533
00:27:57,732 --> 00:27:59,631
That's my lucky earring.

534
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,832
Alright. I got it.

535
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:06,312
Are you no longer angry?

536
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:09,151
Who said I was angry?

537
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:10,871
I'm not that petty.

538
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:30,151
The data shows that
everything looks normal.

539
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:32,531
According to her current physical

540
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:33,850
and mental condition,

541
00:28:33,851 --> 00:28:35,992
it's not dissociative identity disorder.

542
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:38,570
But I think the breakthrough point

543
00:28:38,571 --> 00:28:42,032
should be the VR game
that Ms. Song had mentioned.

544
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:45,251
Therefore, Mr. Xiao, please organize

545
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:47,011
the related details and information

546
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:48,531
related to the game's bug

547
00:28:48,532 --> 00:28:50,272
and send them to me later.

548
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:54,090
I'll inquire about them from my seniors
who specialize in this field.

549
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:56,090
I believe that we'll get an answer soon.

550
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:56,570
Alright.

551
00:28:56,571 --> 00:28:57,731
Thank you, Dr. Xue.

552
00:28:57,732 --> 00:29:00,431
I'll send the details to you
as soon as possible.

553
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:08,512
Song Lingling,

554
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:10,631
I heard that you were pretty strong.

555
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:12,631
Strong?

556
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:14,151
I don't think so.

557
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:16,391
Are you a fast runner, then?

558
00:29:19,452 --> 00:29:20,671
Say,

559
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,752
is there a sports competition

560
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:25,431
after the medical checkup?

561
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:27,272
I'll say this first.
