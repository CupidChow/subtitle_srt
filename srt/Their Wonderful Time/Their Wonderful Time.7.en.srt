Yes.

00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:35,800
I still feel a little bit dizzy now.

43
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,298
I hear

44
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:42,199
that you are afraid of octopuses.

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,800
I'm not.

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,400
I'm not afraid of them at all.

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,039
Have a bite of the octopus, then.

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,319
Bill, please.

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,680

Bill, please.

51
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,999
Okay.

52
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,779
He refuses to admit it

53
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,479
although he's scared.

54
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:04,858
See you next time.

55
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:06,640
(Shangshui Street Street Food Stalls）
Bye.

56
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,018
I never thought

57
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,379
that the boss of the Shanhai Group

58
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,439
would be afraid of an octopus.

59
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:17,618
I'm not afraid of it.

60
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:17,858
I...

61
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:19,999
Then let's go in and eat more octopuses.

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,738
Ms. Qi can cook better.

63
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,199
I'll eat at home.

64
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:31,800
The octopus is coming.

65
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,560
Don't run.

66
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:35,298
Look.

67
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,080
I took this photo today.

68
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,160
Are you that satisfied
with the press conference?

69
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,240
Of course.

70
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,240
After all, you looked
so handsome on stage.

71
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:47,039
Luckily, that MC fell ill.

72
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,199
How do you know about that?

73
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,360
I heard about it.

74
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:00,599
No wonder it felt strange to me.

75
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,319
You were behind it, right?

76
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,680
Xiangyu.

77
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,698
This press conference is very important

78
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:08,738
for our group.

79
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,560
It's not child's play.

80
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:12,099
If Ms. Song

81
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,919
didn't come up with a solution today,

82
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,640
I might have made a huge mistake
on stage today.

83
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,520
Ms. Song?

84
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,339
Is she the game designer, Lanyao?

85
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,840
Stop trying to change the topic.

86
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:27,738
She wore a blue gown

87
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:30,239
in the same color as mine today.

88
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,679
Did you give her the gown?

89
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:36,178
It was given by the company's sponsor.

90
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:38,559
I just picked out that gown.

91
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:40,159
But

92
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:42,840
that is your favorite sky-blue color.

93
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,479
Did you choose this color for her

94
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,579
because

95
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,178
you have feelings for her?

96
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:51,640
She's just the backbone of the game.

97
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:54,019
And it's just work

98
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,520
between us.

99
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:57,618
I'm busy enough

100
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:59,039
trying to launch the game.

101
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:01,719
I don't have time
to think about a relationship.

102
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,599
Really?

103
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,760
What about you?

104
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:08,440
Other than the MC,

105
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:10,938
did you send those reporters and media?

106
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:12,520
Of course not.

107
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,899
It was your press conference.

108
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,738
I wouldn't do anything to hurt you.

109
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,640
It was me and Ran's press conference.

110
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,440
Lin Qiao.

111
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,219
You always seem so mellow

112
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,799
and easy-going.

113
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:27,599
That's why your father
doesn't take you seriously.

114
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:39,200
Lin Qiao.

115
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,339
Actually, when you went on stage

116
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,378
and took over with the mic,

117
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:46,239
you were glowing.

118
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,320
Why didn't you continue
with the path you wanted?

119
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,459
You dislike
business administration and management.

120
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,618
You dislike finance.

121
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,559
You don't even have the ambition
to compete with Xiao Ran for power.

122
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,818
Why are you forcing yourself

123
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:00,320
to do something you dislike?

124
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,220
You studied in the art
of broadcasting and hosting, right?

125
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,800
Why are you transferred to
the business school?

126
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,840
I'm studying finance now.

127
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm not bound
by the art or science stream.

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,298
If I study hard,

129
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,219
I think I can keep up.

130
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,239
If you run into any issues,
you can come to me.

131
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,298
You better make good use of your time

132
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,440
and focus on your profession.

133
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:18,579
If you have time,

134
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,000
work more on being practical.

135
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:35,378
Lin Qiao.

136
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:36,479
Lin Qiao.

137
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:42,320
Were you thinking about something?

138
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,440
I was just thinking about my past.

139
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:53,239
It's late now.

140
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,479
Let's go back.

141
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,119
What are you doing?

142
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,840
Nothing.

143
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,178
Why do I feel like

144
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,479
you are acting strange today?

145
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,459
Is that so?

146
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,599
But I'm like this every day.

147
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,799
I don't know how to explain it.

148
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:22,119
We are here.

149
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,679
I'll go back now.

150
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,738
Just now, you said that you are too busy

151
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:30,938
to be in a relationship.

152
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:31,858
Is that true?

153
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,159
Were you lying?

154
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,839
It's true.

155
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,199
Let go.

156
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,258
Why did you come back

157
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:41,880
this time?

158
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,760
To make you mine.

159
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,419
Take good care of her.

160
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,760
Don't let her cause any trouble.

161
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:54,199
Goodnight.

162
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,400
I believe that Lin Qiao
didn't lie to me.

163
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,099
But he's wrong

164
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,819
if he thinks that everyone has no time

165
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,319
to be in a relationship.

166
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,199
Where's the barrier?

167
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,360
I tore it down.

168
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,439
Why?

169
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,880
The bed is too small.

170
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,319
You chose this small bed yourself.

171
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,898
I can ask

172
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:30,720
Uncle Xiang to change it
to a bigger one tomorrow.

173
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,880
It's okay.

174
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,079
Something is not right.

175
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,658
What's wrong with you today?

176
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,360
Why are you treating me so well?

177
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,240
First, you treated me to a meal.

178
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,319
Now, you want to change the bed for you.

179
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,339
Do you need a favor?

180
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,819
Or

181
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,919
do you need me to do some hard labor?

182
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:55,280
No.

183
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,618
I just think that the barrier

184
00:09:57,619 --> 00:10:00,000
doesn't suit the aesthetic of my room.

185
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,360
Really?

186
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,658
As your client,

187
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:09,138
I need to make sure
that you stay healthy and rest well

188
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:11,919
so that you can have
better work performance.

189
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,898
I knew it.

190
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,720
You always think about
how to make me work like a cow.

191
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,480
It's not just about work.

192
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,378
Since you treat me so well,

193
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,760
let me return the favor.

194
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,480
Give me your hand.

195
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,600
Help me put this on.

196
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,579
(Are these considered)

197
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,792
(couple bracelets?)

198
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:53,498
♪I can't find your response♪

199
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:54,919
(I think so.)

200
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:58,339
I know that you can't sleep well
at night because you are worried

201
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,819
that I'll turn into Xing Tian.

202
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,559
So, I've designed these smart bracelets.

203
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,819
Mine can sense when I'm feeling sleepy.

204
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,538
When I get sleepy,
it will instantly connect

205
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,000
and lock with yours.

206
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,280
What about when you wake up?

207
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,699
When I wake up,

208
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,760
it will unlock and separate
from yours automatically.

209
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,720
(So, she's trying to get away from me.)

210
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:18,618
By the way,

211
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:19,898
to unlock it easily,

212
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,760
I've set a passcode for it.

213
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,240
What is the passcode?

214
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:27,520
It's 110.

215
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:31,199
It's just an easy number to remember.

216
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,839
The light on this bracelet
is quite pretty.

217
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,319
There's this organism I love

218
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:45,480
called the immortal jellyfish.

219
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,880
It is my inspiration

220
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,400
for this design.

221
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,378
A type of

222
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,520
bio-luminescent organism in the ocean.

223
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,640
A little ocean spirit
that looks like an umbrella.

224
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:00,760
Super cute.

225
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,799
It can regenerate

226
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:09,319
again

227
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,880
and again.

228
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,439
Just like the game I designed.

229
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,738
The players have unlimited chances

230
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:19,959
to get revived.

231
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:24,079
But there's no second chance in life.

232
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,159
During the press conference,

233
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,480
you talked about your brother.

234
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,400
But you didn't finish your story, right?

235
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,799
He

236
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,640
is no longer in this world.

237
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:20,839
Tell me.

238
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,360
If he was alive,

239
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,600
what would he work as?

240
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,760
I think

241
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,079
he would be

242
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,640
a great game designer just like you.

243
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,839
So,

244
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,339
I created a character for him

245
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,319
in my game.

246
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:46,959
That way,

247
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,959
he can be with me forever.

248
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,159
Brother.

249
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,018
Why didn't I come across

250
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,939
the NPC that looks like your brother

251
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,000
during the alpha testing?

252
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,018
(I can't possibly tell you)

253
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,219
(that I'm the NPC)

254
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,120
(that can summon my brother.)

255
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:19,538
That's because

256
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:21,360
my brother is a hidden boss.

257
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,799
He can only be summoned
with a special command.

258
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,618
To clear the stage quickly,

259
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:28,858
I used the legendary gear you gave me

260
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:30,720
to skip this stage.

261
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,059
I can't believe you, Mr. Xiao.

262
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,538
You cheated your way through the game.

263
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:38,898
I'll tell Big Ding about it next time.

264
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:40,159
No.

It's such a pity

271
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,839
that I didn't run into you sooner.

272
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,439
But from now on,

273
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:32,120
I'll protect you forever

274
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:34,400
like your brother.

275
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,720
Don't be scared.

276
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,689

But this document is very important.

280
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,120
There's only one copy.

281
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,360
(Do you want to move the file
to the recycle bin? Yes.)

282
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:50,138
I'm going to attend a meeting
at the company.

283
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:51,559
Why are you following me?

284
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,339
I need to show some care

285
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,319
to the employees of my contractor.

286
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,360
You can ask Uncle Xiang
to drive you there.

00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:05,920
You say that I have
no general knowledge.

288
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,879
So, I'm learning from you.

289
00:17:24,499 --> 00:17:25,839
Mr. Xiao.

290

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,419
grip the bus handle tightly

295
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,098
and stand firmly.

296
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:38,079

Ran asked me to look for the person
who planted the virus in the game.

342
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:23,699
When you were cleaning up the virus,

343
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,258
did you find any clues about it?

344
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:27,179
The virus was cleverly designed.

345
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,559
I can't tell who created it.

346
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,240
Let me ask you this.

347
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,520
Is it easier for the person
who planted the virus

348
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,039
to destroy it?

349
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,058
Lin Qiao.

350
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,699
What is the meaning of that?

351
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,979
Are you suspecting David?

352
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,599
I saw him in the CCTV footage.

353
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:49,979
But I don't understand.

354
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,879
We are best friends.

355
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,960
Why did you do that?

356
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,399
I'm sorry.

357
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,778
I'm the one behind it.

358
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,000

359
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,818
Lin Qiao.

360
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,319
Don't blame him.

361
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,480
He did it for you.

362
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:14,258
I just want to help you get back

363
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:16,000
what is rightfully yours.

364
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,578
You did

365
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:20,160
so much for the game.

366
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:22,480

367
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:26,160
After I resolve
this virus issue for you,

368
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,419
everyone will change
their mind about you.

369
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,098
And you'll be in charge

370

of the game again.

371
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,839
As for Xiao Ran,

372
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,240
he's just a pampered child.

373
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,960
You've been protecting him
since you were young.

374
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,280
Now,

375
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:42,818
it's time for you
to think about yourself.

376
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:44,079
There's nothing to think.

377
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,179
He's my brother.

378
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,578
Of course I have to protect him.

379
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,840
But you've never done
what's best for you.

380
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,179
And you've never thought
about competing with him.

381
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,359
Why should I?

382
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,160
What is there to compete for?

383
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,179
It's not mine.

384
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,760
What's the point of competing for it?

385
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:00,298
If you want to live

386
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,319
under Xiao Ran's shadow forever,

387
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,079
you can betray me

388
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:06,160
and tell Xiao Ran the truth.

389
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,119
If you want to fight for yourself,

390
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:11,139
we can help you.

391
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,520
I don't need it.

392
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,359
Surprise!

393
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,359
Let me go to the bathroom to clean up.

394
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,280
Mr. Xiao.

395
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,738
Let me go with you.

396
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:56,659
It's okay.

397
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,440
You can continue with the celebration.

398
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:03,179
Xiong, you are dead.
You were the loudest just now.

399
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,839
I'm sure Mr. Xiao remembers you now.

400
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,578
I didn't fire the confetti myself.

401
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:07,939
You did it too.

402
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,379
If I'm punished for it,

403
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,879
I'll drag you down with me.

404
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,280
But you are the worst, Boss.

405
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,139
Why didn't you give us a heads-up?

406
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,578
How would I know

407
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:20,778
that you would prepare
such a huge surprise for him?

408
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,680
The surprise was for you.

409
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,379
You showed up

410
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,939
in grandeur yesterday.

411
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,720
So, we wanted to celebrate it with you.

412
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,979
What is it?

413
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,039
Xiao Ran.

414
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,039
I've found out a huge secret.

415
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,619
What secret?

416
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,179
I know who's behind

417
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,280
the game incident.

418
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,760
I can't tell you properly on the phone.
Please come and meet me.

419
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:51,160
Okay.

420
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,659
Boss.

421
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,098
Overall, the game
is running smoothly now.

422
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:57,619
We've made the adjustment on Xing Tian

423
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,399
according to your request.

424
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,778
Well done.

425
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,139
But to be safe,

426
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,179
we need to do a few more tests.

427
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,280
Okay.

428
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:07,778
Since the progress is so fast,

429
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:09,058
I'll ask Shanhai Group to make

430
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,680
an arrangement for the alpha testing.

431
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:12,960
Let's do it in three days.
What do you think?

432
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:15,939
Can you postpone it for a few more days?

433
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,179
To prevent the game
from a virus attack again,

434
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,039
I want to comb through
everything carefully.

435
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:22,920
I'll give you one more week to do that.

436
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:25,319
We have to launch the game by next week.

437
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,879
Okay.

438
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,960
I have things to do. I'll get going now.

439
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll leave you to it.

440
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:42,720
I knew that Xiao the Merciless
was angry.

441
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,720
One week

442
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,839
is too short.

443
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,859
By the way,

444
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,160
Mr. Xiao is quite considerate.

445
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,578
To celebrate the success
of the press conference yesterday,

446
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:56,359
he has prepared a surprise
for all of you.

447
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,379
What is it?

448
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,538
It's a secret.

449
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:00,139
I'll reveal it

450
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,639
once you are done with your work.

451
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,960
Boss.

452
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:07,818
At that time,

453
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:09,839
I saw them standing together.

454
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,960
So, I went to eavesdrop on them.

455
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,240
And they were talking about the game.

456
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:16,139
Although I ran into them by chance,

457
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,179
my guess is,

458
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,619
they are the culprits

459
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,920
behind this incident.

460
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:22,459
Do you have proof?

461
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:22,939
Of course.

462
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,399
I took a photo.

463
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:33,859
By the way,

464
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,098
the CCTV cameras at Lan Yao Studio
were damaged last time.

465
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,039
Go and install new ones for them.

466
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:40,018
Why me?

467
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:40,459
I trust you

468
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,799
to get the job done.

469
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,659
You should've said that earlier.
Okay. Don't worry.

470
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,879
I'm always reliable.

471
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:54,578
Brother.

472
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,419
Do you have time
to come to the company?

473
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,160
I have something important
to tell you.

474
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,639
I've found out who the culprits are.

475
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:02,359
Okay.

476
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,538
Brother.

477
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:27,639
Have a seat.

478
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:35,680
What did you find out?

479
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:37,899
I found

480
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,039
who the culprits are.

481
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,619
Although it's a little bit surprising,

482
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,098
the most important now

483
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:44,960
is how to solve the issue.

484
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:47,778
Who are they?

485
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,639
Nan Gongyu accidentally ran into them.

486
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,538
And,

487
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:51,899
he even took a photo of them.

488
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,119
Take a look.

489
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,139
They have

490
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,498
always wanted me to let their men

491
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:07,498
join the project.

492
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,960
But I rejected them.

493
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,240
So, they went to sow discord with
the person in charge of the Glory of Love,

494
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,960
telling him that his game
was plagiarized.

495
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,538
Then he pretended to be a reporter

496
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,280
to cause trouble
at the press conference.

497
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,240
If that's the case,

498
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:21,899
were they the ones

499
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,559
who planted the virus too?

500
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,640
Although we don't have
direct evidence against them yet,

501
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,399
they are our prime suspects now.

502
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:30,480
By the way,

503
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:33,818
how is it going with the CCTV footage?

504
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:35,240
Any clues?

505
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,319
Well.

506
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,839
The USB is gone.

507
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:45,480
I must have lost it
because it was too chaotic

508
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:47,039
during the press conference.

509
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:53,419
It's okay.

510
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,538
If they make another move,

511
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,200
they will give themselves away.

512
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,960
The most important thing now

513
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,018
is to check how they are
related to the company.

514
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,839
Make sure that our security is tight.

515
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,559
We can't let them lead us
by the nose again.

516
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,578
Okay.

517
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:07,680
I'll get it done.

518
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:29,160
Ms. Qi.

519
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:31,459
I want to treat someone important
to a meal tonight.

520
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,399
There won't be many people. Just two.

521
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:35,559
Bye, Boss.

522
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:36,179
Bye.

523
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,738
Bye, Boss.

524
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:37,879
Boss.

525
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:46,240
Why are you still here?

526
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:47,599
Do you want to work overtime?

527
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:50,139
Boss.

528
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,979
What is the surprise

529
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,760
that you mentioned?

530
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,399
Yes.

531
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,298
I almost forgot
if you didn't mention it.

532
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,520
Luckily, you reminded me.

533
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,018
Baby.

534
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,639
I'm here to see you.

535
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,459
Yiyi.

536
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,699
Why are you here?

537
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,619
The way you handled the press conference

538
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,939
yesterday was amazing.

539
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,058
I said that I would reward you, right?

540
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:11,319
What do you want to eat?

541
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:12,538
How about

542
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:13,738
we have

543
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:15,799
a romantic candlelight dinner together?

544
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,000
What?

545
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:19,039
Where's the candlelight dinner?

546
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,659
It has nothing to do with you.

547
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,699
If it wasn't for Xiao Ran,

548
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,498
I wouldn't install
those CCTV cameras for you

549
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:25,459
for free

550
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,659
Mr. Xiao has prepared
a celebratory feast for us.

551
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,298
Let's relax and have fun

552
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:32,200
to celebrate the success
of our press conference.

553
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:33,818
You are the best.

554
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:35,058
Then let's

555
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:36,440
drink until we drop tonight.

556
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:38,619
I'll eat back what's owed to me

557
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,799
by Xiao Ran today.

558
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,298
By the way,

559
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,139
I haven't seen Zhang Yunfei
in a long time.

560
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,760
Let me invite him along.

561
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,920
Xiong.

562
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,538
Invite Big Ding too.

563
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:49,498
Ask him to go there

564
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:50,419
after his work.

565
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,160
Okay. Leave it to me.

566
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:00,419
I'm told that our boss has prepared

567
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,039
a celebratory feast tonight.

568
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:03,599
Do you want to tag along?

569
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,379
Really?

570
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,559
Why haven't I heard about it?

571
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,079
I'm told that it's for Lan Yao Studio.

572
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,219
Goddess Lanyao has personally invited me

573
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,899
to join them.

574
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,018
I'll give you a chance.

575
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,379
Do you want to tag along?

576
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,018
No.

577
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:17,440
I'm busy.

578
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,659
I'm told

579
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,419
that Nan Gongyu will be there too.

580
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,559
Wait.

581
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,000
Are you telling the truth?

582
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,799
(Ms. Qi.)

583
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,058
(I want to treat someone important
to a meal tonight.)

584
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:43,000
(There won't be many people. Just two.)

585
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:45,379
(I'll prepare something
more luxurious, then.)

586
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,498
(Any requests for wine?)

587
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:48,599
(I'll take a red tonight.)

588
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,818
(I don't need you and Uncle Xiang's
help tonight.)

589
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:51,818
(You can go back to rest)

590
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:53,480
(after you are done
with the preparations.)

591
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,560
(May she accept
your love confession, Mr. Xiao.)

592
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:10,839
Who says I'm confessing?

593
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,200
Xiao Ran.
