=Episode 9=

29
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:12,747
Boss.

30
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,805
We are kidnappers.

31
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:23,347
Professional kidnappers.

32
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:24,565
We have to take our jobs

33
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:25,446
seriously

34
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:26,446
and be responsible.

35
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,046
Look at yourselves.
Slouching here and there.

36
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,106
Do you have no shame?

37
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:29,886
Boss,

38
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:31,645
the hostages haven't shown up yet.

39
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:33,326
Can we really trust that brat?

40
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:34,986
They are later than the time.

41
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:38,507
Trust.

42
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:40,845
He's our partner.

43
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:42,426
We have to trust him. Understand?

44
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,627
How about now?

45
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:50,986
Yes, I understand.

46
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:51,907
Understood.

47
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:53,486
Boss,

48
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:54,685
the liaison is here.

49
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:55,986
Let's go.

50
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:57,666
Boss,

51
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,347
we can't show our faces, right?

52
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:03,125
Should we prepare some gear?

53
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:04,546
That's right.

54
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:06,685
I think we should wear stockings
over our heads

55
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,386
to make us look more fierce.

56
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:10,587
Or we cover our face with a mask

57
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:12,187
to look more intimidating.

58
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:15,706
We are professional kidnappers,

59
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:18,946
so I'm well-prepared.

60
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:29,067
- Wise.
- Wise.

61
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:31,986
Stop the car!

62
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:42,946
Get out of the car!

63
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:54,469
Xiao Ran is indeed a jerk.

64
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,645
How dare he challenge us openly

65
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:58,587
and put us to shame!

66
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:02,787
He'd better not blame us.

67
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:04,326
Chen,

68
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,426
are the men you hired reliable?

69
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,845
If they screw things up,

70
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:10,546
we will be out of here.

71
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:12,886
Don't worry.

72
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:14,805
I hired a professional team.

73
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:17,746
They have handled a lot of big orders
and are experienced.

74
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:19,506
They don't make a move aimlessly.

75
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:21,267
Once they do,

76
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:24,186
they succeed.

77
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:28,227
I have asked the legal team.

78
00:04:28,326 --> 00:04:30,046
Once we get the agreement,

79
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:32,106
the shares will be ours.

80
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:33,885
They are wet behind the ears.

81
00:04:33,886 --> 00:04:36,245
Unless we give them a lesson,
they won't learn

82
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:37,746
that the older, the wiser.

83
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,027
Since they belittle us,

84
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:43,986
we might as well show them
what we are capable of.

85
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:04,147
Oh, come on.

86
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:06,506
Don't you feel tired?

87
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:08,406
You have been making noises
for so long.

88
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:10,227
Rest up already.

89
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:13,347
Mind your place.

90
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:15,286
You are a hostage now.

91
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:16,765
You have to listen to me.

92
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:17,765
Besides,

93
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:18,827
what can you know?

94
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:20,467
This is called strategy.

95
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:22,846
When the enemy is most tired,

96
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:25,267
it's easiest to succeed.

97
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,286
You won't understand

98
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:28,626
the professional knowledge.

99
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:31,325
Anyway, you are something else.

100
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:32,947
You don't look tired at all.

101
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:34,526
I told you,

102
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:36,166
I'm an exploited employee.

103
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,406
I often pull all-nighters.

104
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,205
Staying up all night

105
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:39,805
is nothing to me.

106
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,646
Besides,

107
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:42,947
you keep making noises.

108
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:44,907
I can't sleep.

109
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,626
That's what I want.

110
00:05:56,527 --> 00:05:57,606
You are tired, huh?

111
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,685
Can't open your eyes, huh?

112
00:05:58,686 --> 00:05:59,685
Want to sleep, don't you?

113
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:01,467
Just cooperate with me.

114
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,227
What do you want?

115
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:17,846
We are kidnappers.

116
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:19,805
Professional kidnappers, you know?

117
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:20,907
Give it here.

118
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:28,426
Here you go.

119
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:30,426
What's this?

120
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:31,805
Xiao Ran,

121
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:33,606
don't fall for their tricks.

122
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:34,546
Mind your own business.

123
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:35,966
Just sign this.

124
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:37,440
Once you sign, we will release you.

125
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,245
So let's not make things difficult
for each other.

126
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:40,907
We want to get our job done quickly.

127
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,325
What if I don't sign?

128
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:43,245
No?

129
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:44,626
That's fine.

130
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:45,805
We will follow

131
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,606
the orders given from above

132
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,066
to proceed with Plan B.

133
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:50,685
As for Plan B,

134
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:53,606
you will leave this place

135
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:54,707
in a vegetative state.

136
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:56,626
I have some ideas for that.

137
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:58,186
You have two options.

138
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,086
One

139
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,885
is to drown and suffocate you.

140
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:04,147
Guess what the other option is.

141
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:05,986
It's also to drown and suffocate you.

142
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,486
If that really happens, I will tie you up

143
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:11,765
and throw you into the water.

144
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,245
When your brain lacks oxygen,

145
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:15,526
I will pull you out.

146
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:18,765
By then, you won't be dead,

147
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:23,947
but you will spend the rest of your life
lying on the bed and can't move.

148
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:25,707
I will sign,

149
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:27,626
but I need to know what it is about.

150
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,120
(Share Transfer Agreement)
Here.

151
00:07:33,806 --> 00:07:35,746
Share Transfer Agreement.

152
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:37,947
Don't look at me.

153
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,286
I'm not reading it for you.

154
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,685
You need to pay extra.

155
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:43,947
But I can show it to you.

156
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:48,046
Also, don't question who is behind this.

157
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:50,587
You are only asked to sign this.

158
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,960
(Lin Qiao)

159
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:08,125
The two devious foxes have made a move.

160
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:10,160
A large sum has been transferred out
of the account.

161
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,866
You ought to be cautious.

162
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:18,365
If you have any ideas,

163
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:19,565
we can help you.

164
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,347
We already have a plan...

165
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:27,986
Mr. Xiang,

166
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:29,926
has Ran reached home?

167
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,066
Not yet.

168
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:33,085
Is he too busy at the office?

169
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:34,286
He didn't answer my call either.

170
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:36,227
What has happened? Is something wrong?

171
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:37,307
Nothing.

172
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:41,866
Is Mr. Xiao in the office?

173
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:42,646
No.

174
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,845
He went out this afternoon

175
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:45,205
and hasn't been back since.

176
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:46,605
Can you reach him?

177
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:47,965
I have been calling him,

178
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,547
but no one picks up.

179
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:51,506
Crap.

180
00:08:51,606 --> 00:08:53,146
He could be in danger.

181
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,605
What happened?

182
00:08:54,606 --> 00:08:57,440
Hurry and check the surveillance footage
from before Mr. Xiao left the office

183
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,520
to see if anything is abnormal.

184
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:58,965
All right.

185
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,006
The staff in the Tech Department
can locate Mr. Xiao's handphone.

186
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:03,506
Keep this matter confidential.

187
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,286
Do not let anyone
in the office find out,

188
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:06,725
especially Mr. Chen and Mr. Li.

189
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:07,805
Also, look into

190
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:09,445
their company cars

191
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:10,605
and send me the details.

192
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:11,046
All right.

193
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:12,227
I will get on it right away.

194
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,445
What a great plan they have.

195
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:29,325
They are impatient

196
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:30,166
in making me

197
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,445
transfer all the shares.

198
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,126
What?

199
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:33,667
Transfer all the shares?

200
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:34,746
Why?

201
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,605
What's with all the chitchat?

202
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:38,646
Is it so hard to sign?

203
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:39,406
Xiao Ran,

204
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:41,467
you mustn't fall for their tricks.

205
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:42,926
I'm not asking you to sign.

206
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:43,926
Shut up,

207
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:44,725
or I will beat you up.

208
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:45,707
Don't touch her.

209
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:50,926
Are you trying to protect her?

210
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:52,685
You'd better sign it now.

211
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:53,366
Otherwise,

212
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:55,746
I might have to do something
drastic to her.

213
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,445
Xiao Ran, I'm not afraid of them.

214
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:58,605
I won't hold you back.

215
00:09:58,606 --> 00:09:59,600
You are not afraid, huh?

216
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,325
Get a knife

217
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:01,565
and scar her face.

218
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,506
Don't touch her!

219
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:03,547
I will sign it.

220
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,406
Xiao Ran,

221
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:06,085
you mustn't compromise now.

222
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:06,965
If you sign it,

223
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:08,485
everything will be over.

224
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:10,205
The knife. Where's the knife? Hurry up.

225
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:11,205
If you dare touch her,

226
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:12,725
I will make you pay a thousand times.

227
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:13,406
Brat,

228
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:14,406
listen up.

229
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:15,685
If you don't sign,

230
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:16,605
I can keep you alive.

231
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:17,366
But her,

232
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,286
I can't.

233
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:19,886
She's just a disobedient employee.

234
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,805
There is no need to get her involved.

235
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:23,366
I said I would sign, and I mean it.

236
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:24,526
Very well. That's neat.

237
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:25,126
Xiao Ran,

238
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:26,685
you really mustn't sign that.

239
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:28,205
All the effort will be for nothing.

240
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:29,445
Gag her!

241
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:30,445
I will sign now.

242
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:31,506
Untie me.

243
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:34,746
All right.

244
00:10:35,086 --> 00:10:36,307
Untie him.

245
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:37,565
As long as you sign,

246
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:39,347
I can wash your feet.

247
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,026
Fine.

248
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:43,146
But before signing,

249
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:44,906
I have something to tell her.

250
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:47,805
You sneaky brat,

251
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:50,266
what are you up to now again?

252
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:51,626
There are three of you.

253
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:53,427
Are you so wary of me?

254
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:56,646
Fine.

255
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:57,986
Such a pain.

256
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,427
Let's go.

257
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,146
Xiao Ran,

258
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:09,366
you mustn't sign that.

259
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,587
It can cost you dear.

260
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:13,526
Do you trust me?

261
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:14,626
Of course.

262
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,187
Pretend to be sick.

263
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:18,786
Do it.

264
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,986
(I didn't ask for that.)

265
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:31,485
What did you do to her?

266
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:32,707
She has epilepsy.

267
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:33,685
She is triggered,

268
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:34,707
and her condition acts up.

269
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:35,766
Medicine.

270
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,325
There's some in my pocket. Give it to me.

271
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:38,605
Hurry.

272
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:39,085
Come on.

273
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:40,146
Give him the medicine.

274
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:43,006
- Feed her all? How many pills?
- Nonsense.

275
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:43,646
She's dying.

276
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:44,827
Give her all the pills.

277
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:49,965
I can't.

278
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:50,926
This woman is so scary.

279
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,427
What if she bites me?

280
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,126
Useless fool.

281
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:54,725
Untie me.

282
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:55,526
I will feed her.

283
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:56,485
Hurry up. Untie him.

284
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:57,547
Untie both his arms.

285
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:25,205
Have you had a problem resting recently?

286
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:27,565
I prescribed some medicine
that aids your sleeping.

287
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:28,605
Thank you, Dr. Xue.

288
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:30,006
The effect is quite strong.

289
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:31,667
Just take half a pill.

00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,766
Do you remember everything I told you?

304
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:48,827
Yes.

305
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:50,246
Try to delay them

306
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,827
as long as you can.

307
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:53,205
Understood.

308
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:55,406
Make sure this is kept
within the office.

309
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:57,406
Don't say anything
you are not supposed to.

310
00:13:57,407 --> 00:13:58,467
All right.

311
00:13:58,767 --> 00:13:59,667
Go on.

312
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:15,187
Mr. Xiao!

313
00:14:15,446 --> 00:14:16,406
Mr. Xiao!

314
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:17,046
Mr. Xiao!

315
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:17,725
Unlock the car.

316
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:19,886
Mr. Xiao!

317
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:20,166
Quick.

318
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,166
Search around over there.

319
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,046
Mr. Xiao!

320
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:23,146
Xiao Ran!

321
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:28,427
Wu.

322
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:30,485
Wu, are you all right?

323
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:31,386
Wu.

324
00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:32,926
Call the ambulance.

325
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:33,947
Send him to the hospital.

326
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:36,325
How's it going now?

327
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:37,325
Not good.

328
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:38,605
Wu, the driver, was tied up

329
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:39,565
and thrown in the trunk.

330
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:40,685
Mr. Xiao disappeared.

331
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:43,725
There's only his phone in the car.
Wu has been taken to the hospital.

332
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:44,827
Big Ding,

333
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,485
every word you say now

334
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,347
concerns Xiao Ran's safety,

335
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,886
so you must carefully tell me

336
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:51,886
the situation at the scene.

337
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:53,126
Then I can make a judgment.

338
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:54,347
This is very crucial.

339
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,246
Mr. Xiao's car is
in the middle of the road.

340
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:58,126
The ground isn't flat.

341
00:14:58,127 --> 00:14:59,246
There are trees on both sides

342
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,307
and grass everywhere in the distance.

343
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,266
Get to the point.

344
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:04,406
That's my point.

345
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:06,067
Nothing can be seen here.

346
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,205
Are there any abandoned buildings
around you?

347
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:09,587
One that could hide people?

348
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,085
No.

349
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:12,766
Take some people and search around.

350
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:14,406
Ask around
and see if there are any witnesses.

351
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:15,886
I will think of something on my side.

352
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:16,986
Wait for my news.

353
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:17,906
Mr. Lin,

354
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,067
well,

355
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,547
could something
really happen to Mr. Xiao?

356
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:23,866
No,

357
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,866
he will be back safely.

358
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:27,227
All right.

359
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:32,926
Tie him up.

360
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:34,026
Okay.

361
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:36,347
Done.

362
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:39,866
You should've done so earlier.

363
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:42,266
Jeez.

364
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:44,725
You two keep an eye on them.

365
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,160
I will hand this over to the client.

366
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,626
All right.

367
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:48,685
Remember to be professional.

368
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:49,565
Okay.

369
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:50,906
Be professional.

370
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:01,547
I'm a bit hungry.

371
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,526
I have hidden some food.
Boss didn't know that.

372
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:04,587
Let's grab some.

373
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:05,926
Don't take it off.

374
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:08,307
They might see our faces.

375
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:09,166
Come,

376
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,146
let's go outside to eat.

377
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:11,325
All right. Let's go.

378
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:12,467
Don't try to do anything silly.

379
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,947
What did you give me just now?

380
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:31,246
My medicine.

381
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:33,026
Why did you give me that?

382
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:33,986
Wait.

383
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:35,126
I took the pill

384
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,085
and pretended to be sick.

385
00:16:36,086 --> 00:16:38,067
And why did you sign that?

386
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:45,986
Well,

387
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:49,547
what should we do now?

388
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:52,386
We will wait.

389
00:16:58,846 --> 00:17:00,845
They chose a pretty remote place.

390
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:02,766
It took us some time to get here.

391
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,346
Are you sure we're in the right place?

392
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:05,245
It's windy now.

393
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:06,606
They called us here

394
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,086
to give us the agreement.

395
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:09,066
But where are they?

396
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:10,746
Sirs.

397
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:12,867
- Who are you?
- It's me.

398
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:14,086
It's me.

399
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:16,126
Why are you wearing this to meet us?

400
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:17,107
I forgot to take it off.

401
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:17,965
Sirs,

402
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:19,266
it's settled.

403
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:23,525
You guys are pretty efficient.

404
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:24,566
Of course.

405
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:25,986
We are professionals.

406
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:26,846
Sirs,

407
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,205
you see, the task is completed.

408
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:29,867
The payment...

409
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:30,965
We have already given you

410
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,627
the first payment.

411
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:34,086
The last

412
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,285
will be transferred

413
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:36,627
after the agreement is done.

414
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,366
Wait for our news

415
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:39,366
for the following plan.

416
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:40,227
All right.

417
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:43,707
Take care.

418
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:48,266
Have a nice day, sirs.

419
00:17:55,286 --> 00:17:56,525
Xiao Ran,

420
00:17:56,526 --> 00:17:57,886
don't fall asleep.

421
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,245
Shouldn't we discuss

422
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,445
how to get out of here?

423
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,685
There is no need.

424
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:03,506
I have already signed the agreement.

425
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:06,506
Just wait for them to untie us.

426
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:10,485
You signed the agreement,
and you lost your worth.

427
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:11,907
What if they come back

428
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:13,907
and kill us?

429
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:18,026
Don't worry.

430
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:18,846
The two devious foxes

431
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,506
don't have the guts to kill.

432
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:23,566
The worst they could do is
turn us into vegetables,

433
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,586
like in Plan B.

434
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:28,786
Are you afraid?

435
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,026
No.

436
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:35,907
I heard kidnappers have ways and means

437
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:39,346
to torture us.

438
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,285
Once we crack mentally,

439
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,667
they will turn us into vegetables.

440
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,947
Are you not afraid of that?

441
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:49,147
If I become a vegetable,

442
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:51,107
what will happen to my mom?

443
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:53,907
Don't worry.

444
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:55,266
I was bluffing.

445
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:57,746
I have already signed the agreement.

446
00:18:57,807 --> 00:18:59,685
Once they confirm it,

447
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:01,187
they will release us.

448
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:05,485
No wonder they asked us

449
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:07,066
to wait here.

450
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,086
You can't be serious.

451
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:12,886
Are you falling asleep

452
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,227
at a time like this?

453
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:16,467
It has been a long day.

454
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,725
Are you not tired?

455
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:19,107
I can't sleep.

456
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,586
Xiao Ran,

457
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,026
tell me honestly.

458
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:25,387
Are you afraid?

459
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:32,707
Yes,

460
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:35,546
I'm very afraid.

461
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:38,826
I'm afraid that something might happen.

462
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,066
I knew you were pretending.

463
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:45,147
Normal people would've been scared
out of their wits

464
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:47,107
seeing kidnappers.

465
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:52,586
Sorry

466
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:54,826
for being a burden.

467
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,520
Mr. Chen, Mr. Li, please wait a moment.

468
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,566
We need to verify

469
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,546
the details of the agreement.

470
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:03,886
What does she want to verify?

471
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:06,066
We follow all the rules and regulations.

472
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:09,066
Be patient.

473
00:20:09,526 --> 00:20:10,406
She is making a mountain

474
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:11,867
out of a molehill.

475
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:13,005
Chen,

476
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:14,326
why are you so impatient?

477
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:15,886
This is a serious matter.

478
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:17,947
We have to stay calm.

479
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:29,506
Mr. Chen and Mr. Li are here.

480
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:30,467
All right.

481
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:41,506
Mr. Lin.

482
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:43,245
I forgot to bring my car key.

483
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:44,627
Please get it for me.

484
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,525
Mr. Lin,

485
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:47,227
Mr. Li wants me to wait for him here.

486
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:52,005
Do you want me

487
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:53,205
to get the key myself?

488
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:54,306
No, I didn't mean that.

489
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:56,387
I'm going now.

490
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:05,806
(These two old geezers)

491
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,606
(didn't let the driver
use the company car.)

492
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:10,107
(Something must be wrong with it.)

493
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:23,886
I found a strange place.
I have sent you the location.

494
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:24,846
Send someone there now.

495
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:25,947
I will come right away.

496
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:31,245
Guys, come here.

497
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:32,187
Gather around.

498
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:35,586
Listen.

499
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:37,245
Let's go to this location.

500
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:38,086
Let's move.

501
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:38,986
Hurry.

502
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:50,045
It seems

503
00:21:50,046 --> 00:21:52,005
my body has weakened

504
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:54,506
after staying at your home these days.

505
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:57,205
I used to be able to hold on
without eating or drinking

506
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:59,746
for a whole day and night before.

507
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:03,306
But now I'm feeling dizzy.

508
00:22:04,726 --> 00:22:06,467
Don't fight the sleep.

509
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:08,685
Close your eyes and rest for a while.

510
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:10,867
We will be back very soon.

511
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:13,107
No.

512
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:14,525
What if...

513
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:16,746
What if you are in danger?

514
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:19,107
Are you that worried about me?

515
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,786
Of course I am.

516
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:28,628
I can't sleep. No, I can't sleep.

517
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:31,107
I said I would stay with you

518
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:34,187
and come up with ideas.

519
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:36,467
I also need to protect you.

520
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:40,107
Protect me?

521
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:43,746
It's more like I'm protecting you.

522
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:46,867
I told you to leave

523
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:49,427
because I didn't want you
to get involved.

524
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,346
I didn't know what would happen

525
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:55,285
or

526
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:56,907
what they wanted.

527
00:22:59,246 --> 00:23:00,907
I was worried you might get hurt.

528
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:03,586
Do you know

529
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:05,806
that you will

530
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:07,266
get me distracted?

531
00:23:13,446 --> 00:23:14,166
Song Lingling.

532
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:23,586
I like you.

533
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:26,707
What did you say?

534
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,445
♪Compromising while lying to my heart♪

535
00:23:29,446 --> 00:23:31,836
♪That's the last kindness
I can give you♪

536
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:33,427
I like you.

537
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:37,826
♪I say goodbye to you in the ruins♪

538
00:23:37,827 --> 00:23:42,485
♪You must run towards
a new world of love♪

539
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,464
♪Pretending to be funny♪

540
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,007
♪With no pride at all♪

541
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,445
♪So that you won't feel guilty♪

542
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:49,506
What?

543
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:51,306
Say it again.

544
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:52,166
Mr. Chen, Mr. Li,

545
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:54,245
please stop giving us a hard time.

546
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:56,400
We compared the signature
on this Share Transfer Agreement

547
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,366
with Mr. Xiao's previous signature,

548
00:23:58,367 --> 00:23:59,786
it doesn't match at all.

549
00:24:00,046 --> 00:24:01,725
It's different in these two parts.

550
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:03,285
The fingerprint isn't complete.

551
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:05,005
Besides, there are other smudges on it.

552
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:06,205
So, we can't

553
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:07,746
proceed with it.

554
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,079
(Party A: Xiao Ran ; Party B: Chen Shulin
Party C: Li Dong)

555
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,140
(Xiao Ran)

556
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:30,525
Well,

557
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:31,846
what should we do now?

558
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,306
What else can we do?

559
00:24:33,726 --> 00:24:36,227
Since they don't want to live,

560
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:39,107
we will grant their wish.

561
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:40,525
Are we really doing this?

562
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,245
Those guys are reckless.

563
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:43,765
What if they kill them?

564
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:45,147
What do you suggest, then?

565
00:24:45,206 --> 00:24:46,986
Let him come back sober?

566
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:50,467
That's our only choice.

567
00:24:52,046 --> 00:24:53,506
Proceed with Plan B.

568
00:24:56,986 --> 00:24:58,306
Brat,

569
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:00,886
you chose a hard way for yourself.

570
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:02,485
I gave you a chance,

571
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:03,886
but you tried to be smart.

572
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:05,406
Don't blame me now.

573
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:06,427
Take him away.

574
00:25:15,526 --> 00:25:16,086
What about

575
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:17,066
that woman?

576
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:18,725
Take her away.

577
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,227
She will die with him.

578
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:33,867
When did this woman get so strong?

579
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,266
Villains,

580
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,627
the nerve of you!

581
00:25:39,046 --> 00:25:42,586
How dare you attack me
while I'm sleeping!

582
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:45,586
As a general,

583
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:50,326
I fought countless wars

584
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:51,707
and never lost.

585
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:55,667
You did not fool me
with your petty tricks!

586
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,126
Don't you get fresh with me.

587
00:25:58,127 --> 00:25:59,245
Don't think I won't beat you

588
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:00,445
because you are a woman.

589
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:01,986
Bring it on.

590
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:04,586
Run now.

591
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:08,586
The murderer?

592
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:10,586
Why are you here?

593
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:17,965
Once I deal
with these grotesque monsters,

594
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:20,746
I will challenge you to a duel.

595
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:23,266
Boss,

596
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:26,026
is she out of her mind
because of the pill?

597
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:28,606
What should we do now?

598
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:29,826
What do you mean?

599
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:30,685
Get her.

600
00:26:30,686 --> 00:26:31,707
Come forth, my hammers!

601
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:36,646
I forgot again.

602
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:39,266
This vessel is too weak
to perform magical spells.

603
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:41,387
Run now.

604
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:43,005
You are no match for them.

605
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:44,346
Run?

606
00:26:44,726 --> 00:26:48,187
I never fled from a fight.

607
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:50,907
I didn't ask you to flee,

608
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:53,485
I want you to seek help

609
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,427
and capture all of them.

610
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:58,546
That makes sense.

611
00:26:58,647 --> 00:26:59,627
Charge!

612
00:27:07,246 --> 00:27:08,907
Is she out of her right mind?

613
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,947
She's a different person now.

614
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:11,886
Forget about her.

615
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:13,480
We have something more important here.

616
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:22,227
Why didn't the murderer come out?

617
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:25,026
Did they kill him?

618
00:27:26,286 --> 00:27:27,147
No way.

619
00:27:27,286 --> 00:27:29,227
He killed my wife.

620
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,387
I mustn't let others get ahead of me.

621
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:42,227
Why are you back here?

622
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:45,606
I want to kill the murderer of my wife

623
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:47,107
myself.

624
00:27:47,206 --> 00:27:49,926
You are not getting in my way, fools.

625
00:27:49,927 --> 00:27:50,886
Who are you calling fools?

626
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:51,867
Back off.

627
00:27:57,966 --> 00:27:58,867
Oi.

628
00:27:59,006 --> 00:27:59,986
Wake up.

629
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:02,285
You can't be killed

630
00:28:02,286 --> 00:28:03,826
by just anyone.

631
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:08,066
You can only die by my hand.

632
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,187
He's still breathing.

633
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:20,986
How dare you.

634
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,245
You are sleeping

635
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:23,765
when your enemy is in front of you.

636
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:24,907
Wake up now.

637
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:30,147
What are you doing?

638
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:41,765
Why are you back?

639
00:28:41,766 --> 00:28:45,187
We may have a deep grudge,

640
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:47,685
but that's personal.

641
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:50,026
You redeemed me
from the holding cell last time.

642
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:52,326
I didn't thank you,

643
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:53,947
but I won't forget that.

644
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:55,346
Besides,

645
00:28:55,446 --> 00:28:56,926
I only take my revenge

646
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:59,107
openly.

647
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:03,427
I won't allow anyone to get in my way.

648
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:11,026
Run now.

649
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:13,227
I'm dizzy.

650
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:15,306
I can't go far.

651
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:16,907
Dizzy?

652
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:19,467
Could it be

653
00:29:22,006 --> 00:29:23,026
the sleeping drug?

654
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:25,306
Hey.

655
00:29:25,407 --> 00:29:27,205
Are you done talking yet?

656
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:29,586
We have something important to do.

657
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:32,907
This fellow is mine.

658
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:35,406
Surrender the antidote,

659
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,685
and I will let you off.

660
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:39,366
What are you on about?

661
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:41,306
There's no antidote.

662
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:42,667
Get her!

663
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:51,707
