Xiao the Merciless!

30
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,238
Are you taking revenge on me

31
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,979
for not fixing the bug?

32
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,500
Are you done?

33
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:28,859
Yes, Mr. Xiao.

34
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:40,259
It's just a simple sanitization.

35
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,620
It's just

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,118
a simple sanitization?

37
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:44,979
You...

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,620
Why aren't you wearing this pajama?

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,998
Don't tell me

40
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:53,900
you told me to wear it

41
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,259
because you have a weird fetish?

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,558
You're just like
what the rumors had said about you.

43
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,958
Your imagination is pretty wild,

44
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,699
yet unrealistic.

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,998
Ms. Qi prepared this for you.

46
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,079
It has nothing to do with me.

47
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,998
But don't you think
this pajama is strange?

48
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:11,958
It feels like you're making fun of me.

49
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,958
Now, as Party A, I'm requesting you

50
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,678
to wear this pajama.

51
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:16,940
You cannot wear anything else.

52
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:17,759
What gives?

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,660
Because you assaulted me at night.

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,299
So, what was on your mind during daytime?

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,479
What caused you to strip
another person's clothes in your sleep?

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,238
I...

57
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,079
I'm sure I did it

58
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,780
because I wasn't used to the bed here.

59
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,359
That's right.

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,118
You know this too.

61
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,660
All women lack a sense of security.

62
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,180
So, you snore

63
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,019
to get a sense of security?

64
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,419
That's right.

65
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,859
I snore as an alarm.

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,199
Although

67
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,639
this is purely
a partner-partner relationship,

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,319
we're a man and a woman

69
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,100
living together after all.

70
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,100
I have to stay on my toes.

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,219
Of course.

72
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:26,459
That's why I came up
with a foolproof measure.

73
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,740
This?

74
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,500
And this?

75
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:45,500
Are these the foolproof
measures you mentioned?

76
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,380
Report your work progress to me

77
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:14,300
before sleep.

78
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,518
How's the progress

79
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,779
with the bug-fixing?

80
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,420
Your hand.

81
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,420
Give me your hand.

82
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,358
Hurry up.

83
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,500
I want to use the restroom. Hurry up.

84
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:26,158
We're getting late.

85
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:27,319
Pack your things.

86
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,259
We have a meeting
to attend at the studio.

87
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,439
Boss, it's just like what you predicted.

88
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,918
We found a virus

89
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,259
on the external port of the server.

90
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,278
Someone might've sabotaged us
on purpose.

91
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,319
Xiong,

92
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,398
hurry and pinpoint the exact location
of the equipment that was tampered with.

93
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,360
After that, retrieve
the surveillance camera footage.

94
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,119
It's either

95
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,259
one of the members of the studio

96
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,819
or

97
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,380
someone else snuck into the studio.

98
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,119
Alright. I'll investigate it right now.

99
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,119
Can we deal with the virus

100
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,398
by performing a full system scan

101
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,659
with the antivirus software?

102
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,620
We only found the virus
with the full system scan.

103
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,620
And, we found out

104
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,259
that even the hardware was infected.

105
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,918
So? What's the result?

106
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,500
The result is either we let it be

107
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,420
or we wipe it clean.

108
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,100
It's equivalent to a factory reset.

109
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,819
If that's the case,

110
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,940
my four years' worth of effort

111
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,459
would go down the drain.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,358
Calm down for now.

113
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,060
It's not that we have no way

114
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,899
to deal with infectious malware.

115
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,079
Do you have a solution?

116
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,319
One of my seniors

117
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,759
is an expert on computer viruses.

118
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,239
He helped resolve
some of the tougher virus issues

119
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,980
our country had encountered.

120
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,940
Should we seek his help?

121
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,219
Brother, don't tell me
you're talking about David?

122
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,960
I'm not seeing him.

123
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,760
I even fought with him
when we were still studying.

124
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,180
You still hold a grudge against him?

125
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,559
You can see him together with Lanyao.
I'll go and check on Dad.

126
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,380
Alright.

127
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,398
Xiong,

128
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,199
give Mr. Lin a copy
of the data files as well.

129
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,060
Alright.

130
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,019
Let's go.

131
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,478
Contact me in time
if you encounter any issues.

132
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:30,420
Alright.

133
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,500
- Brother, I'll head to the restroom.
- Alright.

134
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,299
What's wrong?

135
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,679
I won't be around later.

136
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,419
You mustn't fall asleep.

137
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,799
Don't worry.

138
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,598
I'll surely uphold

139
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:48,638
the virtuous values of office workers.

140
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,799
I won't sleep

141
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,340
until the virus is dealt with.

142
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,399
But Mr. Xiao,

143
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,860
you can sleep well tonight.

144
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,740
Anyway, come back earlier tonight.

145
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,380
Got it.

146
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,519
Mr. Lin.

147
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,679
Your white sportswear

148
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,039
is shining under the sun.

149
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,718
You look like an NPC.

150
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,478
Didn't you promise to be the model

151
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:36,139
of my NPC before this?

152
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,998
I was afraid that you might be busy.
That's why I'm doing this now.

153
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,159
I can be your model at any time

154
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,220
as long as you need it.

155
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,840
You don't need to take pictures of me.

156
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,439
Really?

157
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,998
Will you sit still

158
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,419
and let me finish the template?

159
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,358
You're so nice.

160
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,740
It's a promise, then.

161
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,700
You suck at photography.

162
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,399
Isn't this pretty good?

163
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,939
Alright. I'll be there immediately.

164
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,878
David has agreed to see us.

165
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,598
Let's go.

166
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,539
Okay.

167
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,838
This shouldn't be a major issue.

168
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,358
However, it's kind of complicated.

169
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,439
How long will it take for you to fix it?

170
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,740
The game concept launch event
will be held two days from now.

171
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:44,279
It'll take me at least two to three days

172
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,838
provided that I can work together

173
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,460
seamlessly with Goddess Lanyao.

174
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,980
Alright.

175
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,439
You guys should finish it
as soon as possible.

176
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,059
Leave the rest to me.

177
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:59,958
You and Ran have already
given them your guarantee.

178
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,118
At this crucial moment,

179
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,899
I mustn't allow the board of directors
to doubt you.

180
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,679
And, it's only
the game concept launch event.

181
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,319
It's not the launch

182
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,878
of the full game.

183
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,878
I believe

184
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,700
that you'll achieve it.

185
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:13,958
Alright.

186
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,539
I'll surely do my best.

187
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:17,059
You can do it.

188
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,340
You're finally here to visit me.

189
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,478
I've been too busy lately.

190
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:26,899
How's your game doing?

191
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,179
(What a stubborn man.)

192
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,958
We've located the key to fix the bug.

193
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,500
Brother is meeting David
with our game designer.

194
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,580
Xiao Ran, it's important
to always keep your guard up.

195
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,539
Dad, he's my brother.

196
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,799
He's your son too.

197
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,580
We're a family, you know?

198
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,139
Speaking of family,

199
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,600
how's your consideration?

200
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,320
Have you decided on whether you want
to marry the Shen family's daughter?

201
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,460
You mean Xiangyu and I?

202
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,238
How many times have I told you before?

203
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,860
I just treat her as my elder sister.

204
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:03,998
About that, once we return to our hometown,
your mother and I will meet her parents.

205
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,118
The marriage will be arranged

206
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,279
if there are no objections.

207
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,758
It's my marriage. I'll make my own call.

208
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,299
You think you're all grown up, huh?

209
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,939
Mr. Xiao.

210
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:12,519
Yunfei.

211
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,500
Mr. Xiao.

212
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,899
How do you feel?

213
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,419
I feel great.

214
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:18,919
It's just that someone is here

215
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,958
to make me angry.

216
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,838
I don't know

217
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,419
how long this body of mine
can withstand it.

218
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,199
Dad, please take care.

219
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,500
I love you the most.

220
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,159
What's wrong?

221
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,638
Did you not sleep well lately?

222
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,259
You look quite pale.

223
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,100
Why are you looking for me?

224
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,559
You're pretty close

225
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,358
to Goddess Lanyao lately, right?

226
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:49,419
I wish to inquire about
her best friend, Liu Yiyi.

227
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,019
I wish to know about her interests.

228
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,299
You like Liu Yiyi, huh?

229
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,539
Alright.

230
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,030
(Restoring)

231
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,980
We're finally almost done.

232
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,740
How is it?

233
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,878
How's the progress with the virus?

234
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,559
I think we can complete it before dawn.

235
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,958
Ms. Song does live up to her reputation.

236
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,480
Not only does she pick things up quickly,
but she's also very good at them.

237
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,740
That means you guys can finish it
one day before the deadline, huh?

238
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,059
Lanyao, you're amazing.

239
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,700
It's because David is a great teacher.

240
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,419
Seems like our goddess is starving.

241
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:47,659
Come. Let's have a meal together.

242
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,598
But the virus is...

243
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,799
It'll take over an hour
for the process to finish.

244
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,238
You guys shouldn't wait here.

245
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,958
You can finish it
after having your meal.

246
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:56,838
Go now.

247
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:57,838
Aren't you joining us?

248
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,039
Nope.

249
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,799
I have other jobs that I need to finish.

250
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,700
I'll use this opportunity
to finish them.

251
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,539
You guys can enjoy yourselves.

252
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:05,500
Alright.

253
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,100
We'll come back after the meal.

254
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,259
Go now.

255
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,860
Why isn't she back yet?

256
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,539
No.

257
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,838
If I call her right now,

258
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,779
she'll definitely think
that I fancy her.

259
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,779
Didn't I tell her to come back earlier?

260
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,159
Don't tell me she fell asleep?

261
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,259
What if she transforms again?

262
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,500
Don't tell me it's because
the bed is uncomfortable?

263
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,100
I'm sure that's the case.

264
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,980
It's delicious indeed.

265
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,358
We only spent 15 minutes

266
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,019
to finish all of our food.

267
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,919
This should be the fastest meal I had

268
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,159
since my birth.

269
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,799
It's because Father taught us

270
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,700
to chew our food slowly.

271
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,159
I heard

272
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,179
that you and Xiao Ran have
the same father but a different mother.

273
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,340
That's right.

274
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,899
My mother remarried into the Xiao family

275
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,380
when I was three.

276
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:04,939
If so, are you still in touch
with your biological father?

277
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,860
No.

278
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,700
Now, I only remember

279
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,179
Father, which is Mr. Xiao.

280
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,740
If so, is your relationship with him...

281
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,319
I mean...

282
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,460
I know.

283
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,580
When my mother was still around,

284
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,139
even though he didn't
speak with me much,

285
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:31,539
he smiled often.

286
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,620
But he rarely smiled

287
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,259
ever since

288
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,340
my mother had passed away.

289
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:47,059
If so, I suppose you wish
to be closer to him.

290
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,700
I guess so.

291
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,620
But he wasn't willing
to acknowledge my existence.

292
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,979
I'm working so hard

293
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,300
to preserve this family.

294
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,179
I truly hope

295
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,820
that he can acknowledge my effort.

296
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,580
Even

297
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,060
a simple phrase of acknowledgment

298
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,100
or an expression of acknowledgment

299
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,100
would make me feel

300
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,139
that everything I did for the family

301
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,739
was worth it.

302
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,158
When I was young,

303
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:35,739
my parents were also...

304
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,739
Forget it.

305
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,118
As the saying goes,

306
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,039
"People are born to suffer."

307
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,999
Since it's already tough enough
to stay alive,

308
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,198
why shouldn't we live happily

309
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,398
for our own sake when we're alive?

310
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:49,598
Just like now.

311
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,999
I invested all of my savings

312
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,719
into this game
without my family's knowledge.

313
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,780
I would've starved had you guys

314
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,780
not invested in my game.

315
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,799
However,

316
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,118
my dream will be fulfilled

317
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,139
when the game is fully online.

318
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,198
If so, I think all the hardships
I endured were worth it.

319
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,739
It'll make me happy.

320
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,158
Therefore,

321
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:13,939
I hope that you can
stop suppressing yourself.

322
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,279
You should express your love to Mr. Xiao

323
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,899
and work hard for
the sake of your happiness.

324
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,559
Alright.

325
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,659
I'll try my best to head
in that direction.

326
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,139
Let's forget about me.

327
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,020
Let's talk about my brother.

328
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,580
According to my knowledge of Ran,

329
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,899
I'm sure he's making you live with him

330
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,499
for some special reasons.

331
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,039
(Indeed.)

332
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,780
(But I can't tell you about it.)

333
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,719
Isn't it obvious?

334
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,780
He's just afraid
that I might run away from work.

335
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,020
He thinks I'm a deadbeat.

336
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,219
You're different indeed.

337
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,039
You see, Ran has female fans

338
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,300
everywhere.

339
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,438
I even heard that he's considered

340
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:15,979
a highly sought-after bachelor
in the outside world.

341
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,878
(Highly sought-after?)

342
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:21,540
(More like highly sinister.)

343
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,398
Alright. It's almost time.

344
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,939
I'll send you back to David's place.

345
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,719
Alright.

346
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,260
Time to continue my work.

347
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,300
Ms. Song, what's wrong with you?

348
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:56,759
I stayed up all night for work.

349
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,559
Uncle Xiang, I'm fine.

350
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,759
Just ignore me.

351
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,198
You haven't taken breakfast yet, right?

352
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,158
- I'll tell Ms. Qi to make you some...
- It's fine.

353
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:02,959
I've taken breakfast.

354
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,179
Please proceed with your day.

355
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,118
Okay.

356
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,239
Uncle Xiang.

357
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,020
Is Xiao Ran upstairs?

358
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:10,060
Mr. Xiao is at the company.

359
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,020
Usually, he's at the company at this hour.

360
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,540
Mr. Xiao, you're home?

361
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:18,580
Why didn't you tell me in advance
that you were back?

362
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,459
I would have no idea that you were back
if I didn't call Lin Qiao.

363
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,759
You stayed up all night.

364
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,559
Do you intend to become
a disabled person after fixing the bug?

365
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,979
Or do you intend...

366
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:38,860
Or do you intend
to transform at my house

367
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,219
and kill everyone?

368
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,519
I'm working tirelessly based upon

369
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,838
the hardworking etiquette
that Party B has to uphold.

370
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,899
You came down

371
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,780
just when I was able to call you.

372
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,739
Are you sure you want to do this?

373
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,419
I cannot work on a bed.

374
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:09,020
You can put a stool
beside the bed, then.

375
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,918
It'll make me look ugly.

376
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,780
But I can't sleep like this.

377
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,899
If so, you can report
your work progress to me.

378
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,659
Tell me about last night's process.

379
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:38,419
The launch event is nearing.

380
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,279
If we can

381
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,239
launch the game successfully,

382
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,918
no one can destabilize

383
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:47,598
Xiao Ran's position in the company.

384
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,860
There's no way to destabilize him.

385
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,158
Once the game is launched,

386
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,319
all of you will be satisfied.

387
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,279
Directors, what else
are you guys unsatisfied with?

388
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,838
It's nothing.

389
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,979
I just feel sorry for you.

390
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,079
You're very capable.

391
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,719
You're the one dealing with

392
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,239
most of the company's affairs,

393
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,999
yet you're always below Xiao Ran.

394
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,079
That's right.

395
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,559
In my opinion,

396
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,039
you're the most suitable candidate

397
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,979
to be the company's CEO.

398
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:17,120
What a shame.

399
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,640
If only you could establish a
marriage alliance with the Shen family.

400
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,620
Uncle Chen,

401
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,878
some of your statements
are quite inappropriate, don't you think?

402
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:26,678
How is that so?

403
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,079
We can help you out

404
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,239
if you have an idea.

405
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,260
We already had a plan all along.

406
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,620
However, we don't get
to decide what to do here.

407
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:38,499
It depends on Mr. Lin's call.

408
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,419
If we do receive everyone's support,

409
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:47,499
I'm sure the chairman will treasure him.

410
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,179
Xiao Ran is my brother.

411
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,358
I will support him

412
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,979
no matter what happens.

413
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,598
Directors, you two don't need

414
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,260
to worry about this.

415
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,319
Xiao Ran can definitely provide you two

416
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,380
with the things you two want.

417
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,899
However, if you two
have ulterior motives,

418
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,239
I'm afraid he won't agree to
your conditions that easily.

419
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,979
Lin Qiao.

420
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,820
- You're...
- Uncle Li.

421
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,580
Have some tea.

422
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,100
Mr. Xiao,

423
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:44,820
you're different indeed.

424
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,039
You wear suits usually.

425
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,139
Now, you're wearing sportswear
for the press conference?

426
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,340
I told Big Ding to take my suit
to the company.

427
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:58,620
Wait.

428
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,899
Are you getting in just like that?

429
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,939
Mr. Xiao, what else do you need?

430
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,139
Did you bring your phone?

431
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,139
I did.

432
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,540
And?

433
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,820
I brought my purse, keys, and cards.

434
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,340
But I can't head home now.
I can't use them.

435
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,499
Since when were you this thoughtful?

436
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:40,239
Open the door for me.

437
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,260
What?

438
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,100
I said, open the door for me.
Didn't you hear me?

439
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:55,659
Boss, please.

440
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,959
I've only seen a driver
opening the door for a passenger.

441
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,459
I've never seen the reversed before.

442
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:13,239
I'm Goddess Lanyao, you know?

443
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,198
Now, I have to
open the car door for you?

444
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:18,739
Xiao The Merciless
does show me no mercy.

445
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,020
Isn't he childish?

446
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,918
People say that men are
youngsters who never grow up.

447
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,499
Youngsters?

448
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,540
He's obviously a brat.

449
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,719
At most, I won't attend it.

450
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,620
Anyway, he better don't
deduct a single penny from my contract.

451
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,079
Uncle Xiang, Ms. Qi.

452
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,300
I'll be leaving now.

453
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:22,878
Mr. Xiao.

454
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:25,358
Do you know that
you're just like San Mao,

455
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,319
Nezha,

456
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,060
and the Calabash Brothers?

457
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,139
Me?

458
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,540
What's with...

459
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,198
What's with all the child references?

460
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:37,979
How do you explain
what you did just now, then?

461
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,519
Hello, Xiong?

462
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,760
Do you still remember
the first day of our alpha testing,

463
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,398
which was the day you were electrocuted?

464
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,079
Yeah. Back then, a man clad in black
snuck into our studio.

465
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,918
And, he also destroyed

466
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,838
all of the surveillance camera footage.

467
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,438
Luckily, I managed to restore some of it

468
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,198
with my skills.

469
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,479
I've sent it to you.

470
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,918
Do what you like with them.

471
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:00,598
Okay.

472
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,559
Great job, Xiong.

473
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,219
I'll give you a bonus next time.

474
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:13,340
Can you tell who it is?

475
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,398
Mr. Xiao,

476
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,118
he just sent the footage to me.

477
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,559
It needs to be downloaded.

478
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,380
Isn't that common sense?

479
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,878
Seems like the brat in the company
has done a lot of evil deeds.

480
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,438
If not, why would someone

481
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,260
try to sabotage the game
I worked so hard on?

482
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,139
