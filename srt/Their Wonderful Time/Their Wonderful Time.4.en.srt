Are you going to vomit?
Are you okay?

30
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,630
I'm fine.

31
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,169
I need to use the toilet.

32
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,729
Don't you want me to accompany you?

33
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,591
I'll wait for you outside, then.

34
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:01,750
Yiyi.

35
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,591
Dr. Zhang.

36
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:07,030
What a coincidence.

37
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,271
You still remember me.

38
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:12,711
I have a good memory.

39
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,311
Besides,

40
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,871
you made a deep impression on me.

41
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:23,489
She's drunk. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,711
It's okay.

43
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,591
Are you okay?

44
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:29,391
I'm fine.

45
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,111
How about I escort you out?

46
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,190
Okay. Thank you.

47
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:20,350
What's going on?

48
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,329
Finally, I've broken the seal

49
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,711
and come out from this female body.

50
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,391
This is great.

51
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,991
You...

52
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,350
Are you Xing Tian?

53
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:48,711
There's actually someone who knows me

54
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,871
in this strange world.

55
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,130
I think I'm the only one

56
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:55,470
who knows you in this world.

57
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:00,671
So, this is how it feels
to see the real-life version

58
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,769
of the character I created for my game.

59
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,750
What do you mean?

60
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,711
What happened during
the Warrior Shrine combat?

61
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,831
Be careful.

62
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,190
(This young man is so naive.)

63
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,089
(I was just playing with him.)

64
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,431
(But he took it seriously.)

65
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,150
Are you in pain?

66
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,551
I'm fine. It's not painful.

67
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:43,769
Prolonged wear of high heels

68
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,289
will put a lot of pressure
on the soles of the feet.

69
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,070
So, you'll tire them out easily.

70
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,431
It's also bad for the knee joints.

71
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,930
So,

72
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:52,690
it's better

73
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,791
to wear some comfortable shoes
in the future.

74
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,969
I've been trying to find a chance
to kill that mongrel!

75
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,231
Well said.

76
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:19,111
You are such a lightweight.

77
00:05:19,491 --> 00:05:20,209
And

78
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,690
you don't know martial arts at all.

79
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,329
I feel so trapped

80
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,551
in your body.

81
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,231
What do you think
about my combat skills?

82
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,590
Just now, you said

83
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,570
that Xiao Ran is your enemy.

84
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,111
Exactly.

85
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,070
I hold a grudge against him too.

86
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:44,510
He's cold and ruthless.

87
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:46,250
He bullies a weak woman like me.

88
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:49,070
He's despicable.

89
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:52,471
As the saying goes,

90
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:55,329
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

91
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,270
Yes.

92
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:59,390
Let's go out and have a drink.

93
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,209
You are quite interesting.

94
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,449
You are fearless

95
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,250
despite being so drunk.

96
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:07,289
It means you are
a sentimental person too.

97
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,329
I'll gladly be your friend.

98
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,950
Let's have a drink together.

99
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,710
Let's go.

100
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:34,111
Good!

101
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:01,630
My friend, it's you.

102
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:03,551
Long time no see.

103
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:09,590
Why have I returned to this body?

104
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:12,390
What do you mean?

105
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:16,111
Come. Let's have a drink together.

106
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,431
I'll take a rain check.

107
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:20,769
Drinking is an important matter.

108
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,351
We can't postpone it.

109
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,570
Let's drink together today.

110
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:24,390
Let's go.

111
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,150
I think you are pretty drunk.

112
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:27,730
How about I escort you over there?

113
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:30,431
I can hold my liquor very well.

114
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,050
But this body is too weak.

115
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:35,730
Yes. You can hold your liquor well.

116
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,240
You can hold your liquor well. Let's go.

117
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,431
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

118
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,911
(You say that you have social anxiety.)

119
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,510
(But it doesn't look like it.)

120
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,431
Yunfei.

121
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:58,031
Hurry up and come here.

122
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,671
I have to go back to them.

123
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,551
Okay. Bye.

124
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:09,911
Lingling.

125
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,209
Darling, I haven't seen you
for so many days.

126
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,671
I miss you.

127
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,089
What are you doing?
There are so many people here.

128
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,510
It's embarrassing.

129
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,089
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

130
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,431
She's drunk.

131
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,351
Thank you for sending her back.

132
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:27,431
But it requires a lot of funds.

133
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,270
Mr. Xiao.

134
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,791
Do you want to consider

135
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,511
my proposal?

136
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:36,151
It takes a lot of funds
to invest in this game.

137
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,289
It'll be good if someone

138
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,970
can share the burden with you.

139
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:40,950
What do you think?

140
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:44,289
I'll leave Ms. Song to you.

141
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,631
I have to get back to my clients.

142
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:48,311
Brother Lin, until next time.

143
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,950
Are you okay, Baby?

144
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,431
Yes. I'm feeling great.

145
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,911
I feel ecstatic

146
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:03,190
to be able to see you again.

147
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,760
I'm sorry, Ms. Chen.

148
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,080
I had something to take care of just now.
Please forgive me.

149
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,689
It's okay.

150
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,950
How's the discussion so far?

151
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,671
I had a great time with Mr. Xiao.

152
00:09:13,731 --> 00:09:15,370
Since you are interested,

153
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:16,450
we can fine-tune

154
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:17,870
the details together.

155
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:20,350
Right?

156
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,431
Yes.

157
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,370
That's good.

158
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:26,590
Cheers.

159
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,490
We haven't danced in a long time.

160
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,190
Come on. Dance with me.

161
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:41,870
Darling!

162
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:26,990
Mr. Xiao.

163
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:29,311
Mr.Lin.

164
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,350
Come. Cheers.

165
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:39,431
Why are you blocking me?

166
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:40,830
What are you doing?

167
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,391
You are...

168
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:49,689
Lingling, don't do that.

169
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,049
It's not that serious.

170
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,470
Don't stop me, Darling.

171
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:54,610
This is between two men.

172
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:55,769
We were just dancing.

173
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,271
Don't be such a party pooper.

174
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,671
How dare you talk back to me.

175
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,929
How dare you touch my wife.

176
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,870
I'll break both your arms and legs.

177
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,169
We are sorry

178
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,330
for crashing the party.

179
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:19,289
She's drunk.

180
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,470
I asked you to stay at home

181
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,511
but you chose to come out.

182
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,440
You've gotten yourself
into trouble again.

183
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:27,230
Brother.

184
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:28,511
Please help me explain

185
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,791
the situation to Ms. Chen.

186
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:36,031
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,590
Are you okay? Let me send you back.

188
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,950
Okay. Let me get my bag.

189
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:59,631
Xiao the Merciless.

190
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:02,271
Why did you hit me?

191
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,010
You are getting bolder and bolder

192
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:08,230
at lying.

193
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:12,569
You are too noisy

194
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,751
until I'm having a headache!

195
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,830
Why is everyone treating me like this?

196
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:30,370
I'm already doing my best
to fix the bug.

197
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,671
But why are you still so mean to me?

198
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,350
Mr. Xiao.

199
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:43,391
In this situation,

200
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:45,230
you just need to give her a hug.

201
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:56,210
I'll only do this once.

202
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,470
No more next time.

203
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,271
Mr. Xiao, do you need my help?

204
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,470
No.

205
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,791
Ms. Qi.

206
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:23,190
Bring her a set of clothes tomorrow.

207
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:24,271
Okay.

208
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,271
You can get back to work now.

209
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:27,470
Okay.

210
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,511
My brother, come on.

211
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,431
Drink!

212
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:41,950
You mongrel!

213
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,791
Xiao the Merciless?

214
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,110
Why are you here?

215
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,511
What did you say?

216
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:09,990
How dare you come into
my dream to bully me.

217
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:11,631
Let me tell you.

218
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:15,271
You are in my dream.

219
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:18,190
I won't let you bully me.

220
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,470
Let me tell you.

221
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:32,791
When you are not being

222
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:34,590
merciless, cold

223
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,950
and a bully,

224
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,511
you look quite handsome.

225
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,870
All the young men in your family
are so handsome.

226
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:55,751
You and Mr. Lin.

227
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,090
I want to turn

228
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,671
both of you into NPCs for my game.

229
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,110
Who is more handsome?

230
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,151
Me or my brother?

231
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,671
Your brother.

232
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,511
Mr. Lin.

233
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,970
Is he

234
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:26,710
more handsome

235
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:28,350
or am I more handsome?

236
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:35,110
I think

237
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,391
both of you

238
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,031
are equally good-looking.

239
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,950
But I still think that...

240
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,751
Wake up.

241
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:55,830
You haven't finished your sentence.

242
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,350
Who's better looking?

243
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,950
I think

244
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:07,910
I'm the best-looking one.

245
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,991
I must be drunk.

246
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,289
Well,

247
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,711
thank you for sending me home
so late at night.

248
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,870
Together with this time,

249
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:54,231
I owe you twice now.

250
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:56,870
It's nothing.

251
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:00,271
I almost forgot to return
your jacket to you.

252
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,311
Thank you.

253
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,590
Is your leg still in pain?

254
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:12,210
I think it feels much better now.

255
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:15,110
Do you want me to help you
get into your house?

256
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,711
I don't think it's appropriate.

257
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:22,089
We are alone and
we are of different genders.

258
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,191
If my neighbors see us,

259
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,529
they'll misunderstand.

260
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,711
- I wasn't thinking about that.
- Really?

261
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:32,991
Are you sure?

262
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:35,450
I won't disturb you from resting, then.

263
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:36,350
Bye.

264
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,711
Dr. Zhang.

265
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,231
Your car.

266
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,010
Why am I here?

267
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:07,670
You...

268
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:12,791
Did you take advantage of me?

269
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,329
Look at the place you are lying on.

270
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,650
I'm almost on the floor because of you.

271
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:23,910
Who's taking advantage of who?

272
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,430
And take a good look at yourself.

273
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:27,930
Other than

274
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:30,070
your nest-like hair,

275
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:31,991
are you undressed in any way?

276
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,150
So, nothing happened between us?

277
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,231
Why? Are you disappointed?

278
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,210
Who's disappointed?

279
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:44,350
You are so narcissistic.

280
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,690
Since you are awake now,

281
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:48,010
please take full responsibility

282
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:49,430
for what happened.

283
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,191
Responsibility?

284
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,289
I slept on this bed

285
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,970
together for a night. I'm a lady.

286
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:57,930
And I didn't say anything.

287
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,511
But you are a man,
are you saying that...

288
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:02,390
Don't you feel ashamed?

289
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,751
I'm talking about the game.

290
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,511
The game?

291
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,910
Mr. Xiao, well...

292
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:18,800
Aren't you going to call me
Xiao the Merciless?

293
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,880
You had fun calling me
by that name last night, right?

294
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,791
Last night, I...

295
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:26,170
Well.

296
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:30,010
I have a neighbor who has
the surname Xiao too.

297
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,129
Instead of making an excuse,

298
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,031
you should get up and work now.

299
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:37,350
I will check on you from time to time.

300
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,910
This is a living hell.

301
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,390
Song Lingling.

302
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,369
You know that you are a lightweight.

303
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,311
Why did you drink so much?

304
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,170
Now,

305
00:20:58,171 --> 00:20:59,430
you've offended him.

306
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,910
Others work to achieve a happy life.

307
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:10,951
Why is mine so dangerous and thrilling?

308
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,670
My life is so difficult.

309
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,311
Okay.

310
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,210
Okay, I got it.

311
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:22,870
Brother.

312
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:24,830
Why are you here?

313
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,551
Hello, Mr. Lin.

314
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,711
Lanyao, you are here too.

315
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:35,231
I'm forced to be here.

316
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:38,150
Forced?

317
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,369
Because she kept disappearing and

318
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,930
couldn't be reached last time,

319
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:44,650
I feel so much better

320
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:46,231
to keep her under my watch.

321
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,450
Besides, the progress is slow right now.

322
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:49,609
By keeping her here,

323
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,070
I can keep an eye
on the restoration of the game.

324
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,769
If this is against your will,

325
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,311
you can leave at any time.

326
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:01,970
But you'll have to bear
the responsibility

327
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:03,311
for the consequences.

328
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,630
I'm willing to stay here.

329
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:13,751
Brother, why are you here today?

330
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:17,031
It's about the game investment
that we talked about yesterday.

331
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,551
Let's talk while we eat.

332
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,890
She is quite sincere.

333
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:28,170
But we may have to compromise

334
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:29,730
on some shares.

335
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:31,690
If she insists on her conditions,

336
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:33,590
there's no way I will agree.

337
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,289
The decision-making power
of this project

338
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,751
has to be in Shanhai Group's hands.

339
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,450
I don't want it to become
a cash cow of capitalism.

340
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:42,630
Okay. I won't mention it again.

341
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:46,791
Mr. Xiao.

342
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:47,849
I want to make

343
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,250
a toast to you for what you said.

344
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:51,569
I didn't choose the wrong person.

345
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,369
You care about the game.

346
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,170
You don't have to butter me up.

347
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:57,870
Get back to work after you eat.

348
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:01,390
Xiao the Merciless.

349
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,960
(Out-Patient)

350
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:12,250
Why are you here?

351
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:13,670
You are back.

352
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:16,930
I'm here

353
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:17,809
to thank you

354
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,609
for sending me home last night.

355
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,630
Actually, you don't have
to be so courteous.

356
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,049
What a waste for this breakfast
I made specially for you.

357
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,951
- If you don't want it, fine.
- Wait.

358
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,830
I didn't say that I wouldn't eat it.

359
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:32,031
Actually, I've prepared something
for you too.

360
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,751
I planned to give it to you in person.

361
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:39,569
You hurt your leg

362
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,930
from wearing heels last time, right?

363
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:43,410
I bought a pair of flats for you

364
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:45,910
so that you can walk more comfortably.

365
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,191
I don't know if you'll like
the shoes or not.

366
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,529
How do you know the size of my feet?

367
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,730
I estimated the size of your feet

368
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:57,070
when I helped you massage them
last time.

369
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,210
Are they too small?

370
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:16,191
No.

371
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,210
They fit me very well.

372
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:27,390
I like them.

373
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:32,110
Eat your breakfast while it's hot.

374
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:36,311
Make sure to finish it.

375
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,650
It's late.

376
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:04,450
I have a meeting
at seven tomorrow morning.

377
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:05,569
Rest earlier.

378
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,089
Okay, Mr. Xiao. Leave me be.

379
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,150
Goodnight.

380
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,870
If I leave you be,

381
00:25:09,931 --> 00:25:12,830
are you sure I can
get a good night's sleep?

382
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,991
You are right.

383
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:18,791
I'll wrap this up at once.

384
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,150
This is a pair of pajamas for you.

385
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,311
Wrap it up as soon as possible.

386
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,311
I'll wear anything you give me.

387
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:40,231
(Are you trying to be a complete wreck
after restoring the game?)

388
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:42,191
(Are you planning to turn in my house)

389
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,400
(and kill me?)
