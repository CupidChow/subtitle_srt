=Episode 19=

29
00:01:45,526 --> 00:01:47,346
I only told you to pause the project.

30
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:48,764
Yet, you teamed up

31
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:50,026
and tried to sell the game.

32
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:51,885
We're doing business here,

33
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:53,106
not charity.

34
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:55,325
Selling the game before it's too late

35
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:57,266
can at least help us retain our capital.

36
00:01:58,765 --> 00:01:59,746
Gentlemen.

37
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,266
I hope you get this clear.

38
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:05,805
We're all in the same boat.

39
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:07,746
We're stuck together.

40
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,186
It's either we succeed together,

41
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:10,505
or we fail together.

42
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:14,105
The project needs to be paused
due to unforeseen circumstances.

43
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,306
We have no other choices.

44
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,746
I have to admit,

45
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:23,026
I've said things I shouldn't
have without thinking much.

46
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:25,505
I apologise for that.

47
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:27,586
We don't want to give up easily too.

48
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:29,684
However, you need to elaborate

49
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:30,665
on your plans.

50
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:33,545
Besides, to be honest with you,

51
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:35,785
we have no more funds.

52
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:37,866
At most,

53
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:40,026
you can have three more days

54
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,825
to think of a solution.

55
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:42,866
That's right.

56
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,524
The current situation

57
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:45,985
is unexpected.

58
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:48,026
We don't wish to pressure you too.

59
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,720
(Qiao)

60
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:10,545
Xiao Ran.

61
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,105
Qiao.

62
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:14,225
You're my last resort.

63
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,586
I don't want to disturb you too.

64
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:17,845
But recently,

65
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:19,945
so many things have happened.

66
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:22,026
Can I talk to you?

67
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:23,945
Of course.

68
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:26,746
Is it related to your work?

69
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,186
I am free right now.

70
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:29,466
I'll go to you then.

71
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:30,405
Never mind.

72
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:31,605
I'll come to you.

73
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:32,764
Well,

74
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:33,985
I want to have a breather too.

75
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:36,545
So,

76
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:39,265
your investors will still
spare you a few days.

77
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:43,505
Ran.

78
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:45,065
I don't want to criticize you.

79
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:47,084
But you shouldn't act rashly

80
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:49,385
and pause the project.

81
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:52,484
I know you have plans.

82
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:54,385
But your investors weren't aware.

83
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:56,405
It's normal for them

84
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:58,985
to get upset as
they can't understand the situation.

85
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,586
If you wish to go further,

86
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,586
you should console them

87
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:07,065
instead of arguing with them.

88
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:08,364
Your actions

89
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:11,466
will only drive them away.

90
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,346
Qiao.

91
00:04:13,006 --> 00:04:14,105
I know.

92
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,364
I paused the project,

93
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:17,845
but not for any other reasons.

94
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:18,979
You knew it too.

95
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,405
Lingling's health condition

96
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,985
has gone worse recently.

97
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,665
I can't bear to see her suffer.

98
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:25,105
Besides,

99
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:27,625
she's the backbone behind the project.

100
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,364
If she falls sick,

101
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:31,105
the project is really over.

102
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,225
I know.

103
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:36,185
You're just too worried about her.

104
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:38,884
But if you'd like
to inform the investors,

105
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:39,845
you should tell them

106
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,924
about your plans in details.

107
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:43,826
They should at least be informed

108
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:46,545
of your analysis
regarding the project's status.

109
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,085
With sufficient funds,

110
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:49,525
the game's production and revisions

111
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:51,425
can continue.

112
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:52,924
You should tell them

113
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,405
about your plans.

114
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:56,045
Then, they can simplify

115
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,165
their thoughts.

116
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,645
They won't ask
for meetings everyday then

117
00:04:58,646 --> 00:04:59,484
and keep on

118
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:00,865
pressuring you.

119
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,405
About the funds,

120
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:05,185
Xiangyu offered to buy in previously.

121
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:07,324
I get it too.

122
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:08,826
This is my best option.

123
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:10,804
However, I'm still concerned

124
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:13,124
that Shen Group might
interfere with our operations.

125
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,745
Hence, I didn't accept the offer.

126
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:17,865
Since you're dating now,

127
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,484
can you talk to Xiangyu
about my concerns

128
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,665
on my behalf?

129
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:23,586
Would that be better?

130
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:25,066
How about you?

131
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:28,684
If I talk to her on your behalf,

132
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:30,386
will that be inappropriate?

133
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:31,804
Moreover,

134
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:34,085
I'm no longer
the Deputy CEO of Shanhai Group.

135
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:36,466
I'm not in charge of the project too.

136
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:39,285
Even if I talk to her,

137
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:40,804
when you sign the agreement,

138
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:42,586
you still need to meet her.

139
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:46,586
Well.

140
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:50,466
Okay then.

141
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:52,826
But you have to go with me.

142
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,266
With you around,

143
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:56,386
she might be a little more restrained.

144
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:57,745
Okay.

145
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:58,865
I'll go with you.

146
00:05:59,086 --> 00:05:59,906
Come on.

147
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:11,645
Isn't this the great Mr. Xiao?

148
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:13,124
I'm having a date with my boyfriend.

149
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,586
Why are you here?

150
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:17,305
Seems like you're free recently.

151
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:18,364
Enough.

152
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:19,586
Stop bullying him.

153
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:21,386
Have a seat.

154
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:30,506
Why are you sitting
next to my boyfriend?

155
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:32,785
You're third-wheeling here.

156
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:34,386
Sit over there.

157
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,745
Ran is here to talk business.

158
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:54,845
Weren't you interested in buying into

159
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:56,105
the Metaverse of Love project?

160
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,645
He wants to discuss

161
00:06:57,646 --> 00:06:58,865
about the collaboration.

162
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:01,466
Isn't he sitting here?

163
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,586
Tell him to tell me himself.

164
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,906
I'm not donating my money to him.

165
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,146
Tell her.

166
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:15,324
We've encountered

167
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:16,804
some issues with the game.

168
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:17,405
Yes.

169
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:18,725
According to him,

170
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:20,725
the coding for the hidden ultimate boss

171
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,244
has turned into a virus

172
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:24,364
and seems to be
infecting other codes as well.

173
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:25,946
I don't really understand these either.

174
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,244
But he told me

175
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:29,225
that if these are not rectified,

176
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:30,645
the game

177
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:32,924
will collapse

178
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:34,785
and turn into another game.

179
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:38,045
About the problem,

180
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:40,305
you need to let Lan Yao talk to him.

181
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:41,684
But only after

182
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:44,324
you talk to her about the clauses

183
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:45,906
and authorization.

184
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:47,645
What about Vic?

185
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:49,364
Does he have any solutions?

186
00:07:49,365 --> 00:07:50,884
He isn't fully aware of the development

187
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:52,066
of the game.

188
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:54,346
How can he think of a solution?

189
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,745
I understand.

190
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:57,625
I can accept your request.

191
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:00,004
As long as the project goes smoothly,
I'm okay with it.

192
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:00,725
Well?

193
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:02,985
You're not asking your girlfriend
for advice this time?

194
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:04,826
Yes.

195
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:06,364
I think you should still

196
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:08,045
ask Ms. Song about this.

197
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:10,405
Since she's
the main designer of this game.

198
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,706
She needs to know about this.

199
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:12,684
Qiao.

200
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:13,785
Never mind.

201
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:16,745
Lingling's is too sick

202
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:19,026
to do this now.

203
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,105
I can take this opportunity

204
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:24,386
to pass the revision work to Vic.

205
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:26,586
She really needs to rest.

206
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:27,444
Okay.

207
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,324
You can discuss
the solutions among yourselves.

208
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:30,085
Aside from this,

209
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:31,484
I have a request.

210
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:33,905
Lin Qiao must join the project.

211
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:36,546
I want to work with him.

212
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:38,105
Xiangyu.

213
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:39,546
Lin Qiao.

214
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:41,444
I know what you want to say.

215
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:42,245
I don't regret

216
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:43,964
my decision to go overseas with you.

217
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:45,466
I just hope

218
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,285
that you can stay

219
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,285
and complete the project with me.

220
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:50,045
When the project is completed,

221
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:51,905
we can then leave together.

222
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:56,905
But I don't want to have
anything to do with Shanhai.

223
00:08:58,406 --> 00:08:59,405
I can stay

224
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,066
and wait until the project ends.

225
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:03,525
But it's not proper to put me

226
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:04,826
in charge of the project.

227
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,265
But Lin Qiao,

228
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:10,706
the project has reached this stage,

229
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:13,045
You were in charge of the project.

230
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:15,546
It's only right for you
to see it through to completion.

231
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:18,466
Besides, the workload is too heavy now.

232
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:20,745
Not only you're helping me,

233
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:22,666
you can help Xiao Ran too.

234
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,186
I agree with what Xiangyu said.

235
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:28,084
I didn't want you to leave the team.

236
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:28,844
If you return now,

237
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:30,385
of course I have no issue with it.

238
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:31,444
Besides,

239
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,586
this will increase our productivity.

240
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,225
Qiao.

241
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:37,946
I suggest that you can
consider Xiangyu's idea.

242
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:46,225
I'll reconsider it.

243
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:49,066
I'll go to Lan Yao Studio now.

244
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:03,285
Mr. Xiao.

245
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:04,485
Why do you want to extract

246
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:06,586
the fundamental data of the game now?

247
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:11,066
I need a backup copy.

248
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:13,186
So, I'm here to extract the data.

249
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:15,285
You can just

250
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,546
send someone here to do this.

251
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:19,546
It's quite time-consuming.

252
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:20,365
No worries.

253
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:21,625
I can wait here.

254
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:24,225
I don't trust anyone else with this.

255
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:24,684
All right.

256
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:25,786
Please wait for a while.

257
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:28,145
Xiong.

258
00:10:28,246 --> 00:10:29,666
Have a look at this...

259
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:35,105
Xiao Ran.

260
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,066
Why are you here?

261
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,265
Didn't I tell you to rest at home?

262
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:45,265
Why did you sneak out to work?

263
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:46,645
Well.

264
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,905
This isn't important.

265
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:49,946
Why do you look for Xiong?

266
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:54,505
I...

267
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:57,125
Mr. Xiao is here to extract
the fundamental data of the game.

268
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:59,066
He said that Shanhai Group
needs a backup.

269
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:01,844
I thought you know, Boss.

270
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:02,946
So, I...

271
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:08,017
Come with me.

272
00:11:13,526 --> 00:11:14,666
Xiao Ran.

273
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:16,426
What are you trying to do?

274
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:38,385
Vic found a new issue.

275
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:40,306
If I don't look for funds,

276
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,385
the project will be put to a stop.

277
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:45,505
So,

278
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:48,045
are you making this decision

279
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:49,466
as Mr. Xiao, the CEO?

280
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:51,385
I'm doing all these

281
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:53,786
to solve the issue as soon as possible.

282
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:56,865
Besides,

283
00:11:57,565 --> 00:11:59,466
you're very sick now.

284
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:02,105
You can't continue
to work on this project.

285
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,105
I'm doing this

286
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:05,865
to protect you.

287
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:08,025
Protect me?

288
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:09,905
You call this protecting me?

289
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:11,324
You made me

290
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:13,204
an outsider.

291
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:15,546
I don't even have
the rights to know about this.

292
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,025
What's next?

293
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,946
Do you think that I'll be happy

294
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:21,546
once this is solved?

295
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,985
I know you've spent a lot of effort
in developing the game.

296
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:27,225
But can you please trust me?

297
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:29,546
I didn't make these decisions hastily.

298
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:32,145
I just want to solve
the problems soonest possible.

299
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:33,865
Problems?

300
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:37,346
To you,

301
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,505
it might be just a job.

302
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:43,045
It's just a bunch of codes.

303
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,905
But I'm different.

304
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:46,444
You know it too.

305
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:48,084
How important it is to me.

306
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:49,525
I told you, this is to protect you.

307
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:51,306
Can you be reasonable?

308
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,066
Yes.

309
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,525
I'm unreasonable.

310
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:55,865
I'm being dramatic.

311
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:57,844
You just want to solve the problem,

312
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,706
but I keep getting in your way, right?

313
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:00,905
Fine.

314
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,346
If that's the case,

315
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:04,546
I don't need your protection.

316
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,586
I'll solve the issue by myself.

317
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,666
Mr. Xiao.

318
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,426
Hold on, Mr. Xiao.

319
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:39,666
Mr. Xiao.

320
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:41,826
We've overheard

321
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:43,546
your fight with Boss.

322
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:46,285
Are you trying to help us reconcile,

323
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:48,186
or are you taking revenge for your Boss?

324
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,265
Mr. Xiao.

325
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:53,645
Since the inception of this project,

326
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:55,105
I've been following Boss.

327
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:58,324
The amount of time and effort
she has spent on the game

328
00:13:58,325 --> 00:13:59,826
is significant.

329
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,765
During the initial stages,

330
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:03,426
she had her beliefs.

331
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:07,105
But in order for
the project to progress,

332
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:08,786
or should I say,

333
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,385
because of you,

334
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,745
she keeps making
adjustments and compromising.

335
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,666
She's not a stubborn person.

336
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:18,346
But about the project,

337
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:21,265
her ego won't allow her to give up

338
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:22,826
or even become an outsider.

339
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:24,225
I understand.

340
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,245
I'll talk this

341
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:28,066
out with her.

342
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:29,885
She's still upset with me now.

343
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:32,186
She won't listen to whatever I say.

344
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:34,666
By the way, Mr. Xiao.

345
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:35,885
Actually,

346
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:37,905
I have a bigger concern.

347
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:39,720
I'm not sure if I should
tell you about it.

348
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,546
Go ahead.

349
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,745
As someone from the industry,

350
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:44,005
we all know

351
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:46,045
the most direct way to solve this.

352
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:49,466
But I still want to support my Boss.

353
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,724
Since she has spent too much effort

354
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,385
on the Brother character.

355
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:55,045
It has been years.

356
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:56,985
It's hard for her to move on.

357
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:58,804
I think

358
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:00,145
this is also why

359
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:02,385
she refused to release the data.

360
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:05,905
I know.

361
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:08,025
Thank you.

362
00:15:08,526 --> 00:15:09,604
It's nothing, Mr. Xiao.

363
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:11,225
I'm doing this for the sake of Boss too.

364
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,145
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

365
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:19,865
What are you up to recently?

366
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:21,485
I just ended a live show.

367
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:22,505
What's the matter?

368
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:25,466
You passed the audition for the shoot.

369
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,265
Really?

370
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:29,365
I passed the audition?

371
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:30,186
Yes.

372
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:32,105
That's great!

373
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,546
Do you have time
to drop by the film set?

374
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:36,426
I'll do as you say.

375
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:37,005
Okay.

376
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:38,346
You can come in the afternoon.

377
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:39,045
All right.

378
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:40,045
See you then.

379
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:40,485
Okay.

380
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:41,426
Goodbye.

381
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:55,946
Come in.

382
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:00,666
Boss.

383
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:02,145
Why are you looking for me?

384
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:09,385
I need you to investigate something.

385
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:10,885
Go on.

386
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,745
I'm good with investigation.

387
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,225
What do you want to investigate?

388
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:15,924
Lingling has a brother.

389
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:17,186
His name is Song Chongming.

390
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,946
He passed away
in an accident when she was little.

391
00:16:20,886 --> 00:16:22,604
I need you to find out

392
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:23,245
more details

393
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:25,225
about the car accident.

394
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:27,186
I want the details.

395
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,826
Well.

396
00:16:28,886 --> 00:16:31,625
This happened years ago.

397
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:32,964
Well?

398
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:33,985
Is it tough?

399
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:35,485
No.

400
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:36,625
I'll think of a way.

401
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:41,265
But Boss,

402
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:43,186
if you don't mind me asking.

403
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:46,225
Why do you want to investigate the case?

404
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:48,706
Did Goddess Lanyao tell you something?

405
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:51,045
You seemed upset

406
00:16:51,046 --> 00:16:52,505
when you came back earlier.

407
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:54,365
Did you two have a fight

408
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:55,466
because of this?

409
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:58,466
I'm just worried about her.

410
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,225
She hasn't moved on.

411
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:03,045
Hence, she's very attached

412
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,506
to the Brother character.

413
00:17:05,686 --> 00:17:06,826
I know.

414
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:08,986
This is putting her
in a difficult position.

415
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,404
I don't wish to see her

416
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,105
struggling and suffering.

417
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:15,986
She never told me about the incident.

418
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:17,425
Hence,

419
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:20,066
I want to find out myself.

420
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:21,266
Perhaps

421
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:23,506
I can help her untie her regrets.

422
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:26,346
Boss.

423
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:28,205
I never expect

424
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:30,465
that you'd do this for a girl.

425
00:17:30,486 --> 00:17:32,385
You're indeed incredible.

426
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,604
As your employee

427
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:35,986
and as your buddy,

428
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:37,465
you have my support.

429
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:39,105
I mean it.

430
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:52,105
I bought a flight ticket
to France tomorrow.

431
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:56,586
Why must you leave?

432
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:04,105
Your family is against our relationship.

433
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,905
We won't end up well.

434
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:09,826
I only know one thing,
which is I love you.

435
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:12,105
Isn't that enough?

436
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:13,905
I know.

437
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:15,506
I love you too.

438
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:20,625
But marriage is different.

439
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,844
Do you think that our love

440
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:24,346
is all we need?

441
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:27,986
How long can

442
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:30,346
a love without blessing last?

443
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:32,266
One year?

444
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,346
Five years?

445
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:36,346
Ten years?

446
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:38,385
Or our whole lives?

447
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:41,826
Marriage is a matter
between two families.

448
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,324
Your family is against our relationship.

449
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:46,306
How can we be happy?

450
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:48,965
We can leave them.

451
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,665
We don't have to mind them.

452
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,465
Will you bear to cut off ties with them?

453
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,404
Can you bear to let your aging parents

454
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,226
take care of themselves on their own?

455
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:07,306
I don't blame you.

456
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:10,665
I'm just begging you.

457
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:15,266
Before we fall deeper in love,

458
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:17,586
while

459
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:20,826
we can still endure the pain,

460
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:24,306
we should let each other go.

461
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,586
But I can't bear to break up with you.

462
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,066
Me too.

463
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:36,725
Let her go.

464
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:37,625
Let her go.

465
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:38,945
What are you doing?

466
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:41,164
Who are you?

467
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:42,465
I'm her boyfriend.

468
00:19:42,526 --> 00:19:43,644
Cut.

469
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:44,644
What's happening?

470
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:45,705
Where's the supervisor?

471
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:46,644
Hold on.

472
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,364
Hang on.

473
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:49,324
Calm down.

474
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:50,629
We're just acting.

475
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,970
I don't care.

476
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,324
Take him away.

477
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,425
Are you still filming or not?

478
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:55,965
I'm so sorry, Mr. Zhang.

479
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:56,884
Let me settle this.

480
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:57,604
Come here.

481
00:19:57,605 --> 00:19:58,485
What are you doing?

482
00:19:58,486 --> 00:19:59,625
Come here.

483
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:00,865
Hurry up.

484
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:13,084
What are you trying to do?

485
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:14,185
Go home with me.

486
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,285
I still have work to do here.

487
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:17,000
I can't leave.

488
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,285
So, are you going
to continue with the filming?

489
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,324
Of course.

490
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:21,905
I've signed the agreement.

491
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:23,364
If I leave now,

492
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:24,865
I'll need to pay the compensation.

493
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,465
Liu Yiyi.

494
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,625
I can support you financially.

495
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,625
Why are you using
your beauty to make a living?

496
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:44,746
You think that I'm using my beauty?

497
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:50,306
You know that's not what I meant.

498
00:20:55,446 --> 00:20:57,266
You really look down on me, don't you?

499
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:00,625
Unlike you,

500
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:02,786
I didn't come from a wealthy family.

501
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:05,644
I just want to make a living

502
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:06,826
by myself.

503
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:10,685
You must have felt superior

504
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,625
and looked down on us peasants.

505
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:16,205
I'm not looking down on you.

506
00:21:16,206 --> 00:21:18,826
I just can't see you working like that.

507
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:22,506
Listen,

508
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:25,346
I must finish my work today.

509
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:32,245
Mr. Zhang.

510
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:33,525
Please don't be upset.

511
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:34,364
I'm really sorry.

512
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:35,644
I'm sorry, everyone.

513
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:36,364
I'm sorry.

514
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:37,765
I'm so sorry, Mr. Zhang.

515
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:40,625
I've caused a delay
in the filming process. I'm really sorry.

516
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:43,084
I told you.

517
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:44,445
She's an influencer, she cannot act.

518
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:45,564
She cannot act.

519
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:46,644
Can we still film now?

520
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:47,525
I'm sorry.

521
00:21:47,526 --> 00:21:48,625
I'm sorry.

522
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,185
Whatever. Let's wrap up.

523
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:53,564
Mr. Zhang.

524
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:54,525
It's my problem.

525
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:56,205
Can you give me another chance?

526
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:57,306
Mr. Zhang.

527
00:21:58,405 --> 00:21:59,485
Mr. Zhang.

528
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,145
Please give her another chance.

529
00:22:01,845 --> 00:22:02,945
Mr. Zhang.

530
00:22:07,885 --> 00:22:09,285
Everyone, let's do another shot.

531
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,965
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

532
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:12,105
I'm so sorry.

533
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:19,925
Why

534
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:22,625
are you in the mood
to take a stroll with me today?

535
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:25,026
Well, I find

536
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:26,665
today's weather pleasant.

537
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:29,285
I don't think so.

538
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:30,385
Let me have a guess.

539
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:32,306
You just want to have a date with me.

540
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,465
Why are you laughing?

541
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:37,105
I think

542
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:38,945
that you're cute.

543
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:41,525
Do you only realise now?

544
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,105
I've always been cute.

545
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,804
You should be grateful

546
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:46,145
to have a girlfriend like me.

547
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:49,425
But I'm really curious.

548
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:51,546
Are you always this carefree?

549
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,066
Well, I do have troubles.

550
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:57,786
In primary school,
I was concerned about my height.

551
00:22:58,246 --> 00:22:59,525
In high school,

552
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:01,586
I was worried about my breakouts.

553
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:03,665
After graduating from college,

554
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:05,826
I worried about why you didn't like me.

555
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,066
You have quite a lot of troubles.

556
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:10,945
However,

557
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,145
it's very specific.

558
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:15,465
Are you laughing at me?

559
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:19,285
However,

560
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:22,066
I'm still very ambitious.

561
00:23:22,686 --> 00:23:24,925
My biggest concern

562
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:26,765
is whether Xiao Ran
can get the copyright

563
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:29,226
and data from Lan Yao.

564
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:31,746
Well.

565
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:34,066
This might be tough.

566
00:23:35,526 --> 00:23:37,604
I don't really know Lan Yao.

567
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:40,185
I don't know how they get along too.

568
00:23:40,926 --> 00:23:42,364
However, I don't think it's easy

569
00:23:42,365 --> 00:23:43,905
to resolve the trouble

570
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:46,665
Lan Yao has with her brother.

571
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:49,485
I don't think Xiao Ran can convince

572
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:50,746
Song Lingling.

573
00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:53,346
To keep this from Lan Yao,

574
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,945
it's even tougher.

575
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,625
Actually, Lan Yao has her own thoughts.

576
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:01,665
Ran won't be able to convince her.

577
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:04,506
He might not see it.

578
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:06,465
But in terms of relationship,

579
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,145
sometimes,

580
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:10,546
outsiders see it better.

581
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:14,465
Will you not see it too?

582
00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:17,346
I see it clearly.

583
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:20,586
Since I'm sure that it's you,

584
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:21,945
it'll always be you.

585
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,185
Get on the car.

586
00:24:57,766 --> 00:24:59,865
Why isn't my car here yet?

587
00:25:03,565 --> 00:25:04,826
Get on the car.

588
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,045
The ride-share drivers

589
00:25:08,046 --> 00:25:09,485
nowadays are so rude.

590
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:11,306
They didn't even inform
when they arrived.

591
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:17,665
Get on the car.

592
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:20,905
Who's talking?

593
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:23,404
I'm talking to you.

594
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:24,705
Get on the car.

595
00:25:27,246 --> 00:25:29,546
Oh, are you talking to me?

596
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:31,385
Mr. Xiao.

597
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,905
Apologies for not welcoming you.

598
00:25:34,006 --> 00:25:35,804
What brings you

599
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:38,586
to our small studio?

600
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:41,746
Would you like to visit Lan Yao Studio?

601
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:44,164
Oh, I forgot.

602
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:45,404
It's past working hours now.

603
00:25:45,405 --> 00:25:46,546
Another day then.

604
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,266
Are you getting on the car or not?

605
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:07,445
Thanks, Mr. Xiao.

606
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:09,164
I've canceled my ride.

607
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:09,685
By the way,

608
00:26:09,686 --> 00:26:10,844
please help me claim

609
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,425
the cancellation fee of three dollars.

610
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:30,986
You're back in time for dinner.

611
00:26:33,645 --> 00:26:34,364
Ms. Song.

612
00:26:34,365 --> 00:26:35,245
Have a seat.

613
00:26:35,246 --> 00:26:36,364
Thank you, Ms. Qi.

614
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:37,586
You're welcome.

615
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:46,385
What's wrong with you two?

616
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:47,084
Ms. Song.

617
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:48,826
Did he bully you?

618
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:50,986
No.

619
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:54,705
Are you having a fight?

620
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,786
It's nothing, Ms. Qi.

621
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,884
Enjoy your meal then.

622
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,226
Just call me if you need anything.

623
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:14,786
No, thanks. I'll take it myself.

624
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,425
Is it cold?

625
00:27:21,526 --> 00:27:22,665
Shall I

626
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:24,306
ask Ms. Qi to cook something else?

627
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,465
What do you take Ms. Qi for?

628
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:29,826
She hasn't eaten yet, did you know?

629
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,905
Or

630
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:34,124
to you, we're just normal staff.

631
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,564
We're not important at all.

632
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:36,786
Song Lingling.

633
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:39,746
Is this the time to talk about Ms. Qi?

634
00:27:40,446 --> 00:27:41,986
What should I say then?

635
00:27:42,446 --> 00:27:44,905
Your superiority and dictatorship?

636
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:49,644
You're the boss.

637
00:27:49,645 --> 00:27:50,986
You're the CEO.

638
00:27:51,165 --> 00:27:53,525
You can make
the decision for us as you like.

639
00:27:53,526 --> 00:27:55,665
You don't care about what we think.

640
00:27:55,885 --> 00:27:56,905
However,

641
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,084
Ms. Qi has taken care
of you since you were little.

642
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:01,285
You didn't even care
that she hasn't eaten yet.

643
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:03,665
Let alone caring about my feelings.

644
00:28:08,845 --> 00:28:10,945
When did I say that?

645
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:13,445
Can you stop imposing

646
00:28:13,446 --> 00:28:15,425
your thoughts on me?

647
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:17,625
I understand where you're coming from.

648
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:19,620
I'm doing this with your
best interests in mind as well.

649
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,586
But you can't...
With my best interests in mind?

650
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:25,425
You're so thoughtful then.

651
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,266
Song Lingling.

652
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:34,105
Sticking to the issue,

653
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:37,226
I'm serious about this.

654
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:38,865
I'm not throwing a tantrum.

655
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:41,145
You can't just avoid the issue.

656
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,404
I hope that we're discussing,

657
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:45,185
but not venting out at each other.

658
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,705
This isn't a discussion to you?

659
00:28:51,926 --> 00:28:53,084
Let's end the conversation then.

660
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:54,665
This is not what I meant.

661
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:57,465
I'm sleepy, Mr. Xiao.

662
00:28:57,726 --> 00:28:59,665
I'll sleep in the guest room tonight.
