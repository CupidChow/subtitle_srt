29
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:09,035
Should we say something?

30
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:12,195
The atmosphere is super awkward.

31
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:16,914
Judging from Dad's expression,

32
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:18,954
I don't think he wants to talk.

33
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:21,234
That's the reason

34
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:23,315
the atmosphere is awkward.

35
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:25,715
You should say something.

36
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:30,035
What should I say?

37
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:33,435
Uncle Xiao.

38
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:35,954
Xiangyu?

39
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:38,053
What are you doing here?

40
00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:40,155
It's been so long since you visited me.

41
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:43,435
Did you not miss me at all?

42
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:44,613
Uncle Xiao,

43
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:47,114
of course that's not true.

44
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:49,394
Mr. Lin.

45
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:52,555
What's the current situation?

46
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:53,773
It seems like

47
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,674
Dad isn't that upset.

48
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:57,694
How's your health lately?

49
00:02:57,695 --> 00:02:58,773
Do you feel better now?

50
00:02:58,774 --> 00:02:59,933
I feel much better now.

51
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:01,894
I feel more energetic upon seeing you.

52
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:02,454
That's great.

53
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:04,634
I have to visit you often in the future.

54
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:06,514
I'm not sure either.

55
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,234
You see,

56
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:12,234
Dad is trying to avoid reality.

57
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:14,134
What should we do now?

58
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,995
Should I bring up the notion, then?

59
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:17,734
By the way, Uncle Xiao,

60
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:19,634
this is the present I prepared for you.

61
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:24,053
Xiangyu, you're thoughtful indeed.

62
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:26,974
You prepared a present for me,
unlike those brats.

63
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:28,014
Xiangyu.

64
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:30,493
No. We should wait and observe.

65
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:31,514
Alright.

66
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:35,213
Uncle Xiao.

67
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,093
This is a special present
that I prepared for you.

68
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:40,294
I hope you can unwrap it
when you're alone.

69
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:41,755
I guarantee that you'll like it.

70
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:45,074
Hurry. Let's eat.

71
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:55,234
Let's eat.

72
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:57,074
I never expected

73
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:00,053
everyone to be here today.

74
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:01,595
This courtyard was vacant

75
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:03,653
for a long time.

76
00:04:03,654 --> 00:04:05,595
Now, it finally looks lively.

77
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:08,555
All of you should spend the night here.

78
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:10,794
Zhang.

79
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:12,974
Dad, I have
company affairs to attend to.

80
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:14,694
There's no rush.

81
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:16,035
Just stay here.

82
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:19,494
Prepare their rooms for them.

83
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:20,755
Their rooms are ready.

84
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:23,315
The brothers will stay
in their own rooms.

85
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:26,034
The two ladies
will stay in the guest room.

86
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:27,355
No.

87
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,293
Lingling will stay in the
same room as me.

88
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:31,355
Nonsense!

89
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:34,474
How could you stay in the same room
as her without getting married?

90
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:36,173
Even if you don't mind it,

91
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:38,413
you should consider her feelings.

92
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:39,494
If news of this gets out,

93
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:40,995
people might gossip about you.

94
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,474
Am I right?

95
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:47,394
Uncle Xiao, of course you're right.

96
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:50,694
But there's a reason we have to do this.

97
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:53,293
No means no.
I don't care what reason you have.

98
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,195
But...

99
00:04:56,854 --> 00:05:00,213
Xiangyu, just tell me
if you need anything.

100
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:02,134
Treat this place as your own house.

101
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,533
You mustn't stand on ceremony.

102
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:05,115
Alright, Uncle Xiao.

103
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:07,853
I'm sure everyone is exhausted.

104
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:09,274
Let's rest early today.

105
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,780
(Honorary Credential)

106
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:30,834
I never expected these items
to be still around.

107
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:33,733
Brother,

108
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,934
doesn't this feel like

109
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,755
our childhood?

110
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:41,413
At first,

111
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:43,634
we didn't live in the same room.

112
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:45,934
But you were afraid
to sleep alone at night.

113
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:48,773
You came to my room
with your pillow every night.

114
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:51,915
In the end, we lived in the same room.

115
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:54,374
I didn't do that because I was afraid.

116
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,195
I just didn't want to sleep alone.

117
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:59,454
But there were plenty of frustrations

118
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:01,235
after we started
to live in the same room.

119
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,254
Back then,

120
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:04,853
you were selected to participate
in a recitation contest.

121
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:07,173
You practiced in front of the mirror
every day.

122
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:09,653
And, you insisted that
I watch your performance.

123
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:10,853
You did the same thing.

124
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:13,293
You tell me about your experiences
in school every day.

125
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:15,235
I felt sleepy whenever
I heard your stories.

126
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:20,435
I do miss those moments.

127
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:24,274
But I like it now too.

128
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,995
It feels great to be home.

129
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:30,814
Brother, do you want
to take a walk outside?

130
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:31,653
Let's go.

131
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:32,555
Let's go.

132
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:57,235
You can choose where you want to sleep.

133
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,235
I'm fine with anywhere.

134
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:02,853
If so, do you have any other needs?

135
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:05,014
For example, toiletries

136
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:06,333
or pajamas.

137
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,074
I'll tell Uncle Zhang
to bring them here.

138
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:09,634
There's no need to trouble him.

139
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:12,773
It's fine.

140
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:14,795
You can take your time
and get used to the place.

141
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:17,594
It was super embarrassing
when I first came here.

142
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:19,653
Back then, it was still an old house.

143
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:21,213
It was huge.

144
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:22,653
I was young too.

145
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:25,733
I fell into the fish pond by accident.

146
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:28,254
I alarmed everyone due to that.

147
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,333
Really?

148
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:30,293
Of course.

149
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:32,134
Due to that,

150
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:35,034
Xiao Ran teased me for a long time.

151
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:39,213
By the way, did Uncle Xiao
make things difficult for you

152
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:40,755
when he told you to come?

153
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,574
He didn't.

154
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,235
It's just

155
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:49,355
that he's not happy with us
being a couple.

156
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:52,755
Don't tell me you were shaken, then?

157
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:55,115
You must stay strong.

158
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,474
If not...

159
00:07:57,854 --> 00:08:00,755
If not, it'll be more troublesome
for me and Lin Qiao.

160
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:04,274
Xiao Ran and I will never give in.

161
00:08:04,974 --> 00:08:06,714
However,

162
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:10,894
the will of the elders is still...

163
00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:12,134
Since it has come to this,

164
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:14,014
you should forget about it.

165
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,894
Right now, our main goal

166
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,014
is to reach a consensus
and put on a united front.

167
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:20,594
Only then will we not be defeated.

168
00:08:21,854 --> 00:08:23,915
You mustn't back off now.

169
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,115
I will never back off.

170
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,213
If so, do you wish to know

171
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:31,954
why Xiao Ran often shows girls
the cold shoulder?

172
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,773
There's actually a story behind it?

173
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:34,494
Of course.

174
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:36,675
It's an interesting story too.

175
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:38,074
Let me tell you about it.

176
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:45,014
Do you remember the first time

177
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,494
you learned how to swim?

178
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:49,234
Back then, you were
unfamiliar with the sport.

179
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:51,533
You insisted on dragging me with you.

180
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:53,573
In the end, we slipped and fell

181
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,675
into the pool together.

182
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,293
Of course I do.

183
00:08:57,294 --> 00:08:58,854
In the end, you dragged me out

184
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:00,714
of the pool.

185
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:03,754
Actually, I was terrified back then.

186
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:06,413
I regretted that
I joined you in the pool.

187
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:07,974
But do you know something?

188
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:08,614
Since then,

189
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:11,014
I took my swimming lessons seriously.

190
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:13,114
I didn't dare to skive
or get distracted.

191
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:14,653
I was thinking

192
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,573
that I mustn't drag you down

193
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:18,515
when we swim again.

194
00:09:21,615 --> 00:09:24,035
(You've been protecting me since young.)

195
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:25,275
(This time,)

196
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:27,874
(I won't let you face the music alone.)

197
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:29,974
(You've grown up.)

198
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:32,714
(Maybe this is
my last time protecting you.)

199
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:39,195
How do you intend to deal with Dad?

200
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:41,714
He doesn't want to listen
to our explanation.

201
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,315
If he insists on doing things his way,

202
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:46,714
I'm afraid he won't listen to us

203
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:48,874
no matter what we do.

204
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,555
Have you already
come up with a solution?

205
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,435
I think so.

206
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:03,614
Brother, all these years,

207
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:06,874
Dad has been avoiding you
and neglecting you on purpose.

208
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:08,675
But you're his son after all.

209
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,494
Some gaps

210
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:12,834
accumulate unintentionally over time.

211
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:15,533
The more one hides these things

212
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:16,894
and is unwilling to bring them up,

213
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:18,874
the more misunderstandings
they'll create.

214
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:21,234
Even if the engagement didn't exist,

215
00:10:21,694 --> 00:10:22,933
I still think

216
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:23,773
that you should

217
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:26,074
have an honest conversation with Dad.

218
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,354
Maybe it's because I'm afraid

219
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,795
that he'd say that
he never treated me as his son before.

220
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:46,515
Dad isn't heartless.

221
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:47,954
Brother,

222
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,614
if you wish to know

223
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,573
how Dad thinks about you,

224
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:54,195
there's a simple method you can use.

225
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:56,773
You just need to pay attention
to the approach

226
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:58,234
and start with the details.

227
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:01,315
Tell me about it.

228
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,635
This was an excellent move.

229
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:13,334
Although you knew their intentions,

230
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:16,474
you made them keep it to themselves.

231
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:22,354
I just want them to spend some time

232
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,114
on the decisions they'll make.

233
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:25,435
After all,

234
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:28,214
I won't be able to face Shen

235
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:30,474
if I say yes to them readily.

236
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:32,435
That old fool,

237
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:34,435
once he gets angry,

238
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,515
he'll be hard to deal with.

239
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,074
What's your plan for tomorrow, then?

240
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:41,994
No one can predict the future, you know?

241
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,234
By the way,

242
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:45,053
where did you put

243
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,754
the present Xiangyu gave to me?

244
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:48,254
I want to know

245
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:50,555
what she's up to.

246
00:11:50,774 --> 00:11:51,994
- Go and retrieve it.
- Alright.

247
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:04,354
You may leave.

248
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:27,195
(Uncle Xiao.)

249
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:28,453
(All these documents)

250
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:31,954
(represent the efforts that Lin Qiao
had devoted to the game project.)

251
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:35,315
(I'm very sure)

252
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:38,275
(that these documents
are just the tip of the iceberg.)

253
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:41,874
(Maybe you never believed him completely.)

254
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,795
(But he has been devoting himself
to the family in silence.)

255
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:47,734
(He would rather resign)

256
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,573
(in order to protect Xiao Ran)

257
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:51,874
(Game Test and Design Plan)
(and the company's interest.)

258
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:57,474
(He has worked really hard.)

259
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:00,094
(I just want you to see)

260
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:01,915
(his fruits of labor yourself.)

261
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,555
(It's because he's truly outstanding.)

262
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:08,874
(And, I love him very much.)

263
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:18,894
Is that so?

264
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:21,053
He never told me about that before.

265
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:23,734
Back then, he was badly bruised.

266
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:24,974
The main thing is,

267
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:27,114
his opponent was actually a little girl.

268
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:28,954
What happened after that?

269
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:31,734
After that, he was terrified of school.

270
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:33,795
I was the one who vented
his frustrations on his behalf.

271
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:35,453
Since then,

272
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:38,675
Xiao Ran kept his distance from girls.

273
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:42,515
Maybe he was traumatized back then.

274
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:48,635
(If so, did I terrify him
when I tried to beat him up)

275
00:13:49,174 --> 00:13:51,395
(as Xing Tian?)

276
00:13:54,414 --> 00:13:55,693
What are you laughing at?

277
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:56,494
Nothing.

278
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:59,714
I just feel like the Xiao Ran you mentioned
is quite different from the Xiao Ran I know.

279
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:02,315
Brother,

280
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,494
you should go to sleep if you're sleepy.

281
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:05,494
I can't sleep.

282
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:06,954
I'll take a walk outside.

283
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:12,074
Look at the time. Where are you going?

284
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:14,954
I'm going on a date.

285
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,590
(Xiao Ran: Are you asleep?)

286
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:26,915
(Are you asleep?)

287
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,480
(Song Lingling: No! I can't fall asleep)

288
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:37,834
(Xiao Ran:
I'll wait for you beside the pool.)

289
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:43,773
You see, I can't sleep.

290
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:45,395
I wish to take a walk outside.

291
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:00,074
If so,

292
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,594
is Lin Qiao alone

293
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:04,555
right now?

294
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,954
Xing Tian didn't
cause any trouble, did he?

295
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:36,275
No, he didn't.

296
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:39,754
How was your conversation with Xiangyu?

297
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:45,155
At first, I was a little nervous.

298
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,053
But when we had a chat,

299
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,714
it felt like
she was easy to get along with.

300
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:50,714
It's just

301
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:53,315
that she knows you guys so well.

302
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:56,214
I wonder if my presence

303
00:15:56,215 --> 00:15:58,155
is somehow unnecessary.

304
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:00,834
How could that be?

305
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:03,074
You appeared at just the right time.

306
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:06,693
But she grew up together with you two.

307
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:08,714
And, she's close to you guys too.

308
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:10,834
I was wondering

309
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:13,014
if my presence was the reason

310
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:16,234
everything is so complicated right now.

311
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:17,974
Your presence

312
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:20,014
made me sure of my goals.

313
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:22,795
It helped me to figure out
the decisions I should make.

314
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:25,435
Don't worry.

315
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:27,195
Everything will pass.

316
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,635
Were you looking for me?

317
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:45,173
Why weren't you looking for me

318
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:46,894
when you weren't asleep?

319
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:48,074
I...

320
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,714
I was planning to look for you.

321
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,675
Planning?

322
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,675
It's obvious that you hesitated
before you spoke.

323
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:58,795
And, you don't need to plan
to look for me.

324
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,933
Since you don't wish to see me,

325
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:02,114
I'll leave, then.

326
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:08,075
I was thinking in silence just now.

327
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:10,314
Thinking about what?

328
00:17:13,174 --> 00:17:14,675
I was thinking

329
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:17,554
that I should have a chat
with Dad tomorrow.

330
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,493
But I still feel insecure

331
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:21,234
about it.

332
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,274
What are you laughing at?

333
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:47,054
I suddenly thought of something funny.

334
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:48,794
Like what?

335
00:17:50,055 --> 00:17:51,595
Like

336
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:53,774
when a certain person was bullied

337
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:56,234
by his female classmate at school.

338
00:17:58,214 --> 00:18:01,474
Why did Xiangyu tell you that?

339
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:03,794
Be honest with me.

340
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:05,894
Were you scared
when I turned into Xing Tian

341
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:07,314
and attacked you?

342
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:08,994
I wasn't.

343
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:10,554
Really?

344
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,514
Tell me about it.

345
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,274
Do you truly wish to know?

346
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,595
You don't need to tell me
if you don't want to.

347
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:27,274
Why would I

348
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:29,954
turn you back to normal by kissing you

349
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:32,595
if I was afraid?

350
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:53,034
Does this matter trouble you that much?

351
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,334
♪I can't find your response♪

352
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:58,774
I'll support you

353
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:00,453
no matter what decision you make.

354
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:01,334
Do you hate it

355
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:03,075
when I'm like this?

356
00:19:03,535 --> 00:19:05,274
I'm hesitating

357
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:07,248
and I can't make up my mind.

358
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:10,134
At least

359
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:12,774
I didn't hate you when you chose

360
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:14,675
to face our relationship.

361
00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:16,714
I'm just worried

362
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,185
that I might lose my home after this.

363
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:25,493
Don't worry.

364
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:26,894
I'm still here for you.

365
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:29,814
Instead of suffering by yourself,

366
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:32,435
you should voice your thoughts.

367
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:34,794
No matter what happens,

368
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:36,679
I'll always stay by your side.

369
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:48,213
I think it'll be more convincing

370
00:19:48,214 --> 00:19:50,034
if all of us go together.

371
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:51,933
No.

372
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:53,213
If we do that,

373
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:55,034
it'll backfire on us instead.

374
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:57,134
After all, if we look at it
from Dad's perspective,

375
00:19:57,135 --> 00:19:59,435
it's as if we're forcing him
to make a decision.

376
00:20:01,414 --> 00:20:04,954
Why don't I have a chat with him alone?

377
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:07,054
Didn't you guys already
have a chat yesterday?

378
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:08,574
He didn't agree to it.

379
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,173
I think we can employ another method.

380
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:12,693
I can speak to Uncle Xiao

381
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:14,253
as a member of Shen Family.

382
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,395
Maybe he'll take that
into consideration.

383
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:19,814
Maybe it'll be more convincing
if Uncle Shen

384
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:21,173
is here to speak with him.

385
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:23,013
But Dad is abroad right now.

386
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,395
I can't just drag him back
to the country now.

387
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:28,155
All of you should stop.

388
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:30,155
I wish to face him myself.

389
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:32,195
I have some heartfelt thoughts

390
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:33,754
that I wish to share with him.

391
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,554
Brother, have you made up your mind?

392
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:07,835
Why did you put osmanthus flower
in the porridge?

393
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:11,595
Mom told me about it.

394
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:14,234
She said you liked putting
osmanthus flowers in your porridge.

395
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:17,835
What else did she tell you?

396
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:24,835
She told me to remember
your hobbies, birthday,

397
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:28,034
and everything related to you.

398
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,954
She told me to be obedient.

399
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:33,814
She told me to be cautious

400
00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:35,595
no matter what I did.

401
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:39,915
She told me to learn
how to get along with you.

402
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:48,034
I'm sure you're here

403
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,754
because you have something to tell me.

404
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:01,733
Maybe you'll get angry after hearing

405
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,474
what I have to say.

406
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:06,574
But it took me a long time

407
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,395
before I decided to do so.

408
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:11,875
I hope you can hear me out patiently.

409
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:18,115
I know

410
00:22:18,494 --> 00:22:19,413
why you insist on

411
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:21,554
arranging a marriage
for Ran and Xiangyu.

412
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:25,314
You just want Shen Group's support

413
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:27,334
so that Ran can stabilize his position

414
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:28,714
in Shanhai Group.

415
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:31,554
But I assume you're worried

416
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:33,894
about the current situation.

417
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,814
If Xiangyu and I get married,

418
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:38,554
Ran's position
in Shanhai Group will be affected.

419
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:41,413
But I've never wanted

420
00:22:41,414 --> 00:22:43,274
to compete with Ran.

421
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,195
In the past,

422
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,933
you were lukewarm towards me.

423
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,635
I was upset about that.

424
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:55,835
Therefore, in order
to receive your recognition,

425
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:58,195
I gave up on the field I loved.

426
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:02,395
I did my best to attract your attention.

427
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:07,355
But now, I understand something.

428
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:11,234
There are certain things

429
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:14,794
where effort

430
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:19,195
makes no difference.

431
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:34,314
Now, I just hope

432
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:36,794
that you won't separate me and Xiangyu.

433
00:23:37,694 --> 00:23:40,514
Now, I finally have the courage
to face her feelings.

434
00:23:40,775 --> 00:23:42,094
This time,

435
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:42,854
I don't want to

436
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,034
and can't afford to let her down.

437
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:49,635
If you're still worried,

438
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,155
I can leave the Xiao Family.

439
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:56,954
But I won't blame you

440
00:23:56,974 --> 00:23:58,635
no matter what decision you make.

441
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:02,274
It's because

442
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:06,274
you'll always be the father
I respect the most.

443
00:24:08,095 --> 00:24:10,274
I hope to get an answer from you.

444
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,754
The porridge is getting cold.

445
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:27,514
You should have it while it's hot.

446
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,355
Don't be too upset.

447
00:25:01,174 --> 00:25:02,733
Lin Qiao is still young.

448
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,554
What should we do now?

449
00:25:06,174 --> 00:25:08,195
Since you already got a divorce,

450
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:09,994
you shouldn't say things

451
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,875
like that again.

452
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:14,435
It'll be bad if the child hears you.

453
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:16,314
I know he's a scum.

454
00:25:16,694 --> 00:25:18,173
But I didn't expect him

455
00:25:18,174 --> 00:25:20,653
to extort money from me
so that he could gamble them away.

456
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:22,794
I didn't expect him
to blackmail me with my child.

457
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:27,675
That will

458
00:25:28,014 --> 00:25:29,514
never happen again.

459
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,395
You can treat this place

460
00:25:32,654 --> 00:25:34,474
as your home.

461
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,355
Ruohai.

462
00:25:49,135 --> 00:25:52,514
Come. I'll buy you something delicious.

463
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:55,894
This child is a bit shy.

464
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:57,213
But it's fine.

465
00:25:57,214 --> 00:25:58,714
He'll warm up to you soon.

466
00:26:02,974 --> 00:26:05,013
This is our home now.

467
00:26:05,014 --> 00:26:07,253
In the future, you need to call him Dad.

468
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:08,474
Understood?

469
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,395
But I have my own father.

470
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,835
At this moment,

471
00:26:24,654 --> 00:26:26,474
I wonder what you'd do

472
00:26:27,575 --> 00:26:29,595
if you were in my shoes.

473
00:26:46,295 --> 00:26:47,435
Mr. Lin?

474
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:50,954
How did it go?

475
00:26:51,135 --> 00:26:52,835
Judging from your expression,

476
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:55,435
don't tell me he said no?

477
00:26:55,654 --> 00:26:56,954
I'll look for him.

478
00:26:58,095 --> 00:26:59,794
He didn't say no.

479
00:27:00,615 --> 00:27:02,355
He said nothing.

480
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,195
What exactly is going on?

481
00:27:07,855 --> 00:27:10,374
Why don't we look for him together?

482
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,954
It's pointless to wait any longer.

483
00:27:17,254 --> 00:27:18,894
What are you guys up to?

484
00:27:18,895 --> 00:27:20,714
Do you guys intend to start a rebellion?

485
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,534
Uncle Xiao, you're overthinking it.

486
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:25,435
That's not our intention.

487
00:27:25,974 --> 00:27:28,155
Calm down for now.

488
00:27:28,174 --> 00:27:30,173
The engagement
between the Xiao and the Shen Family

489
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:31,693
is a huge deal.

490
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:32,933
We have to be prudent with it.

491
00:27:32,934 --> 00:27:35,915
If not, I have no way
to face your father.

492
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:37,774
You don't need to worry about my father.

493
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:38,814
He'll listen to me

494
00:27:38,815 --> 00:27:40,355
if I tell him about it.

495
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:43,474
You guys

496
00:27:43,615 --> 00:27:46,915
are taking your
elders' words too lightly.

497
00:27:47,654 --> 00:27:49,574
You guys only intend
to pursue your own desires

498
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:50,814
and relationships

499
00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:51,854
without regarding

500
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:54,314
the consequences.

501
00:27:56,855 --> 00:28:00,274
We have to be prudent when we act.

502
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,474
Since you guys wish to pursue happiness,

503
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:08,994
it'll depend on
whether you guys are capable enough.

504
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:14,413
Lan Yao, since you're the game designer,

505
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:16,253
don't you think you should give

506
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:17,413
the shareholders an account

507
00:28:17,414 --> 00:28:18,875
when there's an issue with the game?

508
00:28:19,335 --> 00:28:20,614
Can you fix the issue

509
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,075
by the end of the month?

510
00:28:23,174 --> 00:28:25,115
I'll surely do my best.

511
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:29,294
Xiao Ran, are you confident in her?

512
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:30,355
Of course.

513
00:28:32,775 --> 00:28:34,395
I always believed her.

514
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:37,115
Lin Qiao,

515
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,334
resigning from the company

516
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:41,835
was a reckless move indeed.

517
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:45,034
You shouldn't just
ignore the company affairs.

518
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:46,994
Once you head back,

519
00:28:47,454 --> 00:28:49,355
monitor them for me.

520
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,733
Report the progress of their game to me.

521
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:53,954
Uncle Xiao,

522
00:28:54,014 --> 00:28:56,355
have you agreed
to let Lin Qiao return to the company?

523
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:58,534
Lin Qiao is the only mature child

524
00:28:58,535 --> 00:29:01,374
among you guys.

525
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,374
Without his supervision,

526
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,134
you guys

527
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:06,714
might cause me trouble in the future.

528
00:29:08,654 --> 00:29:09,754
Lin Qiao.

529
00:29:10,654 --> 00:29:12,173
Make a name for yourself.

530
00:29:12,174 --> 00:29:13,854
Prove to Uncle Shen

531
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:16,195
that you could provide
Xiangyu with happiness.

532
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:23,274
Xiangyu, you witty girl.

533
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:25,234
I saw your present.

534
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:26,915
I loved it.

535
00:29:32,135 --> 00:29:33,733
Why are you still standing there?

536
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:37,514
Xiao Ran, tell Zhang
to prepare some dishes.

537
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,314
From tomorrow onward,

538
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:43,195
you guys better prove yourselves.

539
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:50,915
Is that the plan you came up with?

540
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:54,253
Although it was quite different,

541
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:55,954
it still yielded a great result.

542
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:58,614
If so, why didn't you tell me
about it earlier?

543
00:29:58,615 --> 00:29:59,933
I was racking my brain

544
00:29:59,934 --> 00:30:01,693
and thinking of ways
to deal with Mr. Xiao.

545
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:02,693
I thought

546
00:30:02,694 --> 00:30:05,294
we were going to put on
a melancholic act.

547
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:06,915
I was so nervous.

548
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:10,794
What if I did leave the company
because of you?

549
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,314
What would you do?

550
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:15,774
What else can I do?

551
00:30:15,775 --> 00:30:18,814
I can only rest, recuperate,
and make money.

552
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:20,514
If not, I wouldn't
be able to support you.

553
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,334
This is great.

554
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,294
Since Uncle Xiao

555
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:38,253
has agreed to let you
return to Shanhai Group,

556
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:39,915
that means
you don't need to leave, right?

557
00:30:40,254 --> 00:30:41,493
This time,

558
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:44,395
I would prefer to complete
the project on Ran's behalf.

559
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:46,554
But I still wish to leave

560
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:48,173
upon the project's completion.

561
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:49,875
Why do you still intend to leave?

562
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:50,933
You've finally

563
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,075
gained
Uncle Xiao's recognition, you know?

564
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:56,075
To me,

565
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:58,234
that's no longer important.

566
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:00,355
Now, I care more about you.

567
00:31:04,335 --> 00:31:05,094
Dr. Zhang,

568
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:06,453
Patient No. 9

569
00:31:06,454 --> 00:31:07,854
has returned to normal after surgery.

570
00:31:07,855 --> 00:31:08,854
He needs to be discharged.

571
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:10,355
I need your signature.

572
00:31:13,014 --> 00:31:14,274
Dr. Zhang?

573
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:15,875
Sign this.

574
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:20,574
Dr. Zhang, are you sick?

575
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:23,595
You look distracted the entire day.

576
00:31:24,414 --> 00:31:25,595
That's not it.

577
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:26,493
Really?

578
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:28,915
You seem troubled by something.

579
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:33,435
Did you argue with your girlfriend?

580
00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:35,875
I guess.

581
00:31:36,014 --> 00:31:37,173
Actually,

582
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:39,994
there's nothing important here today.

583
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:41,754
What do you mean?

584
00:31:42,974 --> 00:31:47,234
I'm saying that the hospital
isn't busy today.

585
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:52,334
If so, I'll take a half-day break
and readjust my state.

586
00:31:52,335 --> 00:31:54,395
Help me apply for leave.

587
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:55,554
Alright.

588
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:13,574
Punch it and change your rhythm.

589
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:16,134
You have to put your back into it.
Straighten your arm.

590
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,034
That's right.

591
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:21,835
Dr. Zhang?

592
00:32:22,055 --> 00:32:24,155
Yang, take a break.

593
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,733
Why are you here?

594
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:28,835
I thought you hated the sweaty smell.

595
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:30,554
I wish to box.

596
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:32,894
Stop joking around.

597
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:34,334
Even the sandbag

598
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:36,314
is tougher than you.

599
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:39,595
I'm not joking.

600
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:41,754
I wish to box.

601
00:32:41,974 --> 00:32:43,794
I want to vent my frustrations.

602
00:32:46,295 --> 00:32:47,514
You're in a bad mood, huh?

603
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:50,595
Alright.

604
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,413
You can vent your frustrations today.

605
00:32:54,414 --> 00:32:55,435
Here.

606
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:13,294
Look.

607
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:15,094
This is the center of the sandbag.

608
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:16,894
Later, you should punch this spot

609
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:17,973
with everything you have.

610
00:33:17,974 --> 00:33:18,835
That's right.

611
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:20,173
Come, give it a try.

612
00:33:20,174 --> 00:33:20,854
Three.

613
00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:21,954
Wait.

614
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,274
You should stand back.

615
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:28,675
A little more.

616
00:33:30,734 --> 00:33:31,875
Happy?

617
00:33:32,014 --> 00:33:33,234
Alright.

618
00:33:34,654 --> 00:33:38,314
Three, two, one, go!

619
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:42,534
You have to apply some force.

620
00:33:42,535 --> 00:33:44,714
You can't just depend
on your arm alone.

621
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:46,954
Think of it as your enemy.

622
00:33:46,974 --> 00:33:48,493
Give it a strong punch.

623
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:49,294
My enemy?

624
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:50,173
That's right.

625
00:33:50,174 --> 00:33:52,173
Punch it with everything I have?

626
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:52,693
That's right.

627
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:53,774
Did you feel it?

628
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:54,534
Yeah.

629
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:55,474
Come on.

630
00:33:55,654 --> 00:34:00,115
Three, two, one, go!

631
00:34:05,014 --> 00:34:06,954
I don't think I have any enemies.

632
00:34:07,815 --> 00:34:08,995
What?

633
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:16,854
Fine. Think of it as the thing
that's troubling you right now.

634
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,075
The source of your frustrations.

635
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:19,973
The harder you punch it,

636
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,914
the further they'll stay away from you.

637
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:24,075
What about that? Did you feel it?

638
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:24,973
My troubles, huh?

639
00:34:24,974 --> 00:34:26,035
That's right.

640
00:34:26,175 --> 00:34:27,854
And, I need to give it
everything I have, huh?

641
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:28,533
That's right.

642
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:29,515
Okay.

643
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:34,635
Three, two, one, go!

644
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:38,995
Enough.

645
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:41,453
I think we should forget it.

646
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,155
Maybe this sport doesn't suit you.

647
00:34:44,454 --> 00:34:46,035
I can't teach you anything.

648
00:34:50,974 --> 00:34:53,394
I can't even box, huh?

649
00:34:53,494 --> 00:34:55,115
I'm a total loser.

650
00:34:56,934 --> 00:34:58,035
You see,

651
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:00,294
I'm not trying to mock you here.

652
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:02,434
Can you not be so gloomy?

653
00:35:03,255 --> 00:35:04,155
I...

654
00:35:04,494 --> 00:35:06,654
You see, you're a doctor.

655
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:08,933
Maybe such rough sports
aren't suitable for you.

656
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:10,035
Why don't we...

657
00:35:10,295 --> 00:35:12,214
Why don't we try something more refined?

658
00:35:12,215 --> 00:35:13,155
Okay?

659
00:35:20,695 --> 00:35:22,314
Do you have any liquor?

660
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:24,394
I do.

661
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:26,234
I wish to drink.

662
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:29,035
I thought you didn't drink.

663
00:35:34,534 --> 00:35:36,195
I wish to drink.

664
00:35:37,574 --> 00:35:39,754
Please get some for me.

665
00:35:40,895 --> 00:35:43,394
What's wrong with you all?

666
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:44,475
What's with you all?

667
00:35:44,494 --> 00:35:46,533
You guys come to me whenever
you face relationship issues.

668
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:48,515
It's not like I'm a love expert.

669
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:52,874
Fine. I'll get some liquor for you.
