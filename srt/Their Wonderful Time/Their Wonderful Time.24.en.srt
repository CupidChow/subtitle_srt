00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:51,545
Hand over the statistics.

30
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:55,265
You are quick to find out.

31
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:57,565
How did you track me here?

32
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:59,685
You can't take the statistics away.

33
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,205
There's no way
I will give it back to you

34
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:03,066
when it's in my hands.

35
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:03,925
Besides,

36
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:06,444
it's useless even if you take it back.

37
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:08,685
Why don't we collaborate?

38
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:10,666
You're not qualified
to negotiate with me.

39
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:12,005
You are so clueless

40
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,386
about how much commercial value
this game holds.

41
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:18,146
Players play the game
through their brainwaves.

42
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:20,386
This means that as the game runs,

43
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:22,005
information will be captured

44
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:23,505
from their brainwaves.

45
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:25,365
We can use this

46
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:27,245
to collect massive user data

47
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:28,586
and build a database.

48
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:31,044
It's priceless.

49
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:32,225
As a businessman,

50
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:33,745
aren't you tempted?

51
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:35,444
It does sound enticing,

52
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:38,185
but we won't gain profit
by invading people's privacy.

53
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:41,724
You are foolish.

54
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:42,986
Mr. Vic,

55
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:44,285
if a technique

56
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:46,005
that can't serve humans

57
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:48,285
and instead becomes a tool for profit,

58
00:02:48,286 --> 00:02:50,866
it shouldn't exist.

59
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:53,826
We need to uphold principles
and boundaries.

60
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,465
I can't agree with your approach.

61
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:57,666
Right.

62
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:58,965
I should've expected

63
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:00,745
you would be so righteous.

64
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:01,945
Luckily,

65
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:03,706
I have prepared something

66
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:05,185
that you have to let me go.

67
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:11,685
Hello?

68
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:12,285
Boss,

69
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:15,044
I just discovered that a humanization program
has been activated in the game.

70
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:15,924
All the NPCs

71
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:16,986
have started to change,

72
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:18,785
and they are getting out of control.

73
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,225
What did you say?

74
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:22,965
What did you do to the game?

75
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:25,546
It seems the mini-program I wrote
is activated.

76
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:27,924
You want to ruin the game?

77
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:29,266
Not at all.

78
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:32,666
I just feel bad for you, Ms. Song.

79
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:34,666
This creative game

80
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:36,866
is going to waste
before it even launches.

81
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:45,924
Do you think

82
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,666
everything will go your way?

83
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,986
I have one last trump card.

84
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:51,546
What do you mean?

85
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:54,044
When you retrieved the statistics,

86
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:55,685
just in case,

87
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:58,324
I set up a self-destruct program

88
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:00,586
to prevent someone like you.

89
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:02,565
If you take the statistics away,

90
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,266
I will destroy everything.

91
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,204
By then, you will have nothing left

92
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,266
and face legal punishment.

93
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:13,945
Why push this far, Ms. Song?

94
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:16,505
You will only cause losses to both sides.

95
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:19,204
You have been abroad for years.

96
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:21,040
You probably don't understand
our generation.

97
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,986
It's true that businessmen love money.

98
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:24,444
We seize every opportunity

99
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:26,106
to make a fortune.

100
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:27,986
However, we care more about ourselves.

101
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:30,065
If the money is gone, we earn it back.

102
00:04:30,085 --> 00:04:31,324
But if we lose in ourselves,

103
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:32,906
there is no way back.

104
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,546
What are you trying to do?

105
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:20,226
Mr. Xue, there's a situation
you need to know about.

106
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:25,764
Is there any other solution

107
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:27,385
to this situation?

108
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:28,964
The only solution is

109
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:31,466
to send Xing Tian back
into the game immediately.

110
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:34,185
But you mentioned the game
hasn't resumed to its normal state yet?

111
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:37,165
Vic activated a new program,

112
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,324
which caused chaos

113
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:39,565
inside the game.

114
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:42,185
If you don't separate the code
from her consciousness soon,

115
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:44,065
she won't hold on much longer.

116
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:47,245
The only way is to naturally
separate the code

117
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,426
from her consciousness inside the game.

118
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:55,026
When will she wake up?

119
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,265
Her consciousness is recovering now.

120
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,145
Once she gathers enough energy,
she will wake up.

121
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:04,825
But it's hard to say

122
00:06:05,006 --> 00:06:06,026
how long that will take.

123
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:08,546
All right, understood.

124
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:09,825
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

125
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:22,385
Mr. Lin,

126
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,324
why are you still here at this hour?

127
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,505
Maybe you should rest for a while.

128
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:28,866
I'm good.

129
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:31,485
I have sorted out the contracts

130
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:33,065
related to Vic.

131
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:34,825
Send them to the legal team

132
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:36,426
to proceed with the lawsuit.

133
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:37,986
All right.

134
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:39,884
Vic has been arrested.

135
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:41,466
You can rest at ease now.

136
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:15,945
I really learned from my mistakes
this time.

137
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:19,245
I shouldn't have involved
our relationship

138
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:21,705
with the company,

139
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,825
and I certainly shouldn't have done that

140
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:28,505
behind your back.

141
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,306
What's done is done.

142
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:38,306
I will try to fix it.

143
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,825
I don't want this to drive us apart.

144
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:46,065
You can blame me

145
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:47,906
or punish me,

146
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:51,106
but can you not leave me?

147
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,226
I don't want to,

148
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:58,226
but perhaps

149
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:02,306
I'm not the choice your dad approves of.

150
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:04,185
No.

151
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:08,226
He shouldn't be the one to decide this.

152
00:08:08,606 --> 00:08:11,185
I chose to be with you.

153
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,005
Regardless of what he says

154
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:15,106
or does,

155
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,026
I won't leave you.

156
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:23,385
And I won't let you be compromised
by his demands.

157
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:28,145
Don't leave me. Please.

158
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,546
Frankly, I have been thinking

159
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,825
about leading a simple life with you

160
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:50,626
after helping Ran launch the game.

161
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,225
Having you in life

162
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:55,026
is enough.

163
00:08:57,606 --> 00:09:00,266
But you crossed the line on this matter.

164
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:05,306
I promise

165
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,666
I won't cause any more trouble.

166
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:12,026
Let's help Xiao Ran and Laoyao

167
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:15,465
launch the game, right?

168
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:40,105
Mr. Xiao.

169
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,284
After a quick investigation,

170
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:47,965
we found the reason

171
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,445
behind the change in game statistics.

172
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:50,626
It's Vic.

173
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:53,306
Although he fixed
the imbalanced statistics,

174
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:54,725
he also secretly triggered

175
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:56,985
Song Chongming's self-awareness.

176
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:59,445
As a result, he awakens,

177
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:00,884
devours other NPCs,

178
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:02,684
and takes control of the game.

179
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,345
That's why external modifications

180
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:08,065
have no effect on him.

181
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,026
Is there any other solution?

182
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:13,365
Technically speaking,

183
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:14,205
we haven't

184
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:16,185
found any solutions yet.

185
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:19,345
But there's one we might try.

186
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:20,884
It is...

187
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:21,786
Go on.

188
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:24,225
It might be worth a try,

189
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:26,146
but it's nearly impossible.

190
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:28,146
What's that?

191
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:31,746
Enter the game to defeat Song Chongming.

192
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,945
Only then can his data
be zeroed out temporarily.

193
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:34,924
At the same time,

194
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,924
we delete the character's code

195
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:38,306
from external.

196
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:40,564
However, the problem is

197
00:10:40,565 --> 00:10:42,465
that Song Chongming has
extremely high combat power.

198
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:45,266
Players with ordinary skills
don't stand a chance.

199
00:10:56,126 --> 00:10:58,465
What if we upgrade the weapons?

200
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:00,546
The gap is too big.

201
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:03,225
The most advanced weapons
won't work either.

202
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,465
All right.

203
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:10,325
Keep this a secret.

204
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:11,804
Don't let Song Lingling know.

205
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:12,705
Okay.

206
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:19,705
Stay here and keep watch.

207
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:21,266
I'm going into the game.

208
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:22,044
Mr. Xiao,

209
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:24,426
we have no idea what's going on
in the game now.

210
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:25,945
Are you sure you want to go in?

211
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:27,585
We will only find out if we try.

212
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:12,426
Have you forgotten

213
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:14,125
about what happened before?

214
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:16,386
I'm the deity of the universe.

215
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:18,365
Anyone who trespasses

216
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:19,786
must die.

217
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,920
(Exit)

218
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,185
Mr. Xiao, this doesn't work.

219
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:51,626
Song Chongming is too powerful.

220
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:54,245
He has completely changed now.

221
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:55,705
All of his moves are cruel.

222
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:58,626
Can you try to jog his memories?

223
00:12:58,685 --> 00:12:59,906
I don't think so.

224
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:02,506
Some settings can't be changed,

225
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,804
which is why I said

226
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:06,506
this method is nearly impossible.

227
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:09,125
What if I use
gameplay skills and strategy

228
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:11,266
instead of relying on skill points?

229
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:13,225
Is it possible to bring him down?

230
00:13:13,486 --> 00:13:15,105
I can't guarantee it,

231
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:16,705
but you could give it a try.

232
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:18,906
All right.

233
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,065
Get back to your work.

234
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:21,146
All right, Mr. Xiao.

235
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:55,306
Jeez, you don't sleep at night?

236
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:57,506
Can't we talk tomorrow?

237
00:13:58,565 --> 00:13:59,786
I have something to ask of you.

238
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:01,585
Don't.

239
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:03,185
Just give your orders.

240
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:05,626
Prepare a plan

241
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:07,865
to quickly boost my physical strength.

242
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:10,666
What are you talking about?

243
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:12,185
Don't ask.

244
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:15,026
I need to improve my reflexes
in a short time.

245
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:17,644
Got it.

246
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:18,626
When do you need it?

247
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:19,666
Tomorrow.

255
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:44,735

You can't rush it.

266
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,386
You need to rest.

267
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:48,225
How long do you think

268
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:50,945
it will take to meet my expectations?

269
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:53,546
At least a few months more.

270
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:57,786
No, that's too slow.

271
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:00,705
Shorten it to two weeks.

272
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:02,725
This is simply impossible.

273
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:04,705
You can't regulate with that, you know?

274
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,705
I have to.

275
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:08,306
Time is pressing.

276
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:13,026
Xiao Ran, what on earth
are you hiding from me?

277
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:17,906
Tell me already.

278
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,865
Fine. If you don't tell me,

279
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:24,125
go find someone else.

280
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:25,465
I can tell you.

281
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:28,225
But you must promise me two things.

282
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:30,225
First,

283
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:32,386
don't get shocked after hearing it.

284
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:33,345
Second,

285
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:36,386
don't tell anyone about it.

286
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:39,786
Okay. Tell me now.

287
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:56,146
Where did it go wrong?

288
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:58,345
Why can't I log in?

289
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,385
Wu, it's Boss.

290
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:07,425
Boss.

291
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:09,324
How are you?

292
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,364
Feeling any better?

293
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:11,585
I'm much better now.

294
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,804
How's the game coming along?

295
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:15,905
Have you found a solution?

296
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:20,485
Of course, Boss.

297
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:23,165
Don't worry. You know we're
more than capable of this, right?

298
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,284
You can certainly

299
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:25,485
count on us

300
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:26,946
to settle a small issue like this.

301
00:17:28,246 --> 00:17:29,044
That's right.

302
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:29,725
Boss,

303
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:32,546
I'm starting to doubt Mr. Vic now.

304
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:34,986
He's not as amazing as the rumors say.

305
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:36,885
We can handle

306
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:38,445
his little trick with ease.

307
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:40,425
You don't need to worry about it.

308
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:43,625
Let me know
as soon as you encounter any problems.

309
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:45,685
Boss, rest well.

310
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:47,105
The fixing's in good hands.

311
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:48,564
Right, Boss.

312
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:49,604
Leave it to us.

313
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:50,604
We guarantee

314
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,385
we won't let you down.

315
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,245
Don't take Vic too lightly.

316
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:58,345
You need to be cautious.

317
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,524
All right, Boss.

318
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:01,564
Don't worry.

319
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:04,026
Well, don't let me keep you.

320
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:23,564
Ms. Song, how do you feel now?

321
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:24,786
Is your condition improving?

322
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:26,905
I feel much stronger now.

323
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:28,925
Mr. Xiao especially asked me

324
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:30,986
to prepare some nourishment for you.

325
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:32,124
You have to rest more.

326
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,345
Just let us know if you need anything.

327
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:36,625
There's no need for the trouble.

328
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,546
This is our duty.

329
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:41,466
Mr. Xiao said he would come home late.

330
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,186
You don't have to wait
for him for dinner.

331
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:45,005
All right.

332
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:46,546
I will get back to work then.

333
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,306
What am I taking this?

334
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:06,026
I told you not to be too shocked.

335
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:07,485
But

336
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:10,065
this is quite unbelievable.

337
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,706
Is there no solution
other than this?

338
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:16,145
For the time being, no.

339
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:21,306
But you can't do it all by yourself.

340
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:22,925
Everyone should try to do something.

341
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:24,485
Fighting bosses in the game is easy.

342
00:19:24,486 --> 00:19:25,946
We can do this with you.

343
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,345
You can't.

344
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:29,324
Xiong said

345
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:31,364
the game world is currently in a mess.

346
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:33,905
No one could tell what would happen
if someone entered.

347
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,385
It could be dangerous.

348
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:39,425
I can't drag you into this.

349
00:19:39,565 --> 00:19:42,506
Still, you can't take the risk alone.

350
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:44,844
It's just a possibility.

351
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:46,145
Don't be nervous.

352
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,706
Maybe we should tell them.

353
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:58,145
Didn't you promise not to tell anyone?

354
00:19:58,765 --> 00:19:59,804
I'm worried

355
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:01,786
this is too much for you.

356
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:04,625
I have you.

357
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:07,165
As long as I can achieve
the training goal quickly,

358
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,546
it should be no problem.

359
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:12,786
Considering the current situation,

360
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:16,266
it's hard to shorten
the training period.

361
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:19,804
If

362
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:22,205
I provide you
with specific combat statistics,

363
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:23,506
do you think it's doable?

364
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:28,226
Well, I will give it a try.

365
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,885
Is the character that challenging

366
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:32,786
and worth so much of our effort?

367
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:37,506
I can't be sure
if I get a chance to fail,

368
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:40,266
so I must be very well-prepared.

369
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:45,746
Can you tell me who the character is?

370
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,345
Song Chongming.

371
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:54,306
Do we really have to go?

372
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:58,345
You need a good rest now.

373
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:00,965
Traveling is the best medicine.

374
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:03,645
You need to be in a good mood
to regain your fighting spirit

375
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:05,865
and figure out solutions.

376
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:06,685
Well,

377
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:09,524
set everything aside for now

378
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,226
and enjoy yourself for a few days.

379
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:12,405
By the time you come back,

380
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:13,825
you will be fully recharged.

381
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:18,625
Yiyi, traveling takes too many days.

382
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:22,005
I'm worried something might go wrong
with the game

383
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:23,706
while I'm away.

384
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:28,186
After all, I'm the one in charge.

385
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:30,965
I can't leave my team here

386
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:32,425
and go traveling.

387
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:35,226
How about this?

388
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:36,844
We will go

389
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,044
after the game goes online.

390
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:38,965
No way.

391
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:39,804
Song Lingling,

392
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:41,604
I know you are worried

393
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:42,725
about everything.

394
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:45,186
That's why I take you to somewhere else.

395
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,804
I understand

396
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:49,685
you want to resolve all the problems.

397
00:21:49,686 --> 00:21:51,385
But do you know

398
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:53,084
this has become

399
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:55,145
your burden?

400
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:58,226
Lingling,

401
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:01,266
you are my best friend.

402
00:22:01,605 --> 00:22:03,865
I want you to be all right.

403
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:08,706
So please don't turn me down, okay?

404
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:11,746
Don't say that.

405
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:13,764
Why are you making it sound so serious?

406
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,706
I will go with you.

407
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:17,986
I will take your word on it.
No backsies.

408
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:21,445
You see,

409
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:23,786
the last trip we went on together

410
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,266
was after our graduation, right?

411
00:22:26,726 --> 00:22:28,865
Time flies.

412
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:30,524
This time,

413
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:32,725
I will make sure everything is ready

414
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,105
and come up with a perfect plan.

415
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,205
It will surely be

416
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,306
an unforgettable trip for you.

417
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:39,825
Hold on.

418
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,345
I remember

419
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:44,625
that our graduation trip

420
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:46,905
got canceled because something
came up at school.

421
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:48,306
Yeah.

422
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:49,405
But

423
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:52,306
we had already bought tickets
to Switzerland.

424
00:22:52,365 --> 00:22:53,685
We even went to beg

425
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:54,725
our lecturer

426
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:56,665
and apologize for getting his approval.

427
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:58,084
In the end,

428
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,786
we missed the graduation event.

429
00:23:01,686 --> 00:23:03,026
What's wrong with you?

430
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:05,506
How could you forget
something so important?

431
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:10,026
It has been too long.

432
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:11,905
Is it?

433
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,764
I think

434
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:15,084
you only care about Xiao Ran now

435
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:16,786
and have ignored me.

436
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:18,324
That's not true.

437
00:23:18,325 --> 00:23:21,466
Yiyi, you are my best friend.

438
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:24,026
I'm kidding you.

439
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:27,946
Let's prepare everything we need
for the trip.

440
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:30,284
Once I come up with the plan
and schedule,

441
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,665
we can set off.

442
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:32,905
Sure.

443
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:41,865
Too slow.

444
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:44,466
Are you all right?

445
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:47,804
Come again.

446
00:23:47,805 --> 00:23:48,725
Come on.

447
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:49,746
One, two.

448
00:23:57,285 --> 00:24:01,105
We really went to Switzerland together.

449
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:04,226
Why did I forget it?

450
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:26,425
Lingling, why are you working again?

451
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:31,825
I'm searching for something.

452
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:35,345
I know you're worried about the game.

453
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:37,905
But you need

454
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:39,825
to relax now.

455
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:42,345
I will handle the rest.

456
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:43,885
But

457
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:47,065
Vic is a world-class gamer.

458
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,585
If he intends to ruin the game,

459
00:24:49,646 --> 00:24:51,706
it must be tricky for us.

460
00:24:52,446 --> 00:24:54,986
I called Xiong and Wu earlier today.

461
00:24:55,246 --> 00:24:58,226
Even though they sounded casual,

462
00:24:58,406 --> 00:25:00,625
I still wanted to confirm

463
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:03,266
if they really found a solution.

464
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:05,165
Vic was just trying to scare you.

465
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,524
He said that

466
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:08,865
because he wanted
to take the hard dish away.

467
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:12,786
Xiong and the rest have already
found the solution.

468
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,065
The problem can be solved in no time.

469
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:19,364
Maybe I'm overthinking.

470
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:21,065
I should trust them.

471
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:23,585
After all,

472
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:25,524
they are game experts

473
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,905
I handpicked.

474
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:29,186
It seems I have
a good assessment of talent.

475
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,506
What about me?

476
00:25:33,926 --> 00:25:36,706
Did you pick me with a purpose?

477
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:42,226
No, you delivered yourself to me.

478
00:25:42,805 --> 00:25:44,645
You are getting bolder.

479
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:45,986
How dare you make fun of me.

480
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:47,124
Watch this.

481
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:47,524
All right.

482
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:49,186
I'm sorry.

483
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:56,746
This is your punishment.

484
00:25:58,006 --> 00:26:01,165
By the way, Yiyi said

485
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,226
she wants to take me on a trip.

486
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:04,665
What do you think?

487
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,706
I know

488
00:26:09,726 --> 00:26:12,625
my condition is weak,
and I can't go out.

489
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:14,266
But

490
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:17,105
I don't want to upset Yiyi.

491
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,986
If you don't agree with this...

492
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:20,585
You should go.

493
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:25,506
I was sad

494
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:27,065
because I couldn't go with you.

495
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:31,665
True.

496
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:34,065
If I leave now,

497
00:26:34,285 --> 00:26:36,364
you will have to face everything
by yourself.

498
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:38,186
You must be under great stress.

499
00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:41,065
I'm just not used to

500
00:26:41,285 --> 00:26:42,986
not having you around.

501
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:46,685
Whenever you miss me,

502
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:47,925
look at my photos.

503
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,466
I will be back soon.

504
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,546
Okay.

505
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:18,186
Where did it go?

506
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:20,306
I can't find it.

507
00:27:23,446 --> 00:27:24,385
What's wrong?

508
00:27:26,365 --> 00:27:28,186
Did you see my necklace?

509
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,466
The one I always wear it.

510
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:32,524
I rarely take it off.

511
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,986
I was wearing it yesterday.

512
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,506
But it disappeared now.

513
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:37,986
Is the necklace very important to you?

514
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,405
You have been wearing it

515
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:40,865
since I first met you.

516
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,706
I designed this necklace

517
00:27:45,486 --> 00:27:47,905
to remember my brother.

518
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:52,466
He couldn't grow up with me,

519
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:55,665
but I want to keep him in my memory.

520
00:27:56,845 --> 00:27:58,506
That's when

521
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:01,506
I decided to design
a game character for him.

522
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:07,625
I'm too careless.

523
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:09,865
How could it have gone missing?

524
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:14,524
It seems you miss him

525
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:15,905
more than I thought.

526
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:23,546
If he hadn't saved me back then,

527
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:26,865
I would've been hit.

528
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:30,546
I know I can't turn back time.

529
00:28:31,206 --> 00:28:32,266
But

530
00:28:33,206 --> 00:28:35,665
if I were given a chance,

531
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:38,226
I would rather sacrifice myself

532
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:41,425
than lose him.

533
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:45,865
Calm down first.

534
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:47,506
I will help you.

535
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:48,786
Sit.

536
00:28:50,726 --> 00:28:51,825
Sit here.

537
00:29:12,605 --> 00:29:13,665
Did you find it?

538
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,665
Not yet.

539
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:34,905
Found it.

540
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:39,825
But the chain is broken.

541
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,466
I will ask Mr. Xiang
to get it fixed tomorrow.

542
00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:49,466
I was thinking

543
00:29:49,886 --> 00:29:51,425
that losing the necklace

544
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:53,665
could be

545
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:55,786
a bad sign.

546
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:57,645
We have found it now.

547
00:29:57,646 --> 00:29:59,925
It means any problem

548
00:29:59,926 --> 00:30:01,306
will be resolved.

549
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:13,925
(I promised Lingling)

550
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:14,925
(to keep her brother)

551
00:30:14,926 --> 00:30:16,986
(in the game.)

552
00:30:17,486 --> 00:30:19,946
(Am I going back on my promise now?)

553
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:21,844
(But if I don't do this,)

554
00:30:21,845 --> 00:30:23,425
(Lingling would...)

555
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,226
(But how should I explain to her)

556
00:30:26,486 --> 00:30:28,825
(about her brother's disappearance?)

557
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:37,885
What's it?

558
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:38,905
Mr. Xiao,

559
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,706
there's a new problem in the game.

560
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,725
The personalization program

561
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:45,345
has caused Song Chongming's code
to update automatically.

562
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:46,725
Some NPCs

563
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:48,425
are disappearing too.

564
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:49,165
At this point,

565
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:51,205
we can only modify the program
externally

566
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:52,986
to maintain the current state.

567
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:53,965
However,

568
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:55,425
that doesn't look promising.

569
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,506
Probably, after some time,

570
00:30:57,686 --> 00:30:59,405
the game will completely collapse.

571
00:30:59,406 --> 00:31:01,345
How much time is left?

572
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:03,786
According to the disruption speed,

573
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:06,026
we have a week left at most.

574
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:07,524
And...

575
00:31:07,525 --> 00:31:08,865
What?

576
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:11,245
The longer we delay,

577
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,405
the stronger Song Chongming will become.

578
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:15,005
Our chances of winning

579
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,385
will decrease as well.

580
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:19,345
