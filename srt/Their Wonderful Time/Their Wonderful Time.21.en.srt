00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,989
Mr. Xiao?

30
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,909
Uncle Xiang.

31
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,749
Mr. Xiao,

32
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,189
I've bought all of these
as per your request.

33
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,410
Why did you buy so many things?

34
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,389
Mr. Xiao said your body
has been weak lately.

35
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,331
He instructed me
to buy these tonics for you.

36
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:09,851
Thank you, Uncle Xiang.

37
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:15,870
Do you think I have a large appetite?

38
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:18,210
I can't finish all of this, you know?

39
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,090
I've sought the consultation
of a nutritionist.

40
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:21,110
All of these are bought

41
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:23,571
according to the nutrients
your body needs.

42
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:26,131
I'll also create a different menu
for you every day.

43
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,990
Besides that,

44
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:29,011
there's also...

45
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,990
From now on,

46
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,600
to ensure that you get enough rest,

47
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,700
(Rest Schedule)
I've formulated a strict schedule for you.

48
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,970
I'll monitor your progress as well.

49
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:46,629
Wake up at 6 A.M.?

50
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,851
Sleep at 10 A.M.?

51
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,691
Exercise in the morning, take a walk,
read books, and go to the gym?

52
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,411
My schedule is so packed.

53
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,229
How can I finish all those chores?

54
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,411
Moreover, I need to make
preparations for the game too.

55
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,949
Besides the rules that were mentioned,

56
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,349
I also came up with
a special rule for you.

57
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,430
I'll kiss you whenever you mention

58
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:13,891
the game project.

59
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:16,810
Will you mention it again?

60
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,210
That's more like it.

61
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,270
I plan to cook for you.

62
00:03:27,271 --> 00:03:29,691
I'll make you
some snow pear and white fungus soup.

63
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,370
But the BBQ you did last time...

64
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:37,370
I mean,

65
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:41,011
it's too tiring for you
to cook by yourself.

66
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:44,550
I've made adequate preparations
this time around.

67
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:46,090
I'll definitely succeed.

68
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:47,851

93
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,535

I know that you'll try

100
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,590
to work in secret after I leave.

101
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:16,070
That's why I prepared a puzzle for you.

102
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,429
Your mission today

103
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,789
is to finish it.

104
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,011
I'll check on your progress
when I'm back.

105
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,030
Now, you're showing your true colors.

106
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,710
You bought me a gift,
yet you want me to complete it for you?

107
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:29,989
I just want you to relax
and take a break.

108
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,970
You should stop thinking about the game.

109
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,869
Alright. Got it.

110
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,451
I won't skive.

111
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,650
I have a meeting
to attend at the company.

112
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,789
Later, Ms. Qi will remind you to rest

113
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,410
according to the schedule.

114
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:44,811
When will you return, then?

115
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:49,131
What? Are you reluctant to part with me?

116
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,131
Of course not.

117
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,970
Don't worry. I'll return soon.

118
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,571
Be a good girl, okay?

119
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,610
I never expected this game
to have such a function.

120
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,610
One can actually enter the game
using brainwaves.

121
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,190
On one hand,

122
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:43,549
it transcended
the original game experience.

123
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,630
On the other hand,

124
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,770
it can establish a connection
with the players' brainwaves.

125
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,869
Although it's just
a pure gaming experience at this stage,

126
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,989
if I can design a program for this,

127
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,710
the system

128
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,989
can automatically capture
the players' brainwave data

129
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,190
while they're playing the game.

130
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,571
It can analyze
one's personality and interests.

131
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:03,510
Whether it's selling this data
to the advertisers

132
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:06,730
or using it for demand analysis,

133
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,891
I can make a fortune from it.

134
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:11,931
This project can literally
make me rich overnight.

135
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,051
It's such a waste

136
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,251
to use it in a game like this.

137
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,630
Old man, cut to the chase.

138
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,730
I need to go to the beauty parlor later.

139
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,290
Just look at you.

140
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,669
It's rare for us to chat, you know?

141
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,960
Do you have anything to say?
If you don't, I'm hanging up.

142
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,131
I do!

143
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:30,451
I heard

144
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,349
that you participated

145
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,870
in one of Shanhai Group's
game project, right?

146
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:34,390
That's right.

147
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:35,390
Didn't you say

148
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,589
I have the right
to make some investments?

149
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,531
That's right.

150
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,171
The money you spent

151
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:42,150
is of no concern.

152
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:44,909
Mainly, I wish to find out

153
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,589
whether you were doing it
for Xiao Ran's sake

154
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,931
or Lin Qiao's sake.

155
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:54,309
You don't need to test me like that.

156
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,789
I told you long ago.

157
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,291
I'm going to get married
to Lin Qiao in the future.

158
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:00,531
Of course I understand your intention.

159
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:04,750
But Mr. Xiao doesn't like Lin Qiao.

160
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:06,829
That's why I arranged a marriage

161
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,651
for you and Xiao Ran.

162
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:11,750
You're the only daughter I have.

163
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,429
I have to take

164
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,669
your happiness into consideration.

165
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,890
No matter who you get married to,

166
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,470
as the future person in charge
of Shen Group,

167
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:25,051
you have to consider
the company's interests and its future.

168
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,051
I'll sum this up.

169
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,090
The person you're getting married

170
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,250
must be the person in charge
of Shanhai Group.

171
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,870
Got it.

172
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:37,010
That's an easy request to fulfill.
I'll satisfy your request.

173
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,949
Don't worry.

174
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,110
Lin Qiao will definitely

175
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,390
become your perfect son-in-law

176
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,510
in the near future.

177
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:43,651
Excellent.

178
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:46,150
I can rest at ease, then.

179
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:47,130
Goodbye.

180
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,651
Since the board of directors
are being this insistent,

181
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:57,730
I assume Dad will find out about this

182
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,610
soon enough.

183
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:05,230
Do you truly think
that Dad is in the dark?

184
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,010
He's very intelligent.

185
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:10,171
I assume he set
the issue aside until now

186
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:13,171
because he's thinking
of a better solution.

187
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:18,090
He'll surely still prioritize
the company's interests.

188
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,691
He'll never

189
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,531
agree to this.

190
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,771
I know that.

191
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,610
That's why I have to tell him

192
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,210
that what's done is done.

193
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:36,811
It's better if we don't drag
Ms. Song into this.

194
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,651
What about this?

195
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:45,051
Xiangyu and I can visit him.

196
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,931
Brother, don't tell me you're trying
to bear all the blame again?

197
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,691
Dad values you the most.

198
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,610
I'll be fine.

199
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,730
I'm the most suitable candidate
to deal with the situation.

200
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,171
No way. I'll never agree to this.

201
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,331
Don't worry.

202
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:07,970
Dad won't punish me too harshly

203
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:10,411
in front of Xiangyu.

204
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,571
And, I'm no longer in the company.

205
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,949
It'll have the least impact

206
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,291
if I take the punishment.

207
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,531
Why are you always
trying to bear the blame for me?

208
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,829
I came here to discuss
this issue with you

209
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,709
only to see

210
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,909
if we can come up with
solutions that are more appropriate.

211
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,171
I'm not here to make you
bear the blame on my behalf.

212
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,051
I know that.

213
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,709
But you're telling the public
that you're canceling the marriage.

214
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,709
You'll offend Shen Group by doing so.

215
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,520
Instead of doing so,
why don't I just tell him

216
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,850
that Xiangyu and I are in love?

217
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,309
This way, it won't affect the marriage alliance
between the Shen and the Xiao family.

218
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,691
It can also stabilize
the company's morale.

219
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:50,110
The worst thing we can do

220
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:51,470
right now

221
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:53,890
is to direct this matter to you
and Ms. Song.

222
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:56,411
After all, you guys are in charge
of the game project.

223
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,411
This might affect the entire situation.

224
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:01,030
We shouldn't cause another commotion.

225
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,850
This time, you should listen to me.

226
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,970
It's not like I'm trying
to bear the blame on your behalf.

227
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,370
I just wish to have
an honest conversation with him.

228
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,850
I want to tell him about

229
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:12,090
my true feelings.

230
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:17,090
Seems like

231
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:19,970
you've already made up your mind.

232
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:22,850
Yeah.

233
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,571
It's time for us to have
an honest conversation.

234
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:37,411
Chairman.

235
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:38,829
I never expected the directors

236
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,210
to tell you about that.

237
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:43,610
Seems like

238
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:46,451
Xiao Ran has made many enemies

239
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,171
within the company, huh?

240
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:52,370
They even said

241
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,970
that he was in a relationship

242
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:57,970
with a female game designer.

243
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,490
They said that
she was mentally unstable too.

244
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:02,210
Is that news even trustworthy?

245
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,291
He's so protective of

246
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,850
Lan Yao in the company.

247
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,291
He even suspended the game project
because of her.

248
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:15,250
It's no wonder people
make such accusations.

249
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,850
He's treating the company affairs
as if they're child's play.

250
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,691
It's no wonder the shareholders
are angry at him.

251
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,789
Besides that, you and Chairman Shen

252
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,010
have already arranged
a marriage for them as well.

253
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,540
If that rumor turns out to be true,

254
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,000
judging from Mr. Xiao's personality,
I'm afraid the situation

255
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:37,730
will be hard to deal with.

256
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,451
It's time to clarify
the situation with them.

257
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:44,970
If not, it'll make it as if
I'm covering up for his actions.

258
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,210
What do you plan to do, then?

259
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:51,870
Try and invite that so-called Lan Yao

260
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:53,890
to our residence.

261
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,451
I wish to see her.

262
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,210
Alright.

263
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,850
Uncle Xiang.

264
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,130
Ms. Song.

265
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:25,210
Uncle Zhang
is waiting for you downstairs.

266
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,051
Who's Uncle Zhang?

267
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,370
Uncle Zhang
is the chairman's housekeeper.

268
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:33,250
He said the chairman
wish to see you today.

269
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:34,669
You mean Xiao Ran's father?

270
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,651
That's right.

271
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,189
Why don't you ask Mr. Xiao about it

272
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,090
and see if it was his arrangement?

273
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,210
No need for that.

274
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:43,490
Tell Uncle Zhang that I'll head downstairs
after getting changed.

275
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,811
Alright.

276
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:53,850
How did it go?

277
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:57,669
You're here. Great timing.
I have something to discuss with you.

278
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,970
What is it?

279
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:00,949
Now,

280
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,309
I've already analyzed the game's
world-building rules.

281
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,909
And, I've provided solutions

282
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,771
based on balance considerations.

283
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,150
As long as Lan Yao can rewrite

284
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:09,630
the program and code

285
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:11,870
based on the data I provided,

286
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,589
the game's issue

287
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,451
can be resolved easily.

288
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,051
What do you mean by this?

289
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:27,970
I wish to negotiate a deal with you.

290
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:32,750
Are you unclear
with your current position?

291
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:34,510
As an investor,

292
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:37,130
I hired you
to repair the bug in the game.

293
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,789
I'm your employer,

294
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,051
and you're my employee.

295
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:43,210
Now, you want to
negotiate a deal with me?

296
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,571
Don't you think that sounds ridiculous?

297
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,210
I think I have the right to do so.

298
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:49,870
After all, no one else

299
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:51,931
can fix the bug yet.

300
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:53,890
What are your conditions?

301
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,909
To you,

302
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,730
my conditions are nothing.

303
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,571
It's simple.

304
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:01,309
I'm just impressed

305
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,030
by the game Lan Yao had designed.

306
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:06,090
I wish to participate
in a forum overseas with this data.

307
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:07,709
As a shareholder,

308
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,610
you should have
the right to do so, right?

309
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,990
You just want to participate in a forum?

310
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:13,451
It's that simple?

311
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,669
Although I didn't invent the game,

312
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,390
the principles and design involved

313
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:19,730
are very attractive to me.

314
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,069
I just want to show them
to everyone else.

315
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,171
It's only meant for
an academic exchange.

316
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,990
If so, shouldn't we

317
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:29,549
obtain Lan Yao's permission
before doing so?

318
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,270
She designed the game after all.

319
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:33,829
You see, this is a private matter.

320
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,730
I don't want to alarm too many people.

321
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:39,490
Ms. Shen, if you're not willing
to cooperate with me...

322
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:49,331
Fine.

323
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:54,771
You can take the data with you.

324
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,990
Ms. Shen, I do like

325
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,730
working together with you.

326
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:12,051
Ms. Song, over here, please.

327
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:28,090
Chairman has been waiting for you.

328
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,811
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

329
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,251
Have a seat.

330
00:18:00,191 --> 00:18:03,370
Ms. Song, I heard
that you were in poor health.

331
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:08,170
I told my housekeeper to prepare a tea
that's good for the liver and mind.

332
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,430
It can help you

333
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:13,030
to think more clearly after consumption.

334
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:14,011
Have a try.

335
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,270
No need for that.

336
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:18,629
You may get straight to the point.

337
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,251
I can think clearly right now.

338
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,690
I just want to know this.

339
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:24,410
Ms. Song,

340
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,011
why do you like Xiao Ran?

341
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,731
You're trying to ask me

342
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,731
whether or not I like
Xiao Ran for his status

343
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,690
or wealth, right?

344
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,090
That's right.

345
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:44,130
When it comes to liking someone,

346
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,069
I don't know

347
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,450
how to describe it
with words accurately.

348
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:49,109
But Xiao Ran and I

349
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,251
have been through
many hardships together.

350
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,430
I believe

351
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,930
that we won't give up
on each other easily.

352
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:58,650
You're still young.

353
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:00,731
Many things

354
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:03,450
aren't as simple as they seem.

355
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,251
The Xiao Ran you're seeing right now,

356
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:10,170
he's backed by the mighty Shanhai Group.

357
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,389
If, one day,

358
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,650
he leaves Shanhai Group

359
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,491
and loses his backer,

360
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:19,971
will you still choose to be with him?

361
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,030
Even if he loses everything,

362
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,610
I think I won't change my answer.

363
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:30,710
If so, are you sure that
Xiao Ran can leave everything behind

364
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,090
and lead a poor life with you?

365
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:36,349
I know.

366
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,470
To you,

367
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:39,789
I'm not the best partner for Xiao Ran.

368
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,971
But it's my choice to fancy him.

369
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,850
I hope you won't
make things difficult for him.

370
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:47,109
You told me to come here

371
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,291
so that you could
make me give up on him, right?

372
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,130
But I think

373
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,410
supporting him right now
is more important than anything else.

374
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:58,690
Ms. Song, seems like
you're pretty stubborn.

375
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:03,690
If so, are you sure

376
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:06,069
that you're someone very important

377
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,690
to Xiao Ran?

378
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:09,430
If he has to choose between you

379
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:11,170
and the company,

380
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:12,370
I assume

381
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,610
the result might not be
what you imagined to be.

382
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:19,710
I'll always respect his decision

383
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:20,930
no matter what it is.

384
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,090
Uncle Xiang, where's Lingling?

385
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:29,450
Chairman sent his housekeeper here
to pick Ms. Song up.

386
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,930
Were you in the dark?

387
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,650
I thought it was your arrangement.

388
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:37,011
When did it happen?

389
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,170
She's been there for a few hours.

390
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:41,309
Alright, got it.

391
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,750
You must tell me

392
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:44,410
if something like this happens again.

393
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,811
So, it wasn't your arrangement?

394
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:50,491
Will Ms. Song be in trouble, then?

395
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,731
We'll only know after I pay him a visit.

396
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:10,051
Dad, where's Lingling?

397
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,629
You rarely come back, don't you?

398
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,251
Why the rush today?

399
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:19,890
Why did you bring her here in secret?

400
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,470
I just wanted to inquire
about your recent condition.

401
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:27,890
By the way, I've told my men
to send her back.

402
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,470
I know. You brought her here

403
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:40,690
so that you could convince her
to leave me of her own accord

404
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:43,360
and maintain the marriage alliance
between us and the Shen Family.

405
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,470
But I've already expressed my stand.

406
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,750
I'll never marry Shen Xiangyu.

407
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:48,850
Stop your nonsense.

408
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,850
Now, you represent more than yourself.

409
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,170
You're also representing
the entire company.

410
00:21:55,671 --> 00:21:57,309
The marriage alliance
with the Shen Family

411
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,829
will be very beneficial

412
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,610
to the company's future development.

413
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:06,190
You won't let Shanhai Group

414
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,990
fall in your hands, will you?

415
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:11,811
Dad, I'm not trying
to make you angry on purpose.

416
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:14,251
But this time,

417
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:16,450
I cannot heed your will.

418
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,731
You have no idea, huh?

419
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:23,811
Ms. Song has already
agreed to leave you.

420
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,251
Did you say she agreed to leave me?

421
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,090
That's right.

422
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:31,069
I plan to give her a huge sum.

423
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,629
However, she has to leave you

424
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,789
to acquire that sum.

425
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,771
That's impossible.

426
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,910
If you truly think

427
00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:37,670
that relationships are worthless,

428
00:22:37,671 --> 00:22:38,950
why do you still miss Mom

429
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:41,011
after her passing, then?

430
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:46,589
Dad, I've decided
that she's the one for me.

431
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,750
I choose to believe her

432
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:49,531
no matter what you say.

433
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,090
Even if we are to break up,

434
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,051
I'll only accept it
if she breaks the news to me.

435
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:54,349
When I was young,

436
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,789
I remember Mom told me

437
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,950
not to give up
on the person I fancy easily

438
00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:59,811
if I encounter her.

439
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:01,690
Back then, I didn't understand
what she meant.

440
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,549
But now,
I've encountered the one for me.

441
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,811
I understood what she meant.

442
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,309
Perhaps there will always be
someone in the world

443
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,531
who makes you want
to protect her without hesitation.

444
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,291
Now, she has appeared in my life.

445
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,710
Therefore, no matter what happens,

446
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:15,690
I won't give up on her easily.

447
00:23:16,431 --> 00:23:19,389
What about the engagement
with the Shen Family, then?

448
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,011
How do you plan to deal with that?

449
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:25,571
I've never agreed to the engagement
from the very start.

450
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,731
If Uncle Shen wants to be angry at me,

451
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:30,370
I can apologize to him in person.

452
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:32,610
You're willing to bow down

453
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:34,510
and admit your fault for her sake?

454
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:35,410
That's right.

455
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:37,930
It's because I don't want
to miss out on her.

456
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,971
I don't want to miss out on you either.

457
00:23:44,271 --> 00:23:47,291
Lingling, are you okay?

458
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:48,690
I'm fine.

459
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:50,750
I didn't compromise with him

460
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:52,170
or give up on you.

461
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,470
Didn't we say we would do

462
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:56,771
many, many things together?

463
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,491
I know.

464
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:01,291
Xiao Ran.

465
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,149
Do you know

466
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,240
what the people in the company
are saying about you?

467
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,451
They said you were seduced by a vixen and
that you were negligent in your duties!

468
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:11,291
They said you were treating company affairs
as if they were child's play!

469
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:12,771
She was the cause

470
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,811
of everything, right?

471
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:18,410
Mr. Xiao,

472
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:20,670
I know it's difficult to advance
the project at the moment.

473
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:23,331
But I'm largely responsible for it.

474
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,170
Xiao Ran already did his best.

475
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:28,571
Please don't blame him for this.

476
00:24:29,191 --> 00:24:31,251
I don't wish to blame him
for this as well.

477
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:32,890
However,

478
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:35,930
I need to consider
the company's interest.

479
00:24:36,671 --> 00:24:38,930
If he insists on
being together with you,

480
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,170
he has

481
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,549
to choose between you

482
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,130
and the company today.

483
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,051
It's either you leave the company

484
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,510
and be together with her

485
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:51,470
or you become the company's CEO

486
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:53,211
and marry Shen Xiangyu.

487
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:55,389
If I have to make a choice,

488
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,211
I'll choose to leave the company.

489
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,270
Have you made up your mind?

490
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:00,731
If you do so,

491
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,470
everything you do in the future

492
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:04,491
won't progress as smoothly
as the affairs of the past.

493
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,190
To you,

494
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:08,069
you will lose everything.

495
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,690
You'll have to start from scratch.

496
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:12,890
This is my only choice.

497
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,650
I suggest you spend some time
to consider it.

498
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:23,750
You should stay for dinner.

499
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:25,130
I hope

500
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,370
that I can get a different answer

501
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:29,051
from you later.

502
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,069
Chairman, aren't you

503
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,491
putting too much pressure on Mr. Xiao?

504
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,771
It's time for him to grow up.

505
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,890
I have to let him know

506
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,731
that he cannot get his way all the time.

507
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,650
What if he does intend
to be together with Ms. Song?

508
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:02,270
If so, he should be prepared
for the pressure

509
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:04,011
he'll face in the future.

510
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,531
If so, do you plan to let Mr. Xiao
leave Shanhai Group?

511
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,291
He's still young.

512
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:15,251
He'll sacrifice everything
for the sake of love.

513
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,971
Even so, he has to understand
the circumstances he's in.

514
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:21,771
The marriage alliance with the Shen Family
will benefit him greatly.

515
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,051
I hope that he'll understand
my intentions soon.

516
00:26:28,031 --> 00:26:29,610
He'll understand them.

517
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:32,610
I'm getting old now.

518
00:26:33,431 --> 00:26:36,090
I can't keep the youngsters in check.

519
00:26:44,991 --> 00:26:46,370
What should we do?

520
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,149
I don't think your father

521
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,531
will let us leave until you say yes.

522
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:58,011
Aren't you worried?

523
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,850
Worried about what?

524
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:03,291
Do you expect me to
say yes to my father's proposal,

525
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,230
which is to leave you

526
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:05,869
and marry Shen Xiangyu?

527
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,531
Of course not.

528
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,051
But you see,

529
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:11,829
you kept insisting that
you want to be together with me.

530
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,130
I'm sure your father
will be upset about that.

531
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:17,491
Of course I don't wish
to break up with you.

532
00:27:17,711 --> 00:27:19,890
But aren't we being selfish

533
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:23,370
by indulging in our own desires here?

534
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,450
Silly girl,

535
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,410
love is selfish from the start.

536
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:30,670
Since we can't control
other people's thoughts,

537
00:27:30,671 --> 00:27:32,771
we should stay true to our decisions.

538
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,430
But judging from
your father's personality,

539
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:37,690
it's likely that he won't
agree to your decision easily.

540
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:41,370
Isn't there a way for us
to have the best of both worlds?

541
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,030
- Why don't we run away right now?
- Wait.

542
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,531
That's too reckless.

543
00:27:46,671 --> 00:27:48,211
Calm down for now.

544
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,971
Let me see if there's a better solution.

545
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,450
You do have a point.

546
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,470
If we run away right now,

547
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:00,011
I'll lose everything I possess.

548
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,331
Are you afraid that you have
to support me forever?

549
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,971
Why do all loving couples

550
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,370
have to endure such hardships
since ancient times?

551
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,829
What? You want to go there now?

552
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,571
But I'm not ready yet.

553
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,109
We have no time.

554
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,510
Judging from Dad's personality,

555
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:21,549
I'm sure he'll be very angry
when he finds out

556
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,069
that Ran and Ms. Song are a couple.

557
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,230
We have to go and save them.

558
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:26,531
But...

559
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,629
This is my first time

560
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,690
seeing Uncle Xiao as your girlfriend.

561
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:34,410
I'm quite nervous.

562
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:35,811
What if

563
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:38,370
he disagrees with our relationship?

564
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,890
What if he gets angry?

565
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,531
What if...

566
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,890
Don't panic. I'm here.

567
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:50,230
How can I not panic?

568
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:52,170
This is so sudden.

569
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,491
We have to do this eventually.

570
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,370
Since we're already a couple,

571
00:28:57,711 --> 00:28:59,410
why don't we be honest with him?

572
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,731
Are you nervous as well?

573
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:09,629
This is my first time going against him

574
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,211
after all these years.

575
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,610
Uncle Xiao won't blame you for this.

576
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,331
Maybe.

577
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:19,130
But I'm the only one
who can help Ran now.

578
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:22,990
However,

579
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:25,531
I can prepare a present for Uncle Xiao.

580
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,291
I can guarantee
that he'll be pleased with it.

581
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:32,251
What are you up to again?

582
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,890
It's a secret.

583
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:37,170
If so, can we depart now?

584
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,051
Did you live here when you were young?

585
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,950
If so, tell me about

586
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:50,930
your childhood, then.

587
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,840
What childhood stories
would you like to hear?

588
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,051
Tell me something fun.

589
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,149
For example,

590
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,629
you can tell me how mischievous you were

591
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,629
when you were young, Mr. Xiao.

592
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,470
I was an obedient boy.

593
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:04,011
I don't believe you.

594
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:06,771
I think Mr. Lin
was the obedient boy at home.

595
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,090
Brother has always
been obedient since young.

596
00:30:11,511 --> 00:30:13,309
But he would bear the blame for me

597
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,789
whenever I did something wrong.

598
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,130
That's why Dad told him off often.

599
00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:21,331
You guys are pretty close, huh?

600
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,331
But Dad favored me

601
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:25,309
since young.

602
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,930
He didn't pay much attention to Brother.

603
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:30,650
Actually, it was unfair to him.

604
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:32,811
Therefore, I hope

605
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,011
that he could seek out
his own happiness.

606
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,531
I think he already found it.

607
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,370
Are you referring to Xiangyu?

608
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,491
One's eyes do not lie.

609
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,690
Her eyes shine

610
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:51,331
when she looks at Mr. Lin.

611
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:56,670
It's just like how my eyes shine

612
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,211
when I look at you.
