29
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,570
(I remembered
that I've escaped from this room.)

30
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,449
(What am I doing here again?)

31
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:01,770
Are you done?

32
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,530
I'm much cleaner now.

33
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:03,609
No one can tell.

34
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:04,409
That was terrifying.

35
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:06,650
What are you doing?

36
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,450
Darling!

37
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,650
Thank the Divine Tortoise of Penglai.

38
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,009
We've encountered each other again.

39
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,370
I thought

40
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,930
you were already dead.

41
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,170
I thought you would stop
your NPC roleplay

42
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,090
once the beta testing was over.

43
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,129
Tell me, then.

44
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,260
Who are you role-playing as?

45
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,890
Darling, it is I, Xing Tian.

46
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:32,529
Have you forgotten about me?

47
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,370
Darling, where's our child?

48
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,210
(I guess she's been feeling down lately.)

49
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,009
(No problem.)

50
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,249
(I can play along with you.)

51
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,610
Darling, I've been
waiting for you as well.

52
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,729
I missed you so much.

53
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,289
But now,
I have some affairs to attend to.

54
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:56,050
You should wait here for my return.

55
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,650
Give me a second.
I need to answer a call.

56
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,729
That must be the new monster of Jiuzhou.

57
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,370
Darling, don't be afraid.

58
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,170
This time, I'll protect
you and our child.

59
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,409
Song Lingling, don't you think
you've crossed the line?

60
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,809
I'll get angry if you keep this up.

61
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:13,090
Are you not done yet?

62
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,809
I'm leaving.

63
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,129
Darling!

64
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,930
Enough already. Stop acting.

65
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:27,450
My wife has gone through
a drastic change.

66
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:30,689
She doesn't even recognize me now.

67
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,009
I wouldn't have been
transported to such a weird realm

68
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:38,170
if it weren't for that crook.

69
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:41,289
And now, I'm also
trapped inside a woman's body.

70
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,930
My wife is starting to detest me.

71
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,090
I must kill that crook!

72
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,030
What are you doing here?

73
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,249
I'm interested
in the mastermind designer.

74
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,529
Can you introduce

75
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:11,409
that person to me?

76
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,529
Wu! Mr. Xiao is here!

77
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,969
Hide all of Boss's belongings.

78
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:18,130
OK.

79
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,450
Hurry and check your surroundings.

80
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,250
Mr. Xiao.

81
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,369
Why are you here personally?

82
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,770
You could've just called us
if you need anything.

83
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,810
How's the game now?

84
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:42,770
To be honest,

85
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,489
we still can't log into the game yet.

86
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:46,590
When will the issue be resolved?

87
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:48,570
About that...

88
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,369
Look here.

89
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:53,609
Why has Xing Tian vanished?

90
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,489
We suspect
that he was consumed by a glitch.

91
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:57,130
However,

92
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,810
we have to wait for Boss

93
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,529
to confirm the details with us.

94
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:03,969
Lan Yao isn't around?

95
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,529
I came here for nothing, then.

96
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:07,650
Where's Lan Yao?

97
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:09,570
She was hospitalized.

98
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,810
Hospitalized?

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,530
Something minor cropped up.
She should be able to return soon.

100
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,730
No matter what, you have to give me
a solution as soon as possible.

101
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,530
A major issue has cropped up
during the beta testing.

102
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,430
You guys can't afford to bear
the responsibilities

103
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,230
if the launching is delayed
because of this.

104
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:22,929
OK, Mr. Xiao.

105
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:23,489
Understood.

106
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,330
I'll be leaving now.

107
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,729
Mr. Xiao, take care.

108
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,489
Darling.

109
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:04,130
What are these strange items?

110
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:06,529
Where did you get them?

111
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:13,450
Darling, what is that?

112
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,130
Darling, that's a TV.

113
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,489
Darling, you're knowledgeable indeed.

114
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:27,690
I admit defeat, okay?

115
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,929
Babe, let's take a break.

116
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:29,849
I'm begging you here.

117
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,650
God of Heaven.

118
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,969
I was harmed by a villain.

119
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,409
Therefore, I'm stuck in this body.

120
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:44,570
I can't defend you anymore.

121
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,090
Please grant me wisdom and strength

122
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:50,330
to eradicate that villain!

123
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,049
She must've gone berserk.

124
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,210
So, this body of mine

125
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:09,130
belongs to a close friend of my wife's.

126
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,489
Mr. Xiao, I can tell
that you're a romanticist.

127
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:16,570
You're young and talented as well.

128
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,529
Mr. Xiao, everyone knows that
you're the youngest prodigy

129
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,929
of the post-90s generation
in Ge University.

130
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,810
And, I heard that this game has...

131
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:26,650
Embrace your work

132
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,770
with passion.

133
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:28,969
Liu Yiyi, you can do this.

134
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:36,529
Goddess Lanyao will
make an appearance too, am I right?

135
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:37,210
Shanhai Group

136
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,010
will hold a press conference

137
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,890
with Lan Yao Studio,
our main game developer,

138
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,049
in one week.

139
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,529
Crook!

140
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:49,289
Welcome to my live stream.

141
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,929
You crook! Show yourself!

142
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,570
You!

143
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,090
Why did you wreck my TV?

144
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:06,529
Darling,

145
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,849
he's my sworn enemy! He killed you!

146
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,690
Who's your sworn enemy?

147
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:12,010
He...

148
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,810
They... They call them Xiao Ran.

149
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,849
He's also your...

150
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:15,929
He's also your boss.

151
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,010
He's the only boss you can depend on.

152
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,210
Boss?

153
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,250
Could it be

154
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,570
that "boss" is the term
they use to refer to enemies?

155
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:27,130
Darling,

156
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,250
where can I find this "boss", then?

157
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,860
(Shanhai Group)

158
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,020
(Underground Parking)

159
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,170
Is there a secret tunnel?

160
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:22,290
Could this be a monster lair?

161
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,090
Come and take a break.

162
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,810
Have some water.

163
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,210
Although this weapon

164
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:45,889
is too light for me,

165
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,889
it's better than using my bare fists.

166
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,430
I'll deal with Lan Yao myself.

167
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:52,369
Alright, Boss.

168
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:01,290
Goodbye, Boss.

169
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,769
Crook!

170
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,969
Time to die!

171
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:21,969
You're pretty good.

172
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,849
It's you again? Did you tail me?

173
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:24,969
My foot!

174
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:26,849
I'm here to avenge my wife!

175
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,570
Take this!

176
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:31,090
Hello? I'm being assaulted!

177
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,430
I'm at Shanhai Group's
underground parking lot!

178
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:47,930
Bare fists are the best.

179
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:50,930
Darling, I've avenged you.

180
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,450
This is bad. I'm going to...

181
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,740
(Public Security)

182
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:26,410
It definitely wasn't me.

183
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,729
I'm not that skillful.

184
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:28,369
Sit down.

185
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,570
Sir,

186
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:34,729
I have no impression of it at all.

187
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:35,930
I had no idea

188
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,649
why I would appear there.

189
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:40,170
I was lying in the hospital.

190
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,210
For some reason,

191
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,729
I ended up in the parking lot.

192
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:45,009
Are you saying that the woman
in the video wasn't you?

193
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,570
Are you saying that the suspect
assaulted you before?

194
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,290
That's right.

195
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,030
Last time when I was at the hospital.

196
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,570
Officer Li can show you the evidence.

197
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,810
I...

198
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,249
Sir,

199
00:11:58,849 --> 00:11:59,690
I...

200
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,090
I think I was possessed by a spirit.

201
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,530
Answer our questions seriously
during interrogations.

202
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,849
Sir,

203
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:09,570
I'm speaking the truth.

204
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,090
I believe that
she intended to cause harm.

205
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,330
You have to punish her severely.

206
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:14,649
Could it be

207
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,450
that he was trying to frame me?

208
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,170
She would've killed me

209
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,849
had the ambulance come one minute later.

210
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,889
I called an ambulance for him.

211
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,290
Hello? Is this 120?

212
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,769
That's right.

213
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:32,170
Why would I try to save him

214
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,050
if I wanted to kill him
in the first place?

215
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,810
He's an intelligent CEO.

216
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,530
I'm sure he understands my intention.

217
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,330
This is a copy of your dashcam's
recording.

218
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,930
She was the one who called
an ambulance for you.

219
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,769
Does she have a split personality?

220
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:46,849
Could it be

221
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:49,570
I have a split personality
after the electrotherapy?

222
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,369
Is this the work

223
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,609
of my dormant violent nature?

224
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,050
What the heck.

225
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:59,090
Girl, why are you here?

226
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,450
Are you deaf? She's talking to you.

227
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,969
What did you say just now?

228
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:08,450
We were talking to you.
How did you end up here?

229
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,489
They said

230
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:12,969
I killed someone.

231
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,649
How did I end up there?

232
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,290
It's actually her?

233
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:24,489
Do you know her?

234
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,290
She's one of my patients.

235
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,530
She was just discharged
from the hospital.

236
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:30,090
I suspect that
her consciousness was confused

237
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,450
due to an electric shock.

238
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,489
Forget it.

239
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,969
I need to find Lan Yao
and resolve the glitch in the game.

240
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:40,290
You shouldn't move around
in such a condition.

241
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,210
I'll go.

242
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:41,810
Brother,

243
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:43,489
I got our company in trouble.

244
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,489
I'll resolve it myself.

245
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,290
I don't want to depend on you
for everything.

246
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:49,849
I'll join you.

247
00:13:57,489 --> 00:13:58,050
Lan Yao.

248
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,489
We have no time to waste.

249
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:00,849
I'll cut to the chase.

250
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,860
Why did the game freeze when the general
was jumping off the cliff?

251
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,670
The general jumped off the cliff?

252
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,849
Has the AI been awakened?

253
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,090
I trust your capabilities.

254
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,910
However, it's been over 48 hours,
yet the glitch hasn't been fixed yet.

255
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,810
I need a logical explanation from you.

256
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,030
I don't want you to brush me off.

257
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,290
Lan Yao,

258
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,889
did something go wrong
with the general's code?

259
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,729
When the game was in development,

260
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:29,930
Mr. Xiao was the one

261
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,330
who shielded you guys
from the board of directors' criticism.

262
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:33,889
The development of the game

263
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,609
concerns the survival of the company.

264
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,769
As one of the company's investors,
we have the right to know.

265
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,769
You're not Lan Yao.

266
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,369
Who said so?

267
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:57,129
Have you ever met Lan Yao before?

268
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,710
Lan Yao said she has social anxiety.

269
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:00,560
Due to that, we only interacted
with each other online.

270
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:02,729
She once told me

271
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,730
that she poured all of her heart and soul
into Metaverse of Love.

272
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,170
It's impossible for her
to ignore such a huge bug.

273
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,170
And,

274
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,170
since the game is facing
such a huge issue,

275
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,969
I'm sure she has no time for herself.

276
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:14,969
Why would she go for a manicure?

277
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:18,889
That's not her style.

278
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,210
How could it be her?

279
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,609
Don't you intend to explain yourself?

280
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,489
100 yuan is enough, right?

281
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:42,769
100 yuan?

282
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,729
Keep the change.

283
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:47,849
Mr. Xiao.

284
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,230
Has Lan Yao arrived?
We have an appointment.

285
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,530
You didn't want to see him usually.

286
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,690
Of course you don't know who he is.

287
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,769
I'm done for.

288
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:57,729
What's wrong?

289
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,210
He's the person I mentioned just now.

290
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,530
This is too much of a coincidence.

291
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,009
What are you doing?

292
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,570
We're one step away
from joining hands with them.

293
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,849
We mustn't lose sight
of the bigger picture.

294
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:10,609
What are you doing?

295
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:11,430
Hurry and come out.

296
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,330
Impersonate me.

297
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,489
How?

298
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:13,889
I...

299
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,810
Are you Lan Yao?

300
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:22,129
Mr. Xiao,

301
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:23,570
Lingling is doing her best

302
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,530
to deal with the general's coding issue
at home as we speak.

303
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,570
She's working very hard.

304
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,129
It's been days
since she last ate or slept due to this.

305
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:34,609
According to what I know,
she's currently being detained

306
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,330
at the police station
because she assaulted someone.

307
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:37,849
That's impossible.

308
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,249
Lingling

309
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,330
is the gentlest

310
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,249
and cutest person in the world.

311
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,930
I'm sure something's wrong
with the person she assaulted.

312
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,030
She did it out of self-defense.

313
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:48,810
She assaulted me.

314
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,449
Could this be the Heavenly Cell?

315
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,090
Since I'm imprisoned,

316
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,169
that means

317
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,050
I've gotten rid of the villain.

318
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,530
God of Heaven, thank you
for your blessings.

319
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,689
She must've lost her mind.

320
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:28,169
Really?

321
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,730
It shouldn't be that bad, right?

322
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:37,290
I'm hungry.

323
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,290
What about you guys?

324
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,050
Prison guard.

325
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:50,689
It's time for our last meal.

326
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,050
What did you say?

327
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:00,609
Actually,

328
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,530
she's my girlfriend.

329
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,260
Your girlfriend
actually tried to kill you?

330
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:06,449
Twice?

331
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:09,970
Mr. Xiao,

332
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,800
we can't just let
the criminal get away scot-free

333
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:15,530
because of your relationship with her.

334
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,849
Everyone has a duty

335
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:18,530
to maintain public security.

336
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,369
She...

337
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,409
She's mentally unstable.
She loves to fantasize about things.

338
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,050
In order to make her recover faster,

339
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,050
I have no choice but to follow
the doctor's advice

340
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,330
and engage in roleplay with her.

341
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,929
Coincidentally,
her illness started to act up.

342
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:39,770
That's why this happened.

343
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,730
Officer Li, I'm sorry.

344
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,930
Sorry for causing you trouble.

345
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:45,330
Young man,

346
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,169
shouldn't you and your girlfriend

347
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,330
draw a line even when
you two are playing games?

348
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:53,449
Yes, sir.

349
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,609
You're right.

350
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,929
I'll take her home now.

351
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,810
Crook, you're still alive?

352
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,290
Let's go for another round!

353
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,090
Are you sure

354
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:17,330
you want to take her with you?

355
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,930
Her illness is acting up again.

356
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,250
Babe, I'm here to pick you up.

357
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,250
I cannot bear this humiliation!

358
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:27,810
I will chop you up

359
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:30,849
to avenge the millions
of vengeful spirits in the palace!

360
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,220
Don't give up on her treatment.

361
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,169
You better come with me
if you don't want to stay here forever.

362
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,090
Crook, there's no escape!

363
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:51,530
Lan Yao.

364
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:54,090
I'll apologize to you on his behalf

365
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:55,929
if he has offended you before this.

366
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,330
Brother, you have no idea.

367
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,449
That crook, Xiao Ran, is my sworn enemy!

368
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,010
I have to avenge my wife!

369
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,250
There's a huge bug in the game.
Everyone is panicking.

370
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,050
Let's think of a solution together.

371
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,570
Please stop pretending to be crazy
and face the issue together.

372
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,290
You should stop.
He already saw through you.

373
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:12,929
Darling,

374
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,169
this is a rare chance.

375
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:15,730
I will fight him to the death.

376
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,490
I'll allow you to strike me three times

377
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,690
so that you won't think
that I'm bullying you.

378
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,609
Brother, let's go.

379
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:21,730
We can talk to her next time.

380
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,849
Darling, stay out of this.

381
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:31,490
This is between us men!

382
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,250
You should
stay out of this as well.

383
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,889
This is between us!

384
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:41,369
(Oh no! I forgot he knows witchcraft!)

385
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:44,209
(He'll knock me out
if I stay too close to him!)

386
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,290
(Darling, I was too reckless.)

387
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,570
Goddess Lanyao

388
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,129
is quite different from what I imagined.

389
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,330
I thought she was a tech wiz.

390
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,129
I never expected her
to be mentally unstable.

391
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,590
We still face the same issue.

392
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,970
What will you do if she can't

393
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:14,409
resolve the bug?

394
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,209
She can definitely resolve it.

395
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,570
Do you trust her that much?

396
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,290
I just trust myself.

397
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,570
The board of directors

398
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,630
think of me as an arrogant dandy who knows
nothing about the way of the world.

399
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,689
I have to find a chance to prove myself.

400
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,889
Besides,

401
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:29,810
I can't just keep
relying on you forever.

402
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:31,929
Alright.

403
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,220
Just do what you desire to do.

404
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,369
I'll always support you.

405
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:37,889
Send me to the company.

406
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:39,260
I have one more thing to deal with.

407
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:48,530
Severe depression can lead to
dissociative identity disorder,

408
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,609
and there's a high possibility that
a violent personality may emerge.

409
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,849
Violent personality?

410
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,849
This is ridiculous.
