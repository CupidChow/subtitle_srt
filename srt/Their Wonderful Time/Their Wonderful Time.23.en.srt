Did I make a huge mistake?

30

You did.

31
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:00,537
Did I hurt her badly?

32
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:01,918
You did.

33
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,098
Tell me what I should do.

34
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:05,817
Tell me.

35
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:07,658
What should I do?

36
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:09,519
Stop pulling my leg.

37
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:12,919
Let me get you some help.

38
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:20,199
Mr. Xiao,

39
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:22,679
are you interested
in offering some advice?

40
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:25,218
I have got a doctor

41
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,318
who's hammered.

42
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:29,799
Here, listen to his wailing.

43
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:31,399
Xiao Ran!

44
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:33,519
Did you hear that?

45
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:35,778
Why are you not responding?
Come and help me now.

46
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:37,378
He's driving me crazy.

47
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,338
All right, got it.

48
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:39,519
I will be right there.

49
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,359
Did Dr. Zhang drink?

50
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:44,458
He never drank alcohol.

51
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,558
He must be really upset this time.

52
00:02:46,738 --> 00:02:48,058
Honestly, I'm mad

53
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:49,639
that he upset Yiyi.

54
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:51,799
But now it seems

55
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,919
that neither of them wants to let go.

56
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:57,338
Yunfei told me

57
00:02:57,339 --> 00:02:59,359
it's not that he doesn't like Liu Yiyi.

58
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:01,817
He's just unsure

59
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:03,278
about marriage.

60
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:05,558
Is he scared of marriage?

61
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:06,338
I believe

62
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:08,017
it probably relates

63
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:09,058
to his childhood.

64
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:11,178
His parent divorced when he was a kid.

65
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:13,759
His mom raised him on her own.

66
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:14,778
So

67
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,058
in his heart,

68
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:18,038
he's afraid of marriage.

69
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,838
Even though he doesn't say it,

70
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,519
I can feel

71
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:23,919
that marriage would

72
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,417
bring back painful memories

73
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:28,079
from his childhood.

74
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:28,878
Well,

75
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:30,919
I see.

76
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:39,679
Where are my glasses?

77
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:00,199
Yiyi,

78
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:05,558
I can't lose you.

79
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,278
Give me a hand. I will drive him home.

80
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,759
I need a minute.

81
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:19,718
I can't calm myself.

82
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,199
Aren't you experienced
in dealing with relationships?

83
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:28,698
Can you teach me something?

84
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:29,458
Please,

85
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,038
I beg you.

86
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,759
You need to figure this out yourself.

87
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:38,439
But how?

88
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,519
What should I do?

89
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,278
Stop drinking.

90
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:53,319
Be honest with me.

91
00:04:53,498 --> 00:04:55,759
Do you really like Yiyi?

92
00:04:56,978 --> 00:04:58,759
I truly like her.

93
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,258
I genuinely love her.

94
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:04,439
Why didn't you accept her proposal?

95
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:05,138
I...

96
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,678
Are you scared?

97
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:08,218
Are you scared

98
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:10,439
of the responsibilities of marriage?

99
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:13,838
Or are you scared
that you would betray her?

100
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:17,959
I have never thought

101
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,158
about leaving Yiyi.

102
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:21,999
However, to me,

103
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:26,199
marriage means a new chapter in life.

104
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,879
I'm scared of disappointing her.

105
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:33,238
But more than that,

106
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:38,038
I'm dreading facing
another imperfect ending.

107
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:41,218
Do you think Yiyi was scared of these

108
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:42,718
when she proposed to you?

109
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:46,798
She said it wasn't a serious proposal,

110
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,158
but I know

111
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:50,158
she was expecting

112
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,079
a yes from you.

113
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,639
She just wants to be with you.

114
00:05:57,938 --> 00:05:59,879
I have let her down.

115
00:06:00,178 --> 00:06:02,199
I really am sorry.

116
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,598
It's pointless telling me this.

117
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:07,478
You should tell her.

118
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,199
I need to go see her.

119
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:18,119
You are so drunk.

120
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:19,258
Don't mind me.

121
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,798
I want to see Yiyi.

122
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:23,079
Don't stop him.

123
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,478
Alcohol is a truth serum.

124
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,199
You are drunk. You can't drive.

125
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,918
Mr. Zhang, be brave.

126
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:41,038
Tell her all your feelings.

127
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:45,358
So your job is done.

128
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,338
What's wrong?

129
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:49,678
Hurry up, okay?

130
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:53,177
I'm so sorry, director.

131
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,698
The ex-boyfriend actor
is stuck in traffic.

132
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,358
He might be late.

133
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:58,718
What?

134
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,617
We are about to start.

135
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:00,898
Tell him to hurry up.

136
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:01,798
All right.

137
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,639
Yunfei, here we are.

138
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:33,319
I really don't understand love.

139
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,218
I know you can't get over him.

140
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:36,698
But

141
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:37,578
I hope you give yourself

142
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:39,238
a chance to start fresh.

143
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:41,759
I know this isn't easy,

144
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:43,199
but I hope

145
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,238
you can forget him.

146
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:50,199
He means a lot to me.

147
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,278
I can't let go of him yet.

148
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:55,678
That's fine.

149
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,238
I will wait for you

150
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:00,417
to get over him.

151
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:01,918
I will stay with you in the meantime.

152
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:03,999
No one is taking Yiyi from me.

153
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:08,079
Yunfei, why are you here?

154
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:13,959
I know you are hurt

155
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,559
by what I did to you.

156
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,879
You know what?

157
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:21,038
Ever since the argument,

158
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:23,759
I haven't been able to calm myself.

159
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,399
You are all I can think about.

160
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:32,479
I have been thinking
about you every day.

161
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:36,678
I can't control myself.

162
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:39,839
I have wanted to come
find you many times,

163
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,479
but I don't know what to do
when I see you.

164
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:50,078
Then

165
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:53,639
why did you come here?

166
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:55,958
Because I'm very sure

167
00:08:57,699 --> 00:08:59,438
that I can't leave you.

168
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:05,538
His lines

169
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:07,759
are different from the script.

170
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,798
Should we stop them?

171
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:11,839
No need.

172
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:13,558
His emotion is just right.

173
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:14,418
Let him continue.

174
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:15,239
All right.

175
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:22,479
I know I'm the stupidest dumb.

176
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:26,338
My foolish imagination

177
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,098
holds me back,

178
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:29,719
and it hurts your feelings.

179
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:36,218
You have already decided
to face all the hardships with me.

180
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:37,578
I truly regretted

181
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,438
that I walked away that day.

182
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:44,078
You always tolerate,

183
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,999
understand, and care for me.

184
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:51,359
I just can't live without you.

185
00:09:58,738 --> 00:09:59,798
Well...

186
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,798
Have you decided to marry me?

187
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,879
I have made up my mind.

188
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:13,158
I will spend the rest of my life

189
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:14,999
taking care of you

190
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:16,918
and cherishing you.

191
00:10:17,378 --> 00:10:19,119
Perhaps you may think

192
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,198
I'm childish.

193
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:25,078
But I promise you

194
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,558
I will become more mature

195
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:32,318
and give you a shoulder to lean on.

196
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,119
I won't upset you

197
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:38,519
or hurt you ever again.

198
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:47,918
Yiyi, can you come back to me?

199
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:50,938
I really love you.

200
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:52,999
I wish I could hug you.

201
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:18,657
I really love you,

202
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:19,958
do you know that?

203
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:23,479
Why did you drink?

204
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,519
I broke my rules for you.

205
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,479
Are you silly?

206
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:29,798
I'm silly.

207
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:41,017
You chose a good actor.

208
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:42,479
That was excellent.

209
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:45,918
Director, he's not the actor.

210
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:49,017
What's going on now?

211
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:50,239
Are you kidding me?

212
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,038
Should we cast another actor?

213
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,257
No need. His performance is good.

214
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:54,999
We will use this.

215
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:34,158
I didn't know

216
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:38,639
you look like this when you are drunk.

217
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,918
Don't try to take Yiyi away from me.

218
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:49,078
No one is taking Yiyi away from me.

219
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:01,399
Do you really mean

220
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:02,918
what you said earlier today?

221
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:08,759
We have known each other for so long.

222
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,480
But this is the first time
I have seen this side of you.

223
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:16,839
To be honest,

224
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:23,119
I'm touched.

225
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:35,278
Actually,

226
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:38,678
I thought I was ready to forget you.

227
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:42,399
But forgetting someone you love

228
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:44,918
isn't easy.

229
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:50,078
When you fall for someone,

230
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,158
the feelings are genuine.

231
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,519
It's hard to cut it off.

232
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:20,519
So, have you prepared
to face everything with me?

233
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,720
(Song Lingling: Dr. Zhang is sincere.
Give him a chance!)

234
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:44,999
No way.

235
00:14:46,978 --> 00:14:49,759
Even though I have already forgiven him,

236
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:53,678
I must punish him.

237
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:19,719
Yiyi, are you awake?

238
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:32,719
Yiyi, are you not angry anymore?

239
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:35,479
Says who?

240
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:37,278
I'm furious.

241
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,599
Did you forget

242
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:42,038
what happened last night?

243
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:47,119
I was drunk yesterday.

244
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:51,798
I only remember I went to the set
to find you

245
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:53,918
and talk a lot.

246
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:58,119
Then I forgot everything.

247
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:01,278
Did I cause you trouble?

248
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,759
You did.

249
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:04,519
You got under the director's skin.

250
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:07,078
Oh no.

251
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:09,017
I will apologize to him now.

252
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:10,257
He said

253
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:11,759
he never wants to see you again.

254
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,078
What should I do?

255
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,879
Why was I so reckless?

256
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:31,038
Well,

257
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,698
do you still remember

258
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,158
what you said to me?

259
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,678
I do.

260
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:43,958
Do those words still count?

261
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:47,519
I swear

262
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:50,038
I genuinely mean what I said yesterday.

263
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:52,599
I have thought it through seriously.

264
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,318
Since I like you,

265
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,239
I should make you feel secure.

266
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:00,798
I will never back down

267
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:04,239
or make you angry again.

268
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:11,359
Do you mean it?

269
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,599
I mean it.

270
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:17,079
I will try to believe you.

271
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:19,758
You're not angry anymore?

272
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,079
It depends on how you behave.

273
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:26,538
You're hungry.
Let me fix something for you.

274
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:27,738
No need.

275
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:29,098
I need to go to work now.

276
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:30,238
I have to leave.

277
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:33,918
I will send you there.

278
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:35,738
No need.

279
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:37,058
Stay home

280
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,279
and rest up.

281
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,918
Here's the hangover medicine.
Don't forget to take it.

282
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,639
Hand.

283
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,599
This is the last time
I'm giving you this.

284
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,958
If you lose it again,

285
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,678
you won't get another chance.

286
00:18:02,178 --> 00:18:03,718
I won't lose it.

287
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:05,198
Well done.

288
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:11,958
By the way,

289
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:13,718
remember to wash your face

290
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:15,599
before leaving.

291
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:34,039
Boss,

292
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,937
we readjusted the underlying data

293
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:37,799
based on Vic's solution.

294
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:39,937
Only the final boss

295
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:41,279
is left now.

296
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:42,617
We know

297
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:44,258
this character

298
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:45,799
is special to you,

299
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:48,279
so we thought it would be best
if you modify it yourself.

300
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:52,238
I didn't expect the progress
to be so fast.

301
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:55,039
I thought it would be done by next time.

302
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:57,098
Boss, you know what?

303
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:58,298
We worked very hard

304
00:18:58,299 --> 00:18:59,639
to get this done.

305
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,857
We have a lot of time, don't we?

306
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:04,279
Why push so hard?

307
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:07,518
We are doing this for you.

308
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:11,457
Many people think you are incompetent
to lead Lan Yao Studio in the fixing

309
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,438
due to the game issues.

310
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:15,098
We want to prove

311
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:16,538
that you are totally capable of it.

312
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,058
Their criticism is wrong.

313
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:18,879
Exactly.

314
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:20,657
When the game goes online,

315
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:23,079
we will amaze them for sure.

316
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:27,639
You have worked so hard these days.

317
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:29,438
Get back and rest.

318
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:31,998
Leave the rest to me.

319
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:32,578
Okay.

320
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,258
Boss, if you need any help,

321
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:35,399
tell us.

322
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:49,119
Your staff are loyal to you.

323
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:52,697
They have been with me

324
00:19:52,698 --> 00:19:54,399
since the project started.

325
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,399
Once the game goes online,

326
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,359
I must reward them well.

327
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:00,857
Definitely.

328
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:01,338
After all,

329
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:03,538
they work hard

330
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:04,559
for your happiness.

331
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:09,079
If we win this bet,

332
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:11,639
will your dad change his mind about us?

333
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:14,039
If he doesn't,

334
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:15,518
we will go for Plan B.

335
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:17,319
Plan B?

336
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:19,718
Let's elope.

337
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:22,758
Nonsense.

338
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:24,599
Lingling,

339
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,857
do you want

340
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,799
to enter the game
and say goodbye to your brother?

341
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:32,657
After the adjustment,

342
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:33,578
he will become

343
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:34,918
an ordinary NPC.

344
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:37,258
All of his combat data

345
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:38,438
will also be cleared.

346
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:42,238
Aren't you worried

347
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,039
I might change my mind when I see him?

348
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:46,079
Like I said,

349
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,399
I won't force you to make any decision.

350
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:50,399
If you can't let go right away,

351
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,639
take your time.

352
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:57,198
As long as you're with me,

353
00:20:57,938 --> 00:20:59,958
I have the courage to face anything.

354
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:03,238
Actually, I also wish to see him.

355
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,279
At least I can let him know

356
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,319
you're doing well now.

357
00:21:07,858 --> 00:21:10,758
All right. Let's go see him together.

358
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:42,457
When I designed this character,

359
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,238
I wanted him as a guardian,

360
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:46,697
not a boss

361
00:21:46,698 --> 00:21:48,857
like Xing Tian,

362
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:52,158
which is why I hid him inside
this withered tree.

363
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:55,839
It's a hidden feature
for players to discover.

364
00:21:56,938 --> 00:21:58,079
However,

365
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,338
you all skipped it

366
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:02,158
and rushed through all the levels.

367
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:06,478
We didn't give it much thought.

368
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,560
We just cleared the levels
to finish the testing.

369
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:11,918
The thing is,
if you don't pass his test,

370
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:14,217
you won't be able to defeat Xing Tian,

371
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:16,359
no matter how high
your strength power is.

372
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:22,098
Why didn't your brother show up

373
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:24,079
during Xing Tian's trial?

374
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:27,518
I wanted it to be more fun

375
00:22:27,698 --> 00:22:31,319
so he doesn't appear

376
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:32,998
without an NPC

377
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,079
triggering the cue.

378
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:52,639
Brother, it has been a while.

379
00:22:55,178 --> 00:22:56,678
Who is he?

380
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:00,839
I'm Lingling's boyfriend and fiance.

381
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:03,879
I didn't say I would marry you.

382
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,538
It seems

383
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:07,198
you have brought good news here.

384
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:10,958
Not just that,

385
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,879
I also need to tell you something.

386
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:20,039
We will make some data adjustments
in the game.

387
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:21,978
And your character

388
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:23,478
will change.

389
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:28,119
So you came to bid farewell?

390
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:30,238
You won't disappear.

391
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:33,417
It's just that your combat power
will change.

392
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:34,839
You will become

393
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:36,518
an ordinary person.

394
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,758
Initially, I designed you
to be unbeatable

395
00:23:40,858 --> 00:23:43,198
so your combat power accumulates.

396
00:23:43,618 --> 00:23:47,678
But now your strength power is too high

397
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:49,718
and has caused an imbalance.

398
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:52,799
Adjusting the data is the only solution.

399
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:55,119
But that means

400
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:59,639
many people can defeat you.

401
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,718
Defeat me?

402
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:04,039
Are you disappointed in me?

403
00:24:04,938 --> 00:24:06,617
I'm just wondering

404
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:08,438
if losing really is that terrifying.

405
00:24:09,178 --> 00:24:10,359
Actually, no.

406
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:13,079
It's just hard for us humans

407
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:15,657
to accept the truth

408
00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:16,799
that we are weak.

409
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:18,377
Consciousness

410
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:20,678
brings out all kinds
of complex emotions.

411
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:22,937
Lingling hopes

412
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:24,918
you never have to feel that way.

413
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:30,718
I understand.

414
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:31,839
I won't blame you.

415
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:33,839
Just do what you have to do.

416
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,119
Will you really not blame me?

417
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:38,617
You are my sister.

418
00:24:38,618 --> 00:24:39,918
Of course I understand you.

419
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,578
It's kind of boring being undefeated.

420
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:43,538
Sometimes, I would like to

421
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:44,718
experience different feelings.

422
00:24:47,378 --> 00:24:48,599
Thank you.

423
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:51,119
Don't forget. I'm always here.

424
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:56,079
But

425
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:01,079
you will treat her well, right?

426
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:02,319
I will.

427
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:04,098
Since I have chosen her,

428
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:06,918
I will always protect her.

429
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:11,359
I will visit you in the game often.

430
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:29,879
I didn't know he didn't care at all.

431
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:32,457
I was overthinking it.

432
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:33,799
Don't think too much.

433
00:25:33,938 --> 00:25:35,498
Since he understands,

434
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,498
that's a good thing.

435
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:38,198
Right.

436
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,518
I feel more at ease

437
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:43,478
after hearing that from him.

438
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:46,937
Proceed with your work.

439
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:48,377
I will make you some coffee.

440
00:25:48,378 --> 00:25:49,119
Sure.

441
00:25:56,499 --> 00:25:57,258
Where have you been?

442
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,857
I didn't see you this morning.

443
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,559
I went to David's studio.

444
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:03,198
Vic said he needs you
to sign a document.

445
00:26:03,218 --> 00:26:03,778
Leave it there.

446
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,079
I will sign it later.

447
00:26:05,178 --> 00:26:06,498
Vic said this is urgent.

448
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:07,778
You need to sign it now.

449
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:08,958
He needs it later.

450
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:12,417
This is just an agreement.

451
00:26:12,418 --> 00:26:13,857
He wants to bring the game statistics

452
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,678
to attend a conference abroad.

453
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:17,338
Just to be safe,

454
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:19,799
he needs you to sign an agreement
for authorization.

455
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:26,140
(Data Use License Agreement)
I have read it. There's no problem.

456
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,478
(of Metaverse of Love)
Just sign it.

457
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:32,119
Is it really that urgent?

458
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:36,119
Don't sign it.

459
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,718
Why are you here, Lin Qiao?

460
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:43,238
What's this document?

461
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:46,697
It's an authorization contract.

462
00:26:46,698 --> 00:26:48,399
Steven asks me to sign it.

463
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:51,279
Let me see.

464
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:52,457
The Shen Group

465
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,217
has complete control over the game.

466
00:26:54,218 --> 00:26:55,718
I don't think you need

467
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:57,319
to read it, Mr. Lin.

468
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:00,137
Did you allow Vic

469
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:02,758
to bring all the game statistics abroad?

470
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,377
He said he's attending
an international conference,

471
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:10,258
and he wants to use
this game as a demo.

472
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:13,918
Are you aware that Vic is planning
to sell these statistics?

473
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:16,818
They are

474
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:18,799
the core of the entire project.

475
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,498
They include user statistics and habits

476
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:23,478
collected during user acceptance testing.

477
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:25,937
There will be consequences

478
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,518
if they are sold as a product.

479
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,438
Do you know something about this?

480
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,478
You read this contract, didn't you?

481
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,639
Explain yourself.

482
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,298
Sorry, I can't explain this to you now.

483
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:51,039
Is this my dad's order?

484
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:53,518
Ms. Shen,

485
00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:55,359
I...

486
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:58,958
Thank you so much for your help.

487
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:02,177
If you hadn't come up with this plan
and helped me hide it from Ms. Song,

488
00:28:02,178 --> 00:28:03,818
I wouldn't be able to
get the statistics.

489
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:05,098
I'm not helping you.

490
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,559
I'm helping Ms. Shen.

491
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,839
I think

492
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,998
Lin Qiao doesn't deserve her.

493
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:14,498
Ms. Shen has done so much for him

494
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:15,879
and been kind to him,

495
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:17,758
but he doesn't give any response.

496
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,279
I strongly believe

497
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:24,158
that if they get together,

498
00:28:24,658 --> 00:28:27,559
Ms. Shen will be hurt in the end.

499
00:28:31,858 --> 00:28:34,538
This won't involve Ms. Shen, right?

500
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:35,799
Of course not.

501
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,857
Don't forget to get her
to sign this agreement.

502
00:28:38,858 --> 00:28:40,258
If Ms. Shen or the Shen Group

503
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:43,799
are affected,

504
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:45,599
I won't let you off.

505
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:48,998
Our collaboration is perfect.

506
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,718
I don't want to see you anymore.

507
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,198
Get out.

508
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:04,958
I'm sorry, Lin Qiao.

509
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:07,298
I made a mistake again.

510
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:10,177
Vic claimed he could come up
with a solution

511
00:29:10,178 --> 00:29:11,918
and fix the game,

512
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:15,998
so I agreed immediately.

513
00:29:16,218 --> 00:29:19,399
I also hope this project
will proceed smoothly.

514
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,678
I didn't expect this to happen.

515
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:24,518
Xiangyu,

516
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:26,818
I beg you.

517
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:27,778
Can you discuss it with me

518
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,678
before you make decisions like this?

519
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:33,158
You shouldn't have hidden it from me.

520
00:29:34,418 --> 00:29:36,039
That's on me.

521
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:39,438
But this isn't my intention.

522
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,758
I was just helping to back you up.

523
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:47,319
I didn't know things would
turn out this way.

524
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:50,359
Have you considered

525
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:52,417
that all this competition

526
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:54,140
will only hurt the relationship
with my brother,

527
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,279
even if you get everything you want?

528
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,158
I don't want that to happen.

529
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,918
But if you don't compete with him,

530
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:06,559
my dad won't approve of us.

531
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,478
My dad

532
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,937
wants me to marry the heir
of the Shanhai Group.

533
00:30:10,938 --> 00:30:12,377
I left Shanhai Group

534
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:13,857
because I didn't want others

535
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:16,098
to judge my worth.

536
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:18,279
If I disappoint your dad,

537
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,478
then let's not force it.

538
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,879
Lin Qiao, don't go.

539
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:30,158
I'm sorry.

540
00:30:35,178 --> 00:30:36,657
(Ran, something came up.)

541
00:30:36,658 --> 00:30:38,438
(Vic deceived all of us)

542
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,857
(and took the underlying data abroad.)

543
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:42,377
(He plans to sell it.)

544
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:44,137
(I'm on my way to the airport.)

545
00:30:44,138 --> 00:30:45,958
(I hope I can stop him before he leaves.)

546
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:47,377
(Just in case,)

547
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,457
(try searching for him along the way.)

548
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:50,538
(His plate number is)

549
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:52,639
(Jiang A 19983.)

550
00:31:09,858 --> 00:31:11,718
Xiao Ran, look. It's the car ahead.

551
00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:31,998
Hand over the statistics.
