Lingling.

30
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:09,514
Lingling?

31
00:02:32,174 --> 00:02:33,275
Do you like them?

32
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,814
Did you prepare all this?

33
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:37,555
Yes.

34
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:39,275
Look.

35
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:42,595
This was taken when we attended
the press conference.

36
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:43,875
This

37
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:46,315
was taken on our first date.

38
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,395
This is you at work.

39
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:50,835
At this one.

40
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:53,354
It was when you were home.

41
00:02:55,855 --> 00:02:58,194
When did you take all these photos?

42
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:00,995
Some were taken openly,

43
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:02,294
and some

44
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:03,595
I took when you weren't aware.

45
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,234
Tell me.

46
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:07,453
Did you like me

47
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,034
for a very long time?

48
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:11,794
You liked me earlier than I did.

49
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:18,453
In case you forget me

50
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:19,733
while I'm away,

51
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:20,453
so

52
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:21,414
I have put up

53
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:22,794
all the photos here.

54
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:23,414
So

55
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:24,374
they can remind you

56
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,574
of me.

57
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:26,294
And you

58
00:03:26,295 --> 00:03:27,954
won't feel lonely.

59
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:29,534
Even without these photos,

60
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:31,094
I won't forget you.

61
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:32,254
Thank you for your gift.

62
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,173
I like it very much.

63
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:33,715
Sure.

64
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:36,715
We will take a lot more photos

65
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:39,595
and fill this wall.

66
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:41,555
And also

67
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:42,794
that wall.

68
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:44,995
Let's fill the walls with our photos.

69
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:47,094
I think

70
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,854
this house isn't big enough.

71
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:51,034
We need a bigger house.

72
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:52,414
Maybe we can take a few photos now

73
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:53,414
as a memory.

74
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:54,395
Sure.

75
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:07,835
(Ms. Song,)

76
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:10,595
(this may sound weird,)

77
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:12,414
(but I think)

78
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:14,194
(the current situation has proven)

79
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,174
(that the memories
of both you and Xing Tian)

80
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,514
(have reshuffled and intersected.)

81
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,555
(You designed Xing Tian)

82
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:24,614
(and wrote the code)

83
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:26,915
(of his memory.)

84
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,714
(But who can guarantee)

85
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,574
(that we humans aren't
a composite code)

86
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:35,514
(written by beings of a higher level?)

87
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:38,934
(As Xing Tian's code)

88
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:41,634
(is absorbing your energy rapidly,)

89
00:04:41,894 --> 00:04:44,074
(you will end up)

90
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:47,814
(becoming a dormant Xing Tian,)

91
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:51,875
(while he will become you
drifting in the void for good)

92
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,235
(without being discovered.)

93
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:58,035
(At this point,)

94
00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:00,394
(there's nothing I can do.)

95
00:05:00,854 --> 00:05:03,194
(Please forgive me, Ms. Song.)

96
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:09,634
(Thank you, Mr. Xue.)

97
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:13,235
(Please don't tell Xiao Ran about this.)

98
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:19,235
(If all my memories disappear,)

99
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:21,555
(does it mean)

100
00:05:22,094 --> 00:05:23,675
(that everything never existed)

101
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:27,394
(in my world?)

102
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:28,915
(I won't even have)

103
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:32,435
(a chance to say goodbye to Xiao Ran.)

104
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,315
I'm Song Lingling

105
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:18,235
and the person in charge
of Lan Yao Studio.

106
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,634
Metaverse of Love

107
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,014
is a game

108
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,875
I spent four years creating.

109
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:27,274
Liu Yiyi and I

110
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:28,995
met in college.

111
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:31,115
We are

112
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,394
the best friends.

113
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:42,915
Dad,

114
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:44,754
what brings you here?

115
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:50,035
Since Lin Qiao isn't planning
to inherit the Shanhai Group,

116
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:51,915
you can't marry him.

117
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:53,194
Dad,

118
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,453
I don't want my marriage

119
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:56,235
to become a chip in your business.

120
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:56,973
My child,

121
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:58,374
I'm doing this for your own good.

122
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,773
It can help you in inheriting
the Shen Group

123
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:02,194
more easily.

124
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:03,853
You need to know

125
00:07:03,854 --> 00:07:05,194
that given your experience,

126
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:07,355
none of those astute shareholders

127
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:09,315
will accept you.

128
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,773
I'd rather not inherit anything.

129
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:13,453
Let someone else take it.

130
00:07:13,454 --> 00:07:14,374
This is absurd!

131
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,435
Dad.

132
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:18,555
Fine.

133
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:20,594
If you don't want anything,

134
00:07:21,135 --> 00:07:22,413
I will pull off

135
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:24,074
the game investments

136
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,315
in the Shanhai Group.

137
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:28,675
Dad,

138
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,194
you can't do that.

139
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:31,293
I promise Xiao Ran

140
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:32,875
I will support Lanyao

141
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:34,954
until the fixings are done.

142
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:37,115
I made this mistake,

143
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:38,355
and I have to make amends.

144
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,795
You diluted your shares
in his company

145
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:44,915
for this reason, didn't you?

146
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:48,274
If you hadn't secretly sent Steven
to help Vic,

147
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,213
things wouldn't have turned out
as bad as this.

148
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:51,915
What makes you think that way?

149
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:52,853
You ordered Steven

150
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,875
to report any of my movements to you.

151
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:58,315
I was wondering why Steven helped Vic.

152
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,134
And he wouldn't answer me

153
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:01,634
no matter how I tried.

154
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:03,355
But you transferred him away

155
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:05,274
the next day.

156
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:07,853
Why would you react that way

157
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,394
if you had nothing to do with this?

158
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,754
I just wanted you to see

159
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:13,274
who the right choice is

160
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:15,494
for you.

161
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,494
I know very well

162
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,995
who's right for me.

163
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:21,514
Then you should calm down

164
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:23,634
and think it through.

165
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:25,475
Call me when you come around to this.

166
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,514
Are you trying to lock me up?

167
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:30,274
I didn't want to do this either,

168
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:33,635
but there are principles and boundaries
you mustn't ignore.

169
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,454
Keep an eye on her.

170
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:37,533
Don't let her out

171
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:38,533
before I'm back.

172
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,474
Yes.

173
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:06,635
Why are you looking at me

174
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,395
like this?

175
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,474
I just want

176
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:13,194
to take a good look at you.

177
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:23,275
I will be back very soon.

178
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:24,315
Wait for me.

179
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:01,293
When did you return from overseas?

180
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:02,614
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

181
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,635
I could've sent a ride for you
from the airport.

182
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:06,994
Old man,

183
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:09,675
how much longer do you plan
to hide this from me?

184
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:12,234
If I hadn't come back this time,

185
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:14,734
when were you going

186
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:16,594
to tell me?

187
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:18,374
Lucky you.

188
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,035
You have two sons.

189
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:21,874
I have only one daughter.

190
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,573
I'm counting on her to help me

191
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:24,874
after she got married.

192
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:26,834
You have known about this all along.

193
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,555
Why didn't you do something?

194
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:30,315
You just let these young people

195
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,755
mess around.

196
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:35,234
You always have a short fuse.

197
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:36,494
Calm down.

198
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:37,954
How can I calm down?

199
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:39,515
Come on,

200
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,155
just tell me already.

201
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:42,954
What's your plan?

202
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:44,234
Let me be frank with you.

203
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:45,954
I came back

204
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:48,194
for this matter.

205
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:51,035
You must give me a satisfactory answer.

206
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:52,494
Honestly,

207
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:54,474
I talked to them.

208
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:55,293
Xiangyu

209
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:56,974
likes Lin Qiao.

210
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:58,315
Nonsense!

211
00:10:58,414 --> 00:10:59,555
How can that be?

212
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:01,693
Do you think you can let them be

213
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,035
when you are satisfied?

214
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:04,234
No way.

215
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:05,714
Listen.

216
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:07,893
This doesn't count.

217
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:09,395
Don't be mad.

218
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:10,915
We can talk nicely.

219
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:12,173
Let's have some tea.

220
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:13,435
Calm down.

221
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:15,734
The kids have all grown up,

222
00:11:15,735 --> 00:11:17,874
and they have ideas of their own.

223
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:20,014
We were all young once.

224
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:22,334
We argued with our parents

225
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:24,094
over relationships, too.

226
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:26,395
You can't force someone to be together.

227
00:11:26,414 --> 00:11:27,795
Cut your crap.

228
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:33,533
Are you planning to
go back on your words?

229
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:35,194
I didn't say that.

230
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:36,675
The thing is,

231
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:39,315
they don't always listen to us.

232
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:41,413
Don't try to brush me off. Call Xiao Ran.

233
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:43,994
I want to hear what he has to say.

234
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:46,275
All right, then.

235
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:47,635
Zhang.

236
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:50,693
Give Xiao Ran a call

237
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:51,954
and tell him to come back.

238
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:54,795
Please.

239
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:16,954
(What has he been busy with these days?)

240
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,400
(Liu Yiyi is my best friend)

241
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,994
Coming.

242
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:11,293
Lingling?

243
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:12,214
You have the keys.

244
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:13,954
Why did you knock?
You can come in directly.

245
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:15,974
I...

246
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:17,000
What?

247
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,334
Don't just stand here. Come on in.

248
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:20,155
Let me show you what I've packed.

249
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:23,515
Come on.

250
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:25,533
This is

251
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:27,653
a rare trip for us.

252
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:29,254
I have to prepare well.

253
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:30,053
I'm going to pack

254
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:31,614
all of our beautiful clothes.

255
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:32,094
Then

256
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:34,275
we can take amazing photos.

257
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:36,594
Look at this.
What do you think about this piece?

258
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:41,954
What are you looking at, Lingling?

259
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:45,155
It's nothing.

260
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:47,773
You haven't been back

261
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:49,014
for a long while.

262
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:50,275
You miss this place, right?

263
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:54,194
You are living in a big villa now,

264
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:55,354
but

265
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:56,834
don't forget

266
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:57,614
this is the place

267
00:13:57,615 --> 00:14:00,714
where our dreams began.

268
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:04,834
I won't forget this.

269
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:06,494
What's wrong?

270
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:07,874
Are you moved?

271
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:09,254
If you miss me,

272
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:11,173
just come back to see me.

273
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:13,614
If Xiao Ran ever mistreats you,

274
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:14,693
move back here.

275
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:15,813
This will forever be your home.

276
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,714
All right?

277
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,755
Yiyi,

278
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,035
let's take a photo.

279
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:26,074
Sure.

280
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:27,795
Let me fix my lipstick.

281
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:41,354
Okay.

282
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:42,834
Let's do it.

283
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:46,915
One, two, three.

284
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,680
(Lan Yao Studio is
where you strive for your dream)

285
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,200
(Everyone here is the best staff
and the most reliable partners)

286
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:55,675
Check this again.

287
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:03,614
Boss?

288
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:04,515
Wu.

289
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:05,594
Boss.

290
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:07,234
Boss,

291
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:08,635
what brings you here?

292
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:14,155
Just visiting.

293
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,454
Be honest.

294
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,155
Do you miss us?

295
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,874
I have missed you very much.

296
00:16:25,615 --> 00:16:26,374
Boss,

297
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,454
let me tell you this.

298
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:28,854
While you were away,

299
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,854
they have been working all night.

300
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:31,933
You always tell us

301
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:33,454
to get enough sleep,

302
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:34,293
but they

303
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,293
never listen.

304
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,014
Xiong,

305
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:37,494
you also work late every night.

306
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:38,214
You said

307
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:40,374
you could work from down to dusk
for the game.

308
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,933
Boss told you to work out,

309
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:42,854
but you gave up.

310
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:43,693
Jeez.

311
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:45,035
I won't argue with you.

312
00:16:49,215 --> 00:16:50,635
You guys have been working

313
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:52,874
all this time.

314
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:54,053
It's fine, Boss.

315
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:54,933
This is a small matter.

316
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:56,374
You don't have to worry.

317
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,134
We settle it

318
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,474
with ease.

319
00:17:00,534 --> 00:17:02,714
Get back to your work.

320
00:17:03,414 --> 00:17:04,773
I'm going to my room

321
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,154
to fetch something.

322
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:07,275
All right.

323
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:24,715
Wu,

324
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:28,154
don't you think

325
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,035
something's wrong with Boss?

326
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:31,795
Is it?

327
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:35,235
She seems a bit down.

328
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:37,594
I don't see it.

329
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:39,434
Back to work.

330
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:14,914
Mr. Xiao,

331
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:16,955
why don't you

332
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:20,515
take a look around the office?

333
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:22,734
I can't focus

334
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:25,874
with you sitting here.

335
00:20:18,655 --> 00:20:19,634
Have some tea.

336
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:26,093
Dad.

337
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:27,154
Mr. Shen.

338
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:28,515
Have a seat.

339
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:30,914
I called you here

340
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,813
because Mr. Shen
has something to ask you.

341
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:35,293
I haven't seen you in years.

342
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:37,773
You have grown into a fine man.

343
00:20:37,774 --> 00:20:39,654
I can rest easy

344
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,154
after handing over
the Shen Group to you.

345
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:46,235
Sorry, Mr. Shen.

346
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:48,715
I can't marry Xiangyu.

347
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:51,114
Why?

348
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,214
Both of you have been close

349
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:55,434
since childhood.

350
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:56,434
Why?

351
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,195
You don't like her anymore?

352
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:03,475
To be honest, I have been seeing Xiangyu

353
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,434
as a sister over the years.

354
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:06,755
Besides,

355
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:08,795
I have someone I like.

356
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:10,755
And Xiangyu

357
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:13,114
is with my brother now.

358
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:21,235
Is this the attitude of your family?

359
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,795
I told you.

360
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:27,354
They have their own ideas.

361
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,573
I was furious when I first found out.

362
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:31,394
I scolded them a lot.

363
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:32,853
I understand

364
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:35,634
you are planning for the future
of Xiang Yu.

365
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,315
I asked Lin Qiao.

366
00:21:37,455 --> 00:21:39,315
He said he likes Xiangyu very much.

367
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:40,174
I also believe

368
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,354
he can make Xiangyu happy.

369
00:21:42,495 --> 00:21:43,494
Why don't we

370
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:45,114
give them what they want?

371
00:21:46,215 --> 00:21:48,674
That's easy for you to say.

372
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:49,654
I know you

373
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:51,014
quite well.

374
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:53,813
If you could let go of the past,

375
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:57,035
Lin Qiao would've achieved nothing
in the Shanhai Group.

376
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:59,373
He's now an outsider

377
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:00,995
in the company.

378
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:03,434
If that's the case,

379
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:05,414
Xiangyu might as well

380
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:07,154
marry an ordinary man.

381
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:08,734
This is enough.

382
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:09,795
Stop it.

383
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:12,955
So you do have a temper.

384
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,475
Listen.

385
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:16,813
I don't care if you listen or not,

386
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:18,634
I say what I have to say.

387
00:22:18,895 --> 00:22:21,955
If you can give Lin Qiao

388
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:25,634
equal status and power as Xiao Ran

389
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:27,494
and let him take full charge

390
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:28,894
of the company's affairs,

391
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:30,834
then I might consider this.

392
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:32,074
Otherwise,

393
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:35,755
I will tell everyone that the Xiao Family
broke their promise.

394
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:38,053
By then,

395
00:22:38,054 --> 00:22:40,354
your family's credibility
will be ruined.

396
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:45,755
If you make a scene out of this,

397
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:49,694
you will put Xiangyu to shame, too.

398
00:22:49,695 --> 00:22:52,114
It would be better than her suffering
after the marriage.

399
00:22:56,614 --> 00:22:57,755
Listen,

400
00:22:58,614 --> 00:23:00,755
if you can't handle this well,

401
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:03,235
I will take matters into my own hands.

402
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:07,715
I will withdraw all the investments

403
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,114
of the Shanhai Group.

404
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:14,955
You have time to think it over.

405
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:17,235
I expect a satisfactory answer.

406
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:21,715
You!

407
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:32,235
Dad, calm down.

408
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:33,434
I will see him off.

409
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:43,373
Mr. Shen.

410
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:44,475
Mr. Shen.

411
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:46,613
There's one thing

412
00:23:46,614 --> 00:23:48,074
I need to talk to you about.

413
00:23:48,814 --> 00:23:51,074
I have already made myself clear.

414
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:52,715
There's nothing left to talk about.

415
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:55,475
I know what you are thinking.

416
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:56,914
To you,

417
00:23:56,975 --> 00:23:59,195
my brother's a stepson who isn't valued

418
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:01,354
and holds no power in the company.

419
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:04,674
You are worried that his lesser
influence in the Shanhai Group

420
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:06,874
won't be helpful
and supportive of Xiangyu

421
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:08,293
and will also affect

422
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:10,434
future collaborations
with the Shanhai Group.

423
00:24:11,614 --> 00:24:12,914
That's why you think

424
00:24:13,215 --> 00:24:14,634
he doesn't deserve Xiangyu.

425
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:16,333
But I have a way

426
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:17,715
to ease your concerns.

427
00:24:21,975 --> 00:24:23,434
What do you plan to do?

428
00:24:23,774 --> 00:24:25,174
I will take care of that.

429
00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:26,133
But I believe

430
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:27,674
you will see it soon.

431
00:24:28,374 --> 00:24:30,195
I believe you are well aware

432
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:32,715
that my brother and Xiangyu
are truly in love with each other.

433
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:34,734
You don't have the full confidence

434
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:37,373
to convince Xiangyu to marry me.

435
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:38,573
Nothing turns out well

436
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:39,995
if the situation doesn't improve.

437
00:24:40,534 --> 00:24:42,914
So, could you give me some time
to resolve this?

438
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:49,195
Do you really have a solution?

439
00:24:49,374 --> 00:24:50,475
Absolutely.

440
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:53,053
But could you please not withdraw
your investment first?

441
00:24:53,054 --> 00:24:53,894
This fund

442
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:55,235
is very important to us.

443
00:25:02,054 --> 00:25:03,035
All right, then.

444
00:25:04,215 --> 00:25:06,275
I give you my word on this.

445
00:25:06,735 --> 00:25:07,755
But

446
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:10,734
you need to show me the results

447
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,195
as soon as possible.

448
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:13,354
You have my word.

449
00:25:31,814 --> 00:25:33,275
Ms. Song, you are back.

450
00:25:38,094 --> 00:25:39,035
Mr. Xiao,

451
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:40,914
Ms. Song is back home.

452
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,320
(I'm in the hospital, and Liu Yiyi came.
I'm so touched.)

453
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,720
(I'm Song Lingling and the person in charge
of Lan Yao Studio)

454
00:26:25,054 --> 00:26:25,974
Mr. Xiang said

455
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,354
you went out earlier today.

456
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:28,594
Where did you go?

457
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:30,955
I...

458
00:26:31,574 --> 00:26:33,715
I was out for a walk.

459
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:38,214
Right. Getting fresh air outside

460
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:39,995
can help improve your mood.

461
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:42,555
Yes.

462
00:26:42,854 --> 00:26:44,755
I'm feeling particularly well now.

463
00:26:51,655 --> 00:26:52,475
By the way,

464
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:54,014
do you remember

465
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:56,634
the white dress you wore
during the press conference?

466
00:26:59,415 --> 00:27:00,555
I do.

467
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:02,014
You were there too,

468
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:03,434
right?

469
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,394
Do you remember

470
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:15,235
what happened on that day?

471
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:19,275
It has been a long time.

472
00:27:19,814 --> 00:27:21,475
I can't remember that.

473
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,555
Why are you asking this?

474
00:27:25,215 --> 00:27:26,354
Nothing.

475
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:51,035
Do you remember

476
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:53,114
the name of this jellyfish?

477
00:28:02,695 --> 00:28:03,755
Yes.

478
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,834
It's called...

479
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:11,394
It's called the immortal jellyfish.

480
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:12,974
Yes, right.

481
00:28:12,975 --> 00:28:14,434
That's its name.

482
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:23,174
It's a luminescent creature

483
00:28:23,175 --> 00:28:24,955
in the ocean.

484
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:26,133
Besides,

485
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:28,114
it's immortal.

486
00:28:28,495 --> 00:28:30,674
It can be reborn

487
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:32,674
repeatedly.

488
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:36,195
I didn't know that.

489
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:47,074
Do you still remember

490
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,533
