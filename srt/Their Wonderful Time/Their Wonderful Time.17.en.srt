00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:45,785
Could it be

30
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:48,505
that there's something between them?

31
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:49,785
Lin Qiao.

32
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:52,505
What are you doing here?

33
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:54,165
Who is this?

34
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,145
Me?

35
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,365
I'm Shen Xiangyu

36
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,466
of the Shen Group.

37
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:00,345
I'm Lin Qiao's girlfriend.

38
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:02,785
So, you had a girlfriend all along?

39
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:04,026
Of course.

40
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:05,844
We were already a couple

41
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:07,585
before Lin Qiao got to know Lan Yao.

42
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:10,705
He didn't want to involve me in this.

43
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:12,724
But you've been too aggressive.

44
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:15,145
I have no choice
but to save the hero in distress.

45
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,884
Only Xiao Ran knows
his relationship the best.

46
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:20,444
As for

47
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:21,645
the capital issue

48
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:23,826
regarding the game "Metaverse of Love,"

49
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:26,346
I can give you a guarantee

50
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:28,365
under my title
as the Shen Group's successor

51
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:29,844
and Lin Qiao's girlfriend.

52
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:32,444
The issues you guys worried about
will never happen.

53
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:33,525
If it concerns Shanhai Group,

54
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:35,305
that means it concerns our company too.

55
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:37,305
Therefore, I won't just sit idly by.

56
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:38,444
If so, our questions

57
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:39,844
are basically answered.

58
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:41,546
We can end the interview now.

59
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:44,386
Thank you.

60
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:53,844
Just look at you.

61
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:55,564
I knew you would act like this.

62
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:56,865
I predicted it.

63
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,145
Since you don't want Xiao Ran
to misunderstand you,

64
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:03,185
I'll surely help you to clarify things.

65
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:08,745
Is there a possibility that I don't want you
to misunderstand my intention?

66
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:15,066
Are you saying
that I'm petty indirectly?

67
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:16,925
I came here

68
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:19,506
because I said I would protect you.

69
00:03:20,486 --> 00:03:22,745
I'm not here because I'm petty.

70
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:27,786
How could a boyfriend

71
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:29,946
let his girlfriend protect him?

72
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,826
Actually, I knew

73
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:44,865
that you didn't sprain your ankle
that night.

74
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:04,245
You were always being avoidant

75
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:06,226
whenever I confessed to you.

76
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:09,266
Why did you admit it
so graciously this time around?

77
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:13,305
When did you straighten out
your thoughts?

78
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:22,905
There's no specific time for that.

79
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:25,386
I just feel like

80
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:28,105
you've done so much for me.

81
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:30,626
I don't want you
to suffer grievances anymore.

82
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:33,946
If so, are you happy now?

83
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:36,866
I'm elated.

84
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:38,705
If so,

85
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:41,905
am I your official girlfriend now?

86
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:44,145
Yes.

87
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:47,965
If so, from now on,

88
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:50,866
I'm going to utilize my rights
as your girlfriend.

89
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:53,066
What kind of rights?

90
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:55,306
Give me a second.

91
00:04:57,485 --> 00:05:00,986
In the future, you're not allowed
to spend time with any woman alone.

92
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:03,665
You're not allowed to praise
other women for their beauty.

93
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:06,525
In the future, I'll be
the only woman in your world.

94
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:08,345
You can only have eyes for me.

95
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:12,225
Although it sounds difficult,

96
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,266
I'll do my best.

97
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:18,506
You need to do more than your best.
You have to do this by hook or by crook.

98
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:21,946
Got it.

99
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,604
You announced our relationship bluntly.

100
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:28,225
Aren't you afraid that Mr. Shen
might hear about this?

101
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:31,844
It's just an interview
for an entertainment column.

102
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:33,525
Steven knows

103
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:35,506
how to deal with them.

104
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:39,386
It's getting late.

105
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:40,826
Let me send you back.

106
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,905
Now, you may address me as Lin Qiao.

107
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,386
Why are you hesitating?

108
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:30,225
Stop right there.

109
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:42,266
This isn't a military camp, you know?

110
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:43,404
Cut to the chase.

111
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:44,506
What's the matter?

112
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:45,525
Mr. Xiao,

113
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:48,164
you need to stop waking up from
the wrong side of the bed every day.

114
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:49,545
Every day?

115
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:54,565
You see, I...

116
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:58,545
Due to the bug in the game...

117
00:06:58,646 --> 00:06:59,364
I mean, due to work,

118
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:00,724
therefore,

119
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:03,545
I do know Mr. Xiao to a certain extent.

120
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:07,506
To a certain extent?

121
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:12,604
You two barged into
my office this early together.

122
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:15,306
Did you two wake up together as well?

123
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:17,465
- I...
- Not at all.

124
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:19,345
We met up this morning.

125
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:20,645
That's right.

126
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:22,705
We came here together
after taking breakfast.

127
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:24,105
Breakfast?

128
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:26,720
So, you asked her out this early
in the morning just to have breakfast?

129
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,645
Don't tell me

130
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,545
you plan to go for
a morning jog with her?

131
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:31,685
That's right.

132
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:33,345
We were planning
to go for a morning jog.

133
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,105
Stop it.

134
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:36,724
That's enough.

135
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:37,325
What is it?

136
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,044
Get to the point.

137
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:39,125
We need to head

138
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,105
to Lan Yao Studio after this.

139
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:43,604
Mr. Xiao, it's like this.

140
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:45,205
We've developed a new PR statement

141
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:47,164
as per your instructions.

142
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,145
The online date report is also ready.

143
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:58,364
I assume the netizens

144
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:00,885
will stop being so aggressive
toward Shanhai Group

145
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:02,465
after we publish the announcement.

146
00:08:02,526 --> 00:08:03,244
With this,

147
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:05,665
we can focus on resolving
the issues related to the game.

148
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:09,765
Boss.

149
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:10,986
What are you doing here?

150
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:13,965
I already found out
who stole our account

151
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:15,940
and tampered with the game.

152
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,360
(Metaverse of Love Alpha Test
Issue Investigation Report)

153
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,905
Anyway, A installed a misleading guide
within the game.

154
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:23,484
She wanted to use our failure

155
00:08:23,485 --> 00:08:25,645
to obtain the rights to the project.

156
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:28,506
But she never expected her actions
to cause such dire consequences.

157
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:30,585
She would've taken over the project

158
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:33,045
if Vic didn't intervene.

159
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,285
However,

160
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:35,644
this alone cannot prove

161
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,545
that she was behind the incident.

162
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:38,945
It can only prove

163
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:40,285
that she tampered with your PC.

164
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,266
I realized that she was
an avid social media user.

165
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:45,405
Therefore, I pretended
to be a fan of hers

166
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:47,165
and kept in touch with her online.

167
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,360
That's how I was able
to procure all this evidence.

168
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,445
Notify the company

169
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:54,040
to terminate our contract with A Team.

170
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,584
And, they're not allowed to participate
in any of our projects again.

171
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:57,545
Yes, Boss.

172
00:08:58,206 --> 00:08:59,706
Boss,

173
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:02,004
since the issue has been resolved,

174
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:04,626
can I return to work now?

175
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,644
You don't need
to worry about that first.

176
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:09,145
You can rest for a little longer.

177
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:11,844
It's been tough

178
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,545
on you these days.

179
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:15,266
You should let Big Ding help you out.

180
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,706
This time,
you were partly responsible too.

181
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:23,200
You should be more careful next time.

182
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:24,825
Alright!

183
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:25,965
Thank you, Boss!

184
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,106
Thank you, Ladyboss!

185
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,145
Don't call me that again!

186
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:40,124
Baby,

187
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,405
why are you awake?

188
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,466
Did I wake you up just now?

189
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:45,884
Actually, I woke up long ago.

190
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,360
I only left the room after you were done
with your live stream.

191
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,425
Come, have a seat.

192
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:53,285
Listen.

193
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:55,364
It's not that I'm not willing
to return with you.

194
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:56,925
But I have plenty of

195
00:09:56,926 --> 00:09:58,124
live stream equipment here.

196
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,825
It's too troublesome
to move them around.

197
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:04,285
You always stay up late.

198
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:05,945
I'm worried about your health.

199
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:10,205
I have no choice.

200
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:11,965
I'm the elder one in our relationship.

201
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,746
That means

202
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:15,825
I'm the breadwinner of the family.

203
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,624
I have no choice but to stay up late
and make enough money for the family.

204
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:19,405
I'm the same.

205
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:20,685
I can do this too.

206
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,425
What do you mean?

207
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:30,665
I...

208
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:41,884
If you don't want to tell me now,

209
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:42,565
you can stop.

210
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:43,604
And, never tell me again!

211
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:44,825
I'll support you, then.

212
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:46,746
In the future, I'll support the family.

213
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,185
He's such a kid.

214
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:01,244
This is the area.

215
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,145
The values here are incorrect.

216
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:07,866
Boss,

217
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,325
if I'm not mistaken,

218
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,285
we never wrote

219
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:11,626
these data files.

220
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:13,586
I've also checked the database
and spreadsheets.

221
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:15,445
According to my deduction,

222
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:18,484
the problematic content should be related
to the battle data of a hidden boss.

223
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:20,840
Due to the irregular data,
a fatal logical error was found

224
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,986
in the underlying algorithm.

225
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:23,665
Boss,

226
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:25,106
did you add the hidden boss

227
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,266
without our knowledge?

228
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:32,266
Boss,

229
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,165
why do you like adding easter eggs

230
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,626
and hidden bosses to the game?

231
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:39,586
But now, it seems like

232
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,746
this is the cause of the issue.

233
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:47,305
What's wrong?

234
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:49,106
Why do you look so pale?

235
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,545
It's nothing.

236
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:00,285
Vic and Xiangyu have arrived.

237
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,506
Let's head over there.

238
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:02,866
Okay.

239
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:16,965
Ms. Lan Yao,
judging from your expression,

240
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:17,764
I assume

241
00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:18,965
you guys have located

242
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:20,305
the bug, right?

243
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:22,685
Ms. Lan Yao,

244
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:25,124
I can tell that you're very fond

245
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,506
of this hidden boss.

246
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:27,644
You've applied

247
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:29,905
multiple layers of data packets on it,

248
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:32,665
even affecting the core
calculation logic of the game.

249
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:33,986
Of course,

250
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,106
since Ms. Shen has hired me,

251
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:38,065
I'll surely be able
to accomplish the mission.

252
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:40,466
I can promise that
I'll resolve the issue on time

253
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,746
and make sure
it doesn't affect the game launch.

254
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:46,706
However, regarding the payment,

255
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:51,346
according to Shanhai Group's
current situation,

256
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:52,706
it's not enough.

257
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,226
It's way too little.

258
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:58,506
Regarding that,

259
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:00,004
I'll think of a solution.

260
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:00,925
Xiao Ran,

261
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:02,425
you should stop putting on a front.

262
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:05,520
I know you don't want the Shen Group
to own a part of your company.

263
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,905
But since it has come to this,

264
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,844
you can only resolve this issue
if I purchase your shares

265
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:12,905
as the representative of Shen Group.

266
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,346
I know you don't trust me completely.

267
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:19,346
But we need to consider the loss ratio.

268
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:20,400
The failure of the game

269
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,880
is far more serious than us
acquiring some of your company's shares.

270
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,866
Moreover,
I notified the media last night.

271
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,565
I would guarantee

272
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,866
the success of the game
on account of Lin Qiao.

273
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:31,440
You can trust me now that both Lin Qiao

274
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,386
and the media are putting me
under surveillance, right?

275
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:36,545
Regarding the solution to this,

276
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:39,226
I still have to consider
Lingling's opinion.

277
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,346
I can only make a decision

278
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:44,386
after she agrees to it.

279
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:47,226
Regarding that,

280
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:49,226
you guys can do as you deem fit.

281
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:51,986
Alright.

282
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:54,305
That's all for today.

283
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:55,960
We'll take some time to consider it.

284
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,106
I'll see you guys off.

285
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:02,825
Take care.

286
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:18,844
Since you already know about

287
00:14:18,845 --> 00:14:20,484
the cause of the bug,

288
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,586
have you come up with a solution for it?

289
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:24,364
It's not that difficult.

290
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,644
The simplest method

291
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:26,565
is to delete all data

292
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,305
related to this character.

293
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,106
No.

294
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:31,825
The character mustn't be deleted.

295
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,244
Seems like you also know

296
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:36,586
about the importance
of this character to Ms. Song.

297
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:38,484
When I first discovered it,

298
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:39,524
I thought to myself

299
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:40,124
that this boss

300
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,364
wasn't just a simple 2D character.

301
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:44,524
It may contain all her emotions

302
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:45,445
and memories.

303
00:14:45,446 --> 00:14:48,626
It might even be the representation
of a character in her life.

304
00:14:48,966 --> 00:14:51,665
If so, is there any way
to resolve this issue

305
00:14:51,686 --> 00:14:53,524
without deleting the character?

306
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,305
Yeah.

307
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:55,604
I also wish

308
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:57,185
to challenge myself.

309
00:14:57,406 --> 00:15:00,825
However, I can't tell you whether or not

310
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,305
I can resolve this issue
in a short period.

311
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:06,045
It might take longer than you think.

312
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:07,844
I wonder if Shanhai Group
has enough capital

313
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:09,425
to last until then.

314
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:12,905
Regarding this, I still have
to wait for Lingling's decision.

315
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:14,364
Fine, then.

316
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:15,405
Take your time.

317
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:18,386
However, this might be your only chance.

318
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:55,825
Xiao Ran.

319
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:59,665
Was I wrong from the start?

320
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,685
The game wouldn't have become

321
00:16:02,686 --> 00:16:04,145
unbalanced

322
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,346
if I didn't set
my brother's strength so high.

323
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:09,905
Everyone is working hard
to resolve this issue.

324
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:11,466
But now...

325
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:15,986
It's all my fault.

326
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:19,226
Lingling,

327
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,746
I understand your feelings.

328
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:23,665
I know

329
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:26,106
that your brother
is very important to you.

330
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,520
Therefore, this character
has a unique place in your heart.

331
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,160
You don't need to blame yourself.

332
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,386
But there's no way
I'm not blaming myself for this.

333
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,266
Our alpha testing
failed time and time again.

334
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:37,405
The company's shareholders doubted you.

335
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:39,185
Mr. Lin was forced to resign.

336
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,506
All of my employees had to
work overtime day after day.

337
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:45,665
And, it's all because of me.

338
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,185
Actually, I know.

339
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,085
To Vic,

340
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:55,226
the fastest solution

341
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:57,266
is to delete the boss.

342
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:58,866
Don't worry.

343
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,706
I won't let him do it.

344
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:03,986
Thank you, Xiao Ran.

345
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:09,305
You should return to the company first.

346
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:11,025
I wish to be alone for now.

347
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:14,585
Okay.

348
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:30,266
Lingling,

349
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:32,785
I'm always here for you.

350
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:49,524
(Xiao Ran disagreed with their decision
to delete the character.)

351
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:52,065
(I'm sure he did it for my sake.)

352
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:53,645
(But I shouldn't let him)

353
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:55,266
(bear all the pressure again.)

354
00:17:56,646 --> 00:17:58,885
(But if Brother vanishes,)

355
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:01,305
(everything will be meaningless.)

356
00:18:32,926 --> 00:18:33,785
Lingling.

357
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:40,545
Brother.

358
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:45,625
Silly girl, from now on, I won't be able
to keep you company.

359
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:47,426
You must take good care of yourself.

360
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:49,266
Where are you going?

361
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:53,266
Somewhere far away.

362
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:55,545
Brother.

363
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:57,266
I won't allow you to leave.

364
00:18:58,325 --> 00:18:59,426
Silly girl.

365
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:01,226
I'm just an in-game character.

366
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:02,764
I'll vanish one day.

367
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:04,244
I'll protect you.

368
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:06,284
I won't let anyone harm you.

369
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:06,925
Brother,

370
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:08,205
can you please don't leave me?

371
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:09,645
I don't wish to lose you again.

372
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:11,625
Can you stay here and keep me company?

373
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:14,865
Brother?

374
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:17,146
Brother?

375
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:18,865
Brother?

376
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:44,986
You're awake.

377
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:46,906
Do you feel unwell?

378
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,906
I'm fine.

379
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,965
Why am I in the hospital?

380
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:53,305
Lie down for now.

381
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,885
You fainted in the studio
after being electrocuted.

382
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:18,746
Xiong and the rest
sent you to the hospital.

383
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:21,506
That's right.

384
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:22,906
I remember now.

385
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:26,345
Don't tell me
you tried to do something silly

386
00:20:26,485 --> 00:20:28,845
because of public opinion?

387
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:30,305
Because of public opinion?

388
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:33,186
Don't overthink it.

389
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:34,865
This time,

390
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:36,324
it was just an accident.

391
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:37,146
I'm serious.

392
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:40,125
I thought

393
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:41,825
you were stressed out.

394
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,466
It's fine as long as you're okay.

395
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:45,226
Remember,

396
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:46,466
I'm always here for you.

397
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:49,345
You're so mushy.

398
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:50,865
That's right.

399
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:52,266
What's wrong?

400
00:20:54,846 --> 00:20:57,305
I...

401
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:58,906
I think I'm hearing things.

402
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:03,065
By the way,

403
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:06,025
I've decided to halt
the development of the game.

404
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:07,845
We can talk about it
after you've recovered.

405
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:08,705
But this will delay...

406
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:10,105
I know what you're trying to say.

407
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:12,084
But your health is more important.

408
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:13,466
Just follow my arrangements.

409
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:20,165
Lingling!

410
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,305
Guo?

411
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:24,365
Mom, what are you doing here?

412
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,305
What happened to you?

413
00:21:25,406 --> 00:21:27,466
You made me worried, you know?
How did this happen?

414
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:29,840
You should've told me
if you were stressed out, you know?

415
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,125
Calm down for now. Everything's fine.

416
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:33,205
Okay.

417
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:34,025
Calm down?

418
00:21:35,366 --> 00:21:36,785
I'm very calm right now.

419
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:40,004
People on the Internet said
you tried to take your own life.

420
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:42,365
Why didn't you look for me
when you were stressed out?

421
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:43,986
I tried to take my own life?

422
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:45,365
Mom,

423
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:47,865
how could you believe them?

424
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:49,724
This time,

425
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,044
it was just an accident.

426
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:52,385
Look. Aren't I

427
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:53,825
doing well right now?

428
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:55,290
You didn't try to take your own life?

429
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,585
Don't tell me someone tried to kill you?
Who's out to get you?

430
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:00,084
Mom, don't spout nonsense.

431
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,564
I'm a heartless person.

432
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:03,040
Why would I try to take my own life?

433
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,946
Don't you think
you're belittling your daughter?

434
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:06,965
Auntie, don't worry.

435
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:07,685
Lingling is fine.

436
00:22:07,686 --> 00:22:10,284
Doctor, is Lingling okay?
Will there be any side effects?

437
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,645
For example, post-traumatic syndrome?

438
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:12,426
Mom.

439
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:14,585
This is

440
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:18,785
one of my game's main investors.

441
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:22,426
This is Mr. Xiao Ran.

442
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,986
Mr. Xiao Ran?

443
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:27,625
Wait.

444
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,564
You're the boss, right?

445
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:30,385
Why are you here to visit your employee?

446
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:32,906
Don't you need to work?

447
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:34,284
Auntie,

448
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:35,785
you can call me Xiao Ran.

449
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:37,605
Lingling is the core figure

450
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,825
of our project.

451
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:41,266
Therefore, I'm here to check on her.

452
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:43,065
Besides that,

453
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,284
we have professional employees

454
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:45,845
handling the company's affairs.

455
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:47,724
Therefore, I'm not that busy.

456
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,880
If so, why are you concerned about her?

457
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,405
Why are you paying
so much attention to her?

458
00:22:51,406 --> 00:22:52,880
What about the rest of your employees?

459
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,205
Do you think she's unique?

460
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,764
Or do you have an ulterior motive?

461
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:56,865
Auntie,

462
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,125
you must be thirsty.

463
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,986
I'll pour you a glass of water.

464
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:03,365
You see.

465
00:23:03,366 --> 00:23:04,645
I knew you had an ulterior motive.

466
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:06,506
But you must cherish your opportunity.

467
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:07,284
Mom,

468
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,645
don't overthink it.

469
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:11,186
He's just here to check on me.

470
00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:16,065
Auntie, have some water.

471
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:17,625
By the way,

472
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,965
you said you had professional employees
tending to the company.

473
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,140
It must be a huge company, then.

474
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,165
How many employees do you have?
Are your parents still around?

475
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:24,906
Do you have any siblings?

476
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:25,445
Hey.

477
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:25,965
Mom,

478
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:27,965
why are you investigating
his background now?

479
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:28,906
Auntie,

480
00:23:29,446 --> 00:23:30,524
my father is still around.

481
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:32,266
I have an elder brother.

482
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:35,025
If so, does your family
have a history of hereditary diseases?

483
00:23:36,686 --> 00:23:37,585
I'm glad to hear that.

484
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:38,645
Mom,

485
00:23:38,646 --> 00:23:40,165
we were discussing work just now.

486
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,906
We're almost done.

487
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:43,365
Why don't you

488
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:44,746
return to the company first?

489
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,764
Alright. I'll make a move first, then.

490
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:51,645
Call me anytime

491
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:52,524
if you need anything.

492
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:53,186
Okay.

493
00:23:57,846 --> 00:23:58,804
You don't need to leave.

494
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:00,524
I should be the one leaving.

495
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:01,205
Lingling,

496
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,044
I'm glad

497
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:03,125
to see that you're okay.

498
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:04,925
As a boss, you should be
concerned about your employees.

499
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:07,000
As an employee, you should
communicate with your boss more often.

500
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,044
I'll be leaving now. Goodbye.

501
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:10,484
Mom, it's not what you think.
You're overthinking it.

502
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:11,645
Auntie, let me see you off.

503
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:12,625
No need for that.

504
00:24:17,485 --> 00:24:18,825
All done!

505
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,065
Why did you try to hide my identity?

506
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:36,946
What identity?

507
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:38,506
What do you think?

508
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:44,244
Alright now.

509
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:45,925
I shouldn't have deceived my mother.

510
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:47,025
It's my fault.

511
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:49,666
Why did you do so, then?

512
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:52,266
I...

513
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:57,226
I'm not prepared yet.

514
00:24:57,606 --> 00:24:58,724
And,

515
00:24:58,725 --> 00:25:00,724
I don't want anything else to crop up

516
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:02,785
at this crucial moment.

517
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:05,125
Just...

518
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:07,625
Just lie to my mother
for a little longer,

519
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:09,585
okay?

520
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,466
Okay?

521
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:17,284
Did you really think

522
00:25:17,285 --> 00:25:18,925
you could dupe your mother

523
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:20,545
with that terrible acting of yours?

524
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:22,885
My mother isn't that smart.

525
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:24,004
I know her well.

526
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:25,466
I don't think so.

527
00:25:25,646 --> 00:25:27,266
I feel the same.

528
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:30,946
What's wrong?

529
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:32,865
I...

530
00:25:34,485 --> 00:25:35,746
I think

531
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,585
I'm hearing things again.

532
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:42,405
I'll get the doctor.

533
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:43,946
It's fine.

534
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:45,585
Maybe...

535
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:47,706
Maybe it's a side effect
of the electrocution.

536
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:50,484
If so, you should rest well.

537
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:50,925
But...

538
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:51,785
Be a good girl.

539
00:25:56,686 --> 00:25:58,605
Pay attention to the patient in Ward 1.

540
00:25:58,606 --> 00:25:59,666
Yunfei.

541
00:26:01,926 --> 00:26:03,125
She's asleep.

542
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:04,545
Don't let anyone interrupt her.

543
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:06,324
Judging from the current situation,

544
00:26:06,325 --> 00:26:07,885
it's nothing major.

545
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:10,625
But she actually survived
after being electrocuted twice.

546
00:26:10,725 --> 00:26:12,865
Goddess Lanyao is a living miracle.

547
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,564
Look after her for me.

548
00:26:14,565 --> 00:26:16,280
I have some
company affairs to attend to.

549
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,186
I'll be back soon.

550
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:24,065
What? Did you say you're going
to suspend the game's development?

551
00:26:25,045 --> 00:26:27,186
I don't wish to repeat this again.

552
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,865
I've already told the PR Department
to issue an official notice.

553
00:26:30,126 --> 00:26:31,186
Xiao Ran.

554
00:26:31,446 --> 00:26:33,520
Do you think we're playing
with paper money here?

555
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
We've invested so much money
into its early development stage.

556
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,004
The game will be launched soon.

557
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:38,405
Why are we suspending it now?

558
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:39,564
Regarding the company's affairs,

559
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:40,724
I have the right to call a veto.

560
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:41,845
This is our company.

561
00:26:41,846 --> 00:26:43,205
Do you think we're playing house here?

562
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:45,240
What makes you guarantee
that our company's revenue

563
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,226
will improve by the end of the year
if you keep this up?

564
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:51,706
Now, everyone on the Internet is talking
about the scandal between you and Lan Yao.

565
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:54,244
She's mentally unstable.

566
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,925
Not only did you not replace her team,

567
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:57,746
but you voiced
your support for her instead.

568
00:26:58,886 --> 00:27:00,205
The affair between me and Lan Yao

569
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:01,666
is private.

570
00:27:01,805 --> 00:27:03,946
The board of directors
doesn't need to worry.

571
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:07,666
I'm not here to collect your opinions.

572
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:11,266
I don't plan on changing my mind.

573
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,666
You're acting
on your own initiative here.

574
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,845
Don't think that you can
do whatever you want

575
00:27:15,846 --> 00:27:17,865
just because your father
is backing you up?

576
00:27:22,366 --> 00:27:23,625
Suspending the game's development

577
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:24,986
is my decision.

578
00:27:25,886 --> 00:27:27,345
I'll bear all the responsibilities

579
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:30,025
if there are any issues.

580
00:27:34,765 --> 00:27:35,986
You liar.

581
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:37,084
Hurry and release me

582
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:39,004
from your body!

583
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,244
If not,

584
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:42,105
I'll take your life!

585
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:46,466
Why do I...

586
00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:49,025
Why do I feel like
I'm hearing Xing Tian's voice?

587
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,004
Did you hear me or not?

588
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,405
What sorcery have you cast

589
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,865
to trap me in your body?

590
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,146
Who exactly are you?

591
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:03,764
This is my name,

592
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,025
and I shall not change it.

593
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:08,186
I'm Xing Tian, Jiuzhou's God of War.

594
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:09,724
You...

595
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:11,625
How could you talk to me?

596
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:12,946
I...

597
00:28:13,686 --> 00:28:15,426
I'm not drunk either.

598
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:17,865
I just woke up, didn't I?

599
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:19,825
What exactly is going on?

600
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:23,506
I must be hearing things.

601
00:28:23,525 --> 00:28:24,825
That must be it.

602
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:27,906
Stop pretending.

603
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:29,845
Baby,

604
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:30,405
how are you?

605
00:28:30,406 --> 00:28:31,484
Let me take a look at you. Are you okay?

606
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:32,284
Yiyi.

607
00:28:32,285 --> 00:28:34,125
I'm fine. It's just that...

608
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:35,226
What is it?

609
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:38,545
It's nothing.

610
00:28:39,005 --> 00:28:41,466
I'm able to recover all thanks
to Dr. Zhang's meticulous care.

611
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:43,925
Since you've done your best

612
00:28:43,926 --> 00:28:46,146
to look after Lingling,

613
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:48,946
I shall give you a reward.

614
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:53,965
Aren't you guys

615
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,025
being too bold?

616
00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:58,044
You gigolo!

617
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:00,125
How dare you seduce my wife?

618
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:01,186
You have a death wish!

619
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:05,025
You!

620
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:07,044
Are you okay?

621
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,025
Are you okay?

622
00:29:09,245 --> 00:29:10,044
Darling,

623
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:11,125
have you forgotten about me?

624
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:11,524
Lingling!

625
00:29:11,525 --> 00:29:12,365
I'm Xing Tian!

626
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:13,065
I...

627
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:13,724
Xiao Ran, hurry!

628
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:15,625
- She's turning into Xing Tian! Hurry!
- Darling!

629
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:16,405
Darling!

630
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:17,065
Lingling!

631
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:17,845
Lingling!

632
00:29:17,846 --> 00:29:18,825
Let go of me!

633
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:19,845
Lingling!

634
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:20,426
Darling!

635
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:21,764
What's going on?

636
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:22,585
Darling!

637
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:24,640
Why are you still standing there?
Help us out!

638
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:26,466
Let go!

639
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:31,244
Let go of me!

640
00:29:31,245 --> 00:29:32,205
Let go of me!

641
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:33,440
I need to look for my wife!

642
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,365
- What should we do?
- You guys should leave the room.

643
00:29:35,366 --> 00:29:36,400
Can you deal with her?

644
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,000
Get out!

645
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,946
Let's go!

646
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:38,986
Lingling!

647
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:41,885
Crook, let go of me!

648
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:43,564
If not, I'll show you no mercy!

649
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:44,426
Lingling!

650
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:57,345
Lingling!

651
00:29:57,646 --> 00:29:58,506
Lingling!

652
00:30:05,686 --> 00:30:07,405
So, what exactly is going on?

653
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,946
Why did Goddess Lanyao
try to pin you down?

654
00:30:10,245 --> 00:30:12,585
Don't tell me
she have split personalities?

655
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:14,186
That's not it.

656
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:15,205
It's not what you think.

657
00:30:15,206 --> 00:30:16,706
Don't make blind guesses.

658
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:19,146
What exactly is going on, then?

659
00:30:21,565 --> 00:30:24,084
You see,

660
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:27,025
this is quite hard to fathom
if I explain it to you.

661
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,004
There's no rush. Take your time.

662
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:31,345
Maybe there's a way I can help her out.

663
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:33,845
To put it bluntly,

664
00:30:33,846 --> 00:30:37,524
Lingling is possessed by

665
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:38,965
the NPC she designed.

666
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:40,146
She was possessed?

667
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:51,345
Is she okay now?

668
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:54,785
She's okay for now.

669
00:30:55,926 --> 00:30:57,405
Before this,

670
00:30:57,406 --> 00:30:59,685
I thought you could
keep Xing Tian under control

671
00:30:59,686 --> 00:31:01,625
if you guys were in close contact?

672
00:31:01,886 --> 00:31:03,666
Why isn't it working this time?

673
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:10,065
I'm not sure either.

674
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:13,105
Maybe it's because
of the second electrocution.

675
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,906
In my opinion, it's better
for her to be discharged.

676
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:19,025
The hospital is crowded after all.

677
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,445
If someone takes a picture of her,

678
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,284
it might cause another scandal.

679
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:23,506
Yeah.

680
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:25,564
People might say that Lingling

681
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:26,865
is mentally unstable again.

682
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:33,266
(Why can't I keep Xing Tian under control
with physical contact anymore?)
