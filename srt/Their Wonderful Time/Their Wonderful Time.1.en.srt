00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:00,708
(Xiao Ran,
come to the rendezvous point.)

30
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,748
(Warriors.)

31
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:20,549
(You are entrusted
with a greater mission.)

32
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:24,349
(You will travel to where
the past and the future connect.)

33
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,708
(The treasure hidden there)

34
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,829
(can restore order
to this chaotic time.)

35
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:44,069
Look at the graphics

36
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,949
and this beautiful view.

37
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:48,148
As expected of the game I created.

38
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,509
It's extraordinary.

39
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:51,989
(After you cross the Gate of Void,)

40
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,308
(your mission will begin.)

41
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:54,989
(Those who embark on this mission)

42
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,349
(will have a dangerous path
ahead of you.)

43
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:58,708
It's show time for me.

44
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:12,708
Who's shaking me

45
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,748
at this time?

46
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:15,588
System error, please log in again.

47
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:16,109
Lingling!

48
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:17,188
Lingling!

49
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:20,669
Ms. Guo.

50
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:22,069
Why are you here?

51
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:24,148
You scared me.

52
00:03:24,148 --> 00:03:25,989
Are you ill again?

53
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,789
Let's go to the hospital right now.

54
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:28,748
Come.

55
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:29,789
Mom, I'm fine.

56
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:30,829
I was working just now.

57
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:32,509
You call sleeping working?

58
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,109
I want to do this kind of work too.

59
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:36,069
(The hidden boss
is the embodiment of wisdom.)

60
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,829
(Please choose whether or not
you will accept this test.)

61
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,109
The rest of you should attack
the hidden monster.

62
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:40,989
I'll clear the stage.

63
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,389
Then we can speed up

64
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,060
so that it won't affect
the market launch.

65
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,588
Well. I really have to work.

66
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:51,308
Just put it here. I'll eat it later.

67
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:54,428
Is your work more important
or my love for you?

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,148
You are more important.

69
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,908
You don't have to worry about me.

70
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:07,308
I'll eat.

71
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:08,428
Finish it.

72
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,980
(Metaverse of Love)

73
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,669
Who's the insolent intruder?

74
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:29,748
(The combat power of the stage boss
is indeed formidable.)

75
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:33,828
This is strange.

76
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:35,308
I didn't feel so ill at ease

77
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:38,308
when he fought in the past.

78
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,149
Darling!

79
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:52,709
Let's go.

80
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:56,909
What's going on?

81
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:57,820
Why is he running away?

82
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,789
General.

83
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:04,748
Darling.

84
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:07,589
I don't think I can make it.

85
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:09,909
Darling.

86
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:13,149
Darling!

87
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:17,149
You scoundrel!

88
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:20,669
You killed my family.

89
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,589
I will kill you

90
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:26,669
in my next life to avenge my family!

91
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,700
(The game cannot be logged in.)

92
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,828
There's a bug with the game.

93
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:48,109
What's going on?

94
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:50,109
Boss. This is bad.

95
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:51,480
Something is wrong with the system.

96
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,909
Wait for me. I'll be there soon.

97
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:53,549
Okay.

98
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:07,029
Boss.

99
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:09,469
Boss!

100
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:11,789
Ask for help!

101
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:12,508
Be careful.

102
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:14,029
Boss. Call the ambulance.

103
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:15,748
Hello. Is this the emergency center?

104
00:06:15,748 --> 00:06:17,000
Someone here who has passed out.

105
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:18,589
Lan Yao Studio.

106
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:19,709
Yes.

107
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:20,828
Okay.

108
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:24,709
Here.

109
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:25,748
Be careful.

110
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,828
Brother.

111
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:44,268
The board of directors
want to see you.

112
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:44,989
Everyone pays

113
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,669
close attention to this beta test.

114
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,149
With such a huge mistake,

115
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,530
Uncle Chen and the others
will probably be quite mean later.

116
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:54,789
I just received a call
from the hospital

117
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,420
saying that Dad
is throwing a tantrum again.

118
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,109
I'll accompany him at the hospital.

119
00:06:58,109 --> 00:06:59,188
Go to the meeting first.

120
00:06:59,188 --> 00:06:59,868
Remember.

121
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:00,989
Don't act recklessly.

122
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,068
Play it by ear.

123
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:03,068
Don't worry.

124
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:04,029
I can handle it.

125
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:10,709
I'm told

126
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,508
that Shanhai Group is investing

127
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:14,229
in a game called "Metaverse of Love".

128
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:15,469
Both the NPCs

129
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,789
and the graphics of the game

130
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,549
are immersive and enjoyable, right?

131
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:19,109
Of course.

132
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:20,268
Shanhai Group

133
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:21,868
has always aimed for perfection.

134
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,748
The center of attention

135
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:25,428
is the gaming platform for this game.

136
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,628
Unlike traditional gaming platforms,

137
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:29,428
with the most advanced technology,

138
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:31,508
the players just need
to close their eyes

139
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:32,549
and enjoy

140
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:35,868
this groundbreaking game
immersively in their brain.

141
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:36,989
Shanhai Group

142
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,349
will hold a conference

143
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:41,030
with the master creator of the game,
Lan Yao Studio, in a week's time.

144
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,388
I'm told that the female designer
of this game,

145
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:44,149
Goddess Lanyao,

146
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:46,469
is a genius
who studied overseas, right?

147
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:47,828
I really look forward

148
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:49,828
to witnessing Goddess Lanyao's

149
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:50,628
creativity.

150
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,349
You have a shareholder's meeting
in half an hour,

151
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:54,469
a video conference at eight tonight

152
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:56,589
with the manufacturer
of the gaming glasses.

153
00:07:56,828 --> 00:07:57,669
Next,

154
00:07:58,388 --> 00:07:59,349
take a look at this.

155
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:00,930
Our Public Sentiment Department
is analyzing

156
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:03,229
the feedback of the netizens
toward this game.

157
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,748
The Public Relations Department
is handling the media.

158
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,909
What about Lanyao?

159
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,068
I can't reach her.

160
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,709
I can't reach her on her phone.

161
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:12,068
Make sure I see Lanyao after the meeting.

162
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:12,909
Okay, Boss.

163
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,820
(In-Patient)

164
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:41,388
Where am I?

165
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:44,388
Why don't I recognize this place?

166
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:51,508
Am I

167
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,388
dead?

168
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,069
My fellow elder.

169
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:18,548
Can you lend me

170
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:19,748
your mount?

171
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:23,548
After I find my wife,

172
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:26,069
I'll reward you handsomely.

173
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:27,709
No need to be so courteous.

174
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:32,028
But this mount is passed down
from my ancestors.

175
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:34,268
I can't simply give it to someone else.

176
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:34,989
I understand.

177
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:37,748
How about this?

178
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,349
I'm willing to exchange it
with my treasure.

179
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:47,788
Come forth, my hammers!

180
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:54,028
Where's my hammer?

181
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,949
It must be due to the wrong posture.

182
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:01,429
Come forth, my hammers!

183
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,109
Come forth, my hammers!

184
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:08,190
Come forth, my hammers!

185
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:10,069
Come forth, my hammers!

186
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:15,668
Old man.

187
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:20,788
I must have lost my power
after the great fight.

188
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,028
That's why I can't summon my hammers.

189
00:10:24,109 --> 00:10:26,589
Can you give me a few more days?

190
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:28,229
I'll exchange them for your mount.

191
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:30,908
No need to trouble yourself.

192
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:32,908
I'm touched

193
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:35,349
by the love between you and your wife.

194
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,189
Now, I've decided

195
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:39,709
to give this to you as a gift.

196
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,628
You are a hero.

197
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:46,548
I will repay you for your kindness.

198
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:47,668
Have a seat.

199
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:48,268
Okay.

200
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,989
I asked you to wait for me
after the test.

201
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:51,949
Where are you running off to?

202
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:53,668
I...

203
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:55,788
I'm heading back to my ward.

204
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,668
Do you remember which ward it is?

205
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:01,109
Psychiatric ward no. 6.

206
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:02,229
At least you know.

207
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:05,989
Old man.

208
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:07,028
My mount.

209
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:08,868
Enough. Stop it.

210
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:17,230
Hello, my fellow shareholders.

211
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:20,949
Metaverse of Love

212
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:23,628
is indeed forward-looking
and innovative.

213
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:26,148
However, it requires a lot of funds.

214
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:27,469
Mr. Li.

215
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,388
You must have invested
a lot in it, right?

216
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:31,989
Now that there's an issue with it,

217
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:33,589
what should we do?

218
00:11:33,868 --> 00:11:36,268
We should stop investing in it
to cut our losses.

219
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:37,788
Right?

220
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:39,829
The issue during the beta test

221
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:41,309
is just a minor

222
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,469
technical problem.

223
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:46,229
Please believe that Lanyao and I will
resolve it as soon as possible.

224
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:49,430
Lanyao? What does she call herself again?

225
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:51,388
The Goddess of Game.

226
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:54,268
Young people now

227
00:11:54,268 --> 00:11:56,069
are so confident

228
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:57,949
despite not being capable.

229
00:11:58,748 --> 00:12:01,028
Mr. Chen, are you doubting my choice?

230
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:02,668
No.

231
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:08,148
I have the veto power.

232
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:08,949
You...

233
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:14,388
Mr. Chen.

234
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:15,949
Mr. Chen.

235
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:16,989
Are you okay, Mr. Chen?

236
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,309
Mr. Chen.

237
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,868
You need to trust Mr. Xiao.

238
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:23,748
He won't make a wrong judgment.

239
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:26,148
We need Mr. Xiao

240
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:28,748
to help us with our retirement funds.

241
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:31,229
If we can't launch the game

242
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:33,309
within the designated time,

243
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:37,829
I'll take full responsibility for it
to compensate you for your losses.

244
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:41,189
Since you are so confident,

245
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:43,109
let me add another condition.

246
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,908
If the project fails,

247
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:47,148
shouldn't you

248
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:49,868
quit as the CEO?

249
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:56,989
Okay.

250
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,908
Deal.

251
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,028
Why are you here?

252
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,940
(Men's Toilet)

253
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:07,189
Is this the men's toilet?

254
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:07,949
It is.

255
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:15,868
Why...

256
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:17,589
Why is it gone?

257
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:28,908
Who are you?

258
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:55,069
I've turned into a woman.

259
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,349
Hurry up.

260
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:57,388
She's right inside.

261
00:13:58,429 --> 00:13:59,189
Here.

262
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:02,028
It's really you.
I told you not to run around, right?

263
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:04,189
Yes, that's her.

264
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:04,829
That's her.

265
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:06,148
It's improper for men and women
to touch each other.

266
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:06,788
That's her.

267
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:08,949
Why didn't you think it was improper
when you knocked me out?

268
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,109
You can't do this.

269
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:13,628
Stop running around.

270
00:14:13,628 --> 00:14:14,748
Rest up.

271
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:17,148
I'm a warrior.

272
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,628
But I'm caught by two women.

273
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:21,069
This body

274
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,668
is really useless.

275
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:24,349
Don't run around again.

276
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:27,868
You have my words.

277
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:34,630
Let's report this to our dean

278
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:36,709
and transfer her
to the psychiatric ward.

279
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:38,709
She's too much trouble.

280
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:40,508
Okay. I'll report it.

281
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:50,268
I, Xing Tian,

282
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:53,548
was a formidable warrior
on the battlefield.

283
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:54,868
But now,

284
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:57,668
I've turned into a weak woman.

285
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:00,548
Darling,

286
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:02,668
can I protect you

287
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:04,908
with this body?

288
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:06,229
Don't worry.

289
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:07,800
I've handled the things at the company.

290
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,069
I'm at the hospital now.

291
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:10,388
Which ward is he in?

292
00:15:30,748 --> 00:15:31,589
Stop right there!

293
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:37,949
It's you.

294
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,189
Do we know each other?

295
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:42,829
Stop acting dumb.

296
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,908
I remember

297
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:47,069
everything you did.

298
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:56,628
You are

299
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:57,429
that 100.

300
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,189
Ding. Get ready with the contract.

301
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:02,349
I'll go and meet Lanyao now.

302
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:03,868
If everything goes well,

303
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:05,028
sign the contract with her.

304
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:06,028
Okay.

305
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,200
Stop right there.

306
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:17,271
♪I see you now, I've taken you lightly,
I'm now lost in you♪

307
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:18,189
I'm sorry.

308
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:19,668
I accidentally dirtied your pants.

309
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,028
I was in a rush just now.

310
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:22,788
Today is a very important day for me.

311
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,229
How about this?

312
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:27,718
♪We passed by each other♪

313
00:16:27,748 --> 00:16:28,628
Take this.

314
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,980
Wash your pants with it.

315
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:32,615
♪I turn back time to search for you♪

316
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:35,811
♪I stand on tiptoe to reach you♪

317
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,786
♪I pass by sunset and run into dawn♪

318
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,229
One hundred should be enough, right?

319
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:40,469
One hundred?

320
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:42,388
Keep the change.

321
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,260
What are you trying to do again?

322
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:58,309
I will never forgive you
for killing my wife!

323
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,200
Come forth, my hammers!

324
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:03,748
You are a lunatic.

325
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:07,068
Don't you dare run away.

326
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,869
What are you doing?

327
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:18,949
Get down.

328
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:20,389
You scoundrel.

329
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:22,389
Since we've run into each other today,

330
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,788
I can't let you get away
until I've sought my revenge.

331
00:17:24,788 --> 00:17:25,548
Are you crazy?

332
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:26,820
I've never done anything to offend you.

333
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:28,028
How dare you lie.

334
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:29,548
Have a taste of my Hulking Drop.

335
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:34,229
This body is useless.

336
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:35,308
Get down from me at once.

337
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:42,909
What's going on?

338
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,788
Why do I feel so dizzy?

339
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:46,709
I haven't avenged my family.

340
00:17:58,629 --> 00:17:59,709
Well. Xiao...

341
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:03,709
I...

342
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:05,869
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,229
What's the point of having police
if an apology can solve everything?

344
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:09,230
I'm going to call the police.

345
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:22,429
Give me my phone.

346
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:24,389
Don't act rashly.

347
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:25,229
Calm down.

348
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,068
Don't be mad.

349
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:26,989
Give me my phone.

350
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:29,548
Can you forgive me?

351
00:18:30,748 --> 00:18:31,748
I swear

352
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,469
that I didn't bite your ear on purpose.

353
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:36,748
If you are really mad,

354
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,149
you can bite mine in return.

355
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,709
If there's something wrong
with your brain,

356
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:47,909
you should do a CT scan.

357
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:49,469
Okay.

358
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:50,909
I'll make an appointment right now.

359
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:11,068
What happened?

360
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:13,588
Dad.

361
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:15,869
Ran will arrive soon.

362
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:19,229
Do you want to have some fruit?

363
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,869
Drink some water.

364
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:33,840
You can place it there.

365
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:41,389
Dad.

366
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:43,149
Brother.

367
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:45,869
Dad, how are you?

368
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:46,828
I'm fine.

369
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:48,828
What took you so long?

370
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:49,949
How's the company?

371
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:51,788
Not bad.

372
00:19:52,828 --> 00:19:54,068
What kind of answer is that?

373
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,189
As the CEO of the company,

374
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:55,909
good is good

375
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:56,788
and bad is bad.

376
00:19:58,469 --> 00:19:59,429
I know

377
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:00,869
I'm strict toward you.

378
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:02,469
But since we are doing it,

379
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:03,828
we have to do our best.

380
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:07,588
Dad.

381
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:09,588
You've said so many things.

382
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:10,748
Can your heart take it?

383
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:11,548
Drink some water.

384
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:13,548
You are trying to distract me again.

385
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,548
Dad is always like this.

386
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:19,108
He doesn't trust me.

387
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:21,068
I've never seen him

388
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:22,229
lectured you like that.

389
00:20:22,869 --> 00:20:23,709
I think

390
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:25,268
he doesn't trust me at all.

391
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:30,869
Thank you for comforting me.

392
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:32,828
But I know very well

393
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,230
that he thinks highly of you.

394
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:39,508
He's all bark.

395
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:40,989
But in his heart,

396
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,588
he actually acknowledges you.

397
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:45,548
Otherwise, you won't ask you
to clean up after me

398
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:46,989
every time I make a mistake.

399
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,709
Everyone says that my brother
is a cold-hearted person.

400
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,629
But you are a kind and warm person.

401
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:55,548
Stop teasing me.

402
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:56,788
Don't worry.

403
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:58,629
I won't tell anyone about it.

404
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:02,229
After all, you have the cool and aloof
CEO image to keep up.

405
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:02,949
Brother.

406
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:03,469
Okay now.

407
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:04,869
I'll stop talking.

408
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:13,788
Baby, I'm here.

409
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,220
(Peace Hospital, Zhang Yunfei)

410
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:11,189
I'm sorry. I was in a rush just now.

411
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:13,669
Are you okay?

412
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:16,709
I'm fine.

413
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:21,869
I've dirtied your coat.

414
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,720
My best friend is in the hospital
because she's hurt.

415
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,229
I need to pay her a visit.

416
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:26,669
Dr. Zhang, right?

417
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,669
Okay. I remember you now.

418
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,149
We'll have a meal next time.

419
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:29,629
Bye.

420
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:32,669
Hello, Baby.

421
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:33,268
I'm here.

422
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,268
I've arrived.

423
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:34,909
Okay.

424
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:46,989
Baby, what happened?

425
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:48,268
How did you get electrocuted?

426
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:51,989
I'm so unlucky.

427
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,588
You...

428
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,548
Why are you in a wedding dress?

429
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:59,709
Did you

430
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:01,068
get married

431
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:02,909
while I was away?

432
00:23:03,268 --> 00:23:04,429
What are you thinking?

433
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:06,588
Do you think I'm someone

434
00:23:06,588 --> 00:23:08,229
who'll get married so easily?

435
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:10,869
I was doing a wedding dress
live broadcast just now.

436
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,189
I heard that you got hospitalized.
So, I rushed here at once.

437
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:13,930
I didn't even get changed.

438
00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:18,748
When did I get it dirty?

439
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:19,508
I'll get fined.

440
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:20,508
I need to clean it up now.

441
00:23:20,508 --> 00:23:21,788
- Let me help you.
- It's okay.

442
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,780
I'll return the wedding dress later
and help you with your discharge.

443
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,028
You scoundrel!

444
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:33,389
