29
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,671
So,

30
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:51,591
there's a mole within Shanhai Group.

31
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:53,172
And, the mole stole our account?

32
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:56,211
That's our current speculation.

33
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:57,990
This won't do.

34
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,671
I have to notify the others.

35
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:01,412
I mustn't let the mole get his way.

36
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,172
Xiong.

37
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,611
Brother.

38
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,972
Life is so tough here.

39
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:38,051
I can't take it anymore.

40
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:00,631
Lass,

41
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,492
it's been a long time
since you visited me.

42
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,652
Brother.

43
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:10,972
I missed you.

44
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:13,391
What happened?

45
00:04:13,392 --> 00:04:14,772
Have you been upset lately?

46
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:22,171
Lately,

47
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,412
there have been
some issues with our game.

48
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:28,332
I'm under huge stress.

49
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:29,591
There's no rush.

50
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:31,051
We can sit down and chat.

51
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:37,611
I think my dream

52
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,811
is drifting further
and further apart from me.

53
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:42,931
Once, I thought

54
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,412
good things would happen

55
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:47,532
as long as I worked hard enough.

56
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,332
But now,

57
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:52,412
issues keep cropping up.

58
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,851
The launch of our game
kept getting delayed.

59
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:58,012
I'm losing confidence in myself.

60
00:04:58,071 --> 00:04:59,972
I don't think I can resolve all of them.

61
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:02,772
I even think

62
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:06,092
that my limited capabilities

63
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,811
might be the reason
we ended up like this.

64
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:12,012
Brother,

65
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:15,012
this is my first time
feeling this exhausted.

66
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,151
Plenty of matters

67
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:18,550
consist of difficulties and issues

68
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,092
stacking upon one another.

69
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,972
There are hardships we must endure.

70
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:23,630
And, the only thing we can do

71
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:25,051
is to face them.

72
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:27,652
Escaping from reality
is never a good choice.

73
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:29,931
If you feel exhausted,

74
00:05:30,232 --> 00:05:31,731
you should take a break.

75
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:33,671
I'll always keep you company

76
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:35,452
no matter when.

77
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:39,412
Lingling,

78
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:42,572
it's difficult for us
to avoid disappointments and hardships.

79
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:44,031
But I know

80
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:45,572
that you've already done a great job.

81
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:48,012
Don't put yourself
under too much pressure, okay?

82
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:51,012
Brother,

83
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:52,892
do you know something?

84
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:56,051
I first developed this game

85
00:05:57,071 --> 00:05:58,731
so that you could

86
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:00,931
always remain in this world.

87
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,972
You can only stay by my side forever

88
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:09,532
once the game is launched.

89
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:11,931
But now,

90
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:14,611
I'm so exhausted.

91
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:17,892
I wish

92
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:20,811
to look at you in silence

93
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:23,691
for just a moment.

94
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,412
For just a moment.

95
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:30,430
You don't need

96
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,051
to act tough in front of me.

97
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,831
No matter when,

98
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:35,111
I'll always be there for you

99
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:36,532
as long as you need me.

100
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:43,251
Brother,

101
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,310
I have urgent matters to attend to.

102
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:46,811
I'll make a move first.

103
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:48,371
Go now.

104
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,611
I still like it better
when you look determined.

105
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,412
I'll always wait here for you.

106
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:08,371
Hello?

107
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:09,870
Hello, Ms. Song.

108
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:11,251
I'm Lin Qiao.

109
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,471
I was only reminded of the fact
that I promised to treat you

110
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:17,051
to a feast when
I passed by your company just now.

111
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:19,231
I wonder if you're free

112
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:21,251
to join me for a feast?

113
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:32,371
Brother,

114
00:07:32,472 --> 00:07:34,231
I'll say this one last time.

115
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:36,212
Are you sure you're going
to accept that solution?

116
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:37,471
I think

117
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:39,691
we can come up with better solutions.

118
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:56,560
(Lin Qiao: It's fine. This should be
the best for you, me, and Ms. Song.)

119
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,151
I was supposed to treat you to a feast.

120
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,070
What's with

121
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:29,831
the simple food?

122
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:31,251
It doesn't matter.

123
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,591
To me, these are

124
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:34,931
just as good as a fancy feast.

125
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:37,071
Moreover,

126
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:38,811
it's an awkward period too.

127
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:45,790
Sometimes,

128
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,231
I do wonder

129
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:49,892
if I'm too arrogant and reckless.

130
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:52,071
I'm rushing forward

131
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,012
without assessing my capabilities first.

132
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,191
Therefore,

133
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:58,732
in order to punish me,

134
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:01,071
God always makes things crop up

135
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,892
at the very last second.

136
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,652
Don't be like this.

137
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,051
You're very brave.

138
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,051
You have the bravery and boldness
to risk it all.

139
00:09:09,352 --> 00:09:10,892
And, you're outstanding.

140
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,451
I'm not.

141
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:16,571
I'm just good

142
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,091
at packaging myself

143
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:21,571
and preventing you all
from seeing the real me.

144
00:09:23,991 --> 00:09:25,211
Actually,

145
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:27,451
I know

146
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:28,910
how lousy I am.

147
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:30,252
Song Lingling,

148
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,012
don't belittle yourself like that.

149
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:34,831
Did you forget

150
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:36,852
how you consoled me back then?

151
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:39,191
Although it's tough on you

152
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:40,612
and you feel terrible now,

153
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:42,931
these aren't reasons
for you to be defeated.

154
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:45,852
I know that.

155
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,630
But the right to persist in my dream

156
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,191
isn't in my hands.

157
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:51,231
I can't just back you,

158
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:52,831
Xiao Ran,

159
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:54,870
and all of my employees

160
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:56,510
into a corner just because

161
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:58,171
I want to fulfill my dream, right?

162
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:03,012
Therefore,

163
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:05,772
I'll risk it all on this.

164
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:07,431
At most,

165
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:09,652
I'll make another comeback

166
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:11,711
after a few years.

167
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,091
Let me ask you this, then.

168
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,030
Do you wish to proceed
with this project?

169
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,051
I do.

170
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,790
To me, Metaverse of Love

171
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,892
is more than just a video game.

172
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:21,630
To me, it's...

173
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:22,971
Got it.

174
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:25,750
You just need to lead your team

175
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,551
and try your best to launch the game.

176
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:31,451
Leave the rest to me and Ran.

177
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,492
Really?

178
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:35,612
How will you resolve those issues?

179
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,990
Those are what we, the investors,
need to worry about.

180
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:41,532
Goddess Lanyao, you don't need
to pay any attention to it.

181
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:43,732
You just need to focus on your game.

182
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,191
Boss,

183
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:48,211
I need your decision on something.

184
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:49,252
Oh.

185
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:51,091
Go now.

186
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:00,211
What's wrong?

187
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:03,892
Are you hiding something from me?

188
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:08,492
No.

189
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:11,412
You can focus on your work.

190
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:12,811
Alright.

191
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,532
Enough already!

192
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:01,270
I've already made it clear
who's responsible for the incident.

193
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,291
And,

194
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:03,670
Mr. Lin has already resigned

195
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,171
due to his negligence.

196
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:07,132
Therefore, I'll emphasize this again.

197
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,091
This has nothing
to do with the design team.

198
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:11,191
Do you need me to repeat it again?

199
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:13,790
But what was the reason
Mr. Lin stole the game account?

200
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,772
Why did he try to stop the game
from being launched?

201
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:17,831
Meeting dismissed.

202
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:18,811
Mr. Xiao.

203
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:23,132
If this is the attitude
you're showing us,

204
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:26,331
don't blame us
for being old-fashioned, then.

205
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:29,270
So, what's your decision?

206
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:30,591
The board of directors

207
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:32,492
will postpone the game launch.

208
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,591
Next,

209
00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:36,372
we will do the follow-up regarding
the game's monetary investment.

210
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:39,390
Back then, we invested in the game

211
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,390
under Chairman Xiao's instructions.

212
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:43,311
Now, we're delaying the investment

213
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,591
after receiving instructions
from Chairman Xiao

214
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:48,132
in the hospital when we visited him.

215
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:49,990
If you agree to swap them out

216
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:52,412
for a professional game-developing team,

217
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:55,532
we can rescind our decision.

218
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:59,012
Fatty Ding,

219
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:01,231
if I'm not mistaken,

220
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:03,412
the time we agreed upon
hasn't arrived yet, right?

221
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:04,231
That's right.

222
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:06,111
We have half a week left.

223
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:07,471
I assume the A Team can't even

224
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:09,892
familiarize themselves
with the project in such a short time.

225
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:10,910
Aren't you guys afraid

226
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:12,711
that I'll remove all of
your investment shares?

227
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:14,652
You can take your time to consider it.

228
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:16,372
We're

229
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:17,732
not in a hurry.

230
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,431
Boss, you're bleeding!

231
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:38,132
I'll get you a band-aid!

232
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:51,111
What should we do?

233
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:52,732
I don't know what to do at all.

234
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,892
My goodness.

235
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:58,412
How did it end up like this?

236
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,351
What's wrong? You startled me.

237
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:01,231
Mr. Lin

238
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:03,150
has been fired by Shanhai Group.

239
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:05,831
He said he would bear
all the responsibilities

240
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:07,892
for the game's failed alpha testing.

241
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,591
How is that possible?
Don't spout nonsense.

242
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:12,510
I didn't. Read it yourself.

243
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:14,811
Fatty Ding posted a notice
in the group chat.

244
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:18,691
People are unpredictable indeed.

245
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:23,510
Xiong,

246
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:26,412
do not spout nonsense
before we get to the bottom of the case.

247
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:29,372
Fine.

248
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:32,351
You just need to lead your team

249
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:35,111
and try your best to launch the game.

250
00:14:35,112 --> 00:14:38,012
Leave the rest to me and Ran.

251
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:43,171
(Don't tell me
this is the solution he mentioned?)

252
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:47,852
No. This isn't right.

253
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:50,652
Meeting dismissed.
See you guys tomorrow.

254
00:14:56,432 --> 00:14:58,951
Boss, I've made a public announcement
for every department to see

255
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:00,691
as per your instructions.

256
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,111
However,

257
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:04,132
I have a question.

258
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:05,790
Why did Mr. Lin

259
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,630
resign all of a sudden?

260
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:09,471
Is this the solution you mentioned?

261
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:12,732
You used Mr. Lin as my scapegoat, huh?
You fired him in order to keep me here.

262
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:17,451
You found out, huh?

263
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:19,532
When do you plan to tell me the truth?

264
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:26,951
Why is he hurt?

265
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:29,012
Boss argued with the board of directors.

266
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:03,931
I know you're angry.

267
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:08,451
I don't wish to resolve the issue
with this method either.

268
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,591
But under such circumstances,

269
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:12,372
I had to make a choice.

270
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:15,331
I would rather you give up on me.

271
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:16,790
Mr. Lin

272
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,111
is very responsible for the company.

273
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,311
He shouldn't be the one

274
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,331
to bear the consequences.

275
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:25,191
I'm the person in charge
of the game's overall design.

276
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,372
I should bear all the responsibilities
if anything goes wrong.

277
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:30,591
I can't allow you to do so.

278
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:31,772
But why?

279
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:38,030
Can you separate
your personal feelings from work

280
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,591
before we discuss this issue?

281
00:16:39,592 --> 00:16:40,990
Isn't replacing Lan Yao Studio

282
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:43,351
a more logical solution?

283
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,652
You started this project from scratch.

284
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:47,191
Can you bear to hand it
to someone else?

285
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:48,772
I can't bear that.

286
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:52,772
But I can't let Mr. Lin
bear the consequences when he's innocent.

287
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,091
Just take it

288
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:58,971
as Brother's support.

289
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,931
He's resigning from the company

290
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:03,571
in hopes

291
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:05,731
that you can persist
until the last step.

292
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,412
Have you ever considered

293
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,111
the repercussions of this action

294
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:13,092
toward his future career?

295
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,991
Once news of this gets out,

296
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:18,612
it'll be difficult for him
to establish a foothold again.

297
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,292
If I can only succeed

298
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:24,332
by sacrificing someone else's
honor and future,

299
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:26,372
I would rather give up on this project.

300
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:32,000
I've already thought of
all the solutions I could think of.

301
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,491
This is the best solution, at least for now.

302
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,852
What's done is done.

303
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:39,111
I can only help him return
to the company

304
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:41,292
if you launch the game
as soon as possible.

305
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:44,451
Have you ever considered my feelings?

306
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:46,031
Have you ever considered

307
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,251
my will?

308
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:49,971
Of course.

309
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:52,892
But now, there's no way out.

310
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:55,011
At least

311
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,332
I can still protect you now.

312
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:02,691
Sorry.

313
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:04,831
I have no way to deal with

314
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:06,971
his sacrifice with peace of mind.

315
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:11,691
Lingling.

316
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:45,171
It's late.

317
00:18:45,431 --> 00:18:47,052
What are you doing here?

318
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:55,931
Have some warm water.

319
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,731
Mr. Lin.

320
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,412
You don't need to be like this.

321
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:03,731
Why don't you...

322
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,572
You should tell me off.

323
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:10,971
I came here

324
00:19:11,631 --> 00:19:13,612
to console you.

325
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,092
But I have no idea

326
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:18,251
how

327
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:20,691
to console you.

328
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:22,630
What about this?

329
00:19:22,631 --> 00:19:24,150
If you don't mind,

330
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:25,691
I'll drink with you.

331
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,251
One glass is enough, okay?

332
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:33,372
It's fine as long as
the intention's there.

333
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,011
I'll get a glass.

334
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:48,931
(What exactly should I do now?)

335
00:19:48,992 --> 00:19:50,430
(Why do I have to make a choice)

336
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:52,910
(between Brother and Lingling for this?)

337
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:54,852
(Isn't there a way
to gain the best of both worlds?)

338
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:57,430
(Brother has already done a lot for me.)

339
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,971
(I don't want him to sacrifice himself
for me again.)

340
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:02,572
(But do I have a choice?)

341
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:05,372
(What else can I do?)

342
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:06,670
(I'm too useless!)

343
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:08,111
(I'm incompetent!)

344
00:20:08,112 --> 00:20:10,572
(I can't even protect
the people dearest to me!)

345
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:14,052
(I'm all show and no substance!)

346
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,812
(I'm a rich man's useless son.)

347
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,430
You weren't boxing.

348
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:40,011
You were hurting yourself.

349
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:43,372
Let me ask you something.

350
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:46,292
Do you think I'm useless too?

351
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:50,251
You're pretty arrogant

352
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:52,251
usually.

353
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:53,390
I guess

354
00:20:53,391 --> 00:20:54,852
that's about it.

355
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:09,612
Don't worry.

356
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:11,332
I will

357
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:14,292
definitely prove your innocence.

358
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:17,171
I'll prove your innocence

359
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:21,412
even if it means
I have to give up on my game.

360
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:24,771
No.

361
00:21:26,391 --> 00:21:28,491
I can't give up on my game.

362
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:32,612
You can't hold your liquor at all, huh?

363
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:39,292
Stop drinking.

364
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:41,892
Xiao Ran, he...

365
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:45,852
He did the wrong thing.

366
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:49,332
He's a nice person.

367
00:21:51,032 --> 00:21:53,132
He's just like me.

368
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:56,892
He doesn't want you to get hurt.

369
00:21:58,272 --> 00:22:00,052
He's stuck in a dilemma.

370
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:04,731
You're stuck in a dilemma too.

371
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:06,931
Listen.

372
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:11,931
You mustn't blame Xiao Ran for this.

373
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,132
If you want to blame someone,

374
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:16,572
you should blame me for this.

375
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,652
I won't blame him.

376
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,412
He's my younger brother.

377
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,332
I'll always love him.

378
00:22:22,832 --> 00:22:24,812
You're an excellent girl too.

379
00:22:25,352 --> 00:22:26,892
He's lucky enough to encounter...

380
00:22:58,671 --> 00:22:59,991
Brother Lin?

381
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:01,670
It's you.

382
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,111
Long time no see.

383
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,412
I missed you, you know?

384
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,451
Brother Lin.

385
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:10,230
Don't tell me

386
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:12,531
you forgot about me, the mighty general?

387
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,812
However,

388
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:18,531
where are we?

389
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,211
This is my house.

390
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:24,292
Just now, you...

391
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:28,111
So, Brother Lin,

392
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:30,292
you have an exquisite house, huh?

393
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:33,251
May I take a look around?

394
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:36,292
You may go ahead.

395
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:01,551
Brother Lin, your liquor

396
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:03,292
looks exquisite too.

397
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:14,852
Ms. Song,

398
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:17,412
you should have some food.
It'll relieve your hangover.

399
00:24:18,552 --> 00:24:20,292
Why are you still drinking?

400
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:22,791
Brother Lin,

401
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,971
do not belittle me.

402
00:24:24,992 --> 00:24:27,230
I'm the god of liquor
in the Divine Palace.

403
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,812
I could finish eight vats
in a row, you know?

404
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:32,311
Speaking of which, Brother Lin,

405
00:24:32,312 --> 00:24:33,751
your preference in liquor

406
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:35,691
is no good.

407
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:38,292
This liquor is as bland as water.

408
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,292
This is no fun at all.

409
00:24:42,592 --> 00:24:43,531
By the way,

410
00:24:44,512 --> 00:24:45,771
Brother Lin,

411
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:48,971
why is your bed this tiny?

412
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:52,332
Where will your wife sleep?

413
00:24:57,752 --> 00:24:58,910
I'll tell you

414
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:00,292
if you give me the liquor.

415
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:10,812
I don't have a wife.

416
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,470
Brother Lin, you're an excellent man,

417
00:25:17,471 --> 00:25:19,372
yet you're actually unmarried?

418
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:21,751
If so,

419
00:25:21,752 --> 00:25:23,572
I'm sure

420
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:25,092
you have a lady you fancy.

421
00:25:29,512 --> 00:25:32,372
The issue isn't
whether or not I fancy her.

422
00:25:32,512 --> 00:25:33,551
Brother Lin, your matter

423
00:25:33,552 --> 00:25:35,211
is my matter.

424
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:37,190
We're buddies, you know?

425
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:38,910
You can tell me what's on your mind.

426
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:40,230
There's no need to be reserved.

427
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:41,332
That's not it.

428
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:42,531
You...

429
00:25:43,032 --> 00:25:44,731
It has nothing to do with you.

430
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:47,612
Our relationship is...

431
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,612
We don't have a special relationship.

432
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:54,251
Buddy...

433
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:56,852
Brother Lin.

434
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:05,731
Why is Brother Lin acting strange today?

435
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:12,451
Ran,

436
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,311
Ms. Song is at my house.

437
00:26:14,312 --> 00:26:15,591
I think she's drunk.

438
00:26:15,592 --> 00:26:16,910
You should hurry and pick her up.

439
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:17,960
The door is unlocked.

440
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,320
Alright. Keep her under control for now.
I'll be there in a second.

441
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,652
Where are you going?

442
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,531
I have something urgent to do.
I'll be going now.

443
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:25,831
No matter what happens,

444
00:26:25,832 --> 00:26:27,531
just tell me if you need any help.

445
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:31,451
I'll tell you the details later.

446
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:42,950
Ms. Song,

447
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:44,771
calm down.

448
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,011
I almost forgot.

449
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:58,251
I'm in a woman's body now.

450
00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:02,271
But I know he treats me as his buddy.

451
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,372
How could I let a woman's body

452
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:07,372
get in the way of our brotherhood?

453
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,612
Whenever I wake up,

454
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,150
it's either I'm on the floor

455
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:14,931
or on the bed.

456
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:16,852
And,

457
00:27:17,312 --> 00:27:19,731
it's always nighttime.

458
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:23,011
Could it be

459
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:26,950
that I only wake up

460
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:30,052
when this woman is asleep?

461
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:31,892
Ms. Song,

462
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:35,011
have you calmed yourself down?

463
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,332
You...

464
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:40,652
Don't be angry, okay?

465
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:42,332
You see...

466
00:27:43,832 --> 00:27:45,111
Don't worry.

467
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:48,111
I won't tell anyone

468
00:27:48,112 --> 00:27:49,531
about your mental condition.

469
00:27:49,552 --> 00:27:52,132
We'll take you to the best doctors.

470
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,511
Please wait a little longer.

471
00:27:55,512 --> 00:27:57,390
Xiao Ran will arrive soon.

472
00:27:57,391 --> 00:27:59,211
We'll send you to the hospital together.

473
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:03,111
Do you know Xiao Ran?

474
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:04,551
Of course I do.

475
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:06,092
He'll arrive soon.

476
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:10,751
That crook

477
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:12,971
actually knows Brother Lin?

478
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:14,511
No wonder

479
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:17,171
Brother Lin always avoided me.

480
00:28:17,231 --> 00:28:18,591
Could it be

481
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:19,910
that they're in cahoots?

482
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:22,491
Are they trying to capture me?

483
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,311
To think

484
00:28:26,312 --> 00:28:28,831
that I allowed that crook
to play me like a fiddle

485
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,132
after risking my life
in the battlefield for several decades.

486
00:28:33,431 --> 00:28:34,271
No.

487
00:28:34,272 --> 00:28:36,011
I have to escape somehow.

488
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:46,292
You can open the door now.

489
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:48,052
I feel much better now.

490
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:51,491
Really?

491
00:28:52,592 --> 00:28:54,292
Have you returned to normal?

492
00:28:58,272 --> 00:28:59,691
Don't worry.

493
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:16,150
Let me go! You crook!

494
00:29:16,151 --> 00:29:16,800
Ms. Song!

495
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,120
Although I don't know what's wrong with you,
I can't let you leave the house in this state!

496
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,332
Xiao Ran will be here soon!
Please calm down!

497
00:29:22,871 --> 00:29:24,412
