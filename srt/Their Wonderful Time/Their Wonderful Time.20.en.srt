Don't.

33
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,331
I don't deserve this.

34
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,211

Xiao Ran,

36
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:15,910
this is your house.

37
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:18,050
There's no reason for you
to sleep in the guest room.

38
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:19,589
You're making it

39
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,070
as if you're swallowing grievances

40
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:22,691
because I bullied you.

41
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,850
I understand now.

42
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:27,850
To you,

43
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,491
I'm just a tool you use to
deal with Xing Tian, huh?

44
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,350
Now that Xing Tian is gone,

45
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,971
I'm no longer useful to you, right?

46
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,371
Xiao Ran,

47
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:37,790
have you ever thought about

48
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,269
the words you uttered?

49
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,390
Don't you think
that you're in the wrong here?

50
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:42,709
Why does it sound like

51
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,771
I'm the one at fault here?

52
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,070
Xiao The Merciless,

53
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,691
you're an evil capitalist!

54
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,720
Your bed is so soft and comfortable

55
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,050
while people can barely
sleep on the bed in the guest room.

56
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:37,429
You forgot to take your pajama.

57
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,091
I brought it all the way here.

58
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:42,771
If so, I guess I have
to thank you, then.

59
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,811
That's not what I mean.

60
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,811
That's not what I mean at all.

61
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,811
Who's there?

62
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,651
Give me a second. Coming.

63
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,270
Yiyi.

64
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:23,490
It's you?

65
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,470
Why were you knocking on the door?

66
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,011
It's not like you don't have the keys.

67
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,069
I left the house in a rush today.

68
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,531
I forgot to take the keys with me.

69
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,170
I guess you have to
return to your home, then.

70
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,370
If so, what are you doing here?

71
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,509
I was taking my beauty nap, you know?

72
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,250
You interrupted me.

73
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:43,091
I didn't mean it.

74
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:48,170
Which incident were you referring to?

75
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,810
Forget it, then.

76
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:02,490
What are you doing?

77
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,830
You're not talking or apologizing to me.

78
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,290
Why are you here?

79
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,050
My mustache has grown.

80
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:14,490
I...

81
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:17,030
I hope that you can

82
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:19,211
shave it for me.

83
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:29,290
Shave your mustache for you?

84
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,170
Dr. Zhang, you don't even know

85
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:35,891
how to shave your mustache?

86
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:40,850
I know how to do it.

87
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:43,930
But it feels weird
for me to shave it myself

88
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,771
after you shaved it

89
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,971
for me.

90
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,069
Is this considered

91
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,050
an apology?

92
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:58,091
Fine.

93
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,270
I'll accept your apology for now.

94
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:02,730
But remember this.

95
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,771
I went easy on you this time.

96
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,549
I'll settle my debt with you next time.

97
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,331
Come inside. Close the door.

98
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,411
Your nose is pretty sharp

99
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,610
when I'm looking at you from this angle.

100
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,411
What are you doing here?

101
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,810
Get up!

102
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:48,771
Why did you hit me?

103
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:51,331
Did I infect you
with my morning grumpiness too?

104
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,370
Why are you lying beside me?

105
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:57,790

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,371
I've gathered some bits of news...

187
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,509
You two...

188
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,050
You two can go ahead.

189
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,170
Did you buy the cake for me

190
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,930
as an apology?

191
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:53,350
I thought

192
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:54,909
I kept it well hidden.

193
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,570
In the end, you still found out.

194
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:58,269
If so,

195
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,411
why didn't you
apologize to me last night?

196
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:01,830
You even pretended

197
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:03,851
not to care.

198
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:06,149
You didn't get in the car
of your own accord

199
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,290
when I picked you up yesterday.

200
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,411
I did so

201
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,330
to make you angry.

202
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,710
Me too.

203
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:15,050
Can't I do so?

204
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,950
You...

205
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,411
Alright. I'll stop teasing you.

206
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,851
Have you tried the cake?

207
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,371
Not yet.

208
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,531
I want you to try it with me.

209
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:28,690
Thank you for doing all this for me.

210
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,131
However, I'm angry

211
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,771
because you didn't discuss it
with me beforehand.

212
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:37,851
Lingling,

213
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,950
in the future,

214
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:41,411
you can do everything
you want to do bravely.

215
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:43,731
I'll always support you
behind your back.

216
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,371
No matter what,

217
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,491
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,731
Actually, it's not like
I want to hear that.

219
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:54,210
You were too emotional

220
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:57,651
when it came to this incident.

221
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:01,851
I know.

222
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,110
Nothing in the world

223
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:04,110
can replace

224
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:06,251
your brother.

225
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,810
But I hope you'll know

226
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,590
that I'll take care of and protect you

227
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,110
on your brother's behalf

228
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:14,290
in the future.

229
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,749
Therefore,

230
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,509
you can rely on me just like

231
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,690
how you relied on your brother.

232
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,290
Are we reconciling with each other?

233
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,050
Yeah. We're reconciling
with each other.

This is for you.

249
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:28,810
Why did you buy me flowers
all of a sudden?

250
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,070
You think you can brush me off

251
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:36,851
with such a tiny bouquet?

252
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:38,669
The florist was closed.

253
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,450
I could only buy this
from a small flower stall.

254
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,411
Is that so?

255
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,930
Why did you knock on the door, then?

256
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:52,011
Last time, you did so
because you didn't bring the keys.

257
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:54,640
What's your excuse this time around?

258
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:59,570
I'm hungry. Why don't we eat first?

259
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:02,830
Listen.

260
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:05,310
You cannot enter my house

261
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:07,029
without the keys

262
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,830
unless you tell me

263
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:10,450
why you bought the bouquet.

264
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:14,269
It's nothing.

265
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,491
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

266
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,930
Surprise?

267
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,590
Your surprise is lackluster

268
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:31,371
compared to mine.

269
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,851
Come here.

270
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:34,450
Close the door.

271
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,090
Look.

272
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,350
Look.

273
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:52,371
I prepared
this candlelit dinner for you.

274
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,470
Are you seeing this?

275
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,011
This is what you call a surprise.

276
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,050
Since when did you learn how to cook?

277
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,789
Actually, I ordered them online.

278
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,830
However,

279
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:06,411
it doesn't affect my feelings for you.

280
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,790
Actually...

281
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,250
I know what you're trying to say.

282
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,469
Actually,

283
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,651
you don't need me
to do this for you, right?

284
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,891
I know.

285
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:23,170
You never had a sense of security.

286
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:25,291
You were always cautious

287
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,571
in front of me.

288
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:29,469
Therefore,

289
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,371
I did all these

290
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,891
to tell you

291
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,930
that I shouldn't have been angry at you.

292
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,389
Alright. Sit down for now.

293
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:43,909
Hurry.

294
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,750
Sit down.

295
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,091
Have a seat.

296
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:51,490
Look at me.

297
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,030
Dear Mr. Zhang Yunfei,

298
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,869
are you willing

299
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,429
to marry

300
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,291
Ms. Liu Yiyi?

301
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,550
What's wrong?

302
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,450
Why aren't you answering me?

303
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,291
Sorry about this.

304
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,210
What do you mean by that?

305
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:52,611
I don't know.

306
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,250
I was just joking with you.

307
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,051
It's not like
I was proposing to you for real.

308
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:03,949
You could've brushed me off

309
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,091
with a random excuse.

310
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,611
You're breaking my heart here.

311
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:15,970
Or are you not even willing

312
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:20,411
to coax me now?

313
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,730
I'm sorry.

314
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:08,949
Tell me.

315
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,669
Are you having an affair outside?

316
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,310
Don't take me as a fool.

317
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,310
This is what doctors do.

318
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:15,590
If you can't take it,

319
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:16,970
let's just get a divorce!

320
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,110
Yunfei,

321
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:19,229
when

322
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:19,990
you're not ready

323
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:22,250
to be a good husband,

324
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:25,291
you mustn't form a family casually.

325
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,291
A divorce

326
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:29,770
truly breaks

327
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,450
the heart of a woman, you know?

328
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:37,690
My son,

329
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,930
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,530
It wasn't my intention
to divorce your mother either.

331
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,490
We wish to provide you
with a complete family too.

332
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,891
This ending

333
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:50,170
is truly terrible.

334
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:03,091
You guys don't need to worry too much.

335
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,149
Since I promised

336
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,869
I'd keep your brother's original data,

337
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,371
I'd surely keep my word.

338
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,830
Although he'll turn into

339
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:10,510
an ordinary NPC

340
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:11,709
after I adjust his data,

341
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,709
at least

342
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,730
you can still hold on
to your thoughts of him.

343
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,571
Thank you for being understanding.

344
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,131
This game data is very important to me.

345
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:22,530
Therefore,

346
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,149
it took me a lot of determination

347
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,930
to entrust it to you.

348
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:29,270
Actually, the person
you should thank the most

349
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:30,490
is Mr. Xiao.

350
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,149
I wouldn't need to go through
all this trouble to retain the data

351
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,990
had he not done his best to persuade me.

352
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:37,891
There's an easier solution after all.

353
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,811
Although the game project is important,

354
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,371
I'm more afraid that you'll be upset.

355
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:46,510
Why didn't you

356
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:48,651
tell me about it back then?

357
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:51,450
Back then, nothing was confirmed.

358
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:54,291
I was afraid that you might
get your hopes too high.

359
00:21:57,031 --> 00:21:59,110
I'll leave the subsequent

360
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,450
game repair work to you, then.

361
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,070
Don't worry.

362
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,331
I'll definitely do my best.

363
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,450
I've poured my heart and soul

364
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,891
into this game.

365
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:13,189
This data is very important

366
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,891
to me.

367
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:22,170
Please use them well.

368
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,411
Ms. Song.

369
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:39,210
Lingling.

370
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,750
Since you still can't get over it,

371
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:45,709
there's no need

372
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,970
to hand the data to him in a hurry.

373
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,411
Actually,

374
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,210
when I handed him the hard disk,

375
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:56,450
my heart felt empty.

376
00:22:57,831 --> 00:23:00,970
Maybe it's because I never thought
that we would be apart one day.

377
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:02,210
That's why

378
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:04,331
I was obsessed with him.

379
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,010
But actually,

380
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,571
this is good for me too.

381
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,250
I'm finally bidding farewell to Brother.

382
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:15,690
Although

383
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,611
I know that he's just an NPC,

384
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:22,131
I still feel upset about it.

385
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:26,891
I'll always keep you company.

386
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,530
Thank you.

387
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:35,371
I think I might not be able to do it

388
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,371
had you not kept me company.

389
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:40,571
How do you feel now?

390
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,891
I feel much better now.

391
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,030
Say, do you think your nosebleed

392
00:23:48,031 --> 00:23:50,051
is related to Xing Tian?

393
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,371
That can't be.

394
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:56,310
He already left my body.

395
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:59,291
He shouldn't be able
to do this to my body.

396
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:02,371
I have a hunch

397
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,010
that there's more to it
than meets the eye.

398
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,110
Maybe

399
00:24:08,111 --> 00:24:10,110
my body is weak

400
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:11,490
because I didn't rest well.

401
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:13,869
I'll take you to the hospital, then.

402
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,091
No need for that.
I feel much better now.

403
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,291
No.

404
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,730
I'm still worried about you.

405
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,530
Yunfei,

406
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:28,131
please come to my house now.

407
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:30,210
She's a little unwell.

408
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:34,450
Why don't I

409
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:36,709
call Yiyi as well?

410
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,091
It's been so long since I saw her.

411
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:45,450
Yiyi.

412
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,550
It feels like my condition
is getting worse.

413
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:54,690
I'm very weak right now.

414
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:55,790
Why don't you

415
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,651
come and visit me?

416
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:01,530
I...

417
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:05,131
I think this is a side effect
of the electrocution.

418
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:09,091
Now, I can't even breathe
without exerting effort.

419
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:11,010
I kept having relapses.

420
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,429
You should hurry.

421
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,690
I can still hang in there for a moment.

422
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:22,010
All done.

423
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:46,571
Yiyi.

424
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,590
I have something to tell you.

425
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,051
I'm not listening.

426
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,970
Sorry about

427
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,770
yesterday.

428
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,611
What's the point of saying this now?

429
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:05,170
Since you already did it,

430
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:07,229
you shouldn't pretend

431
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,970
to be pitiful now.

432
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,291
Many times,

433
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:13,350
one won't be forgiven

434
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:15,051
by saying sorry alone.

435
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,450
Yiyi, listen to me.

436
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:33,930
You have to eat up.

437
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:36,110
Lingling.

438
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:37,331
How are you?

439
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,371
Yiyi, you're here.

440
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,869
Why does it seem like

441
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,490
you're enjoying yourself
instead of being sick?

442
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,990
I missed you. That's why I told you

443
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:48,469
to visit me.

444
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,350
My condition is pretty serious.

445
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:52,611
I even had a nosebleed this morning.

446
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,411
You've learned how to deceive me, huh?

447
00:26:57,511 --> 00:26:58,909
I'll deal with you next time

448
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,450
since you're a patient.

449
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,170
Yunfei?

450
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,490
Yunfei.

451
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:14,651
What's wrong with you?

452
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:15,869
It's nothing.

453
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,450
What did you say just now?

454
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,291
What's wrong with you two?

455
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,851
Did you two have an argument?

456
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,110
It's nothing.

457
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,250
We just broke up.

458
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:29,389
That's not it.

459
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,909
You didn't listen to my explanation.

460
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,611
There's nothing to explain.

461
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:34,930
My conclusion is to break up with you.

462
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:39,990
Why don't you two

463
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,851
calm down for a second?

464
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:42,909
Yunfei,

465
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,131
you should

466
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,131
give Lingling a diagnosis first.

467
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:05,371
Lin Qiao!

468
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,270
What are you doing here?

469
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,469
I was waiting for your return.

470
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,651
Why didn't you wake me up
when you went for a morning jog?

471
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:13,010
I wanted you to sleep a little longer.

472
00:28:13,311 --> 00:28:14,730
Why did you wake up so early?

473
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,291
I had a nightmare last night.

474
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,970
I was terrified when I woke up.
That's why I came to find you.

475
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,131
Everything's fine now.

476
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:23,830
But are you sure

477
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:26,051
you want to keep hugging me?

478
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,389
I'm all sweaty now.

479
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,070
It's fine.

480
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:30,770
I don't mind.

481
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,170
Have a seat.

482
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:43,930
I heard something else this morning.

483
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,110
Last night,

484
00:28:45,111 --> 00:28:46,389
Xiao Ran brought Lan Yao with him

485
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,010
and they handed all the data to Vic.

486
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,651
Regarding this,

487
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,091
she did impress me.

488
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,411
After all, this was
a tough decision for her to make.

489
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,949
I could tell that she couldn't
bear to part with it.

490
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,891
But for Xiao Ran's sake,

491
00:29:02,351 --> 00:29:04,131
she still went all out.

492
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,611
I do understand her feelings.

493
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,210
You understand her feelings?

494
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:11,750
No matter if it's giving up on kinship

495
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,490
or relationship,

496
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,571
both are tough decisions to make.

497
00:29:16,311 --> 00:29:18,869
But luckily, she has Ran with her.

498
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,891
At least she won't be that upset.

499
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,469
I've done so many things for you.

500
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,709
Why didn't you try to understand
my feelings, then?

501
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,690
Now, you're saying
that you understand her feelings?

502
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,770
I'm jealous.

503
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:32,510
You better explain yourself

504
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:34,331
to me right now.

505
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,770
Just look at you.

506
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,270
What I meant was,

507
00:29:40,271 --> 00:29:42,730
I was once in her shoes.

508
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:44,690
Therefore, I could
understand her feelings.

509
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,990
It's just like you and I.

510
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:48,310
Isn't it difficult

511
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:49,651
for us to make choices too?

512
00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:53,131
If so, do you regret your decision?

513
00:29:53,311 --> 00:29:55,030
If so, you can tell me about it.

514
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:57,051
It's not like I must get married to you.

515
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:04,811
Since I chose to be together with you,

516
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,291
I would never regret my decision.

517
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,389
If so, you're not allowed
to understand anyone else in the future.

518
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,250
I'm the only person you can understand.

519
00:30:15,031 --> 00:30:16,210
Understood.

520
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,371
How is she?

521
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,280
Actually, her body was getting weak

522
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,830
because she didn't rest well
for some time.

523
00:30:28,831 --> 00:30:30,590
In addition, she didn't get to rest well

524
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:32,149
after being electrocuted.

525
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,730
That's why she's a little weak.

526
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:35,790
She should rest well during this period.

527
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,210
Don't let her overexert herself.

528
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,411
Alright.

529
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:41,891
I'll definitely let her rest well.

530
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,389
Let's leave the room first.

531
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,909
Let's give them some time.

532
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,811
Okay.

533
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,450
Song Lingling.

534
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,669
You're bold now, aren't you?

535
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,411
You actually deceived me.

536
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:04,310
It's because I missed you so much.

537
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:06,030
It's been so long since I saw you.

538
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,080
Is that so?

539
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,909
You said the electrocution caused this
and that you couldn't breathe normally.

540
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,270
I couldn't tell at all.

541
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:12,469
Please spare me.

542
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,970
I truly wanted to see you.

543
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,371
Be honest with me.

544
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:20,229
What's wrong with you

545
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,669
and Mr. Zhang?

546
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,170
Why did you two break up
all of a sudden?

547
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,131
I proposed to him yesterday.

548
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,690
But he rejected me.

549
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:33,291
You proposed to him?

550
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,550
Do you not wish to marry her, then?

551
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:37,790
That's not it.

552
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,851
I just haven't made up my mind.

553
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:41,770
Here's a piece of advice, then.

554
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:44,590
Both of you should cool down

555
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:46,651
before you two have made up your minds.

556
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,331
After all, I don't think
any woman can take it

557
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,291
when their boyfriends run away
after getting proposed to.

558
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:54,571
If so...

559
00:31:55,111 --> 00:31:57,210
If so, do you think
a marriage is terrifying?

560
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,611
It's different for everyone.

561
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:03,189
To me,

562
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,371
it's just a piece of proof.

563
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,229
Once you've decided

564
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,770
to take care of this girl
for the rest of your life,

565
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:12,851
getting married is just a procedure.

566
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,270
You're doing this

567
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:17,250
to provide her with
more sense of security.

568
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,970
What if everything changes
after our marriage?

569
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:24,709
Changes occur all the time.

570
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,590
It's not like

571
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:27,930
they only occur at certain moments.

572
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:29,429
Don't be too stressed out

573
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,411
by the notion of marriage.

574
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,790
What you need to do now

575
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,469
is to figure out

576
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,770
your exact feelings for her.

577
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,590
I have a schedule to attend to.

578
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,429
I have to go. I can't keep you company.

579
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,189
Rest well

580
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,811
and look after yourself.

581
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:51,669
If Xiao Ran dares to bully you
like how that doctor bullies me,

582
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,949
call me immediately.

583
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,331
I'll pick you up immediately.

584
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:56,350
Don't worry.

585
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:58,371
No one dares to bully me
when you're around.

586
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:00,189
You must look after yourself too.

587
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:00,550
Okay.

588
00:33:00,551 --> 00:33:01,469
I'll be leaving now.

589
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,530
Goodbye.

590
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:18,930
What are you doing?

591
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,210
I wish to send you back.

592
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,490
No need for that.

593
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:24,590
Listen to my explanation.

594
00:33:24,591 --> 00:33:25,891
Like what?

595
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,949
Are you trying to explain

596
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,091
that you never wanted to marry me?

597
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,571
Are you trying to explain to me
about my wishful thinking?

598
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,550
Or are you trying to explain to me

599
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:41,051
how hilarious it was when
you witnessed my wishful thinking?

600
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,429
That's not it.

601
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,891
Dr. Zhang.

602
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,051
Breaking up isn't that big of a deal.

603
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:50,811
There's no need for us
to hold on to the relationship.

604
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,891
Let's be strangers

605
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:56,851
when we see each other again.

606
00:33:57,351 --> 00:33:58,891
There's no need to contact
each other again.

607
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,450
I've never wanted to break up with you.

608
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:03,371
Fine.

609
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:07,510
This is an official announcement
from my side, then.

610
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:09,010
It's over between us.

611
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:10,851
Understood?

612
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,891
Yiyi,

613
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:21,171
I'll give you an account.

614
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,891
Yiyi.

615
00:34:57,551 --> 00:34:59,090
Who said you could come here?

616
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,829
Yiyi, don't be like this.

617
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,650
Let's have a chat.

618
00:35:04,991 --> 00:35:07,291
We have nothing to chat about.
Just leave.

619
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,749
Yiyi, listen to my explanation.

620
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,910
Actually, that day, I was...

621
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:12,411
I'm not listening.

622
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:13,771
Get out.

623
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,510
Actually, I came here today because...

624
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:19,371
Don't you understand human speech?

625
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,291
I'm telling you to get out.

626
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,331
Wait.

627
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,331
My keys.

628
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,309
Yiyi, actually, I...

629
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,450
Leave.

630
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,331
Yiyi, listen to me.

631
00:35:58,551 --> 00:35:59,070
Listen to me.

632
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:01,211
