(If I remember correctly,)

30
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:02,429
(this is the place he came
during the day.)

31
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,149
(Thank god, the door is open.)

32
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,310
(That mongrel is indeed tricky.)

33
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,150
(He actually had guards stationed here.)

34
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,109
(That weapon looks quite handy.)

35
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,180
(Shanhai Group)

36
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,870
I didn't expect

37
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:45,829
this mongrel to put so much effort

38
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,709
into killing me.

39
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,789
Even my domicile

40
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:51,630
has been investigated thoroughly by him.

41
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:54,630
It seems like they have planned it
long ago.

42
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,549
How insidious!

43
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,030
(If she doesn't have
split personalities,)

44
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,630
(how can we explain)

45
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,030
(Lan Yao's strange actions?)

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,269
I will avenge my wife!

47
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,269
(Hang on.)

48
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,150
(Calm down.)

49
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,350
Please, don't be angry.

50
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,350
Mongrel!

51
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,030
Die!

52
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:44,310
It's you again.

53
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:45,630
That's right.

54
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:46,989
It is I.

55
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,509
I'm back again.

56
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,389
There's no one else here now.

57
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,630
You and I can have a good fight.

58
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,109
I advise you to leave immediately.

59
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:58,350
There is a limit to my patience.

60
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,070
I forgot.

61
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,389
You are a timid and weak coward.

62
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:07,829
How about this?

63
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:09,870
I'll fight you with my bare hands.

64
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,430
You can make the first three moves.

65
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,080
Don't say that I, Xing Tian,
bullied you.

66
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,829
(Xing Tian?)

67
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,460
(It seems that she imagined herself as
as a character in the game.)

68
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,509
(Could she really have
split personalities?)

69
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,070
I'll give you the first move.

70
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:25,829
Bring it on!

71
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,750
(According to the data from
medical experiments,)

72
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,149
(there are only two methods that are)

73
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:32,750
(more effective
in switching personalities.)

74
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,310
(One, physical trauma stimulation.)

75
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,620
(Physical damage output)

76
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,349
Why are you still standing there?
Come at me.

77
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,310
Hey, you.

78
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,430
Mongrel.

79
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,670
How dare you use dirty tricks?

80
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,550
You have a death wish!

81
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,270
You mongrel, how dare you use
underhanded tactics.

82
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,149
Do you want to run?

83
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,030
(It seems like physical trauma
is useless.)

84
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,430
(Perhaps…)

85
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,469
What do you want to do?

86
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,310
(Oh no, he is going to use
his witchcraft again.)

87
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,990
Mr. Xiao, what…

88
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,029
What are you doing?

89
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,790
Lan Yao.

90
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,149
(It seems that hormonal stimulation
is effective.)

91
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,829
Mr. Xiao, you just

92
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,269
I was saving you just now.

93
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,269
I was also saving myself.

94
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:51,110
Why am I here?

95
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:55,029
Mr. Xiao, please listen
to my explanation.

96
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,349
There is nothing to explain.

97
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,430
No, I…

98
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,349
Well, Mr. Xiao,

99
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:02,829
because I was electrocuted recently,

100
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,750
I'm still a little confused mentally.

101
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,190
Let's pretend that

102
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,230
nothing happened just now.

103
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:20,190
Mr. Xiao, have you had dinner yet?

104
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:43,149
It's over. It's really over this time.

105
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,029
Time and again

106
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:47,149
I have offended our client thoroughly.

107
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,750
I shouldn't log into the game anymore.

108
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,310
My dreams are also ruined.

109
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,190
But why am I so weird?

110
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,190

we slept all night?

(This is just like a plot from a movie!)

161

162
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:28,190

After the meeting,

169
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,080
I have something important
to discuss with you.

170
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,709
Okay.

171
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,150
Remember, you are not allowed
to sleep while you are at home.

174
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,989
Fortunately, my genes aren't too shabby.

175
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:20,270
I hope this armor set

176
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:22,949

Good luck, Lan Yao!

178
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,030
Mr. Xiao, Goddess Lan Yao has arrived.

179
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,190
Miss Song, please take a seat.

180
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,910
This is the game designer Lan Yao.

181
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,869
Yesterday, we discussed

182
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,430
how to fix the bugs.

183
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,869
We still feel that we should stick to
the original plan.

184
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:56,829
The original plan?

185
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:59,989
Can you guarantee
the launch date of this game?

186
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,270
Old folks like us might not live
to see that day.

187
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,749
We might be old,

188
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:06,949
but we are not Santa Clauses.

189
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:09,430
Every penny we invest

190
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,910
must have a profit return.

191
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:13,550
If Miss Lan Yao's team

192
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,949
can do it, then do it.

193
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,989
If not, A's team will pick it up.

194
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:23,670
Two weeks.

195
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,349
Within two weeks,
Lan Yao will definitely fix it.

196
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,910
Two weeks. That's 14 days.

197
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,390
Such a tight period,

198
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,709
what if she slacks off?

199
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:35,270
Do you expect her to work around
the clock?

200
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,349
Why not?

201
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,670
Mr. Xiao, I will definitely
not let you down.

202
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:44,390
Lan Yao,

203
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:45,989
tell everyone

204
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:47,030
about your solution.

205
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,989
Okay.

206
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,469
Did it fail again?

207
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,670
When I tried it at home yesterday

208
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,829
it succeeded.

209
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,989
Oh, my brain.

210
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:32,749
Well,

211
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,510
I left a hard drive at home.

212
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:38,070
Boss, Goddess, it's time to…

213
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:43,670
Go on, go on.

214
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:48,989
I'll go get the hard drive.

215
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,989
I'll go get it.

216
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,910
Keep working on it.

217
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:54,749
I haven't told you where it is yet.

218
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,910
Keep a close eye on Lan Yao.

219
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,349
- I'll get the hard drive for her.
- Let me get it instead.

220
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,229
Okay, I won't go.

221
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,310
When I return,

222
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,510
if you are not with her,

223
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,989
just resign.

224
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,629
Got it, Boss.

225
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,790
It's in the drawer
by the side of the table.

226
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,070
That's usually where I put
my hard drive.

227
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,229
It might be a little
messy inside, though.

228
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:28,109
Did you find it?

229
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,790
Not here either.

230
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,349
Hey, are you for real?

231
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:33,150
I remember I put it…

232
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,349
Put it…

233
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:36,749
I remember after finishing it

234
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:38,749
I put it in a particularly
conspicuous place.

235
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,190
I was thinking of taking it with me
when I go out.

236
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,949
I forgot about it because I was
rushing to the meeting.

237
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:46,829
You can't even remember where
your things are.

238
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:49,629
Your intelligence is really worrying.

239
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,349
It must be because I was electrocuted.
My mind is a little confused after that.

240
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:55,949
I wasn't like this before.

241
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:58,109
Even my private life is very organized.

242
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,030
After starting this game project,

243
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,150
I devoted myself wholeheartedly
to my work.

244
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:03,349
So it is obvious

245
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,589
- that I am very…
- Found it.

246
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:34,709
Oh, my god.

247
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:37,469
Is this the power of capital?

248
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:39,109
This is too evil.

249
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,589
Goddess, I still have something to do
at the company.

250
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:42,709
I'll excuse myself first.

251
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,550
But I want to tell you,

252
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,790
I think our boss

253
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,989
is a little weird today.

254
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:50,349
You have to be careful.

255
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,270
Bye-bye.

256
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,349
Are you Miss Lan Yao?

257
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:56,670
Yes, I am.

258
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,030
Mr. Xiao is waiting for you.
Come with me, please.

259
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,829
Mr. Xiao is there.

260
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,070
Miss Lan Yao, this way.

261
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,109
Okay.

262
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,470
Mr. Xiao, what is the matter?

263
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:31,829
Do you still remember

264
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,990
your promise at the board meeting?

265
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,189
What do you mean?

266
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,149
Before you complete the task,

267
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,589
you have to live here.

268
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:41,310
Stop kidding me.

269
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:43,109
You also know that time is tight.

270
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,030
I still have a lot of work to do
when I go back.

271
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:46,510
You can do it here.

272
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:48,310
I've brought the hard drive over.

273
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:51,550
But,

274
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,149
all my data is on my computer at home.

275
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,430
I have solved that problem for you.

276
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,030
Mr. Xiao, why are you like this?

277
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,990
You silently

278
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,310
moved all my suitcases

279
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,829
and my computers here.

280
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:20,470
You, you are so disrespectful.

281
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,750
That's because I am your client.

282
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:22,869
I'm selling you a game,

283
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:23,909
not selling myself to you.

284
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,360
You have to move everything back.

285
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,349
Oh, I wasn't the one who made a promise

286
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,070
at the board meeting.

287
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,540
You didn't object to it then either.

288
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:31,990
You…

289
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,869
Do you know why

290
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,909
every time you wake up,
you are on top of me?

291
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:37,589
I…

292
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,909
During the time when
you lost your memory,

293
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:45,909
you had split into another personality.

294
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,790
Only after contacting me

295
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,070
will you return to normal.

296
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,550
Do you mean

297
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,149
that I transform every time I sleep

298
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,310
and only you can change me back?

299
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,349
This other personality can wreak havoc.

300
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:11,829
Only I can suppress

301
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:13,270
this personality inside you.

302
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:15,950
Having you live here

303
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,189
is purely to prevent you
from transforming.

304
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,510
In that way, you will have more time

305
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,030
to fix the game.

306
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:28,389
Okay, I'll stay.

307
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:35,710
Get to work, then.

308
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,189
You are inhumane, do you know that?

309
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:40,510
Now?

310
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:42,310
Everyone is off work now.

311
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,829
You have 14 days left.

312
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:48,030
Okay.

313
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:50,990
Hard drive.

314
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,389
You should get off work.

315
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,470
Mr. Xiao, you don't need
to worry about me.

316
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,230
Let me be.

317
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:31,030
I'm not sleepy.

318
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,750
I want to finish this bit of data.

319
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,550
Even if you don't want to sleep,
I want to.

320
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,510
You can go ahead and sleep.

321
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,510
I don't mind.

322
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,030
What does it have to do with me?

323
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,710
You will transform when you sleep.

324
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,230
Then, you'll torment me again.

325
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:47,230
Save your file now.

326
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:48,230
Shut it down.

327
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,270
Oh, that's right.

328
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:53,310
I almost forgot that this is a thing.

329
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:09,310
Well…

330
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,270
Mr. Xiao, there's just one bed.

331
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,230
What did you expect?

332
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,270
I can sleep in the living room

333
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,389
or on the couch.

334
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,389
You can sleep on the couch,

335
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,330
but do you want me to sleep
on the couch too?

336
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,629
Get into bed.

337
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:53,310
I'm just doing this for work.

338
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,470
Mr. Xiao,

339
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:21,109
the air conditioner is not working.

340
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,829
Don't you feel hot?

341
00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:25,550
It's 23 degrees.

342
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,389
Do you want some water?

343
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:31,829
No.

344
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,550
Why don't you go to the toilet?

345
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,730
Are we just going to sleep like this?

346
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:50,589
What else?

347
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,829
Give me your hand.

348
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,310
What for?

349
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,149
If we aren't physically in contact,

350
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,310
how can I help you control Xing Tian?

351
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,990
Ran, the overseas investors have arrived.

352
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,750
Where are you?

353
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,149
Hey, I'm sorry.

354
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,030
Hold them up for me for a bit.

355
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,389
I'll be there in about half an hour.

356
00:23:57,389 --> 00:23:58,790
You always have a good memory,

357
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,520
how did you forget
such an important thing?

358
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:01,510
Make it quick.

359
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:02,710
Okay.

360
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,429
Where do you usually stay?

361
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:06,470
Beijing.

362
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,750
From now until I come back,

363
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:16,710
you must finish

364
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,470
the first phase
of fixing the vulnerability.

365
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,909
But I'm off work now.

366
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:22,270
It's bedtime.

367
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:23,669
Before I come back,

368
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,810
you aren't allowed to sleep.

369
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,310
Mr. Xiao,

370
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,629
has anyone ever told you

371
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,950
that you have a special talent
for being a boss?

372
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,950
If I were you,

373
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,990
I wouldn't put up a meaningless fight.

374
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,109
Of course, my exalted client.

375
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,589
In a few more hours,

376
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,550
there will be only 13 days left.

377
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,909
That evil Xiao the Merciless.

378
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,990
Do you treat me as a data entry girl?

379
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,349
It's really miserable to be an employee.

380
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:02,310
I must make you into a
non-playable character

381
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,389
that labors in the game.

382
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,189
Hey, I'm here.

383
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:36,950
Where are you?

384
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:38,149
Keep walking inside.

385
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,950
I'll come to get you.

386
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:39,589
Okay.

387
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,109
You're finally here.

388
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,790
Miss Chen came here especially
from Australia

389
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:53,349
just to invest in our game.

390
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:55,030
You must remember

391
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,149
to have the best attitude.

392
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:58,550
Don't leave her hanging halfway
like the last time.

393
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,629
I'll try my best.

394
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,109
This deal is very important to us.

395
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,829
If you guys have a pleasant chat

396
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,760
she will immediately become
a shareholder.

397
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,230
Got it, bro.

398
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,189
I know it.

399
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,070
Let me introduce you

400
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,270
to Miss Chen,

401
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:24,429
the famous overseas real estate tycoon.

402
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,230
This is my brother, Xiao Ran,

403
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,330
President of Shanhai Group.

404
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,389
Hello.

405
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,990
Mr. Xiao is indeed a young talent.

406
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:33,909
Handsome and talented.

407
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:35,349
As expected,

408
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:36,629
you deserve your reputation.

409
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,230
What is this?

410
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,429
A small gift.

411
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:44,149
Oh, surprisingly thoughtful.

412
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,230
Let's not keep standing.

413
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,460
We should have a seat and talk.

414
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:48,230
Okay.

415
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,230
I didn't expect

416
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,429
Xiao the Merciless to be this tame
back then.

417
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:02,990
How did he turn out

418
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,149
to be this inhumane today?

419
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:07,710
Before I come back,

420
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:08,909
no sleep is allowed.

421
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:16,149
What are you doing?

422
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:19,310
Let me take you to a place to relax.

423
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:20,790
There is a bug in the game now,

424
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,389
I must try my best to repair it.

425
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:26,230
And I even made a promise
at the board meeting

426
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,909
that I would fix everything
within 14 days.

427
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,189
What now?

428
00:27:31,189 --> 00:27:32,349
Do you really plan to

429
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:33,470
work around the clock

430
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,470
under Xiao Ran's nose?

431
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,710
What choice do I have?

432
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:38,470
Do you have a better idea?

433
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,750
Idea?

434
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,990
I really don't have one yet.

435
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:45,149
At this time, you should go out
and blow off some steam.

436
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:47,070
Help you release

437
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,869
your pent-up stress and grievances.

438
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:51,109
What if he comes back and finds
me missing?

439
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:51,990
What then?

440
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,909
So be it. It doesn't matter.

441
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:55,470
I'm sending you the address now.

442
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,710
I'm here to help you.

443
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:01,589
Miss Chen is not only a high achiever
in the real estate industry,

444
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,470
but she is also surprisingly interested
in games.

445
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,230
Well,

446
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,589
I have always liked
to do adventurous things.

447
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:08,270
I believe

448
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:11,230
this project to be a good choice.

449
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,510
The attention and influence project

450
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,550
is pretty significant.

451
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,630
I don't think you should consider this
as an adventure.

452
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,909
I have heard some rumors

453
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,470
that your game project

454
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,790
encountered some minor problems

455
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,070
during alpha testing.

456
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,589
It's just a minor issue.

457
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,429
The overall progress of the game
is going well so far.

458
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:32,909
The game design team

459
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:34,909
is led by famous domestic designer
Lan Yao.

460
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:37,310
These small issues will be solved soon.

461
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:44,510
Yiyi.

462
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,990
You are late!

463
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,960
I waited for you forever.

464
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,990
Your introduction just now
was quite detailed.

465
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,510
This game

466
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,470
is quite unique in terms of
design methodology

467
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,750
and participation method.

468
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,790
May I know

469
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:00,470
who is the designer this time?

470
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:02,909
It's Lan Yao, whom I have
just mentioned.

471
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,270
Lan Yao?

472
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:16,790
I've finally broken the seal

473
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,869
and escaped from the body of this woman!

474
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,669
