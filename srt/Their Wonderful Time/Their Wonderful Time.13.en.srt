Ms. Song.

30
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:56,046
Mr. Xiao said

31
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:57,565
that you should rest well at home

32
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:59,146
and stop working.

33
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:01,205
Ms. Qi.

34
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:01,966
Don't worry.

35
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:03,547
I'm feeling much better now.

36
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:06,766
I'll talk to Xiao Ran about it.

37
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:08,507
He won't blame you.

38
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:10,987
Can you ask him

39
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,947
if he's having dinner at home today?

40
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:14,707
Sure. I'll ask him.

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,680
(Song Lingling: I'm home. I'm fine.
How's work? Having dinner at home?)

42
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:29,466
(Why do you sound so insincere?)

43
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,026
(Song Lingling: I want
you to come home earlier.)

44
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:37,960
(Song Lingling:
But can't I be subtle about it?)

45
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:44,346
A man in love is indeed different.

46
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:47,267
How am I different?

47
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:51,547
In the past, you wouldn't smile foolishly
at your phone.

48
00:02:51,886 --> 00:02:53,586
Now, you don't look like

49
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:56,885
a strict and ruthless boss anymore.

50
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,206
You look like

51
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:01,547
a house husband
who is glued to his wife every day.

52
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,765
You haven't changed.

53
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:10,107
You are still as domineering as ever.

54
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:16,427
Have I really changed a lot?

55
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:18,325
No.

56
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:20,227
You haven't changed at all.

57
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,427
Which documents do I have to sign?

58
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:31,306
You've worked hard lately.

59
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:34,605
I'll give you a 30% increment.

60
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:36,667
Remember to inform HR about it.

61
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:40,267
Really?

62
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,626
This happiness has fallen
upon me too suddenly.

63
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:46,165
I know that you are a kind person.

64
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,526
But there's no one in this world

65
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:50,526
who's as handsome and kind as you.

66
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:52,086
I'm so lucky

67
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,486
to have a great boss like you.

68
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:55,406
I'm living such an amazing life.

69
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:57,066
That's enough.

70
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:02,126
I won't be attending

71
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:03,406
tomorrow's meeting.

72
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,026
Just follow Mr. Lin's orders.

73
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:06,526
Boss.

74
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:08,605
The meeting tomorrow is very important.

75
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:11,186
It's the last major meeting
before the alpha testing.

76
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:14,005
I have something urgent to take care of.

77
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:15,987
Are you going to stand me up again?

78
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:18,445
We've done all the preparations today.

79
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:20,046
Just discuss these issues tomorrow

80
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:21,427
and everything should be fine.

81
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:23,726
You should wrap things up

82
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:25,347
and get off work earlier too.

83
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:36,626
Looks like there's
no such thing as a perfect boss.

84
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:52,366
Are you a fool?

85
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:54,427
This is not how you wash clothes.

86
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:55,706

No.

106

Aren't you afraid that it'll fail?

107
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:36,587
Are you afraid?

108

I'm afraid
that I'll drag you down with me.

00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:55,126
You are too tense.

114
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:56,547
You need to relax.

00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,107

(Famous game master in the industry)

119
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:12,726
Mr. Lin.

120
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:14,405
Last night, Lan Yao Studio

121
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:16,005
compiled all the related documents

122
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:18,046
and did
all the preparation work overnight.

123
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,325
Our company is ready too.

124
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,486
Now, we just need you to confirm

125
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:23,926
the alpha testing list.

126
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,486
How do you choose these candidates

127
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,486
for the alpha testing?

128
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,846
Some of them are famous gamers

129
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:29,846
in the industry.

130
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:31,645
And some are our hardcore fans

131
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:33,667
who has been supporting our game.

132
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,547
What information do they get?

133
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:38,726
They will each receive a set

134
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:40,107
of the gaming equipment.

135
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:43,005
And they are informed of
the date and time for the alpha testing.

136
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:45,046
Their gaming visuals will be transmitted

137
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,965
to our company's terminal equipment
in real-time

138
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,965
as data for us to fine-tune the game.

139
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,826
I think

140
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:52,066
that's it.

141
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:54,846
Okay. I got it.

142
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:56,626
- You can go back to work now.
- Okay.

143
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,686
We suspect

144
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,806
that a man in black is the one
who planted the virus.

145
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,645
This is the CCTV footage
that we've gotten

146
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:13,806
from Lan Yao Studio.

147
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:15,467
Help us investigate it.

148
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:27,325
So, did you collude with each other

149
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:28,405
to destroy this project?

150
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:30,560
We just want to help you get back
what is rightfully yours.

151
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,600
And you've never thought
about competing with Xiao Ran.

152
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,627
Why should I?

153
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:35,507
What is there to compete for?

154
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:36,486
If you want to live

155
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:38,466
under Xiao Ran's shadow forever,

156
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,267
you can betray me

157
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:42,427
and tell Xiao Ran the truth.

158
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,306
Why did you bring me here?

159
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:18,507
Because we can see
the sunset clearly from here.

160
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,387
No matter how the sun sets,

161
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:24,346
it'll rise tomorrow.

162
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:26,005
So, no need to worry about

163
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:27,706
something that hasn't happened.

164
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:29,747
There'll always be a way.

165
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:52,066
I feel at ease

166
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:54,226
with you here.

167
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:05,706
I want to ask you something.

168
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,285
Why is David

169
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:09,507
on the list
of the alpha testing this time?

170
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,147
David?

171
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:14,645
Maybe he's invited by your group.

172
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:17,846
After all, he's quite famous
in the gaming world.

173
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:19,946
I've taken him out of the list.

174
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:22,267
He can't participate
in the alpha testing tomorrow.

175
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:25,466
What's wrong?

176
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,106
Are you angry?

177
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,566
But you look quite cute

178
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:31,726
when you are mad.

179
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:33,826
I'm not joking around.

180
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,267
Okay.

181
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:38,186
Let me ask you, then.

182
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,086
Do you care about me

183
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:41,946
or do you care about Xiao Ran?

184
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:45,427
What are you trying
to do again this time?

185
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:49,246
I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

186
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:52,826
But I don't want to let Xiao Ran
successfully launch the game.

187
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:54,826
Because if that happens,

188
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,486
you can't show them
what you are capable of.

189
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:57,446
If I didn't keep

190
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:58,645
what you did a secret,

191
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:00,547
Ran would've found out.

192
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,520
Luckily, they didn't pursue the matter
because they were busy with the launch.

193
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,920
Otherwise,
if my dad and Ran found out...

194
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,826
It wouldn't be a bad thing
for your dad to find out.

195
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,440
That way, the marriage arrangement
between you and Ran will be destroyed, right?

196
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,627
You got it right.

197
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:12,525
The decision was made

198
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:14,685
after careful considerations
from two families.

199
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:16,285
It's not as simple as you think.

200
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:19,226
You are the one who's complicating it.

201
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,486
You worry about the group,

202
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:22,480
you worry about your dad,
and you worry about Xiao Ran.

203
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,086
Why can't you care more about yourself?

204
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:25,846
Xiangyu.

205
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:27,206
What are you trying to do?

206
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:30,165
I just hope that everyone
can see how capable you are.

207
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,525
I hope that you can face
your own feelings.

208
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,627
I hope that you can choose to be with me
without any hesitation.

209
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:39,885
You know that I can't do that.

210
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:41,846
Yes. I know.

211
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:44,366
After your dad proposed
that marriage arrangement,

212
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,685
your attitude toward me
changed completely.

213
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:48,885
You started avoiding me

214
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:50,525
and staying out of my sight.

215
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:53,005
You even gave up the chance
to study abroad

216
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:54,586
together with me.

217
00:11:55,886 --> 00:11:58,226
But we weren't like this in the past.

218
00:11:58,607 --> 00:12:00,826
Why do you refuse to admit it?

219
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:04,846
Actually, I've always been like this.

220
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:06,147
You are lying.

221
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:08,246
You are afraid of angering your dad

222
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:10,306
and hurting Xiao Ran.

223
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:12,326
So, you've been torturing yourself.

224
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:14,787
You don't dare
to face your true feelings.

225
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:17,846
You can't solve anything

226
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:19,507
if you keep on running away.

227
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,106
I'm not running away from anything.

228
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:24,885
Fine. If you are not running away
from anything,

229
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:26,466
do you dare admit

230
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,165
that you've never liked me before?

231
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,027
I...

232
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:32,667
You can't do that, right?

233
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:35,645
Is it that hard
to face your feelings for me?

234
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:37,907
Is it that hard for you to admit it?

235
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:40,907
Can you be brave for once

236
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:42,885
and show me the Lin Qiao

237
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:44,346
who I once knew?

238
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:47,267
Tell me how you really feel.

239
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,986
Give me some time, okay?

240
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,706
I'll give you an answer

241
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:10,226
after the alpha testing.

242
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:13,586
But stop causing trouble again
this time, okay?

243
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,066
Okay.

244
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:33,405
My fellow directors,

245
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:35,867
the second alpha testing of the game
will start now.

246
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:37,005
We have invited some players

247
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:38,606
for this alpha testing.

248
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:40,685
The data that you are seeing
on the screen right now

249
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,507
is the speed of them clearing the stage
and the status of the game.

250
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:20,045
Brother.

251
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:21,726
You wanted to talk to me yesterday.

252
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,027
What was it about?

253
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:26,867
I thought about it
the whole night last night.

254
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:29,427
It's better for me to quit.

255
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:30,885
But I haven't found

256
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:33,387
the perfect reason to quit.

257
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,126
What are you talking about?

258
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:37,186
Why do you want to quit?

259
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:40,387
I'm sure

260
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,186
you know the reason better than I do.

261
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:45,186
I know

262
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:47,206
you don't trust me

263
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:48,446
just because

264
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,427
I am your elder brother.

265
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:53,066
You are one of the few

266
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,066
who recognize my capabilities.

267
00:14:57,487 --> 00:14:59,066
I'm grateful for that.

268
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:00,446
But now,

269
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:02,346
I may have betrayed that trust.

270
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:04,086
What do you mean?

271
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:05,306
Let me ask you this.

272
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,267
Have you never suspected me?

273
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,846
Of course not.

274
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:11,267
You are my brother.

275
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:12,246
Who else can I trust

276
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:13,867
if I don't trust you?

277
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:16,667
Do you know?

278
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:18,326
You've never been good at lying.

279
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:19,986
I'm not lying.

280
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:25,826
Actually, when you found out
that I went to see David,

281
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,747
you were already suspecting me.

282
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,446
That's why you kept

283
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:34,566
being absent from the meetings.

284
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,285
And you would send Big Ding

285
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,867
to ask me to take over the meetings.

286
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:40,387
Because you wanted to test me.

287
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:41,925
But you were worried

288
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:44,045
about leaving the important
decision-making meetings to me.

289
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:45,966
So, during meetings like that,

290
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:47,685
you would keep me in the dark

291
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:48,805
and hold

292
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:50,765
a mini meeting at the end

293
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:52,387
so that I wouldn't notice.

294
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:54,925
Maybe you didn't see
anything wrong with me

295
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:56,747
from Big Ding's meeting minutes.

296
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:59,267
That's why you trust me.

297
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:02,907
Brother.

298
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,366
I did those things

299
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:05,885
to prove it to myself.

300
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:06,765
My plan is...

301
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,147
I'm not here to accuse anyone.

302
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,027
And I don't blame you.

303
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,805
I always think

304
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,427
that as your older brother,

305
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:18,547
as a senior in this business industry,

306
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,106
I've always been in front of you.

307
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:23,387
But I've realized

308
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:25,586
that you've long surpassed me.

309
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:29,005
So, it doesn't matter

310
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:30,747
if you trust me or not.

311
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,706
You've grown up.

312
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:39,186
It's time for you to be independent.

313
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:42,066
Brother.

314
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:43,366
Mr. Lin.

315
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,486
Boss.

316
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:46,427
The alpha testing fails again.

317
00:16:51,806 --> 00:16:53,326
Lan Yao, explain.

318
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:54,507
What happened?

319
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,805
The players can't clear the stage

320
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:58,405
and proceed to the next one

321
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:00,346
because the game keeps lagging.

322
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,186
You told us that you
took care of the bug, right?

323
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:04,965
Why is it still lagging?

324
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:05,846
Can Lan Yao Studio

325
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:07,706
solve this issue?

326
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,266
Okay.

327
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:12,466
So, you still haven't solved

328
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:14,827
the same issue that happened last time.

329
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:16,946
From what happened,

330
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:18,627
it seems that way.

331
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:19,925
Mr. Xiao.

332
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:21,006
We cross-checked everything

333
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,685
before the alpha testing.

334
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:24,526
Everything could run smoothly.

335
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:25,485
I don't know why

336
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:28,006
the same issue will happen again

337
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,405
during the alpha testing today.

338
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:30,587
Enough, Xiong.

339
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:31,725
No matter what we say,

340
00:17:31,726 --> 00:17:34,387
we can't change the fact
that the alpha testing failed.

341
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:36,645
I'm really sorry

342
00:17:36,646 --> 00:17:37,986
about what happened.

343
00:17:38,127 --> 00:17:39,526
But the most important thing right now

344
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:41,506
is to find where the bug is.

345
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:43,587
We will troubleshoot it again.

346
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,766
It's pointless

347
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,445
to apologize.

348
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,965
But given the huge failure this time,

349
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:53,326
it's only right for us to doubt
Lan Yao Studio's capability

350
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:55,907
to continue developing this game.

351
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:57,086
My suggestion

352
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:58,326
is to hand over the project

353
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,786
to the A Team.

354
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,667
What do you think?

355
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:07,867
Now is not the right time

356
00:18:07,926 --> 00:18:09,347
to switch teams.

357
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:10,366
I understand

358
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:12,867
that we are short on time.

359
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:14,965
I will carefully consider

360
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:16,786
all of your opinions too.

361
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:19,506
But I hope you can let Lan Yao Studio

362
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:22,506
handle this issue.

363
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:25,107
Enough.

364
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:26,907
That's it for today.

365
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:29,867
Directors, this way, please.

366
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:42,445
Mr. Xiao.

367
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:43,645
The game is about to launch soon.

368
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:45,867
There are many things to do.

369
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:48,226
I have to get back to work with my team.

370
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:49,946
Are you okay?

371
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:52,347
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

372
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:53,766
About the team switch...

373
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,766
I'm fine. Don't worry.

374
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,307
The most important thing right now
is to solve the problem.

375
00:18:58,446 --> 00:18:59,427
Bye.

376
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:17,965
The alpha testing

377
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:20,226
of Shanhai Group has failed again.

378
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:22,186
What happened?

379
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:24,526
I asked David to stop, right?

380
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:26,867
I heard that it was a technical problem.

381
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:30,147
The game crashed for some of the players

382
00:19:30,406 --> 00:19:32,526
and many were forced to log out.

383
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:35,347
Things are looking bad.

384
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:38,347
What happened?

385
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:41,026
This is a major setback.

386
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,307
Shanhai Group will hold
someone responsible for it.

387
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:47,587
I hope Lin Qiao won't be held
responsible for it.

388
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,226
I have to find a way to help him.

389
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:52,925
But this is their company's project.

390
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,706
We can't intervene.

391
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:57,466
It's not that difficult.

392
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,925
I know that there's
an expert game developer overseas

393
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:02,067
named Vick.

394
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,965
If we can hire him to aid us,

395
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:07,786
I'm sure it'll work out.

396
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:10,006
But this kind of international expert

397
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,706
is not easy to hire.

398
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:14,286
Besides, even if you help him,

399
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:16,907
Lin Qiao may not appreciate it.

400
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:19,326
I just hope that I can help him.

401
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,907
I don't care about anything else.

402
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,725
Do whatever you can.

403
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:26,226
I want to see this person
as soon as possible.

404
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,067
Understood.

405
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:38,226
No. I can't let you do that.

406
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:42,186
Isn't that the best solution?

407
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:43,667
Or

408
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:45,685
do you have a better solution?

409
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:46,667
I...

410
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:51,986
But I can't treat you like this.

411
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,046
Are you sure

412
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:56,445
you can entrust me with all the work

413
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:58,566
without any doubt after this?

414
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:01,006
Besides, after the game is launched,

415
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:02,806
I'll be in charge of
the most important task,

416
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:04,587
marketing.

417
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,147
Brother.

418
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:10,685
I just haven't found

419
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,427
the perfect solution.

420
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:13,925
Besides, I can't

421
00:21:13,926 --> 00:21:15,867
and I won't do as you say.

422
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:18,347
Actually, you've told me the answer

423
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:20,627
when you hesitated just now.

424
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:22,685
In this situation,

425
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:24,645
it's worth it for me

426
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:26,205
to sacrifice myself to protect you

427
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:27,445
and Ms. Song's team.

428
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:28,706
Moreover,

429
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:30,725
I'm the one who made the mistake first.

430
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:32,245
Song Lingling doesn't need
your protection.

431
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:33,706
I'll find a way.

432
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:34,606
Brother.

433
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:35,806
Give me some time.

434
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:38,326
But what you lack right now is time.

435
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:40,366
You don't have a solid foundation yet.

436
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,806
And the massive cost of this game

437
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:44,126
is already a thorn
in the directors' sides.

438
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:46,366
Although you've eliminated
Uncle Chen and Uncle Li,

439
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,485
the board of directors only cares
about their interests.

440
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:50,286
If you can't fulfill their needs,

441
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:51,165
you'll face

442
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,667
more people like
Uncle Chen and Uncle Li.

443
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:59,667
I know you plan to use your position
to suppress them.

444
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:01,627
But you need to understand

445
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:04,546
that power alone
can't suppress their greed.

446
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:17,266
So,

447
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:19,405
let take responsibility
for this incident.

448
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:20,846
Then, you can fire me personally

449
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:22,165
to appease the board of directors.

450
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,445
Then, you can protect Ms. Song's team.

451
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:26,867
They are the key
to the success of this project.

452
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:29,307
But Brother,

453
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,046
you shouldn't sacrifice yourself
for my success.

454
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:33,546
There's no but.

455
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:36,387
This is a wise decision.

456
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:40,226
Don't make me regret
my compliments for you today.

457
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,706
Xiong.

458
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:58,907
Order some food for everyone.

459
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,046
Let's rest for a while.

460
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,566
After we eat,

461
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:06,466
I may have to trouble you
to work overnight again today.

462
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:07,667
Boss.

463
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:09,006
It's no trouble for us at all.

464
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:09,885
Yes, Boss.

465
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:11,427
It's no trouble for us.

466
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:15,387
Boss.

467
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,266
Don't be upset.

468
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:18,885
This time,

469
00:23:18,886 --> 00:23:20,366
everyone knows

470
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,026
that you did your best.

471
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:24,685
But

472
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,445
we need to show great results

473
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,885
for others to recognize our hard work.

474
00:23:28,886 --> 00:23:31,827
Our effort is nothing
if we can't give them good results.

475
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:35,347
Let's take a rest for now.

476
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:36,965
Let me sort out my thoughts.

477
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:39,186
We can discuss them after the meal.

478
00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:55,396
♪Once upon a time,
our shadows would overlap♪

479
00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:58,354
♪Silence appearing silently♪

480
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:03,315
♪You and I, pushing each other away♪

♪Since we've reached the critical point,

483
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,685
♪I don't mention that I want
to love you one more year♪

484
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:18,706
Lingling.

485
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,806
Sorry about what happened

486
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:21,925
during the meeting today.

487
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:22,651
I...

488
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:26,223
♪I know that I have to cut off

489
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:28,951

00:24:28,952 --> 00:24:33,636

491

(Voice message has been recalled.)

492
00:24:39,886 --> 00:24:42,387
(All the best.
I believe that you can do it.)

493
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:45,867
(But no matter how busy you are,
remember to eat.)

494
00:24:46,246 --> 00:24:48,986
(Take good care of yourself.)

495
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:53,054

00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:57,645

♪So that you won't feel guilty♪

499
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,326
So, the lagging issue this time

500
00:25:10,327 --> 00:25:12,186
is not because of external factors,

501
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:13,627
but internal factors.

502
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:15,766
Actually, I rarely pay attention

503
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:17,827
to the login time of this account.

504
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:20,286
But last time, you asked me

505
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,326
to amend the programming code
for the general.

506
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:24,827
I was ill that day.

507
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:25,806
I was at home.

508
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:26,846
So, I asked Xiong

509
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:29,006
to set up an external network
login authorization for me

510
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:30,445
so that I could work at home.

511
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,307
So, I remember this very clearly.

512
00:25:35,446 --> 00:25:36,766
Remember to inform me

513
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:38,067
if you are sick next time.

514
00:25:38,726 --> 00:25:40,427
Even if you work when you are sick,

515
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:42,485
you won't get overtime pay.

516
00:25:42,486 --> 00:25:44,907
So, you need to rest well
when you are sick.

517
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,147
Boss.

518
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:48,366
Maybe

519
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:49,846
I will sound foolish

520
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:51,387
for saying this.

521
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:53,806
But we are not working for you

522
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:55,627
just to make money.

523
00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:57,147
We are here

524
00:25:57,767 --> 00:26:00,307
to work for our dream.

525
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:04,107
We have time to make money
if we are out of money.

526
00:26:04,206 --> 00:26:06,827
But when the dream is lost,

527
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:08,667
you can't find it anymore.

528
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:12,786
Besides,

529
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:15,526
we don't want to let the A Team

530
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:18,147
reap the benefits of your hard work
for so many years.

531
00:26:18,406 --> 00:26:19,366
Boss.

532
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:20,907
Please believe in us.

533
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:22,205
We will do our best.

534
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,086
We will break through this predicament

535
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:26,427
and launch the game on time.

536
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:30,067
But

537
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:33,307
this is up to the board of directors.

538
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:36,706
Forget it.
Let's not talk about this anymore.

539
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:39,587
Tell me.

540
00:26:39,646 --> 00:26:41,506
Where does the issue lie?

541
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:43,506
It's like this.

542
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:45,645
I haven't logged
into this account at all

543
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:46,846
after my sick leave that day.

544
00:26:46,847 --> 00:26:48,347
But look.

545
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:50,566
A day before our alpha testing,

546
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,885
someone logged into this account

547
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:54,286
twice

548
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:56,326
for around two hours.

549
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:57,366
Are you sure it was not you?

550
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,466
I'm sure.

551
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:05,546
Are you saying

552
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:08,387
that there's a mole

553
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:10,147
in our company?

554
00:27:11,406 --> 00:27:12,546
Boss.

555
00:27:12,607 --> 00:27:15,706
I don't have
the delusion of persecution.

556
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:20,965
To make it easier for us
to playback and troubleshoot,

557
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:23,286
before we send the system
to Shanhai Group,

558
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:24,485
our technical team

559
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:27,086
has programmed the system
so that nothing can be deleted.

560
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:28,147
But

561
00:27:28,486 --> 00:27:30,126
the staff in the studio

562
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:32,067
has the authority to delete something.

563
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:36,147
So, are you saying

564
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:38,546
that the mole is working under Xiao Ran?

565
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:40,867
Based on the current situation,

566
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:42,427
that's an educated guess.

567
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:44,827
Can you trace the IP address?

568
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,606
I've tried.

569
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:49,685
Maybe that person found out

570
00:27:49,686 --> 00:27:51,245
that he couldn't erase his trace.

571
00:27:51,246 --> 00:27:53,387
So, he encrypted his login information.

572
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:54,946
So far,

573
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:56,746
I can't decode it yet.

574
00:27:59,926 --> 00:28:00,606
Okay.

575
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:01,485
I got it.

576
00:28:01,486 --> 00:28:02,606
You can get back to work.

577
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:03,606
Okay, Boss.

578
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:04,946
I'll get back to work.

579
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:12,307
(Xiao Ran will not do that.)

580
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:14,946
(So, it's someone who works for him.)
