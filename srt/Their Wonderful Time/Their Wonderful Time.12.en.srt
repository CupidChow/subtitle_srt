Yiyi?

30
00:01:58,013 --> 00:01:59,393
What a coincidence.

31
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:02,033
What are you guys doing over there?

32
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:04,493
We're here to check out the view.

33
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:05,812
The view is pretty good.

34
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:07,372
You guys can go ahead.

35
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:08,673
We'll make a move first.

36
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:10,034
Wait.

37
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:31,773
Yiyi, be honest with me.

38
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:33,393
Did you tell me?

39
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:37,314
I heard that Xiao Ran was going to...

40
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:42,132
I meant, he was going
to take you outside.

41
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:43,493
That's why I thought

42
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:46,113
I should help you two
record your first date.

43
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:48,773
What about you guys?

44
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:51,314
I'm not doing this of my own accord.
I was coerced to come.

45
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:54,673
You see,

46
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:56,794
I don't care if you two
believe it or not.

47
00:02:56,934 --> 00:02:59,153
But we did meet each other

48
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:00,553
by pure coincidence.

49
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:03,553
Boss, I'm truly here to jog.

50
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,213
What about this?

51
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:08,613
Since all of you guys are here,

52
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:10,113
why don't we spend the day together?

53
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:11,393
What do you think?

54
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,754
You two, come here and help me out.

55
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:24,852
Yiyi.

56
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:27,634
He doesn't intend to marry me.

57
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:29,773
Babe, you have no idea.

58
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:32,333
It's easiest to catch people
off guard at times like these.

59
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:34,493
Just when you think it won't happen,

60
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:35,914
it'll definitely happen.

61
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,273
What are you guys talking about?

62
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,474
It's nothing.

63
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:43,652
What about this?

64
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:45,474
Why don't we play frisbee?

65
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:47,053
Let's go.

66
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:48,074
Alright.

67
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:55,553
Mr. Lin, regarding today's workload...

68
00:03:56,214 --> 00:03:58,333
Hello. You must be Mr. Lin's secretary.

69
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:00,453
He's allowing you to take the day off.

70
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:02,794
Just leave his work to me.

71
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:04,613
Alright.

72
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:06,493
I've already included his work
in the documents.

73
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:08,013
You just need to refer to it.

74
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,754
I'll make a move first.

75
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:29,053
Stop messing around.

76
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:31,034
I just wish to work today.

77
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:32,714
Lin Qiao,

78
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,173
she works for you
every single day without rest.

79
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:38,293
And, today's the weekend too.

80
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,354
You should let her take a break.

81
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:43,332
And, I have nothing to do here.

82
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,113
Isn't it better for me to help you out?

83
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:50,113
I truly don't know what to do about you.

84
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:58,093
You should catch it.

85
00:04:58,094 --> 00:04:58,753
Come on.

86
00:05:03,854 --> 00:05:06,413
Xiao Ran, how could you
not tell me about this?

87
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:08,474
Since when did you fall for Lanyao?

88
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:19,993
I think it's during
the press conference.

89
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:24,012
Are you sure it wasn't the time

90
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:26,433
you allowed her to move into your house?

91
00:05:26,453 --> 00:05:28,372
Why are you so nosy?

92
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:30,073
I'm just curious.

93
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,332
And you.

94
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,474
Tell me about your story with Liu Yiyi.

95
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:39,914
We fell for each other

96
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:44,193
at first glance.

97
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:47,354
That's pretty romantic, huh?

98
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,873
You're a timid guy.

99
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:52,513
I suppose Liu Yiyi took the initiative.

100
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,034
It's nice falling in love
with someone older than me.

101
00:05:57,693 --> 00:05:59,313
That's enough.

102
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:00,993
Stop talking about us.

103
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:03,034
What about you?

104
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:06,234
How's your preparation
for the next step?

105
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:10,753
Us?

106
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:13,034
I'm just her coach.

107
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:15,252
I don't think so.

108
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:16,873
I feel the same.

109
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,653
Xiao Ran, this doesn't look good.

110
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:25,034
What should we do?

111
00:06:26,174 --> 00:06:27,113
We need water!

112
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:28,993
I'll do it.

113
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:41,154
What a waste.

114
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:54,834
This is the meal
you guys prepared for us, huh?

115
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,794
Something cropped up.

116
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:11,553
That means we have nothing to eat, huh?

117
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:17,553
Yiyi, you can have this
if you're hungry.

118
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:19,993
You're so thoughtful.

119
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:26,892
You see, it's actually pretty fun

120
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,173
to gather with your friends

121
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:29,772
during the weekends.

122
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:32,394
Checking out the nice view together

123
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,274
is pretty nice too, am I right?

124
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,973
Although our meal was burnt,

125
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:39,633
at least we had fun, right?

126
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:53,234
Pardon me for this untimely statement.

127
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,914
But I'm starving.

128
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:01,173
You see,

129
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:03,633
I've prepared
something else for you all.

130
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,914
I bought some noodles.

131
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:07,012
Where are they?

132
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,252
Hurry and get them for us.

133
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:09,533
Don't be picky at this moment.

134
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,474
We should be grateful that we have food.

135
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:20,594
Mr. Lin, answering your calls
is part of the secretary's job, right?

136
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:24,234
Hello?

137
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:26,313
I'm Mr. Lin's secretary.

138
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:28,252
A meeting?

139
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:29,413
No.

140
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:31,413
His schedule is full today.

141
00:08:31,414 --> 00:08:32,993
He has no time for a meeting.

142
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:38,834
No. He can only attend it
after tomorrow.

143
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,873
Alright. Let's keep in touch.

144
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:47,692
How could you

145
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,113
turn down my work directly?

146
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:52,452
I didn't turn it down.
I merely postponed it.

147
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:53,893
And, he said

148
00:08:53,894 --> 00:08:56,354
it wasn't an important meeting.

149
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:58,692
Today's a joyous occasion.

150
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:00,332
You have to spend time with me.

151
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,554
You shouldn't see anyone else.

152
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,893
Forget it. Let's drop the topic.

153
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:07,053
Are you thirsty?

154
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:09,033
Do you want to grab a drink?

155
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:11,714
No.

156
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:13,873
Let's proceed with your work.

157
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,594
Sorry about this.

158
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:33,393
It was supposed to be
a fun date you prepared.

159
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:35,674
I didn't expect it
to end up like this either.

160
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:37,474
It's fine.

161
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:39,793
It's nice to gather
with them occasionally.

162
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,653
But you shouldn't cook next time.

163
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:47,013
You can leave that to me.

164
00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:49,173
You were so flustered just now.

165
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:51,554
You didn't act like
your usual self at all.

166
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:55,572
If so, what do you plan to cook for me?

167
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:57,053
I'll cook whatever

168
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,633
you feel like eating.

169
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:02,033
Here.

170
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:10,373
Aren't you eating?

171
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:11,674
I'm not hungry.

172
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:17,273
Here, take a bite.

173
00:10:17,294 --> 00:10:18,572
No. I'm on a diet.

174
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:19,834
I won't eat that.

175
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:21,972
Even so, you need to mind your health.

176
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:23,554
You can't just skip your meals.

177
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:27,276

You see,

we have to control our diet
when we exercise.

184
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,773
However, we can
indulge ourselves occasionally.

185
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:49,074
But I haven't eaten yet.

186
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:54,153
I'll make one for you.

187
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:56,113
I'm beyond hungry now.

♪I can't help but respond♪

190
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:08,834
Actually, there's no need
to make any extra preparations.

191
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,852
An experience like this

192
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,354
is unforgettable as well.

193
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,572
It's unforgettable indeed.

194
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:17,554
This is our first date after all.

195

♪This love needs no declaration.

00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:30,194
Happy Valentine's Day.

198
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:49,840
♪This love needs no declaration.
It's meant only for you♪

199
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:12,413
It's 12 A.M.

200
00:12:12,414 --> 00:12:14,194
Valentine's Day is over.

201
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,633
It's time for me to go home.

202
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:16,913
You're leaving already?

203
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:18,594
That's right.

204
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:21,594
Lin Qiao, don't work
until too late, okay?

205
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,993
Why don't I send you back?

206
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:50,194
She did make a thorough record.

207
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:56,393
(This is a commemoration of
my first Valentine's Day with Lin Qiao.)

208
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:22,269
(Shanhai Group)

209
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:26,674
Mr. Xiao.

210
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,234
I...

211
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:32,332
I know what you're trying to say.

212
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,773
I've sent my men to the police station

213
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:34,972
to bail your nephew out.

214
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:36,852
He should be able to leave
in a few more days.

215
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:39,153
How... How did you know that he was...

216
00:13:39,174 --> 00:13:41,852
He tied up a ninth-degree
black belt master like you

217
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,933
in the trunk without getting a scratch.

218
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:45,800
I assume that he knew you.

219
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,880
And, the only person
who could catch you off guard

220
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,452
should be that distant nephew of yours

221
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,554
whom you always complained about.

222
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:53,293
I've let you down indeed.

223
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:54,972
I failed to educate him.

224
00:13:54,973 --> 00:13:55,893
In the future,

225
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:57,013
I'll surely bring him to you

226
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:58,773
and make him apologize to you

227
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,194
if there's a chance.

228
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:02,633
Boss,

229
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,354
this is the file for today's meeting.

230
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:06,972
Everyone has arrived
at the meeting room.

231
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:08,194
You're the only person left.

232
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:10,092
Mr. Wu,

233
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:12,873
you should head upstairs
and do your job handover as well.

234
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:14,513
For?

235
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:19,993
Mr. Wu committed
a huge mistake this time.

236
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,194
You were almost hurt.

237
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:25,692
To prevent further trouble,
the HR Department has decided to...

238
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:26,572
So,

239
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:27,373
am I the boss here?

240
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:28,893
Or are they the boss here?

241
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:31,212
Mr. Xiao, don't be angry.

242
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:32,273
I understand.

243
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,492
I'm getting old after all.

244
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:37,234
There are times
when I feel powerless too.

245
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:40,653
Wu, you can stay out of this.

246
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:42,800
Just park the car and
wait for me to get off work.

247
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,413
I'll deal with the rest.

248
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:46,753
Alright. Thank you, Boss.

249
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:52,913
Let's attend the meeting.

250
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:56,653
Regarding the issues that arose from

251
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:58,332
the game's alpha testing,

252
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,834
we've made several adjustments to them.

253
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:02,153
Firstly,

254
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:04,812
based on the feedback
from some of the testers,

255
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:06,873
they mentioned that
the visuals were unclear

256
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,773
and that it lagged sometimes.

257
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,212
We've improved the situation

258
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:13,612
by improving the framerate.

259
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,753
Secondly,

260
00:15:15,174 --> 00:15:17,393
it's related to the virus issue
that everyone has heard about.

261
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:19,714
It's been wiped out completely.

262
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,033
Thirdly,

263
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:22,092
there was an issue

264
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:24,212
with Xing Tian's codes
during the last test.

265
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:26,373
We've reprogrammed it.

266
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:28,773
I believe that the game experience
from the next test

267
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:30,594
will represent a significant leap
in game quality.

268
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:32,852
That is all

269
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:35,234
for the progress of the game design.

270
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:41,113
Ms. Song, are you sick?

271
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:42,812
That's not it.

272
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:44,413
It's just a minor throat inflammation.

273
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:45,714
Have some water.

274
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:47,332
Ai,

275
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,732
tell everyone about

276
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,633
the promotional method
for the game's alpha testing.

277
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:51,492
Alright.

278
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,160
There are four methods we will employ.

279
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,092
Firstly, it's the traditional
print media platform.

280
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:55,972
We've already contacted

281
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:58,354
some of the more influential
print media firms in the country.

282
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:05,153
Goddess Lanyao,
you're coughing up blood.

283
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:15,212
You guys may continue.

284
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:17,554
Mr. Lin will lead the meeting.

285
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:34,954
Don't worry.
Let's proceed with the meeting.

286
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:36,933
And, regarding
the highlight of the game...

287
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,234
Put me down.

288
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,773
I can walk by myself.

289
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:40,873
No.

290
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:43,373
Your arms will get sore, you know?

291
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:44,633
Don't move around.

292
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:47,234
It's not as serious as you think.

293
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,033
You're overthinking it.

294
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:50,572
Since I promised to protect you,

295
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:52,834
I mustn't let you be harmed.

296
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:00,492
Dr. Zhang, you stayed up all night
and performed three surgeries.

297
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:01,692
You should head back and rest.

298
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:03,732
If not, your body
won't be able to take it.

299
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,573
Alright. I'll head back and rest first.

300
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:07,373
Call me if there are any emergencies.

301
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:08,593
Okay.

302
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:17,052
Hello? Mr. Xiao?

303
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:19,000
Sorry about that. I'm getting off work.

304
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,680
Arrange an emergency consultation for me.
I'll arrive in 15 minutes.

305
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,972
What's wrong with you?
Did something happen?

306
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:25,194
Is it very serious?

307
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:26,212
It's very serious.

308
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,833
It requires urgent treatment.

309
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:28,732
Alright.

310
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,353
I'll arrange it for you now.

311
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:40,114
Don't be scared. I'm here.

312
00:17:40,614 --> 00:17:41,972
You should take a nap.

313
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,760
I'll wake you up
when we arrive at the hospital.

314
00:17:45,574 --> 00:17:48,474
Actually, it's not
as serious as you think.

315
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:49,492
Do you know

316
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:51,874
there are many potential causes
for one to cough up blood?

317
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:55,492
I know my own health.

318
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:57,154
You don't need to be that worried.

319
00:17:58,493 --> 00:17:59,753
Now that I'm around,

320
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,634
you don't need to act tough.

321
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,753
I had to withstand it alone

322
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:11,313
when I was sick in the past.

323
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:14,353
I never expected

324
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:17,073
to be spoiled like this one day.

325
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:20,874
I don't care what
you've experienced in the past.

326
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:23,513
But from now on,

327
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:25,353
no matter what happens,

328
00:18:25,574 --> 00:18:27,194
you can always depend on me.

329
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,800
(Inpatient Department)

330
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:39,813
Mr. Xiao, you're overreacting.

331
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,772
It's just a case of
a slight bleeding caused by tonsillitis.

332
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:45,573
To think that you requested
the dean's diagnosis for this.

333
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:48,532
Do you think these old professors
have too much free time on their hands?

334
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:50,392
She was coughing up blood.
Isn't it severe enough?

335
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:52,240
Although doctors are known
for their compassion,

336
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,040
you should utilize
your resources wisely too.

337
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:55,313
You see,

338
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:58,273
since I'm fine,

339
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:00,333
does that mean I can return to work?

340
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:02,452
I have plenty of preparations
to make for the alpha testing.

341
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:03,434
Wait.

342
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:06,252
Although this isn't a huge issue,

343
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:08,513
it's definitely not a minor issue.

344
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:09,933
You'll feel a sharp sting

345
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:11,052
in your throat when you speak

346
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:13,093
and eat.

347
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:15,320
Forget about staying up late
just to develop your video game.

348
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:17,353
I told you it wasn't a minor issue.

349
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:19,394
How should we deal with it, then?

350
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:20,853
It depends on Goddess Lanyao

351
00:19:20,854 --> 00:19:23,474
whether she wants to deal with it
fast or slow.

352
00:19:23,894 --> 00:19:25,993
Now, we're at a crucial phase.

353
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:27,653
It's best if there's a way

354
00:19:27,654 --> 00:19:29,234
to deal with this quickly.

355
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:30,853
If so, she can opt for surgery.

356
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:33,212
It'll treat the root cause.
It's fast too.

357
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,954
Why does it sound terrifying?

358
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,234
Are there any other solutions to this?

359
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:41,033
I fear pain.

360
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,732
A grade-five tonsil

361
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:46,914
can't be reduced with
injections and medication alone.

362
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,972
And, you need to rest periodically

363
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:50,732
and adopt a healthy diet.

364
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:53,133
Forget about staying up late
to develop your video game.

365
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,914
You'll have a high chance
of suffering a relapse.

366
00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:59,634
Injections? That sounds painful too.

367
00:20:00,614 --> 00:20:02,954
Dr. Zhang, can you
come here for a second?

368
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:03,993
Give me a moment.

369
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:06,853
Anyway, my opinions
are just suggestions.

370
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:07,492
In the end,

371
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:09,653
it depends on the will
of the patient and her family members.

372
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:10,772
Tell me your answer after this.

373
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:12,194
I'll head out for a second.

374
00:20:17,894 --> 00:20:19,394
What are you laughing at?

375
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:22,613
I never expected

376
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:24,613
that the legendary Goddess Lanyao

377
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,154
to fear pain.

378
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:29,793
Actually, it's not that I fear pain.

379
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:31,173
I just...

380
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:32,252
I was just wondering

381
00:20:32,253 --> 00:20:34,753
if there was a better solution to this.

382
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,273
Alright now.

383
00:20:37,773 --> 00:20:39,954
I know you're not afraid.

384
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:41,613
But you're sick.

385
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:43,480
We have to get you treated
as soon as possible.

386
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,434
Don't worry. I'll keep you company.

387
00:20:46,053 --> 00:20:49,993
What if I sneak out of the hospital?

388
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:51,993
Will you be angry at me?

389
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:53,033
I will.

390
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:56,133
You have to go for surgery.

391
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:57,793
But I still

392
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:01,194
fear pain.

393
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:05,573
Mr. Lin,

394
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:06,853
that's the current situation

395
00:21:06,854 --> 00:21:08,593
of our department.

396
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,813
Alright. The official alpha testing
will begin in two days.

397
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:12,093
That's all for today's meeting.

398
00:21:12,094 --> 00:21:13,093
You all should get ready.

399
00:21:13,094 --> 00:21:14,154
Thank you for your hard work.

400
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:15,553
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

401
00:21:24,094 --> 00:21:24,772
Look.

402
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:25,933
Mr. Lin has a nice personality.

403
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:26,933
He's good-looking too.

404
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:29,513
It would be great
if they could be together.

405
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:32,492
Mr. Lin does treat
Goddess Lanyao nicely too.

406
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:33,252
Maybe

407
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:34,813
he fancies her too.

408
00:21:34,814 --> 00:21:37,413
Goddess Lanyao is pretty popular, huh?

409
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:40,434
I'm looking forward to
the development of their relationship.

410
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,373
Actually, I'm looking forward to it too.

411
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:44,333
Why don't I bring Mr. Xiao here

412
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:46,993
and tell him
to have a chat with you guys?

413
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:49,080
Do you guys have nothing else to do
besides gossiping?

414
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,634
Go back and do your job!

415
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:55,194
You, hand this
to the Finance Department.

416
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:06,234
Could it be that Mr. Lin
has fallen for Goddess Lanyao as well?

417
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:10,313
That's impossible.

418
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:16,692
Stop talking.

419
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:18,234
You'll be fine after some time.

420
00:22:20,693 --> 00:22:21,833
It hurts.

421
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,154
I know.

422
00:22:26,574 --> 00:22:28,154
I'll keep you company.

423
00:22:28,374 --> 00:22:31,292
Once you're discharged
from the hospital, you should rest well.

424
00:22:31,293 --> 00:22:32,292
As for the alpha testing,

425
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:34,154
you can leave it to Xiong and the rest.

426
00:22:37,134 --> 00:22:38,553
What are you trying to say?

427
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:47,914
Xiao Ran.

428
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:51,114
Thank you.

429
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:15,914
That's your painkiller.

430
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:24,252
(Xiao Ran is much braver than you.)

431
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:26,373
(At least he won't hide his true feelings)

432
00:23:26,374 --> 00:23:29,313
when he has to face his relationship.

433
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:34,212
Lin Qiao, you're here.

434
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,154
Are you here to visit Goddess Lanyao?

435
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:37,093
How is she doing?

436
00:23:37,094 --> 00:23:38,273
Is it serious?

437
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:40,373
She'll be discharged
from the hospital later.

438
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:42,353
Why don't you go and check on her?

439
00:23:42,574 --> 00:23:44,234
She's being discharged already?

440
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:46,052
She said she wasn't used
to the hospital bed.

441
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:47,714
She wants to go home.

442
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:51,252
Don't you guys need
to observe her condition?

443
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:53,133
It's just a minor surgery.

444
00:23:53,134 --> 00:23:54,732
It's pointless for her to stay here.

445
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,920
It's a waste of medical resources
for her to stay here.

446
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,874
If so, deliver the flowers
to her on my behalf.

447
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:03,653
I have something else to do.
I'll go first.

448
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:04,593
Thanks.

449
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:10,753
He's here, yet he didn't visit her.

450
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:12,474
What a strange guy.

451
00:24:28,973 --> 00:24:30,093
Take a break.

452
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,033
Let's take a break.

453
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:41,474
Thanks.

454
00:24:49,854 --> 00:24:51,353
Are you venting out your frustration?

455
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:53,513
No.

456
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:55,893
I'm just relieving some stress.

457
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,793
You look troubled.

458
00:24:58,013 --> 00:24:59,154
Is it about your relationship?

459
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:04,474
You see,

460
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:08,634
I feel something different

461
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,732
for a particular girl,

462
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:12,634
but I don't know how to put it in words.

463
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:15,273
You fancy her, don't you?

464
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:17,474
Not really.

465
00:25:18,174 --> 00:25:19,753
I don't understand at all.

466
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,813
Why must you guys complicate

467
00:25:21,814 --> 00:25:23,313
such simple things?

468
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:24,874
It's like boxing.

469
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:26,452
If you launch a slow blow

470
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:27,692
and hesitate,

471
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,513
people will take advantage
of the situation.

472
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:32,133
You should take the initiative
if you like her.

473
00:25:32,134 --> 00:25:33,772
Why are you hesitating

474
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:35,593
and making things difficult
for yourself as well?

475
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,012
Enough already.

476
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,972
Let's drop the topic.
Let's change the topic.

477
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:40,452
I shouldn't have told you that.

478
00:25:40,453 --> 00:25:41,714
Coach!

479
00:25:42,094 --> 00:25:42,732
You're here.

480
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:44,292
Mr. Lin, you're here too?

481
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,513
Ai? What are you doing here?

482
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,133
She's my VIP member.

483
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:50,212
What's wrong, Mr. Lin?

484
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:52,394
She already got off work.

485
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:54,634
Do you decide where
your employee go even after work?

486
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,173
I was just asking.

487
00:25:57,174 --> 00:25:58,613
I like boxing.

488
00:25:58,614 --> 00:26:01,033
It's my way to relax after work.

489
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,753
Relax?

490
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:06,573
You have a terrible foundation.

491
00:26:06,574 --> 00:26:08,133
You have weak core strength too.

492
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:10,273
You have to train harder.

493
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:11,732
If you like something,

494
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:13,593
you have to spend time on it.

495
00:26:13,654 --> 00:26:15,114
And, you need to persevere too.

496
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:18,093
I don't like this attitude of yours.

497
00:26:18,094 --> 00:26:19,553
Got it.

498
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:21,880
Alright. You guys can go ahead.

499
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,833
I have something else to do.
I'll make a move first.

500
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:26,273
You're leaving already?

501
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:34,052
Come and find me
if you need anything else.

502
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:35,474
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

503
00:26:39,174 --> 00:26:41,634
What's wrong with Mr. Lin lately?

504
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:44,353
Why are you being nosy as well?

505
00:26:44,574 --> 00:26:45,692
I'm not being nosy.

506
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:47,993
I'm just concerned about my buddy.

507
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,893
Actually, I don't know
the details either.

508
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,933
But rumors have been circulating
within the company.

509
00:26:52,934 --> 00:26:56,114
They say that both Mr. Lin
and Mr. Xiao like Goddess Lanyao.

510
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:58,194
I thought he fancied Shen Xiangyu.

511
00:26:58,773 --> 00:27:00,394
I'm not sure about that either.

512
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:02,674
Tell me all about it.

513
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:13,452
Dr. Xue.

514
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:14,333
Mr. Xiao,

515
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:17,634
I have something to discuss with you.

516
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:18,893
A cousin of mine

517
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:21,093
studies supernatural phenomena.

518
00:27:21,094 --> 00:27:23,613
He's very interested
in Ms. Song's condition.

519
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:25,474
He wishes to make your acquaintance.

520
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:27,692
Although we should stick to science,

521
00:27:27,693 --> 00:27:29,373
you can listen

522
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:30,833
to his explanation for now.

523
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:33,133
He's quite influential

524
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:34,674
in his field.

525
00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:36,772
If you don't mind,

526
00:27:36,773 --> 00:27:39,073
I'll tell him to contact
you and Ms. Song.

527
00:27:39,654 --> 00:27:40,674
