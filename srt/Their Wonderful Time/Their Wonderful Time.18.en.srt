It's nice to enjoy
some fresh air outside.

30
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:10,654
Do you want to eat some?

31
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,135
It's quite delicious.

32
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:40,895
Promise me.

33
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,054
No matter what happens in the future,

34
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:46,335
stick by my side.

35
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:50,415
Okay.

36
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:06,175
Mr. Xue.

37
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:08,594
Lingling is showing new symptoms.

38
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:10,374
Looks like her condition has worsened.

39
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:11,673
Why is that happening?

40
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:13,473
It must be due to that electric shock.

41
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:15,015
She's probably fine this time

42
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:16,695
thanks to the programming code.

43
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:19,335
What do you mean?

44
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:22,913
The programming code and the body itself

45
00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:24,714
are intertwined with each other.

46
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:26,394
If the body is damaged,

47
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:28,994
its correspondent programming code
will disappear as well.

48
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:31,434
At that critical point,
the programming code must have taken

49
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:32,934
some damage on behalf of its host.

50
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:33,793
But

51
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:35,353
even if I touch her physically now,

52
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:36,953
I can't turn her back into herself

53
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:38,214
from being Xing Tian.

54
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:39,793
This happens

55
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:42,314
because when the body
of the host becomes weaker,

56
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:45,094
the code will use that
as an advantage to take over.

57
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:47,594
My guess is, it'll be harder and harder
for Ms. Song

58
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,394
to control the code
with her consciousness.

59
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,953
It will show up in some way

60
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:52,434
to communicate with Ms. Song.

61
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:53,434
Does it mean

62
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:54,513
that Xing Tian can show up

63
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,054
at any time?

64
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:57,135
How about this?

65
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:59,233
I'm almost done with fine-tuning

66
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:00,594
the machine I told you about.

67
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:01,753
Come and visit me

68
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:02,314
and I'll

69
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:03,575
make the necessary adjustments.

70
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:05,774
Okay. I'll leave it to you.

71
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:20,895
Ms. Qi.

72
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:22,174
Mr. Xiao.

73
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:23,834
Keep everything in my room

74
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:25,913
that can be dangerous
under key and lock.

75
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:26,634
For example, knife,

76
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:28,074
scissors, or something like that.

77
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:29,774
Don't let Lingling
get her hands on them.

78
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:31,094
Another thing.

79
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:32,793
If you find out

80
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:34,473
that she's acting strange,

81
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,974
inform me at once.

82
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:37,335
What's wrong?

83
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:40,774
Lingling is still recovering
from that electrical shock.

84
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,954
Sometimes, she'll get confused.

85
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:44,375
I don't want her to hurt herself.

86
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:46,094
Okay. I got it.

87
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:03,575
What's wrong?

88
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:05,695
Why are you awake?

89
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:08,854
I'm thirsty.

90
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,255
Why were you

91
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:28,015
so nervous just now?

92
00:05:31,155 --> 00:05:33,294
So many things happened
in the last two days.

93
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:34,815
Of course I'm nervous.

94
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:39,774
I'm sorry

95
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,654
for making you worry about me again.

96
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:44,055
I won't let it happen again.

97
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:52,974
What?

98
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:54,594
Are you sure you got it right?

99
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:55,614
Yes.

100
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:58,255
Xiao Ran has put a stop to the game.

101
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,514
And the company
has made an official announcement.

102
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:03,375
But Xiao Ran hasn't made any comment
about it yet.

103
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:06,135
Why so sudden?

104
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:10,055
Because Lan Yao was hospitalized
after an electrical shock.

105
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:12,174
Maybe it was quite serious.

106
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:14,673
But

107
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,695
this is a good opportunity.

108
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:17,954
If Lan Yao

109
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:19,974
can't participate in this project,

110
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:23,135
Vick can take over the project.

111
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:25,414
That way,

112
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,335
Lin Qiao can naturally come back.

113
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,614
What's our next step?

114
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:32,055
There's no rush.

115
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:35,534
Let's see what Shanhai Group's
next move is.

116
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:02,695
Why is he hurt?

117
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:23,015
What's going on?

118
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:25,734
Xiao Ran

119
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,614
is acting strange.

120
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:31,255
He wasn't as nervous

121
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:33,854
when Xing Tian came out in the past.

122
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:43,774
Hello.

123
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:44,854
Yiyi.

124
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:46,534
I have something to ask.

125
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:47,594
Baby.

126
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:49,473
It's so late now.

127
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:50,594
I'm sleepy.

128
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,854
Don't sleep yet.

129
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:53,695
Tell me.

130
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:55,654
What happened

131
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:57,654
at the hospital today?

132
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:01,154
When I visited you,

133
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:03,594
you suddenly turned into Xing Tian

134
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:05,233
and pushed me down.

135
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,455
Luckily, Xiao Ran got there in time.

136
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,935
Let me tell you.

137
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:11,654
That general was quite strong.

138
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:13,673
Xiao Ran couldn't stop him.

139
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:15,495
He had to hold you for a long while

140
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:17,094
before you could return to normal.

141
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:18,015
Okay.

142
00:08:18,195 --> 00:08:19,214
I understand now.

143
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:20,455
You can sleep now.

144
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:29,194
It's cold outside.

145
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:30,495
Why are you out here?

146
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:33,254
I can't sleep.

147
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:35,014
So, I've come out to take a breather.

148
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:50,535
Do you know how scared I was yesterday?

149
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:52,593
You can't be so reckless again.

150
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:53,775
Don't make me worry about you.

151
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:56,335
Okay.

152
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:01,815
When I found out
that you passed out yesterday,

153
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:03,894
my brain was in shock.

154
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:07,114
I couldn't think.

155
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:08,815
I just wanted to see you
as soon as possible.

156
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:11,535
I don't know

157
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:13,254
when it started.

158
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:15,775
But you are

159
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:17,455
all I think about right now.

160
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,974
I'm fine now, right?

161
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:28,254
Luckily, you are fine.

162
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:29,695
It's so fortunate.

163
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:34,494
You haven't rested well
in the past two days.

164
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,455
You should go back to sleep.

165
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:40,775
I want to be with you.

166
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:46,655
Tell me.

167
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:50,335
What happened when Xing Tian took over

168
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,494
at the hospital?

169
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:55,394
Nothing.

170
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,874
Don't overthink it.

171
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:57,775
But...

172
00:09:58,074 --> 00:09:59,815
As long as we can be together,

173
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:02,374
we can face anything.

174
00:10:50,794 --> 00:10:52,335
(I'm sorry, Xiao Ran.)

175
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:54,254
(I've made you worry about me again.)

176
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,374
(I really want to help you.)

177
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:01,055
(But I can't control my own body.)

178
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,335
(I can't control Xing Tian.)

179
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:05,815
(You are injured because of me again.)

180
00:11:07,554 --> 00:11:09,575
(Although you told me that it was fine,)

181
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:11,415
(you couldn't hide the truth from me.)

182
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:12,913
(You can't stop Xing Tian)

183
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:14,815
(from taking over my body again.)

184
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:17,535
(That's why you are so nervous.)

185
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:22,175
(I really want to be with you.)

186
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:26,134
(I can't bear to be apart from you.)

187
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:31,094
(But I don't want you
to exhaust yourself.)

188
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:35,295
(And I don't want to let Xing Tian
hurt you again.)

189
00:11:58,035 --> 00:11:59,974
(Where can I go now?)

190
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:04,974
(Xing Tian thinks
that Liu Yiyi is his wife.)

191
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,494
(I can't go to her.)

192
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:11,415
(I can't stay with my mom too.)

193
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:14,815
(If I turn into Xing Tian,)

194
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,175
(it'll scare her.)

195
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:23,695
(What should I do)

196
00:12:24,235 --> 00:12:25,775
(next?)

197
00:12:46,714 --> 00:12:47,734
Lingling.

198
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:50,415
Lingling.

199
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:39,935
Ms. Qi.

200
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:40,593
Mr. Xiao.

201
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:41,514
Breakfast is ready.

202
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:42,854
Have you seen Lingling?

203
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:44,295
No.

204
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:54,313
Uncle Xiang.

205
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:54,833
Yes?

206
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,073
Have you seen Lingling?

207
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:57,094
No.

208
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,455
Hello?

209
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:08,415
Yiyi.

210
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,055
Is Lingling with you?

211
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:11,553
No.

212
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:13,295
She's with you, right?

213
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,553
She was gone
when I woke up this morning.

214
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,935
She left her phone behind.

215
00:14:17,914 --> 00:14:18,854
Wait.

216
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:20,614
What happened?

217
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:22,593
She was fine when she went home
with you yesterday.

218
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:23,894
Did you get into a fight?

219
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:24,994
I don't know. I...

220
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:25,833
I don't know.

221
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:26,935
You don't know?

222
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:28,793
How can you not know?

223
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:30,055
That's it for now.

224
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:34,335
Lingling.

225
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:36,935
Where are you?

226
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,415
He's always so clueless.

227
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:47,055
Hello, Yiyi.

228
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:48,175
Darling.

229
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,593
Just now, Xiao Ran called me,

230
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:51,034
saying that Lingling has gone missing.

231
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:52,474
Let's look for her together.

232
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,474
Calm down.

233
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,433
Wait for me at home.

234
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,394
I'll pick you up.

235
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,214
Okay.

236
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:07,535
Xiong.

237
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,494
Mr. Xiao.

238
00:15:09,515 --> 00:15:10,793
Have you seen your boss?

239
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:11,514
No.

240
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:13,520
I thought she was hospitalized
for being ill.

241
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,760
Call me at once
if you've received any news about her.

242
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,695
Okay. Mr. Xiao.

243
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:54,634
How is it?

244
00:16:54,635 --> 00:16:55,614
Have you found her?

245
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:57,874
I went to all of her favorite places.

246
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,415
But I couldn't find her.

247
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:00,193
What about you?

248
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:01,335
Any clues?

249
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:03,695
No.

250
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:09,000
The most important thing right now
is to find her.

251
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,775
Is there anywhere else
that we haven't searched?

252
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:13,894
Have you searched the places

253
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:15,593
that are meaningful

254
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:16,854
to both of you?

255
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:19,854
I got it.

256
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:55,854
Who are you?

257
00:17:56,594 --> 00:17:57,313
I'm sorry.

258
00:17:57,314 --> 00:17:58,454
I got the wrong person.

259
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,134
Song Lingling, stop right there.

260
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:43,295
Look at me.

261
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:49,374
Song Lingling, look at me.

262
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:56,255
Can you tell me why you suddenly left?

263
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:02,015
I don't want to be
a burden to you anymore.

264
00:19:07,235 --> 00:19:08,454
Be a burden to me?

265
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:11,295
Is that the only reason you can give me?

266
00:19:15,794 --> 00:19:17,113
From the moment I met you

267
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,255
until now,

268
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:21,255
I've been causing you trouble.

269
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,414
You are attacked by Xing Tian
because of me.

270
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:26,055
You are injured because of me.

271
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:29,575
I really regret

272
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:32,295
not running far away enough

273
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:34,815
so that you can't find me.

274
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:39,694
Xiao Ran,

275
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:42,654
without me,

276
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:44,654
all of the issues

277
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:46,474
will be solved.

278
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:48,894
I won't allow you
to make that decision yourself.

279
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:57,575
Okay.

280
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,975
If you've given up everything,

281
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:01,934
why are you here?

282
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:05,775
I...

283
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,094
I'm here

284
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:11,295
to give this place

285
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:13,854
a last farewell.

286
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:16,174
If

287
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:18,714
one of us

288
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:20,454
needs to let go first,

289
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:25,055
I hope that person is me.

290
00:20:37,915 --> 00:20:38,934
I know.

291
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,815
I know that it hasn't been easy for you.

292
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:45,934
But I hope that you won't push me away.

293
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:49,134
Let's solve all the issues together.

294
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,575
We've gone through so much,

295
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:53,393
we just need to persevere

296
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:54,575
and be courageous.

297
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:56,975
Then everything will be fine.

298
00:20:57,915 --> 00:20:58,964

that I can't suppress Xing Tian anymore?

Don't be scared.

328
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:47,134
Mr. Xue has come up with a solution.

329
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:49,495
It's

330
00:22:49,554 --> 00:22:51,073
not a complicated matter.

331
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:52,295
I'm here.

332
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:54,414
But

333
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,274
what if

334
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,654
he hurts you again in the meantime?

335
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:00,654
I fought with him.

336
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:02,034
He's no match for me

337
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:03,454
in your body.

338
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:05,414
So,

339
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,535
are you worried
that Xing Tian will harm me?

340
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:21,815
Yes.

341
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:24,495
Why did you keep it a secret from me?

342
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:28,815
Everything happened too suddenly.

343
00:23:28,995 --> 00:23:31,015
I didn't know how to tell you about it.

344
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,313
And I was afraid

345
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:34,174
that you would worry
if I tell you the truth.

346
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:36,495
I was wrong.

347
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,934
I won't do it again.

348
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:43,295
So,

349
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:45,495
are you planning
to spend the night here?

350
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:48,975
I'm scared that Xing Tian
will come for you again.

351
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:50,775
And I'm scared

352
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:53,055
that he'll frighten others.

353
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:00,894
Don't run away again next time.

354
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:05,055
I don't want to lose you again.

355
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:07,015
Let's go home.

356
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,780
(Cranial Nerve Image)

357
00:24:56,874 --> 00:24:58,934
Our great Dr. Zhang.

358
00:24:59,154 --> 00:25:01,215
You've been reading the whole day.

359
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:02,775
How is it?

360
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:05,854
Have you found a way
that can help Lingling?

361
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:08,094
Look.

362
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,034
According to this book, the brain

363
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:12,793
can transmit weak electrical pulse

364
00:25:12,794 --> 00:25:14,353
through the nerve fibers

365
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:17,113
to send commands to various
body tissues and organs.

366
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:17,754
It means

367
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:19,274
that the brain
can use electrical signals

368
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:21,015
to control our movements.

369
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:23,073
When Lan Yao is developing this game,

370
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:24,833
a machine is used
to control the nerve fibers

371
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,775
to create the gaming experience.

372
00:25:26,794 --> 00:25:29,094
The brain is like the signal receptor.

373
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,174
But there's a huge issue with it.

374
00:25:32,394 --> 00:25:33,833
The user's brain waves can easily

375
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:35,914
be controlled by other thoughts

376
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:37,735
thus affecting the nerve fibers.

377
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:39,775
I think you are right.

378
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:42,313
It means

379
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:43,833
that this game is very dangerous.

380
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,575
Lan Yao has been affected
by the brain waves.

381
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:54,015
Here.

382
00:26:12,675 --> 00:26:13,975
How's she?

383
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:16,954
I was right.

384
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:19,553
Ms. Song and the code
are now more and more

385
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:20,353
integrated.

386
00:26:20,354 --> 00:26:22,575
It has started to become unstable.

387
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:25,360
This is the same-frequency communication
that I'm talking about.

388
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:29,654
Will it affect my body?

389
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:31,735
It may be more taxing for your body.

390
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:33,194
But I can't estimate

391
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:34,914
how bad it will get.

392
00:26:34,915 --> 00:26:36,694
But if I were to guess,

393
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:39,614
it would be bleak.

394
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:44,454
What's the current solution you have?

395
00:26:44,995 --> 00:26:45,873
Xing Tian

396
00:26:45,874 --> 00:26:49,575
is connected to Ms. Song
through electricity.

397
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:51,793
So, I've created this device based on

398
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:53,495
her vital signs.

399
00:26:53,995 --> 00:26:56,034
I want to use this connection between

400
00:26:56,035 --> 00:26:59,633
Ms. Song's brain and the computer
to send Xing Tian back

401
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:02,015
through the brain waves.

402
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:02,754
But

403
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:03,954
due to the lack of time,

404
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,694
I haven't adjusted
the readings of the device.

405
00:27:06,995 --> 00:27:08,215
So...

406
00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:10,113
No.

407
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:11,454
This is too risky.

408
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:13,633
An untested device

409
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:15,134
may lead to side effects.

410
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:17,793
Besides, we can't experiment

411
00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:19,015
with Lingling's body.

412
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,414
What if we fail to send Xing Tian back

413
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:23,575
and instead, cause harm to her body?

414
00:27:24,955 --> 00:27:26,094
I want to give it a try.

415
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:28,894
I don't agree.

416
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,815
We've lost control over Xing Tian.

417
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,454
I don't want him to hurt you again.

418
00:27:37,515 --> 00:27:38,815
Besides,

419
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,313
I'm sure you don't want him

420
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:42,113
to bother me from time to time.

421
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:43,894
I don't want to talk to him anymore.

422
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:45,194
Because otherwise,

423
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:47,535
people will think that I'm crazy.

424
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:49,854
I believe in Mr. Xue.

425
00:27:51,715 --> 00:27:52,854
I'm ready.

426
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:58,575
Okay.

00:28:07,314 --> 00:28:08,535
