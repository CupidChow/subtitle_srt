Give me the antidote.

00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:40,435
Give me the antidote.

00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:45,076
There's no antidote!

41
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:47,715
Yes.

42
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:48,574
There's an antidote.

00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:56,116
It's over there.

You can go and take it. Hurry.

Go now.

Let's go!

53
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,236
Let me help you out.

54
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:48,076
Cut the crap.

55
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:49,454
Just run away.

56
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:50,915
For what?

57
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:53,755
I already scared
all of those crooks away.

58
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:56,775
Although we're enemies,

59
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:58,516
you're quite chivalrous.

60
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:00,134
You were drugged,

61
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:01,815
but you still tried to save me.

62
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:04,155
I'll let you strike me three times

63
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,435
when we spar next time.

64
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,435
I didn't do it to save you.

65
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,956
I did it to save someone else.

66
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:16,195
Could it be

67
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:19,956
that this body belongs
to the person you love?

68
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,475
That's right.

69
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:27,035
What a coincidence, huh?

70
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:29,196
You killed my wife.

71
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:32,155
And now, I've possessed
the person you love.

72
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,374

79
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:51,414
Boss, where are you?

80
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:52,895
Their reinforcements are here.

81
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:54,294
They aren't.

82
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,396
Don't make a sound.

83
00:04:57,576 --> 00:05:01,235
General, hurry and examine my wound.

84
00:05:02,615 --> 00:05:05,535
I'm a glorious general, you know?

85
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:08,555
How could I allow a crook
like you to order me around?

86
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:10,115
General,

87
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:12,155
you know this too.

88
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:14,436
The poison has infiltrated my body.

89
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:16,876
I won't be able to live long anyway.

90
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:21,555
Can you fulfill my last wish?

91
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:22,795
Poison?

92
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:25,475
It wasn't a sleeping drug?

93
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:26,675
This poison,

94
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:30,355
I'm afraid it has infiltrated
my internal organs.

95
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:33,675
Since you're going to die soon,

96
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:35,996
I'll treat it as a good deed.

97
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:39,235
Tell me. What's your wish?

98
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:42,595
Come closer.

They didn't let go.

126
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:17,854
I wasn't referring to that.

127
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,155
I meant, why aren't they awake yet?

that it would be amazing

163
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:35,175
to introduce our game
on the stage together

164

00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:50,835
you haven't accomplished that yet,
you know?

169
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:00,254
I told you to run away

170
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:02,276
because I didn't want you
to get involved.

171
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:06,236
I don't know what will happen next.

172

I don't want you to be in danger.

174

So,

177
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:32,795
did you tell me that

178
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:38,195
because you were afraid
that you had no time left?

179
00:10:42,735 --> 00:10:44,356

180
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:48,155

00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:53,435

00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:13,756
Xiao Ran?

186
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:15,756
Xiao Ran, you woke up?

187
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,075
This is great!

188
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:30,155
They didn't turn you into a vegetable?

189
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,195
How could I listen
to your heartfelt confession

190
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:41,116
if I didn't pretend to be a vegetable?

191
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,254
How did this happen?

192
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,276
What's with the kidnapping case?

193
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:05,134
If they launch an investigation,

194
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:06,774
and the Shen Group
is found to be involved,

195
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:08,756
there's no way to explain ourselves.

196
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,075
Chairman,

197
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:12,116
this case isn't related to us.

198
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:14,356
Silence everyone who was involved.

199
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,155
Clean up the mess.

200
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,356
Understood.

201
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:18,774
I sent you back

202
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:20,955
to monitor Xiangyu.

203
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:22,734
You have to report to me

204
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:24,494
regarding the people she met

205
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,476
and the events that happened.

206
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:27,795
Understood?

207
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:28,575
Understood.

208
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:29,876
Report what to him?

209
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:34,315
Chairman told me to report
your situation to him.

210
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:38,695
Dad, did you tell Steven to
keep me under surveillance again?

211
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:40,014
I'm just worried

212
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:41,575
that you might not be able

213
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:43,254
to let go

214
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:44,815
of the past, you know?

215
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:47,134
Dad, I know what you're trying to say.

216
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:48,254
If you keep this up,

217
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,494
I'm going to be angry.

218
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:50,215
No.

219
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:51,095
Don't be angry.

220
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:52,356
I'll drop the topic.

221
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:57,555
Have you met Xiao Ran
after heading back?

222
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:01,055
Mr. Xiao kept mentioning
the marriage between you two

223
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:02,716
when he called me.

224
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,854
That old man is such a drag.

225
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:06,534
I already told him

226
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,795
that I'd take charge of my own marriage.

227
00:13:08,976 --> 00:13:11,435
Chairman is just concerned about you.

228
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:14,335
Are you in cahoots with my father?

229
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,795
Do you intend to betray me?

230
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:17,195
That's impossible.

231
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:20,774
I don't know what Xiao Ran is doing.

232
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:22,695
There's no news of him lately.

233
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:25,396
The old folks are starting
to play matchmakers.

234
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:33,734
Don't go!

235
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:34,774
Get out of our way!

236
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:36,815
Yiyi, don't be angry.

237
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,494
No.

238
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:38,935
You have to come home with me today.

239
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:40,876
I don't know how
you'll get hurt next time.

240
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:42,534
Since you can't protect her,

241
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:44,996
fine, I'll pick her up
and send her home.

242
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,534
The kidnapping case

243
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:49,534
was my fault indeed.

244
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:50,614
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:51,996
But I promise

246
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:55,315
that I won't let her
experience that again.

247
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,455
That's right.

248
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:58,955
The kidnapping case
was just an accident.

249
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,596
Moreover,

250
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:02,596
there's a reason why I can't leave.

251
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:04,075
What reason?

252
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:08,195
I can't explain myself for now.

253
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,695
Did I appear at the wrong time?

254
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:11,614
I'll make a move first

255
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:12,975
if this isn't the time.

256
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:13,955
Come back.

257
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,295
You'll always side with me, right?

258
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:22,175
Of course.

259
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:23,476
Zhang Yunfei, go!

260
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:25,455
Yiyi.

261
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:27,055
Calm down for now.

262
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:29,276
Mr. Xiao.

263
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,636
Ms. Shen has arrived.

264
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:35,915
Xiao Ran.

265
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,835
Long time no see.

266
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:47,356
When did you come back?

267
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:48,734
Just a few days ago.

268
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:50,975
It's been a long time since we met.
Did you miss me?

269
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:52,596
Who's that?

270
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:55,055
I'm Xiao Ran's childhood friend

271
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:56,854
and playmate.

272
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,815
I'm also the daughter
of Uncle Xiao's best friend.

273
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,415
I'm the successor of Shen Group,
Shen Xiangyu.

274
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,996
So, you're the Shen Xiangyu
whom everyone has been talking about.

275
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:09,596
What did they say about me?

276
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,774
They said you were the
daughter of a wealthy family, a campus belle,

277
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:14,876
and Xiao Ran's preferred partner.

278
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,335
Xiao Ran mentioned you every day

279
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:19,516
when you went abroad.

280
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,494
What are you doing here today?

281
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:26,095
I wouldn't visit you

282
00:15:26,096 --> 00:15:27,996
without any reason.

283
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:29,815
It's all because

284
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:32,396
my father was urging us to get married.

285
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,095
Yiyi, I feel unwell.

286
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:42,756
Let's go inside.

287
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:51,276
I'll go and examine them.

288
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:55,134
Don't try to run away.

289
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,356
I need you to deal with Liu Yiyi.

290
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:00,155
Who exactly have I offended?

291
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:08,435
You did it on purpose, right?

292
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:10,155
You found out, huh?

293
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:12,155
I'll clarify this first.

294
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:14,276
I'm not here to jeopardize
your relationship.

295
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,716
It's just that you're too slow.

296
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,815
The old folks are urging us to
get married.

297
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:21,756
I'm afraid it'll be too late
if we don't act now.

298
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:28,915
Lingling,

299
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:31,876
do you like Xiao Ran?

300
00:16:36,535 --> 00:16:38,534
He never told me

301
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:40,155
that he was engaged.

302
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,155
We confessed

303
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:46,236
to each other

304
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:48,315
at the hospital just now.

305
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:50,095
So,

306
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,254
since you guys like each other,

307
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:53,254
you can ask him

308
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:54,876
about his engagement directly.

309
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:57,335
If he hesitates

310
00:16:57,336 --> 00:16:58,774
or can't make a decision,

311
00:16:58,775 --> 00:16:59,295
you can do

312
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:01,155
without a man like him.

313
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:04,734
However, if only Ms. Shen
has a crush on him,

314
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:06,334
we mustn't back off.

315
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:08,494
If you like him, you mustn't let him go.

316
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,315
You have to fight for it.

317
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:17,075
Shen Group is just as big
as Shanhai Group.

318
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,175
They're childhood friends too.

319
00:17:19,176 --> 00:17:20,956
They have known each other since young.

320
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:24,276
They suit each other better
no matter if it's their identities

321
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,236
or background.

322
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:29,875
Are you trying to make me
persuade my father?

323
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:33,094
As long as you get together
with Song Lingling,

324
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:33,935
by then,

325
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:36,975
I'll pretend to be upset
and find Uncle Xiao.

326
00:17:36,976 --> 00:17:40,035
I'll say that you
already have a girlfriend.

327
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:42,494
Uncle Xiao won't be able
to do anything about it by then.

328
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,716
By then, the engagement
will be canceled.

329
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:48,315
How could you come up
with such a terrible idea?

330
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:50,254
You're protecting yourself

331
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:51,635
while sacrificing me.

332
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:54,175
Tell Ms. Qi

333
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,215
that I'm not leaving.

334
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:56,760
I'm having dinner with you guys tonight.

335
00:17:57,616 --> 00:18:00,054
You're trying to
add fuel to the flame, huh?

336
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:01,254
Since I'm trying to assist you,

337
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:02,956
I need to go all the way.

338
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:10,695
Mr. Xiao, Ms. Shen, let's eat.

339
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:11,494
Alright.

340
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:12,756
Let's eat.

341
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,175
Ms. Qi, your cooking
is still as good as always.

342
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:20,094
I'm starving.

343
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:21,476
Let's take our seats.

344
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:22,774
Xiao Ran, sit here.

345
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:25,875
You loved to sit beside me
when you were young, right?

346
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:31,814
That was in the past.

347
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:33,516
Times have changed.

348
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:38,334
She's just a guest.

349
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:39,175
But look at her.

350
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:41,516
She's making it as if
she's the female head here.

351
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,236
Xiao Ran,

352
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:47,175
let's have a drink

353
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:48,595
to celebrate our reunion.

354
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:51,574
He was just discharged
from the hospital and his body is still weak.

355
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:53,035
He mustn't drink now.

356
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:54,895
Look at all the scrumptious dishes here.

357
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:56,615
It's a waste if we don't
drink alcohol today.

358
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:59,595
Goddess Lanyao, why don't
you drink with me instead?

359
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,094
Ms. Qi had prepared plenty of dishes.

360
00:19:04,095 --> 00:19:05,716
Let's try them.

361
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:09,014
I have a hunch

362
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:11,035
that the situation will go south soon.

363
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:14,916
Xiao Ran,

364
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:18,094
since you didn't allow me
to take Lingling with me,

365
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:20,315
I'll leave her to you.

366
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:22,494
I'll settle my debt with you

367
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,555
if she suffers because of you.

368
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,956
Most importantly,

369
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:30,075
you mustn't let anyone else bully her.

370
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,415
Lanyao will move out of the house

371
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,855
once the game is online, right?

372
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:36,395
She won't.

373
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:38,135
But why?

374
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,855
Could it be that you two
are living together now?

375
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:41,956
- No...
- That's right.

376
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:48,996
Now, you're acting distant, huh?

377
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:51,855
When you were young,
you followed me around

378
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:53,716
and called me Big Sister.

379
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:56,494
Why am I an outsider to you now?

380
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,574
Lingling, you mustn't back off now.

381
00:19:58,575 --> 00:19:59,695
Tell her what's on your mind.

382
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:01,716
She's acting so arrogantly.

383
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:07,996
Yes. I do like Xiao Ran.

384
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,135
But I didn't know

385
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:11,956
that you two were engaged.

386
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:15,115
If I have to express my stand,

387
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:17,676
I won't give up on him.

388
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:20,094
Although I didn't know him

389
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,476
as long as you did,

390
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:23,375
my love for him

391
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:25,075
is at least equal to yours.

392
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:27,436
If you intend to compete,

393
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:31,355
from today onward,
let's have a fair competition.

394
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:32,875
Excellent.

395
00:20:32,936 --> 00:20:34,476
That was great.

396
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:38,716
You have no right to compete with me.

397
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:47,795
It's because

398
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:50,716
you're already at the finish line.

399
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:54,855
Xiao Ran should know

400
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:57,035
what to do with our engagement.

401
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,716
I'm done. I'll make a move first.

402
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:05,014
Nice to meet you.

403
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,395
I hope I can be friends with you.

404
00:21:08,495 --> 00:21:09,476
No.

405
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:11,916
Nice to meet you, Sister-in-law.

406
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:14,756
Lin Qiao is the one I like.

407
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,760
(Lingjiang Airline, Kaifa Bank)

408
00:21:36,015 --> 00:21:38,054
What does Mr. Shen mean by this?

409
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:40,215
He wants you two to keep mum.

410
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,574
Do not tell anyone else

411
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:43,716
about your relationship
with the Shen family.

412
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,734
You guys should escape

413
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:48,476
before Xiao Ran strikes you down.

414
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:50,935
Do you guys think you can escape

415
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,534
if Mr. Shen didn't help you guys out

416
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:54,756
on account of your ties with him?

417
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:56,534
If so, should we sit idly by

418
00:21:56,535 --> 00:21:57,895
as Xiao Ran flaunts his superiority?

419
00:21:57,896 --> 00:21:59,756
That's none of your business.

420
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:02,075
You should ensure your own safety first.

421
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:05,956
This is a one-way ticket.

422
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:07,494
Since you guys intend to leave,

423
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:09,276
do not come back again.

424
00:22:12,856 --> 00:22:14,960
Uncle Chen and Uncle Li
were arrested by the cops

425
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,160
on their way to the airport.

426
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,534
I've also gotten rid of their spies

427
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:19,276
in the company.

428
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:21,175
Thank you, Brother.

429
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:23,075
Why are you being this courteous?

430
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:26,375
It's also my fault
for not noticing it sooner.

431
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:27,835
It must've been tough on you.

432
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:29,814
This has nothing to do with you.

433
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,294
I was too anxious

434
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:32,655
to catch them.

435
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:34,595
But I have to thank you
this time around.

436
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:36,415
Luckily, you came to my rescue in time.

437
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,135
You're being too courteous.

438
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:39,975
But what you did

439
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:42,175
was too risky.

440
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,494
How can I face Father

441
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,156
if something happens to you?

442
00:22:45,295 --> 00:22:46,916
I have my own boundaries.

443
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:49,014
By the way, Brother,

444
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:51,035
Xiangyu looked for me today.

445
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,156
Why was she looking for you?

446
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,075
Where's my bed?

447
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,840
(Liu Yiyi: Did you see my gift?
Cherish your golden moment!)

448
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:16,956
This Liu Yiyi...

449
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:21,014
Uncle Xiang,

450
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:22,574
Lingling said

451
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:25,534
she wanted to remove
the bed in the bedroom.

452
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:27,315
She thought it was uncomfortable.

453
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,595
Is that so?

454
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,035
Alright.

455
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:33,375
I'll prepare a new bed for Ms. Song.

456
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,334
No need for that.

457
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:35,254
Mr. Xiao said

458
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:36,835
he would do something about it.

459
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,615
Alright, then.

460
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:39,415
You can go ahead.

461
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,315
Alright.

462
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:44,395
How can I sleep tonight, then?

463
00:23:48,656 --> 00:23:49,916
What are you looking for?

464
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,395
Nothing.

465
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:56,774
I heard from Uncle Xiang that you thought
the bed felt uncomfortable.

466
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:57,916
Not at all.

467
00:23:57,976 --> 00:23:59,655
I thought it was pretty comfortable.

468
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:02,315
Why don't you ask him to bring it back?

469
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:03,716
That won't do.

470
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,156
I already told him to throw it away.

471
00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:12,276
If so, where should I sleep tonight?

472
00:24:12,696 --> 00:24:14,655
We're already a couple.

473
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:17,276
Isn't it reasonable
for us to sleep on the same bed?

474
00:24:21,055 --> 00:24:23,655
I still have unfinished work.

475
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:25,054
You can sleep first.

476
00:24:25,055 --> 00:24:26,516
I'll finish my work.

477
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,774
What are you doing here
at this late hour?

478
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,996
What? Am I not welcome?

479
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,236
I'm thirsty. I'm here to get a beverage.

480
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:50,035
Stop drinking cold water.

481
00:24:50,136 --> 00:24:51,716
I'll get you some warm water.

482
00:24:58,335 --> 00:24:59,196
Here.

483
00:25:02,176 --> 00:25:04,795
Guess where I went just now.

484
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:08,476
Weren't you avoiding him before this?

485
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:12,635
He did make a timely report, huh?

486
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:15,734
But just like what you've said,

487
00:25:15,735 --> 00:25:17,196
he has become much more mature.

488
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:20,196
Times have changed.

489
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:22,035
People change too.

490
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,334
Have you changed

491
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:26,916
all these years, then?

492
00:25:29,616 --> 00:25:31,196
Maybe a little.

493
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:34,835
Anyway, I didn't change at all.

494
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:45,795
Try and see
if the temperature is just nice.

495
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,156
You always brush me off.

496
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:54,236
Listen.

497
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:57,315
Xiao Ran and Song Lingling
are already a couple.

498
00:25:57,815 --> 00:26:01,476
You've been avoiding me
because you know Uncle Xiao

499
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:03,315
wants me to get married to Xiao Ran.

500
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:08,835
My father is already urging me
to get married.

501
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:13,516
I don't know how long
I can still wait for you.

502
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:15,814

You weren't asleep?

506
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:03,476
I can't sleep without you.

507
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:08,555
I can't keep you company

508
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:10,635
all the time, you know?

509
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:14,635
If so, let me embrace you
