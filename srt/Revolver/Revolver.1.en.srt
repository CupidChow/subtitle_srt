00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,542
The scar under your eye wasn't
here when you came here.

3
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:03,042
I fell in the bathroom.

4
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:06,084
Turn around, please.

5
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:14,250
Did you get the scar on
your shoulder in prison?

6
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:17,167
No, I got it when I was
working as a detective.

7
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:21,209
Okay, it's done. You
can get dressed now.

8
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:30,500
Change your clothes.

9
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:37,917
For the identification process, please
state your inmate number and name.

00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,500
Your sentence is fully served.

16
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:56,084
I don't have any.

17
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,125
Please state your parents' address.

18
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:00,292
They both passed away.

19
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,584
Then anyone's address
you'll be staying at,

20
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,009
a friend's address is fine.

21
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,375
I don't have any.

HAPPY CORRECTION, HAPPY NATION

25
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,667
- Hello, sir.
- How's it going?

26
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,375
YOU HAVE THE WILLPOWER TO START FRESH

27
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,125
I guess no one's here.

28
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:19,750
Yeah. No one's coming for you.

29
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,209
They either forgot all about
you, or bailed on you.

30
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:29,084
The case of Lieutenant Lim is closed,
and you got duped by them.

31
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,084
Did you come here to tell me that?

32
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:35,417
And for other reasons.

33
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,709
To see if things worked out
for you, and to close the case.

34
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,792
Great, the bottom feeder is here.

35
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,875
What are you doing here?

36
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,542
I'm here to escort her.

37
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,125
Are you here for the money?

38
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,542
They bailed on her, she's broke.

39
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,209
Speaking of, what are you
doing here, Prosecutor Hong?

40
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:16,209
You know what? I'm going
to find every dirt on you.

41
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,875
Hey, girl!

42
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,584
Long time, no see!

43
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,042
- Do I know you?
- What?

44
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:38,209
You don't remember me?

45
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:41,667
People usually don't forget my face.

46
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,709
From a hostess bar?

47
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,625
Girl, that's harsh.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,459
We met at Mr. Jo's place, remember?

49
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,459
Girl.

50
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,375
Your outfit needs some work.

51
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:58,042
Let's get you some clothes.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hop in!

53
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:02,834
We'll have lots of time
to talk on the way.

54
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,459
I'm Jeong Yun-seon.

55
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,709
At the bar, they call me Madam Jeong.

56
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,792
I worked for Mr. Jo and managed
the girls until things went south.

57
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,042
Who sent you?

58
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:28,625
What?

59
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:30,417
I said, who sent you here?

60
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,334
I came here voluntarily.

61
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,042
What the hell do you want from me?

62
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,167
God, you're starting to piss me off.

63
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,459
Why are you talking down to me?

64
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,792
I have no respect for thugs.

65
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,417
And I thought you'd
be whiney. How cool.

66
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:54,959
Unless the person who made me
a promise sent you, pull over.

67
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:57,667
Suit yourself.

68
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:18,250
Wait!

69
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:23,625
A gift for your release.

70
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,250
Did Lim Seok-yong send
you from his grave?

00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,375
VINTAGE OUTFITS

72
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,084

PLEASE FIX HERE

74
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:00,750
PLEASE FIX HERE

75
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:11,834
Lieutenant Lim Seok-yong?

76
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,375
Yes.

77
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,659
Okay, I see.

78
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,875
You're on the phone all day!

79
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,417
PLEASE FIX HERE

80
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,250
Okay, I'll do that.

81
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,417
Oh, come on.

82
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,292
PLEASE FIX HERE

83
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,459
I hope this building
has no noise issues.

84
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,542
PLEASE FIX HERE

85
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,042
PLEASE FIX HERE

86
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,084
The apartment's empty?

87
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,750
The house faces south
and it's on a popular floor.

88
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,709
The lease alone costs 1.2 billion.

89
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,750
Why would it be empty?

90
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,667
COPY OF REGISTER

91
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,917
BOUGHT BY LIM SEOK-YONG
GIVEN TO HWANG JEONG-MI

92
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,667
Where's the name "Ha Su-yeong"?

93
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,917
Who is she?

94
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:29,584
She had the right to
buy this apartment.

95
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,667
Now, the owner is Hwang Jeong-mi.

96
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:36,000
This apartment was given
to her by Lim Seok-yong.

97
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:37,250
"Given"?

98
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:39,667
That means no money was exchanged.

99
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:43,625
For some reason, this Ha Su-yeong?

100
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,625
She must have sold the right
to buy to Lim Seok-yong.

101
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:49,334
And three months ago,

102
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:53,042
Lim Seok-yong gave this
apartment to Hwang Jeong-mi.

103
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,000
Hello, is Hwang Jeong-mi here?

104
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,084
No one by that name is here.

105
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:06,459
You're not here for the shaman?

106
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,959
It says here...

107
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,459
This is Hwang Jeong-mi's address.

108
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:17,750
We moved here last August,

109
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,250
so she must have
lived here before then.

110
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:38,000
TWO YEARS AGO

111
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:48,125
FINALLY, I'M A HOMEOWNER!

112
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,667
Can you not do that?

113
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,334
Can't I show off a little?

114
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,750
What if the Internal Affairs finds out?

115
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,584
And ask you about the source of money?

116
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:00,834
Everyone knows a cop's salary.

117
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,125
NEW POSTING

118
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,625
DELETE

119
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,584
Go.

120
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,917
I got intel on the
investigation of Jo's club.

121
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,125
That bastard Jo screwed up big time.

122
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:22,167
What did he do?

123
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,959
The DA went through his phone,

124
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:28,625
and that crazy bastard had
all his phone calls recorded.

125
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,334
Hold on.

126
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,125
Go ahead.

127
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:44,417
Jo says he messed up
with his phone settings,

128
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,125
but Sergeant Ha's name
was mentioned in the calls.

129
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:52,084
Jo can be heard trying to bribe
Sergeant Ha multiple times.

130
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,042
What about my name?

131
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,500
You were never mentioned.

132
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:58,167
But Sergeant Ha
should brace for impact.

133
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:01,167
Okay.

134
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,917
Good job. Keep me posted for more.

135
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes, sir.

136
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:10,334
My name was mentioned?
I should brace for what?

137
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,209
Did something happen in the club?

138
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,459
They got busted for
a drug party last night.

139
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,459
So what? They have
those parties all the time.

140
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:21,167
One of them was a minister's son.

141
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,167
They can't let this one slide.

142
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:26,834
Why didn't you tell me?

143
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,750
We were going to the new house today.

144
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:32,375
And I never imagined your
name would be in the calls.

145
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,542
Okay.

146
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,167
What kind of impact
was he talking about?

147
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,334
Why would I?

148
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,334
Make up your mind
soon, and let me know.

149
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,334
You'll have to quit the police force,

150
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,959
but I'll make sure you get probation.

151
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:01,084
Once the case is closed, you
will be rewarded accordingly.

152
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:07,084
That is, if this all goes down as
your bribery scandal, nothing more.

153
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,667
What if I say "no"?

154
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,709
Then we'll all be arrested,

155
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:13,625
and you'll also have to serve
several years behind bars.

156
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,042
Someone will suffer a great loss,

157
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,834
and will retaliate against you.

158
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:24,500
- Is that a threat?
- I'm telling you the truth.

159
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:34,209
Lieutenant Lim Seok-yong,
Attorney Yang Hyun-su,

160
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,167
and the man in the passenger's seat.

161
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,459
What is my reward?

162
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:41,750
Once the case is over,

163
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:44,375
you'll be the director of
security at Eastern Promise

164
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,542
and get a compensation
of seven hundred million.

165
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,334
Who will guarantee that?

166
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:55,875
Hello, nice to meet you.

167
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,209
I'll make sure that this will be...

168
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,792
What do they call it?

169
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,625
"A blessing in disguise"? Anyways...

170
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:11,084
We'll do our best to make
you feel fully compensated.

171
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:14,042
And you are?

172
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,125
Are you from Eastern Promise?

173
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,792
Yes, I'm...

174
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:24,084
Someone who will appreciate
your help more than anybody.

175
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:29,084
I know this is a difficult decision.

176
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:33,667
But if you help me out this
once, I won't ever forget it.

177
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,834
Come on.

178
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,792
You think the DA will
believe I'm in on this alone?

179
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:39,959
Sure he will.

180
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,042
We took care of that part.

181
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:44,667
Right.

182
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:47,000
You people are incredible.

183
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,792
I have one condition.

184
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,917
I have a new apartment to move in.

185
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:06,042
Once everything is over,
promise me I can move in there.

186
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,334
I promise you, you will.

187
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:14,292
Is there anything else you
need? Tell me everything.

188
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,459
No.

189
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,917
I'll take one for the team.

190
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,334
Hold on.

191
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,917
Sergeant Ha.

192
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,792
You don't have to
make up your mind now.

193
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,542
You can sleep on it, until tomorrow.

194
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,709
Is this how you treat me?

195
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:36,542
Forget it.

196
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:39,834
It's all over.

197
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,875
Are you keeping your
mouth shut for a payday?

198
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,167
Let's see...

199
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,417
You took the bribe from Mr. Jo,

200
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,875
and covered up minor troubles that
happened at the Blue Oyster Club.

201
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,417
And you never split the
money and kept it for yourself?

202
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:09,917
I did.

203
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,750
- I'm kind of greedy.
- Sure.

204
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:15,375
You know Eastern Promise?

205
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:19,042
No, I've never heard of it.

206
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,209
The money you took all
came from Eastern Promise.

207
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:27,292
The club was used for the money laundering
of Eastern Promise's illegal fund.

208
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,167
Don't know, don't care.

209
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:31,750
You see,

210
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:35,959
we interrogated Mr. Jo with
his phone call recordings,

211
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:40,417
and he confessed, along with
money, you received drugs three times.

212
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,084
Can you explain this?

213
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:07,584
What's with your face?

214
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,375
Did someone hit you?

215
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:11,792
I got into a fight.

216
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,125
Are they bullying you
for being an ex-cop?

217
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,584
You think someone can bully me?

218
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:21,209
Two years.

219
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,542
How can I last two years in here?

220
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:46,375
Are you...

221
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,084
sleeping better now?

222
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,917
Yes.

223
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:57,084
Surprisingly, I can now sleep at night.

224
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,084
I can now breathe
without having to force it.

225
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:03,917
I guess you turned the corner.

226
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,334
So I've been told.

227
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:16,000
Yang hasn't visited me for
nearly a month. What's wrong?

228
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:21,667
Something came up in
the Philippines last month.

229
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,792
I'll deposit some money
for you to use here.

230
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,959
Why didn't Yang tell me anything?

231
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,625
Something urgent came up.

232
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,209
Anything new on the outside?

233
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,750
The same old, same old.

234
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,959
I made a list of things
to do when I'm out.

235
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:57,209
I think about it every
night before going to bed.

236
00:20:58,584 --> 00:20:59,917
What's on the top of the list?

237
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,417
The day I get released,

238
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:05,542
I'd get a hotel room at
the main street of Seoul,

239
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:09,667
take a shower, and look out the window,

240
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,000
enjoying whiskey.

241
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,584
And that whiskey will
be on me, as a gift.

242
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,917
Forget it.

243
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:25,042
When I get out, I'll forget everything.

244
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,500
But I'll never forgive you
for what you did to me.

245
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:39,667
I've been blaming you,

246
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:42,084
and I've been crying.

247
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:46,834
But one day, just
like the tide falling...

248
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:51,750
All my feelings for you have gone away.

249
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,292
You have two months left.

250
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,292
So hang in there.

251
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,417
It's 65 days.

252
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:25,084
This morning at Heungnam-ri Reservoir
in Seocheon, Chungcheongnam-do,

253
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:29,042
a police officer was found dead
with a gunshot wound in his head.

254
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:33,417
He was identified as Lieutenant
Lim from an unnamed police precinct,

255
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,917
and was found holding a
revolver gun that has been fired

256
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,792
at the site he was discovered.

257
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,500
Two years ago, Lim was implicated
in many police corruption cases

258
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:46,333
including the Blue
Oyster Club drug case,

259
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:50,084
and was under investigation by the DA.

260
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:54,542
The case hit the wall, since any evidence
proving his corruption has died with him.

261
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,750
SENT FROM

262
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:03,000
MT. GEUMGANG, HWAJONG
TEMPLE SEALED, HWANG JEONG-MI

263
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,667
The recordings cannot be restored.

264
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,625
What?

265
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:33,500
They are completely
destroyed, and can't be restored.

266
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:35,667
I thought anything could
be restored these days.

267
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,042
I know, but the mainboard is
destroyed and there's nothing I can do.

268
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,000
MIN GI-HYUN: COME SEE ME

269
00:24:56,084 --> 00:24:57,584
HOUSE 201, DONGHA VILLA, SEOUL

270
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:01,292
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
HOLY BIBLE

271
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,500
You acted like an
anchorwoman, not a detective.

272
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:13,667
Then you became a lame criminal,

273
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,084
and now you're an ex-con.

274
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:16,875
Doesn't it hurt?

275
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,375
It hurts.

276
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,917
It hurts so bad, I want to die already.

277
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,917
Why did you want to
see me? You hate me.

278
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:30,834
What about the money?

279
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:35,750
Did you get rewarded for your silence?

280
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,875
You're going to let
them screw you over?

281
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,292
- Are you?
- No.

282
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,959
I have to get my apartment
back. And my money.

283
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,209
How?

284
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,292
How are you going to do that?

285
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,375
You have any evidence against them?

286
00:25:58,209 --> 00:25:59,959
God, you fool.

287
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:05,417
How can Lim fall for someone
like you and betray my trust?

288
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:11,167
So you really don't
have anything on them?

289
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:13,375
I don't.

290
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:16,542
But I remember the face of the
man who promised to pay me.

291
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:19,667
When you got stabbed, you
ran off to the PR department.

292
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:23,084
You'll never conduct
a proper investigation.

293
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,334
How on earth are you going
to get your money back?

294
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,459
Are you done? I should go.

295
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:31,709
Do you need my help?

296
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:36,875
You want my help?

297
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,542
Yes.

298
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:42,834
I need your help.

299
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,459
Take this, and I'll help you.

300
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:18,792
Why are you doing this?

301
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:21,292
You had Lim wrapped around your finger,

302
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:24,292
and drove a wedge between him and me.

303
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:28,084
So I want to see you hit rock bottom.

304
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,334
And by rock bottom

305
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:33,000
you mean becoming a murderer?

306
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:36,917
Is that it? You want me
to avenge Lim's death?

307
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,167
You must have really loved him.

308
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,042
Are you in or not?

309
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:45,792
Fine, I'm in.

310
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,167
Let's do this.

311
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,625
Okay.

312
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,625
Let's get back the bloody money,
for the duped criminal in front of me.

313
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,875
- You have any operating funds?
- No.

314
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,584
You can't do anything without money.

315
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,542
Go find the retired Chief Kwon.

316
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:07,500
Give him trouble.

317
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,292
Give him trouble and
shake him down for money.

318
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,459
Hello, Chief.

319
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:19,459
You don't need this
anymore, right? I'll take it.

320
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,250
Just how much money
did you guys rip off?

321
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,917
Did you retire because of us?

322
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:50,292
Yeah.

323
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:53,625
Thanks to you, I had to retire.

324
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,375
You know, don't you?

325
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,250
The reason Lim killed himself.

326
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,417
I don't.

327
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,125
I need some operating funds.

328
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,834
"Operating funds"?

329
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,750
They promised to
pay me, but they didn't.

330
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,334
Now I'm going to find them.

331
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:19,834
And during the process,

332
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:23,542
if your name ever pops
up, I'll make it go away.

333
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:27,125
I won't ask you any questions, Chief.

334
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:30,084
You'll never see me again.

335
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,959
Look at you being cute.

336
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,084
Are you threatening me?

337
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,042
Who told you to rip me off?

338
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,542
It's not something you'd come up with.

339
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:03,125
- Nice!
- Good shot.

340
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,709
All that practice must have paid off.

341
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,500
You're a doctor, not a golfer.

342
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:12,625
Your swing looks
amazing. Not like me...

343
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,917
It looks like you're
doing great, Mr. Jo.

344
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,209
When did you get out and
open such a fine establishment?

345
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:25,417
What brings you here?

346
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,042
How did you pay for this place?

347
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,709
Come on, you know how.

348
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:33,417
No, I don't.

349
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,417
I never thought the police
would grill me at my own place.

350
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,667
I was fired long ago, remember?

351
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:44,584
But you got to open
such a fine establishment.

352
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:50,334
They must have paid
you all the hush money.

353
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:52,709
So what?

354
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:54,667
I never saw a penny of it.

355
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:57,250
The bastards who
promised to pay me bailed.

356
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,625
What does that have to do with me?

357
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:01,084
Let me ask you one thing.

358
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,042
Who paid you?

359
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:13,459
Why are you so
serious? It's not like you.

360
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,209
So you really don't know anything?

361
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,042
I don't.

362
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:25,667
I was just a minion following
Lim's orders left with breadcrumbs.

363
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,542
And it pisses me off to see your place.

364
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:34,500
Do you know why Lieutenant Lim died?

365
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:40,125
The CEO of Eastern Promise, Grace.

366
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:43,334
He found something on her
and planned something huge,

367
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,459
but got screwed over
and killed himself.

368
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:47,209
Something on Grace?

369
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:48,292
Yes.

370
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:52,209
Whatever that was, I
don't know. Don't ask me.

371
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,042
Eastern Promise...

372
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:06,917
you know we can't touch those folks.

373
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:14,084
Don't get any funny ideas,
just get a job for an honest living.

374
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:18,750
I know this host bar in
Gangnam, looking for security.

375
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:19,917
To deal with Karens.

376
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:28,792
How did it go?

377
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:31,459
You gave him trouble?

378
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,334
How can I?

379
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:38,334
He was a bit hesitant,
but came through.

380
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,792
He was hesitant?

381
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,709
He asked me who I was working with.

382
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,209
And?

383
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,459
I didn't say anything.

384
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:56,750
Why not?

385
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,084
Why didn't you tell him it was me?

386
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,375
Tell me about Grace.

387
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,292
You know Lim So-jeong, right?

388
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:13,584
The former CEO of Eastern
Promise? But she's dead.

389
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:14,625
Yeah.

390
00:33:16,584 --> 00:33:19,625
She was a shaman, and the
prosecutors' wives worshiped her.

391
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,000
Grace became her adoptive daughter.

392
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,792
And they got bumped up to first class.

393
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:31,292
Grace used to...

394
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:35,209
work as a model in China.

395
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:39,709
Then she latched on to a sugar daddy.

396
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:43,667
A big-time high-roller.

397
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:45,834
But...

398
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:50,250
Grace wasn't her only stepdaughter.

399
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:53,417
A rookie shaman named
Hwang Jeong-mi was, too.

400
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,625
"Hwang Jeong-mi"?

401
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:57,459
Yes, Hwang Jeong-mi.

402
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,584
She used to be a high-end escort,

403
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:03,667
but got possessed by a spirit.

404
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,334
Lim So-jeong adored her,

405
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,292
performed rituals for her,

406
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:12,875
and planned to leave
the company to her.

407
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:15,792
But then...

408
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:18,459
Hwang Jeong-mi disappeared.

409
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:20,334
What?

410
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,917
Why?

411
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,875
I know her.

412
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:30,125
Lim Seok-yong gave my
apartment to Hwang Jeong-mi.

413
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:32,000
He gave it to her?

414
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,750
Did Lim take anyone under his wings?

415
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:44,792
Yes.

416
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:50,042
Then go see him.

417
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,500
It'll be awkward talking to him.

418
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:58,834
He didn't know Lim and I were
together and I rejected his advances.

419
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,209
You're a real piece of work.

420
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:07,709
He must be Grace's henchman.

421
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,417
What do you want?

422
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:24,209
I want to know what Lim was
investigating before he killed himself.

423
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,709
What's it to you?

424
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,750
I don't know.

425
00:35:34,084 --> 00:35:35,250
Shin Dong-ho.

426
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:40,792
Your senior detective killed
himself, how can you not know?

427
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,417
Even if I do, I won't tell a civilian.

428
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:49,042
I know you were rewarded
handsomely for your silence.

429
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,292
You disgust me.

430
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,500
Don't ever come see me again.

431
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:01,500
If I was rewarded, why
would I come to you?

432
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:22,917
What are you doing?

433
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,417
You know Hwang Jeong-mi, right?

434
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:26,959
Wasn't Lim investigating her?

435
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:29,875
Come on, what are you
talking about? Damn it.

436
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:33,459
She fled across the borders
after pulling an investment scam!

437
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:37,167
She is seriously loaded,

438
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:40,875
and I heard she's enjoying life
somewhere nice, like Switzerland.

439
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:43,834
You happy now? Get out.

440
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:48,750
You're good, Shin.

441
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,667
You came a long way.

442
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,875
You know Jeong Yun-seon?

443
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:55,334
They call her Madam Jeong at the bar.

444
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:59,625
She came for me the day I got
released. She must be connected to Lim.

445
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:01,917
You know her, right?

446
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,959
While you were in prison,

447
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,125
Lim lived with her.

448
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:13,542
Get out.

449
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:53,917
What's funny?

450
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,750
Ha Su-yeong came to see me today.

451
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:02,375
Don't make a damn fool out
of yourself like the last time.

452
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,375
Don't mess up.

453
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:09,000
I can be tough on men,

454
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,000
but I have a soft spot
for pathetic women.

455
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,500
Are you talking about Ha Su-yeong?

456
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:18,792
Her boyfriend killed himself,

457
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:22,084
and she served time in
prison but never got paid for it.

458
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,084
Isn't that pathetic?

459
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:26,042
Madam.

460
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,167
Shouldn't you be more
concerned about yourself?

461
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,834
You are swimming in debt,

462
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:35,167
and your ex-husband in his
40s always gets into trouble.

463
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,375
Touché.

464
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,250
Check out everything Ha is doing,

465
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,000
and report back to me.

466
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,542
It'll be lame if I approach her.

467
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:51,542
Just wait. She'll come looking for you.

468
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,167
Why are you so determined
to give her a hard time?

469
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,750
Because she rejected you?

470
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,500
You're a smart ass today.

471
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:09,459
Okay.

472
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,792
I'll shut up and stay put.

473
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:16,500
If I do this, does this
mean we're even now?

474
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,125
Yeah, but does it matter?

475
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:22,292
Your ex will get in trouble again.

476
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:30,917
You want me to kill him?

477
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:34,084
Yes.

478
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,542
Are you crazy?

479
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:41,959
I'm just kidding.

480
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:46,709
Just remember.

481
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,250
Don't ever lie to Ha Su-yeong.

482
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:52,959
When you tell her ten things,

483
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:55,875
HOTEL CHECK-IN
nine of them have to be true.

484
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:59,167
And the last one will be
the lie to stab her in the back.

485
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,542
I should save it for the last moment.

486
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:03,667
Room 702.

487
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:08,042
You've just quoted Lim
Seok-yong word for word.

488
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:17,167
If you want to copy
Lim, get it done right.

489
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,125
That is just lame.

490
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,459
- How do you know Madam Jeong?
- "Madam Jeong"?

491
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:09,709
- I know a lot of Madam Jeongs.
- Jeong Yun-seon.

492
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:12,792
She's my ex-wife.

493
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:17,417
What are you two up to? Are
you trying to take my money?

494
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:21,584
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

495
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:25,000
Barging into my own
house, in broad daylight.

496
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:29,667
Bring it on.

497
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:43,334
What do you want?

498
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,125
Jeong Yun-seon's number.

499
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:04,875
JAWS ENTERTAINMENT SUMMER RETREAT

500
00:42:15,584 --> 00:42:18,167
SHINE BRIGHTER THAN ANYONE
ALWAYS SHINE BRIGHT

501
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,000
- Thank you.
- Good job, bye.

502
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:29,667
- Thank you.
- Your makeup looks perfect today.

503
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,375
- Thank you.
- Bye!

504
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,292
What was that all about?

505
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:39,375
It's an entertainment agency.

506
00:42:39,917 --> 00:42:41,667
And what are you doing there?

507
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:43,417
I'm a trainer.

508
00:42:44,084 --> 00:42:45,084
"A trainer"?

509
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,125
I teach the trainees

510
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:50,042
how to do makeup, how to stay fit,

511
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:51,584
and manners,

512
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:53,709
stuff like that.

513
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,125
So it's not a proper establishment.

514
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:58,125
No, it's not.

515
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:02,084
Who are these people?

516
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,584
Thugs who made some money
by running sports betting websites.

517
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:10,584
Now playing management agents,
with aspiring girl group wannabes.

518
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:12,959
You're a scum.

519
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:17,750
Come on.

520
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,500
You're the one to talk, girl.

521
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,084
Just get to the point, will you?

522
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,584
I'm looking for someone.

523
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:41,375
And I want you to help me.

524
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,250
What's in it for me?

525
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,084
Ten million won.

526
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:48,542
That's it?

527
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:51,000
Your cut was seven hundred million.

528
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:54,417
Fifty million.

529
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,084
Twenty million.

530
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:04,500
Fine, who are you looking for?

531
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:08,000
People at Eastern Promise
who hang out with Lim Seok-yong.

532
00:44:09,084 --> 00:44:11,250
Try to remember people
he met two years ago.

533
00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:14,084
There were too many
of them to remember.

534
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:18,792
The chief director.

535
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:22,042
Also, there was Andy.

536
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:23,209
"Andy"?

537
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,875
Yeah.

538
00:44:25,542 --> 00:44:28,167
They were joined at the
hips until two years ago.

539
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,792
He visited the bar almost every day.

540
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,334
What did he look like?

541
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:33,709
In his early 30s.

542
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:35,167
Clean-cut.

543
00:44:35,792 --> 00:44:39,709
Like the youngest son of
Gangnam's real estate mogul?

544
00:44:41,209 --> 00:44:42,625
That sort of image.

545
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:44,000
Did he wear glasses?

546
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,792
Yeah, they were expensive.

547
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,375
Made from turtleback.

548
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:49,459
A testudinal frame.

549
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,084
That's right.

550
00:44:58,375 --> 00:44:59,959
Where can I find him?

551
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,709
What? Andy?

552
00:45:03,084 --> 00:45:04,875
He promised to pay me.

553
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:06,917
Andy was the one who didn't pay?

554
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:11,500
Andy is Grace's younger brother.

555
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,500
Grace has a younger brother?

556
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,750
Some say he's her lover.

557
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:19,792
But why would he pay everyone but you?

558
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:23,459
Maybe he screwed
you over because of Lim.

559
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:28,500
It won't be easy
getting money from him.

560
00:45:32,084 --> 00:45:33,250
So tell me,

561
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:35,542
how far are you willing to go?

562
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:38,084
What do you mean?
I'm getting what I'm owed.

563
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,750
You can end up like Lim Seok-yong.

564
00:45:42,834 --> 00:45:44,750
What did he do, exactly?

565
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:52,167
You know as well as I do,
what kind of man he was.

566
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,209
Everything was a secret for him.

567
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:59,209
Let me ask you one thing. No lies.

568
00:46:01,042 --> 00:46:02,959
Why did you come pick me up?

569
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:05,875
We're in this together now, so tell me.

570
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:11,459
Lim's junior, Shin Dong-ho told me to.

571
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:13,584
What's up his sleeve?

572
00:46:14,584 --> 00:46:15,959
I wouldn't know.

573
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:19,917
I just do as he says,
because I owe him.

574
00:46:24,792 --> 00:46:26,375
They say he's alone now.

575
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:28,584
The bartender kept the door open.

576
00:46:30,959 --> 00:46:34,125
Girl, if you get a
bad feeling, just bail.

577
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:39,834
Lim Seok-yong once said Andy
was a crazy dog wearing perfume.

578
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:52,417
CALLING: SHIN DONG-HO

579
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:01,709
Go.

580
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:04,209
Ha Su-yeong is on her way to see Andy.

581
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:06,542
She's inside Dream Catcher now.

582
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:07,625
Andy?

583
00:47:08,084 --> 00:47:09,625
How did she know about Andy?

584
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:11,292
I told her.

585
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:13,959
Are you out of your
mind? Why would you?

586
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:17,125
I told you to watch her
and report, not help her!

587
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,084
So I'm reporting to you now! Goddammit!

588
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:21,542
That piece of shit.

589
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:38,584
Ah, shit.

590
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,875
Who are you again?

591
00:47:56,584 --> 00:47:58,417
Give me the money you promised.

592
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:02,625
Right, damn it.

593
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:04,084
I promised to pay you.

594
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:05,875
That's right.

595
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:08,375
But you know...

596
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,417
I no longer work for that company.

597
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:21,417
It's no use coming to me for money.

598
00:48:24,709 --> 00:48:28,417
It will be better if you go to
the company and talk to them.

599
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,875
You asshole.

600
00:48:36,584 --> 00:48:37,625
What is this?

601
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:39,792
You piece of crap! Come here!

602
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,292
You little shit!

603
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:44,584
I told you not to let anyone in today.

604
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:48,542
Put your guard down.
I said, down! You shit!

605
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:50,667
You screwed up big time!

606
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,625
I should kill you right now!

607
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:56,959
So you see,

608
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,917
to be exact, since October 3rd, 2022,

609
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,417
I no longer work at
Eastern Promise and...

610
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,874
what do you call it?

611
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:06,625
Yeah, I retired.

612
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:08,167
You piece of shit!

613
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,459
Damn it.

614
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,209
It's all ruined.

615
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,417
Seriously, though, use
your common sense.

616
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,292
Okay?

617
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:24,209
You don't ask for money to
someone who got fired from the job.

618
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:25,417
I mean...

619
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:28,792
Come on.

620
00:49:29,542 --> 00:49:30,625
That's...

621
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:32,500
You were the one who promised me.

622
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,542
Pay me, and I'll leave quietly.

623
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:36,792
Did I?

624
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:38,625
Holy shit.

625
00:49:39,584 --> 00:49:40,542
It's happening.

626
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:42,584
It's happening again.

627
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:45,375
The panic attack. It's happening.

628
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:56,209
Damn it.

629
00:49:58,042 --> 00:49:59,084
Hold on.

630
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:06,625
If you don't leave quietly, then what?

631
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:13,875
Listen, lady.

632
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:19,709
I mean,

633
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:22,542
you were in jail for drugs.

634
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:26,167
I had nothing to do with
that shit, why are you here?

635
00:50:58,875 --> 00:50:59,834
Hey.

636
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,084
Spit.

637
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:07,834
Spit here.

638
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,750
Okay.

639
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:25,417
Drink this.

640
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:29,125
And I'll pay you.

641
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:36,750
Get my bag.

642
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:52,542
It's a promise.

643
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:14,959
Shit, she really did it.

644
00:52:24,417 --> 00:52:25,584
You can sell them.

645
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:28,292
What?

646
00:52:29,584 --> 00:52:30,625
You don't want to?

647
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,875
Better yet, you can use them yourself.

648
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,875
You were in jail for selling drugs...

649
00:52:39,584 --> 00:52:43,459
Make, good, on, your word!

650
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:49,917
Ah, shit. It hurts so bad.

651
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,917
What did you say? Make
good on my damn word?

652
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,792
Crap, what a load of bullshit.

653
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,709
I've lived my whole
life without doing so.

654
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,209
Then...

655
00:53:05,709 --> 00:53:07,917
give me the number of someone who will.

656
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,209
Okay, fine. I will.

657
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:12,209
I'll give you the number.

658
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:14,417
Please don't hit me. Please don't.

659
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,875
I'll give you...

660
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,250
Damn it.

661
00:53:17,334 --> 00:53:18,459
You piece of shit.

662
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,084
Do whatever the hell
you want. But you know,

663
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:47,000
remember what happened to Lim?

664
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:02,084
Are you crazy?

665
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,042
Holy shit.

666
00:54:28,584 --> 00:54:31,084
Girl, how about a drink?

667
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:44,417
Sure.

668
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:11,042
Is the pitcher okay?

669
00:55:17,834 --> 00:55:20,375
This was Lieutenant Lim's parting gift.

670
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,834
Wow, this is nice!

671
00:55:43,084 --> 00:55:44,334
Say something.

672
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:01,459
This is nice.

673
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:07,125
Lim Seok-yong's a piece of work.

674
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:10,042
Bringing his mistresses together,

675
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,667
making them drinking buddies.

676
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:20,875
Before he died, Lim sent me a message.

677
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,959
He told me to give you this
whiskey on the day of your release.

678
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:28,667
Enough with the old stories.

679
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,084
It's ruining my whiskey.

680
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:42,334
Andy is not someone who'd back
down after getting beaten up like that.

681
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,125
What are you going to do?

682
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,792
You get out of this now.

683
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:53,625
I'll pay you when I get paid.

684
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:56,084
Sure, good idea.

685
00:57:02,584 --> 00:57:03,792
But, girl.

686
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,959
I have no idea how
it's going to go down.

687
00:57:36,042 --> 00:57:38,042
I heard Andy is seriously injured.

688
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:41,417
Yes, ma'am.

689
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:44,750
He broke his leg and collarbone.

690
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,042
He's bedridden.

691
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:51,792
Who the hell did this?

692
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:55,000
An ex-cop named Ha Su-yeong.

693
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,792
She used to work for Lim Seok-yong.

694
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:02,209
Two years ago, she
was promised to get paid

695
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:05,667
for her silence and serving time
in jail, for the Blue Oyster incident.

696
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:06,584
And?

697
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:08,584
And Andy

698
00:58:09,459 --> 00:58:11,709
broke his promise to pay her.

699
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,125
Chief director.

700
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:18,584
Did you know about this?

701
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:21,792
Andy and Lim told me
they'd take care of this.

702
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:25,834
But...

703
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:28,375
she wasn't paid?

704
00:58:29,292 --> 00:58:30,959
The money was sent out.

705
00:58:34,084 --> 00:58:36,167
But Andy blew it all at the casino.

706
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:41,792
That mess with Lim
Seok-yong, and now this...

707
00:58:43,459 --> 00:58:45,584
He makes a mess out of everything.

708
00:58:48,709 --> 00:58:49,625
I see.

709
00:58:49,709 --> 00:58:51,625
PERSONNEL FILE
She trained kumdo?

710
00:58:51,709 --> 00:58:54,500
No wonder she snapped
your leg and collarbone in half.

711
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:56,750
Chief director.

712
00:58:57,709 --> 00:58:58,750
You think it's funny?

713
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:02,709
Director, now everyone in town knows.

714
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:06,167
That the great Andy got his
ass kicked by a female cop.

715
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,125
You should fix this.

716
00:59:08,209 --> 00:59:10,250
Show her not to mess with you.

717
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,834
Did you train kumdo with her?

718
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:13,875
Yes, sir.

719
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:18,375
She was the police spokesperson,

720
00:59:19,117 --> 00:59:20,294
and Lim Seok-yong's lover.

721
00:59:20,377 --> 00:59:21,909
Larger-than-life, really.

722
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:28,959
She was sort of, you know,
a popular girl in the precinct.

723
00:59:30,084 --> 00:59:31,500
- Detective Shin?
- Yes.

724
00:59:34,209 --> 00:59:35,542
You had a thing for her, too?

725
00:59:38,084 --> 00:59:39,125
Who, me?

726
00:59:41,959 --> 00:59:43,500
Older girls are not my type.

727
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:45,500
Hey, you asshole!

728
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,917
Ah, shit.

729
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:51,292
You asshole.

730
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:53,375
You shitty little cop.

731
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:54,625
What's funny?

732
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:57,875
There's nothing funny about this, shit.

733
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:02,417
Go ahead.

734
01:00:02,792 --> 01:00:05,084
Ever since Ha got out of prison,

735
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:08,375
she met three people,
Mr. Jo, Madam Jeong, and me.

736
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:12,584
But those two scums know
nothing about anything.

737
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,459
And Lim wasn't the type
to talk about what he knew,

738
01:00:18,084 --> 01:00:23,625
so Ha Su-yeong doesn't have any
idea what Lim Seok-yong was up to.

739
01:00:23,709 --> 01:00:24,709
Are you sure?

740
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:28,709
Can you be sure those
three were the only ones?

741
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,292
Yes, I'm positive.

742
01:00:35,292 --> 01:00:38,459
Isn't she the last person
to see Lim before he died?

743
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:41,459
I checked every CCTV
footage of the visiting room

744
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:43,000
and there was nothing.

745
01:00:43,084 --> 01:00:44,375
Enough.

746
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,709
Take that bullshit home with you.

747
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:49,875
So tell me.

748
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,584
What the hell are we
going to do with Ha?

749
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:56,917
Director.

750
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:01,417
Wait until the CEO makes her move.

751
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:05,334
And then you can make your move.

752
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,750
And one more thing.

753
01:01:09,959 --> 01:01:10,917
Director.

754
01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:14,250
From now on,

755
01:01:15,709 --> 01:01:19,334
don't do anything that
will upset the CEO.

756
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:22,000
Please.

757
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,792
You're not a kid anymore.

758
01:01:27,834 --> 01:01:28,792
Aren't you?

759
01:01:47,209 --> 01:01:48,334
Are you a detective?

760
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:50,459
You came by the other day, right?

761
01:01:51,084 --> 01:01:52,584
Tell me about Hwang Jeong-mi.

762
01:01:55,209 --> 01:01:57,042
It seems my friend is popular.

763
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,625
She ran a psychic shop here, right?

764
01:02:00,709 --> 01:02:03,417
Why would a cop ask about
Jeong-mi, after all this time?

765
01:02:03,834 --> 01:02:05,792
Her stepmother, Lim So-jeong

766
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:08,709
was also your spirit mother.

767
01:02:09,917 --> 01:02:12,917
I've been told you know
them well, more than anyone.

768
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:21,875
If you're a detective, show me a badge.

769
01:02:24,084 --> 01:02:25,750
It's been a while since I got fired.

770
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,875
And what now?

771
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:31,750
She's been long dead,
buried six feet under.

772
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:35,709
She got greedy and died
before her time. That's it.

773
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:41,334
You're also here for greed.

774
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,209
That I am.

775
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:46,250
I don't care why Hwang Jeong-mi died.

776
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:48,917
All I want is my money
and my apartment back.

777
01:02:53,417 --> 01:02:54,709
My dear Jeong-mi

778
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:58,750
was taken advantage of and
died, all because of dirty money.

779
01:02:59,584 --> 01:03:00,542
And now,

780
01:03:01,959 --> 01:03:04,084
you're taking advantage of her corpse.

781
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:18,667
What a bottom feeder.

782
01:03:20,334 --> 01:03:21,334
That I am.

783
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:30,709
Hwajong Temple, in Sokcho.

784
01:03:31,459 --> 01:03:34,000
That is where Jeong-mi
last served the spirits.

785
01:03:39,625 --> 01:03:42,750
MT. GEUMGANG, HWAJONG
TEMPLE SEALED, HWANG JEONG-MI

786
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:46,459
SEALED, HWANG JEONG-MI

787
01:03:55,584 --> 01:03:57,500
The solution is simple.

788
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,334
You pay me what I'm owed.

789
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:03,667
You and I are alike,

790
01:04:04,209 --> 01:04:07,042
since we're both trying to
get paid by Grace's family.

791
01:04:07,917 --> 01:04:10,959
I make my living by taking
care of Grace's problems,

792
01:04:11,042 --> 01:04:13,125
just like you served time in prison.

793
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:17,625
I'm just saying we should
have an honest conversation.

794
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:28,000
You really don't get it, do you?

795
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:34,584
Grace had the most to gain
with Hwang Jeong-mi gone.

796
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,417
She was murdered, and buried somewhere.

797
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,459
Is that a threat?

798
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:42,750
Do you have any proof?

799
01:04:44,792 --> 01:04:46,084
No proof.

800
01:04:47,667 --> 01:04:49,167
No proof...

801
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:52,792
Then it won't be a threat.

802
01:04:55,084 --> 01:04:56,959
I didn't know I was making one.

803
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,625
Listen now, Ha Su-yeong.

804
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:05,292
I can't pay you right now.

805
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:09,750
All I have are credit cards. You
want me to write a promissory note?

806
01:05:11,834 --> 01:05:13,750
We're talking about
seven hundred million.

807
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,792
It's not huge, but not small, either.

808
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:21,875
For that kind of money, we need to
talk to the accountants and the board.

809
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:24,625
I'll be in touch soon.

810
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:30,000
Don't mess with me.

811
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
You know...

812
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:38,250
I'm just eager to clean
up this shitty mess

813
01:05:38,792 --> 01:05:41,209
that Grace's dumb brother made.

814
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:07,167
You should come back to
Seoul as soon as you can, ma'am.

815
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:13,959
Ha Su-yeong knows about Hwang Jeong-mi.

816
01:06:32,459 --> 01:06:33,792
Everything good?

817
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:35,084
Yes, major.

818
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:37,167
All thanks to you.

819
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:40,000
You saw Ha Su-yeong?

820
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:42,084
Yes, sir.

821
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:43,792
She came looking for me.

822
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,500
But is everything alright?

823
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:49,542
You little weasel.

824
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,542
Don't play dumb.

825
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:54,625
I don't follow you, sir.

826
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:57,292
Come in.

827
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:09,459
Down on your head.

828
01:07:10,084 --> 01:07:11,042
Sir?

829
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:14,084
You're late.

830
01:07:14,709 --> 01:07:15,917
Get down on your head.

831
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:21,375
Chief director, come on.

832
01:07:21,459 --> 01:07:22,709
Will you do it?

833
01:07:23,334 --> 01:07:24,375
Sir?

834
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:26,542
Yes, sir.

835
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:27,625
Forget it.

836
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:29,417
Forget it!

837
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:37,834
Jo, you sit down. Madam
Jeong, you stay there.

838
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,667
You two should make a comeback.

839
01:07:48,875 --> 01:07:51,125
There's a shop in Nonhyeon-dong
closed last month.

840
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:53,417
Renovate the place,

841
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,459
and you two can run it.

842
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,959
I hate to see your
talent going to waste.

843
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:01,292
Thank you, major.

844
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:02,625
I'll do my best.

845
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:04,709
But...

846
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,750
something has been bugging me.

847
01:08:13,209 --> 01:08:14,834
What would that be?

848
01:08:21,084 --> 01:08:22,417
You know Ha Su-yeong?

849
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,500
Yes.

850
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:30,667
She's causing me trouble.

851
01:08:32,834 --> 01:08:33,875
What do you say?

852
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:37,334
Will you two help me out here?

853
01:08:38,959 --> 01:08:40,459
- Yes.
- I will!

854
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:42,084
Of course, we will.

855
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:45,584
Good.

856
01:08:46,584 --> 01:08:49,209
I'm not asking you amateurs
to do something extreme.

857
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,250
The two of you...

858
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:55,625
you two watch Ha Su-yeong
and report back to me.

859
01:08:56,209 --> 01:08:57,334
Simple, right?

860
01:09:00,084 --> 01:09:01,084
Yes.

861
01:09:04,042 --> 01:09:05,000
That's it.

862
01:09:07,417 --> 01:09:08,459
I'll leave you be, sir.

863
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:15,209
Madam Jeong?

864
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,959
Sir?

865
01:09:17,334 --> 01:09:19,500
I heard you were the one...

866
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:26,792
who told Ha about Andy.

867
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:29,917
I...

868
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,542
"Yes, major, sir!"

869
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:39,042
Damn it, why not just wiggle your tail?

870
01:09:39,125 --> 01:09:40,167
Shut the hell up!

871
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:44,542
What were you thinking? Why
would you tell her where Andy is?

872
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:49,167
"Get down on my head"? Bullshit.

873
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:52,125
Damn it, now I'm in deep shit.

874
01:09:52,542 --> 01:09:53,584
What?

875
01:09:54,209 --> 01:09:56,167
He'll give us a new shop.

876
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,250
You moron.

877
01:09:59,084 --> 01:10:01,042
You believe that bastard?

878
01:10:01,584 --> 01:10:03,959
It only ends when we have
her blood on our hands.

879
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:05,792
Then go tell him you can't.

880
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:08,042
You're a genius! As if!

881
01:10:08,459 --> 01:10:09,500
Jackass.

882
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:15,542
Goddammit.

883
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,500
Detective Shin, yeah, it's me.

884
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:36,084
I just talked to the chief director.

885
01:10:36,959 --> 01:10:38,834
I think he wants Ha Su-yeong killed.

886
01:10:41,334 --> 01:10:44,042
He told me to watch her,
so I'm on my way now.

887
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:47,959
Oh, and Mr. Jo is in, too.

888
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:07,292
What did you want to talk about?

889
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:22,292
Today, the chief director
summoned me and Mr. Jo.

890
01:11:22,792 --> 01:11:27,167
He told us to approach you,
and report your every move.

891
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,750
Why are you telling me this?

892
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:30,792
I can't betray your trust.

893
01:11:31,334 --> 01:11:33,542
There is no trust to betray between us.

894
01:11:33,959 --> 01:11:35,875
Come on, that is harsh!

895
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:40,792
You have to get your money
back, so I can get my tip!

896
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:42,167
Is that it?

897
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:51,917
It seems that I have to pay a hefty
price for telling you where Andy is.

898
01:11:52,334 --> 01:11:55,417
Then stab me in the back
and be in Andy's good graces.

899
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:56,792
You're right.

900
01:11:57,292 --> 01:11:59,292
So I'm in a tricky situation now.

901
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,750
Interesting.

902
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,167
Be here by 9 a.m. tomorrow.

903
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:19,917
Okay, sure.

904
01:12:20,209 --> 01:12:21,834
You're not asking me where we're going?

905
01:12:25,584 --> 01:12:27,959
I told you, I don't ask questions.

906
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:29,542
Good.

907
01:12:30,584 --> 01:12:32,917
Now go home. We have
a long way to go tomorrow.

908
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:44,959
Jeong Yun-seon.

909
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,167
Did Lim leave anything
for me besides the whiskey?

910
01:12:50,792 --> 01:12:52,084
What do you mean?

911
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,125
You have the apartment deed, right?

912
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:57,375
Did you know it was mine?

913
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:02,084
You can't do anything
with the deed alone.

914
01:13:05,292 --> 01:13:06,917
I can hear you trying to think.

915
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:11,500
I knew you were one sly fox.

916
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:13,792
You're right.

917
01:13:14,917 --> 01:13:18,500
I think you'll be the highest
bidder when I sell the apartment.

918
01:13:19,459 --> 01:13:21,834
But the deed alone won't
get you anywhere, either.

919
01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:24,084
You're right.

920
01:13:24,959 --> 01:13:27,917
It's useless without the
registered seal of Hwang Jeong-mi.

921
01:13:30,459 --> 01:13:34,750
We'll deal with that later, after
you get your seven hundred million.

922
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:38,084
The going rate of the
apartment is 1.5 billion.

923
01:13:38,959 --> 01:13:40,500
How will you pay me?

924
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,667
I guess it's a tricky
situation you're in, too.

925
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:55,042
I think they're plotting
something to get rid of you.

926
01:13:59,084 --> 01:14:00,792
Just this much...

927
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:03,417
I got your back.

928
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,334
Yes, chief director.

929
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,959
Yes, she says she'll
travel far tomorrow.

930
01:14:27,709 --> 01:14:28,625
Right.

931
01:14:29,084 --> 01:14:31,500
Yes, sir. Thank you.

932
01:14:37,417 --> 01:14:38,584
Hey, Mr. Jo.

933
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,334
It's me.

934
01:14:41,959 --> 01:14:43,500
Did you delete my number?

935
01:14:43,834 --> 01:14:46,042
She will travel far tomorrow.

936
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:47,959
I'll text you, follow me.

937
01:14:48,709 --> 01:14:51,250
Just do as I say, will you?

938
01:14:51,334 --> 01:14:53,292
He's such a loser.

939
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,167
Detective Shin.

940
01:14:58,542 --> 01:15:01,209
I'm going out of town
with Ha tomorrow morning.

941
01:15:02,292 --> 01:15:03,750
I'll call you before I leave.

942
01:15:09,834 --> 01:15:12,167
Ah, this is messy.

943
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:39,875
Prepare the GPS.

944
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:43,292
Good morning to you, too!

945
01:15:43,834 --> 01:15:46,792
810-1 Gaegok-ri, Gimpo, Gyeonggi-do.

946
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:48,750
MT. GEUMGANG, HWAJONG TEMPLE

947
01:16:48,834 --> 01:16:51,209
Wow, the air is so fresh!

948
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:57,792
You stay here.

949
01:16:58,834 --> 01:16:59,834
Sure.

950
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:01,709
See you.

951
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:19,375
Can I help you?

952
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:21,667
Hello.

953
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:24,125
Can I ask you something?

954
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,250
Sure, go ahead.

955
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:27,917
Do you know this man?

956
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:30,834
I'm afraid I don't.

957
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:31,250
The mountain pass is rough
to come all the way up here.

958
01:18:31,334 --> 01:18:33,917
So there must be a
good reason you're here.

959
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:36,542
Ma'am,

960
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:40,375
may I ask your name?

961
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:42,042
I'm Ha Su-yeong.

962
01:18:42,959 --> 01:18:44,042
I see.

963
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:58,625
Lieutenant Lim came here
many times before he died.

964
01:18:59,834 --> 01:19:01,834
If Ha Su-yeong ever comes here...

965
01:19:04,292 --> 01:19:06,334
he asked me to give her this.

966
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:14,167
SEAL CERTIFICATE
HWANG JEONG-MI

967
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:29,209
SEALED, HWANG JEONG-MI

968
01:21:59,292 --> 01:22:00,709
You surprise me.

969
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:04,709
What?

970
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,625
I'm impressed.

971
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:10,459
Impressed about what?

972
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,750
You really don't ask me anything.

973
01:22:15,084 --> 01:22:16,042
Well,

974
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,167
I promised you, didn't I?

975
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:21,709
Yes.

976
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:23,542
You promised.

977
01:22:41,084 --> 01:22:42,250
What is that?

978
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:44,209
What is that guy?

979
01:22:46,834 --> 01:22:47,959
Just run him over.

980
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:49,209
Are you nuts?

981
01:22:53,292 --> 01:22:54,334
Damn it.

982
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:37,500
You stabbed me right in the back.

983
01:23:38,209 --> 01:23:39,875
Not Andy!

984
01:23:41,084 --> 01:23:42,625
I told the chief director.

985
01:23:45,584 --> 01:23:47,042
No commission for you.

986
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:53,875
Damn it!

987
01:23:55,459 --> 01:23:57,250
Holy shit, Ha Su-yeong.

988
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:59,125
What brings you here?

989
01:23:59,709 --> 01:24:01,250
I missed you so freaking much.

990
01:24:02,209 --> 01:24:03,334
So...

991
01:24:04,042 --> 01:24:05,417
Enjoyed your little hike?

992
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:08,334
Found anything good?

993
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:09,667
Hwang Jeong-mi.

994
01:24:10,209 --> 01:24:11,250
"Hwang Jeong-mi"?

995
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:13,167
Hold on.

996
01:24:14,042 --> 01:24:15,667
Hwang Jeong-mi? Who is she?

997
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:18,042
Oh, you mean her.

998
01:24:18,834 --> 01:24:19,834
Her...

999
01:24:22,042 --> 01:24:23,042
Are you sure?

1000
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:27,000
If you're so sure, why
don't you bring her here?

1001
01:24:27,084 --> 01:24:28,209
You're all talk.

1002
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:30,750
Just get this over with.

1003
01:24:35,542 --> 01:24:38,084
Have you ever hit someone's
head with a full swing?

1004
01:24:44,084 --> 01:24:44,917
Wow.

1005
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:47,625
The lady doesn't even flinch.

1006
01:24:53,417 --> 01:24:54,584
What are you doing?

1007
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,334
Trying to kill her?

1008
01:24:56,417 --> 01:24:59,250
- I'm calling the police.
- That stupid piece of shit.

1009
01:25:05,959 --> 01:25:06,959
A home run.

1010
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:53,917
Goddammit.

1011
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:56,042
To hell with it!

1012
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:07,084
Jesus! You scared the hell out of me.

1013
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,209
Why you...

1014
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:12,000
What the hell?

1015
01:26:13,292 --> 01:26:14,125
- Out.
- Hey!

1016
01:26:14,209 --> 01:26:15,542
- Hey!
- Get out!

1017
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:17,250
She's running away!

1018
01:26:17,334 --> 01:26:19,042
- Open the damn door!
- Hey! She's running away.

1019
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:20,167
Step away.

1020
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,917
Lose her and you don't
get paid, you shitheads!

1021
01:26:24,292 --> 01:26:25,459
You're not paying?

1022
01:26:26,209 --> 01:26:28,750
Are you kidding me, you piece of shit?

1023
01:26:30,917 --> 01:26:32,792
I'll pay, damn it.

1024
01:26:33,792 --> 01:26:35,667
I said, I'll pay!

1025
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:37,625
I'll pay you, you asshole!

1026
01:26:37,709 --> 01:26:39,542
Go get Ha Su-yeong!

1027
01:26:39,917 --> 01:26:41,750
- Goddammit!
- Hey.

1028
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:43,375
Let's go.

1029
01:26:51,042 --> 01:26:52,834
You jackass, why aren't you going?

1030
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:56,625
Get up and go!

1031
01:26:58,709 --> 01:26:59,667
Run!

1032
01:27:00,292 --> 01:27:02,167
I said, run, you shithead!

1033
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:05,459
How did I end up with these morons?

1034
01:27:05,542 --> 01:27:07,375
Fuck.

1035
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:21,375
What?

1036
01:27:22,042 --> 01:27:23,000
Dude.

1037
01:27:24,042 --> 01:27:26,417
- I can't walk anymore.
- What are you doing?

1038
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:29,417
- Come on!
- You jackass.

1039
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,417
Slow down, will you?

1040
01:27:40,417 --> 01:27:42,334
That annoying shit.

1041
01:27:42,417 --> 01:27:43,375
Hey!

1042
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:45,292
Hey, you!

1043
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:46,625
You, get out.

1044
01:27:47,084 --> 01:27:48,250
Get out!

1045
01:27:49,459 --> 01:27:50,625
Shit.

1046
01:27:51,209 --> 01:27:52,209
God...

1047
01:27:52,917 --> 01:27:54,000
Damn it!

1048
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,625
Shit.

1049
01:27:56,709 --> 01:27:58,042
- You!
- Back off!

1050
01:27:58,125 --> 01:28:01,042
- Back off, you asshole!
- What did you say?

1051
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:03,042
You piece of shit.

1052
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:04,709
Get out, damn it!

1053
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:06,459
Shit.

1054
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:10,709
Huh?

1055
01:28:11,334 --> 01:28:12,250
Hey!

1056
01:28:13,542 --> 01:28:15,375
Hey, you!

1057
01:28:15,834 --> 01:28:17,917
Hey, Shin! Get over here.

1058
01:28:18,292 --> 01:28:19,584
Detective Shin!

1059
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:26,167
Damn it, my battery's out.

1060
01:28:27,209 --> 01:28:28,875
I told you to stop playing games.

1061
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:35,375
Where the hell is she?

1062
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:36,959
What is this?

1063
01:28:37,459 --> 01:28:40,125
You're staying out of this,
and sent Andy instead?

1064
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,375
Andy screwed up big time, again.

1065
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:46,042
You take care of things.

1066
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:47,167
No can do.

1067
01:28:47,917 --> 01:28:49,459
Then why are you there?

1068
01:28:50,459 --> 01:28:52,542
This is way above my pay grade.

1069
01:28:53,042 --> 01:28:54,000
Jesus.

1070
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,875
Unless you want to end
up like Lim, take care of this.

1071
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:07,334
So this is where you
buried Hwang Jeong-mi?

1072
01:29:10,834 --> 01:29:13,167
Wow, you people are incredible.

1073
01:29:14,084 --> 01:29:15,209
So Lieutenant Lim

1074
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:18,584
found out about this place, right?

1075
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:21,000
And now I do, too.

1076
01:29:22,834 --> 01:29:24,167
What are you going to do with me?

1077
01:29:25,334 --> 01:29:26,792
Make me "kill myself"?

1078
01:29:28,334 --> 01:29:29,709
Listen, Shin Dong-ho.

1079
01:29:31,334 --> 01:29:33,125
You and I are buddies.

1080
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:35,875
What?

1081
01:29:39,209 --> 01:29:40,667
Holy shit.

1082
01:29:49,334 --> 01:29:50,292
Shit.

1083
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,625
Detective Shin.

1084
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,750
Bring Madam Jeong
over here. That little shit.

1085
01:30:06,542 --> 01:30:07,542
Come on.

1086
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:10,417
Where do you find these amateur losers?

1087
01:30:12,584 --> 01:30:14,584
Do you even have money to pay them?

1088
01:30:14,959 --> 01:30:16,542
What's it to you, asshole?

1089
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:19,084
I have the goddamn money.

1090
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:22,625
After I take care of this,

1091
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:25,292
I was going to ask my sister.

1092
01:30:25,917 --> 01:30:28,042
Seriously, is this for real?

1093
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:33,542
Who knew, the great
Andy would hit rock bottom?

1094
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:36,709
Enough with the crap, just go get her!

1095
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:38,250
You shithead!

1096
01:30:38,959 --> 01:30:41,167
How the hell did you even come here?

1097
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:45,625
I came to clean up the
shit you made, you asshole.

1098
01:30:47,459 --> 01:30:49,792
You goddamn cop.

1099
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:51,500
Are you freaking kidding me?

1100
01:30:52,042 --> 01:30:54,625
You couldn't look me in the
eye when Lim was around,

1101
01:30:54,709 --> 01:30:56,292
you low-level scum!

1102
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:58,000
Don't mess with me!

1103
01:31:10,542 --> 01:31:11,667
Shit.

1104
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,084
It's quiet around here.

1105
01:31:19,209 --> 01:31:20,917
You can die from an accident.

1106
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:24,167
Hey, what the hell?

1107
01:31:25,042 --> 01:31:27,375
Come on, damn it!

1108
01:31:27,792 --> 01:31:28,709
Hey!

1109
01:31:28,792 --> 01:31:31,834
Dude, Dong-ho! We're on the same side!

1110
01:31:42,625 --> 01:31:45,125
You're pretty gun-shy, aren't you?

1111
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:50,500
Just pray at least one of
them makes it out in one piece.

1112
01:31:54,917 --> 01:31:56,834
Goddammit.

1113
01:32:33,667 --> 01:32:35,542
You don't want to die, do you?

1114
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:39,917
Then say nothing, see
nothing, and stay put.

1115
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:42,334
Buckle up.

1116
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:43,917
You're in deep shit.

1117
01:32:47,792 --> 01:32:50,667
What do you like so much
about Ha Su-yeong, anyway?

1118
01:32:56,292 --> 01:32:57,500
Everything.

1119
01:33:10,334 --> 01:33:11,500
Damn it.

1120
01:33:15,584 --> 01:33:16,625
Die!

1121
01:33:44,167 --> 01:33:45,792
Hold on.

1122
01:34:01,625 --> 01:34:02,625
Huh?

1123
01:34:13,584 --> 01:34:14,709
Now keep your promise.

1124
01:34:15,125 --> 01:34:16,084
I don't.

1125
01:34:17,209 --> 01:34:18,417
I don't have the money.

1126
01:34:23,959 --> 01:34:25,334
Wow, Ha Su-yeong.

1127
01:34:26,209 --> 01:34:27,709
You're amazing.

1128
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:31,334
I never imagined you'd fight so well!

1129
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:33,625
Too bad,

1130
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:35,000
it all ends here.

1131
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:37,334
Drop that baton.

1132
01:34:42,125 --> 01:34:43,334
Easy does it.

1133
01:34:54,709 --> 01:34:59,042
You barely made it out of the
woods, but you're going back now.

1134
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:02,542
Detective Shin!

1135
01:35:03,292 --> 01:35:04,709
Come on, now.

1136
01:35:05,209 --> 01:35:06,292
Get back in.

1137
01:35:06,959 --> 01:35:07,917
Come on.

1138
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,417
- Get back in?
- Asshole!

1139
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,625
Really? You want a hole in your head?

1140
01:35:19,834 --> 01:35:20,792
So...

1141
01:35:21,792 --> 01:35:24,542
I guess it has come to this.
What are you going to do?

1142
01:35:27,584 --> 01:35:28,584
What's funny?

1143
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:31,084
Huh?

1144
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:33,417
Hey, whoa!

1145
01:35:34,917 --> 01:35:36,459
Stop!

1146
01:35:36,542 --> 01:35:38,917
Okay, let's wrap this up.

1147
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,292
What's that asshole doing here?

1148
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:43,542
What's with the gun? Let's be civil.

1149
01:35:44,334 --> 01:35:47,459
The chief and Grace aren't
here. It's just us, come on.

1150
01:35:47,542 --> 01:35:49,500
Hey, Jo? What are you doing?

1151
01:35:49,709 --> 01:35:50,750
I'm filming.

1152
01:35:50,834 --> 01:35:52,209
- For what?
- Proof.

1153
01:35:52,292 --> 01:35:53,500
What proof?

1154
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:57,375
Holy shit!

1155
01:35:57,459 --> 01:35:59,625
Goddammit!

1156
01:36:00,417 --> 01:36:01,334
What the hell?

1157
01:36:01,917 --> 01:36:02,875
My finger!

1158
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:07,375
Why did you have to
make everything worse?

1159
01:36:08,542 --> 01:36:10,250
Damnit!

1160
01:36:15,834 --> 01:36:17,084
Okay, fine.

1161
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:18,542
Ha Su-yeong.

1162
01:36:20,709 --> 01:36:22,709
Seriously, this is your last chance.

1163
01:36:23,209 --> 01:36:24,209
Listen carefully.

1164
01:36:25,584 --> 01:36:26,917
Promise us

1165
01:36:27,542 --> 01:36:30,667
that from now on, you'll
never show up again.

1166
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:32,250
And you can go home.

1167
01:36:34,042 --> 01:36:35,959
I don't want to shoot someone.

1168
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,209
I promise you, I won't shoot.

1169
01:36:40,292 --> 01:36:41,292
I...

1170
01:36:41,834 --> 01:36:44,500
I'll talk it out with Grace.

1171
01:36:44,584 --> 01:36:46,334
Hey, Andy. How is it going to be?

1172
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:50,084
What do you mean, you shithead?

1173
01:36:50,167 --> 01:36:53,500
Enough with that crap,
just get this baton...

1174
01:36:58,959 --> 01:36:59,917
You asshole!

1175
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,459
- Goddammit!
- That little shit.

1176
01:37:01,792 --> 01:37:03,000
An accident.

1177
01:37:03,084 --> 01:37:04,417
Come on.

1178
01:37:04,834 --> 01:37:07,167
Come on, man. Okay.

1179
01:37:08,667 --> 01:37:10,375
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

1180
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:14,042
I'll back off. I'll...

1181
01:37:14,125 --> 01:37:17,084
I'll back off, from Ha Su-yeong.

1182
01:37:17,167 --> 01:37:18,209
For real.

1183
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:19,375
You hear that?

1184
01:37:20,459 --> 01:37:22,792
You won't get your money,
but you'll make it out alive.

1185
01:37:43,417 --> 01:37:45,709
Just shoot her already, you jackass!

1186
01:37:45,792 --> 01:37:47,375
Shut the hell up!

1187
01:37:51,667 --> 01:37:53,959
Goddammit.

1188
01:37:54,584 --> 01:37:56,334
Damnit!

1189
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:59,542
Are you in love?

1190
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,625
Are you freaking in love?

1191
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:05,375
Why did you even bring
a gun, you dickhead?

1192
01:38:05,459 --> 01:38:06,792
You bastard!

1193
01:38:32,125 --> 01:38:33,167
Call your sister.

1194
01:38:34,042 --> 01:38:36,334
Tell her you're taken
hostage, trying to kill me.

1195
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:56,792
Hey, sis.

1196
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:02,000
Something came up.

1197
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:04,959
This is Ha Su-yeong.

1198
01:39:05,917 --> 01:39:08,917
Bring me my money, and
get your brother yourself.

1199
01:39:09,667 --> 01:39:11,334
At the yard of Hwajong Temple.

1200
01:39:12,209 --> 01:39:13,334
Come alone.

1201
01:39:21,459 --> 01:39:23,750
Shin Dong-ho, it's the
end of the road for you.

1202
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,000
- Hey, Mr. Jo.
- Yes.

1203
01:39:28,375 --> 01:39:30,000
Get him treated.

1204
01:39:30,375 --> 01:39:32,167
But my finger...

1205
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:37,167
Okay, fine.

1206
01:39:38,417 --> 01:39:39,584
Damn it.

1207
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:43,125
Hey, get up. You goddamn cop.

1208
01:39:43,209 --> 01:39:45,417
You asshole! Goddammit.

1209
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,209
Why did you have to bring a gun?

1210
01:39:48,667 --> 01:39:51,834
But I have to find my freaking finger!

1211
01:39:59,834 --> 01:40:01,792
Girl!

1212
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:05,500
I knew you would come through, damn it!

1213
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:07,750
Madam Jeong.

1214
01:40:11,042 --> 01:40:12,209
You stay.

1215
01:40:14,459 --> 01:40:15,375
Get up!

1216
01:40:16,042 --> 01:40:17,417
Get up!

1217
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:21,917
Why me, again?

1218
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:27,542
Hold on, damn it!

1219
01:40:32,042 --> 01:40:34,584
- Go in further.
- He's so damn heavy!

1220
01:40:42,334 --> 01:40:44,250
Don't touch here!

1221
01:40:46,209 --> 01:40:49,875
Don't touch here! It's my broken bone!

1222
01:40:51,042 --> 01:40:52,292
You can go now.

1223
01:40:53,625 --> 01:40:55,625
What about the deed?

1224
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:58,834
We'll sort it out in Seoul.

1225
01:41:05,542 --> 01:41:06,625
Damn it.

1226
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:15,250
Are you alone, like we promised?

1227
01:42:17,042 --> 01:42:18,875
All alone, like we promised.

1228
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:52,750
Seriously!

1229
01:43:16,334 --> 01:43:17,250
Shit.

1230
01:43:18,875 --> 01:43:19,917
Seriously!

1231
01:43:24,209 --> 01:43:26,250
Goddammit.

1232
01:43:51,042 --> 01:43:52,709
Why you...

1233
01:43:57,084 --> 01:43:58,709
You're driving me nuts!

1234
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:09,709
How can you screw up my
life with everything you do?

1235
01:44:11,959 --> 01:44:13,500
Whose life did I screw up?

1236
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:17,042
Tell me, whose life?

1237
01:44:18,167 --> 01:44:19,750
Then who screwed up mine?

1238
01:44:20,792 --> 01:44:22,000
What about my life?

1239
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:26,250
What about my damn life?

1240
01:44:31,334 --> 01:44:32,292
Mom.

1241
01:44:42,792 --> 01:44:43,917
Mom.

1242
01:44:47,459 --> 01:44:48,459
Mom...

1243
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:50,625
don't leave me.

1244
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:53,750
I did everything.

1245
01:44:54,709 --> 01:44:56,084
Everything you told me!

1246
01:44:56,542 --> 01:44:58,250
I did everything you told me to do!

1247
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:01,917
I did everything, damn it!
Don't leave me.

1248
01:45:04,417 --> 01:45:05,625
Damn it.

1249
01:45:06,167 --> 01:45:07,792
Don't leave me.

1250
01:45:07,875 --> 01:45:08,875
Please don't.

1251
01:45:09,459 --> 01:45:10,625
Don't leave me.

1252
01:45:44,334 --> 01:45:45,500
Hey, Ha Su-yeong!

1253
01:45:46,334 --> 01:45:49,459
Consider yourself dead
from now on. You got it?

1254
01:45:50,125 --> 01:45:52,667
I'm going to find you
one way or another,

1255
01:45:53,084 --> 01:45:56,250
and kill you, you piece of shit!

1256
01:46:05,917 --> 01:46:07,542
I still have two bullets left.

1257
01:46:15,917 --> 01:46:17,042
I promise you.

1258
01:46:18,334 --> 01:46:20,792
If you don't ever come looking for us,

1259
01:46:22,417 --> 01:46:24,084
we'll forget all about you.

1260
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:27,792
Let's put an end to this.

1261
01:46:29,667 --> 01:46:30,625
Andy.

1262
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:32,584
That means you, too.

1263
01:46:39,167 --> 01:46:40,209
Fine.

1264
01:46:43,709 --> 01:46:44,709
It ends here.

1265
01:46:45,375 --> 01:46:46,375
The end.

1266
01:46:48,042 --> 01:46:50,959
I will not use your
unfortunate past against you,

1267
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:54,792
