We’re drinking alone in
my empty house.

187
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,777
This is a done deal so
don’t do anything stupid.

188
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,154
Anything stupid?

189
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,781
- Like what?
- Say, call the girl’s father and...

190
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:16,699
Mr. Lee?

191
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,994
I was thinking about
bonking your daughter.

192
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,412
Yes. sir.

193
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,247
Your daughter agreed to it

194
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,624
and we’re just waiting for
your confirmation.

195
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:25,750
You won’t.

196
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:26,709
Right.

197
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,544
Game over. Unless...

198
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,755
Everything was set but..

199
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,012
YOU MET HIM IN THE CLUB?
YOU'RE IN HIS HOUSE?

200
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,723
I don't understand one thing about
these girls. They’ll do anything they want

201
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,850
but won’t let their friends do it.

202
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,101
This is a crisis.

203
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,021
Maintain focus at all cost.

204
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,024
You mustn’t panic.
Now it's time..

205
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,318
for the final blow.

206
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,451
I want to hold you in my arms.

207
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,121
She was shocked

208
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,539
She can’t believe her ears.

209
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,874
She’s dumbstruck!
Astonished!

210
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,292
And this is the moment

211
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,794
Now is the correct time to take a move.

212
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,629
Before she could think of anything

213
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,130

What do men do when
they’re new to an environment?

216
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,074
They search for women.

217
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,951
It doesn’t mean much.

218
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,454
It’s just natural for young
hearts to beat faster for girls.

Yes, I’m fine.

I’m worried your shoulder
might be dislocated.

225
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,023
No, I’m fine. Really.

226
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,567
But I feel really bad.

Today we will start a
new chapter in economics.

230
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,493
The new college for me was perfect.

231
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,204
I will devote myself
with academic pursuits

232
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,623
and did my best for better marks.

233
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,127
I got good offers in
campus interviews.

234
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,256

Dong-woo has a clear goal.

254

I will accept it as a part of the process

but I was disappointed that
the welcome party for intellectuals

275
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,586

00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,182
Okay!

740
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:12,808
Ok.

741
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,561
I’ll see you tomorrow.

742
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,690
You really have
nothing to do.

743
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:20,358
Yup.

744
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,360
You don’t have to
come anymore.

745
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,402
I will.

746
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,536
I’m not that innocent,
you know.

747
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,663
Don’t try anything.

748
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,916
Don't be misunderstood

749
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,376
When did I say that you're innocent?

750
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,338
You go now, we will meet tomorrow

751
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,007
Okay.

752
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:47,343
Okay.

753
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,805
We got really late.

754
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,978
You haven’t paid
this month’s tuition.

755
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,729
Oh! Yes, it's pending right.

756
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,064
I’ll get it to you next week.

757
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,483
I promise.
- Alright. Alright.

758
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,068
Why are you sneaking in?

759
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,362
Just like that.

760
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,456
Are you done?
I’m on my way home.

761
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:29,969
Yup.
I’ll text you when I go to bed.

762
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,346
Throw in a smiley and ‘lol’.

763
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,597
What’s there to think about?

764
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,765
Do you mind?

765
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,226
What’s wrong with you?

766
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,524
So, you’re going out with her?

767
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,567
With who?

768
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,902
Your text.
It seems like you are.

769
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,696
I text your brother, understood?

770
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,575
Why are you dating my brother?
Who the girl?

771
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,369
Doesn't matter. Go away.

772
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,131
What’s up, big man?
- You're here.

773
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,216
Why didn’t you call me?

774
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,676
I’m just dropping off some
food that mom made.

775
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,221
She’s worried you might starve.

776
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,390
Just tell her to stay away
from my account.

777
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,060
She needed it for the twins.

778
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,564
She cried a lot, you know.

779
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,151
I know mom
can be inconsiderate

780
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,946
but shouldn’t you at least ask
how things are at home?

781
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,115
Well,

782
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,285
comics are more important to you
than mom.

783
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,078
Look, don't bore me.

784
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,455
After dad went to jail

785
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,082
Our family needed you the most.

786
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,793
You don’t have to
go to college to draw.

787
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,003
You’re right.

788
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:51,550
But if I give up now, I’m afraid
I’ll never pursue that dream again.

789
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,512
I’m not saying you should
give up college.

790
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,180
I’m sorry, man.

791
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,473
How are you doing.

792
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,058
I’m going to military academy.

793
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,228
Mom tells me to go to law school

794
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,562
but forget that.

795
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,855
Who’s going to pay for that?

796
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,283
Are you asleep?

- Sir
- Hmm

800
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,301
I have a question for you.

801
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:35,719
Fire away.

802
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:36,971
Come on!

803
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,598
How do you become a director?

804
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,435
By shooting a movie.

805
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,312
That’ll make you a director.

806
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,606
How do you shoot a movie?

807
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,237
Actors act. Then, I shoot it
with a camera.

808
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:58,534
Actually, I don’t.
The DOP shoots them.

809
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:03,330
If somethings wrong,
I’ll ask them to do another take.

810
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,709
Then eventually, you have a movie.

811
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,840
It’s a job with incredible stress.

812
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,091
You understood that?

813
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,636
Director, come here. The set is ready.

814
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:18,679
Okay.

815
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,641
You want to make a movie?

816
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:24,977
Well...

817
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,148
Don’t. It’s tough.

818
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,526
You have a good figure.
Be a model.

819
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,153
Actually, don’t.
That’s tough, too.

820
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,655
Just open a shop.
No, don’t.

821
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,450
Running a small business
is tough.

822
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,619
If you can, be a business tycoon.

823
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,370
The government
treats you sweetly.

824
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,957
Understood?
You can marry actresses.

825
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,167
Divorce them.

826
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,668
Then, marry another.

827
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,463
Then repeat the process. That's good idea.

828
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,883
Director! I asked you to come!

829
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,801
I am coming.

832

Do this, do that.

835
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,069

What do you want me to do?

842
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,213
This way.
- Alright.

00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,466
Awesome.

855

Investment is all about analysis.

856
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,177
Her boyfriend rarely
calls or texts her.

857
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,931
She spends most of her time
in the club room.

858
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:26,765
Thus,

859
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,267
she spends it with me.

860
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,061
We both like
the same food.

861
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,854
Thus,

862
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,522
She eats with me.

863
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,985
She loves comedies.
I do, too.

864
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:38,902
Thus,

865
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,654

00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,373
How long have you been
with your boyfriend?

870
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,667
A little over 2 years.

871
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,209
Why?

872
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,049
Thanks.

873
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,384
You need rational judgment.

874
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:06,472
Never invest in something
that you can’t understand.

875
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,641
But I can understand this.

876
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,062

of my heart into this.

Why aren’t you eating?

Have some, mom.

I like duck.

Next time, get duck instead.

905
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,748
Mom, why did you have
so many kids?

906
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,959
First, I had you.

907
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,503
But you were ugly
like your dad.

908
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,922
So, I had Dong-won.

909
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,509
He was cute like me.

910
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,722
Then, I wanted a daughter.

911
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,641
So, we decided to have
another one.

00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,935

Never mind her.
Eat your chicken.

I stopped having more
ever since our bankruptcy.

00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,319
That was a stroke of
good luck.

but I’m quite happy.

01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:21,890
Learn the business.
Earn some money, too.

1469
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,517
This is an opportunity.

1470
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:26,519

1471
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:30,899

1472
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:36,780

[Sobs]

1474
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:45,789
Tears won’t come out.

1475
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:54,047
It’s not really something
you can cry about.

1476
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:58,676
I can always draw
on my own time.

1477
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:03,473
I mean it’s not like
my parents died

1478
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,351
or we lost our country.

1479
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,479
I guess you're doing right.

1480
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,233
Anyways, you’re back, Chi-ho.

1481
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:15,944
Keep one thing in mind.

1482
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:18,905
Don’t have sex in front of me.

1483
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,406
What the hell, man?

1484
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:21,866
Don’t get pregnant either.

1485
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:22,867
You're crossing your limit.

1486
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:24,911
Don’t even look happy.
I got dumped.

1487
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:25,829
She dumped you?

1488
01:25:26,037 --> 01:25:27,122
Big time.

1489
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:29,749
What’s really pathetic?

1490
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,920
is that my heart’s broken.

1491
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,798
The three of you
remind me of

1492
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:39,467
Dumb and Dumber

1493
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:42,262
and Dumb again.

1494
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:43,263
Pour me a shot.

1495
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:44,430
- No!
- No!

1496
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,683
You started drinking
in high school.

1497
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:49,978
I’m done with my SATs.
Don’t I deserve one drink?

1498
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:51,604
No.

1499
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:53,189
Never.

1500
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:58,444
Why does it feel so...

1501
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:00,572
empty?

1502
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:04,534
People say how golden
this point in life is.

1503
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:06,369
How so?

1504
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:10,707
I don't understand that what's
happening here is right or not?

1505
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,376
I get confused by all this.

1506
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:16,379
At least you’re screwing
your best friend’s ex.

1507
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:18,214
Shut the hell up.

1508
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:19,757
Shut the hell up. [Funny tone]

1509
01:26:20,049 --> 01:26:20,884
Stupid.

1510
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,178
I’m letting you off ‘cause of Dong-woo.

1511
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:23,970
What did I do?

1512
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:25,555
I don’t want your pity.

1513
01:26:26,806 --> 01:26:28,224
You’re all annoying.

1514
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:31,686
It was going to be a celebration
if it wasn’t for you.

1515
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,730
You’re the biggest idiot
come to think about it.

1516
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,899
I’m no competition to you.

1517
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:36,649
Idiots.

1518
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:38,943
At least I’m not screwing
my best friend’s ex.

1519
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,361
Can you stop saying that?

1520
01:26:40,486 --> 01:26:42,614
Whatever. You’re screwing
your ex’s best friend.

1521
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:43,698
You're really bad.

1522
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:45,742
You’ve gone too far, man.

1523
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:47,577
They’re the one’s screwing here.

1524
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:49,913
Will you stop using that word?

1525
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:51,414
See? We’re too
superficial.

1526
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,875
Great. This is just great.

1527
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:56,544
You’re no better.
You did screw his ex.

1528
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:58,296
Don't get me involved into this.

1529
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:01,049
Stop! At least he’s not
masturbating anymore.

1530
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:01,716
What? [Everyone shocked]

1531
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:05,136
Get up! The party is over.

1533
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:10,975
What are you doing? Careful.

1534
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:12,101
What are you doing?

1535
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:14,896
Why are you breaking things over here.

1536
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:16,522
Stop it! Stop it!

1537
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:18,691
Don’t do that.

1538
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:23,613
Even I don't like these things.

1539
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:26,449
But it’s my job.

1540
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:28,076
I wouldn't come if you
complete your promise.

1541
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:29,244
But what can I do?

1542
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:32,080
I can’t quit my job in this economy.

1543
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:34,165
Get out before I call the cops.

1544
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,292
Get the hell out,
you thugs!

1545
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:39,712
- Beautiful voice
- Go inside.

1546
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:41,965
Let’s take this outside.

1547
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:45,385
I’m just here to do my job.

1548
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:47,595
So let’s settle it.

1549
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:50,181
I have a crush on your wife.

1550
01:27:50,473 --> 01:27:51,266
She’s hot.

1551
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,434
I’d like to date her.

1552
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:56,062
I’m not saying you should
give her to me.

1553
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:59,607
I’m only asking for a fair chance
to compete with you.

1554
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:04,112
I’ll write off your interest
and leave your business alone.

1555
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,156
That’s it!

1556
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:10,285
Honey.

1557
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:12,412
Let’s get out of here.

1558
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:15,164
Let’s just go, okay?

1559
01:28:16,499 --> 01:28:17,166
Go inside.

1560
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:19,043
But honey...

01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:19,961

a trained master of Taekwondo,

from making dough.

This man who’s been hiding
his wild instinct for his family

1565
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,658
is about to explode.

1566
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,495
I’ve been timely on the
interest payments.

1567
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:56,622
I understand your point.

1568
01:28:56,789 --> 01:28:59,167
My father poured his life
into this restaurant.

1569
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:02,003
I can’t just leave.
Please.

1570
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:06,507
You scared me!

1571
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:07,967
I thought you lost it!

1572
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:09,802
The duty of youth

1573
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:13,639
is to challenge corruption.

1574
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:17,643
Trash it. Trash everything!

1575
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:20,146
Shut your mouth
otherwise I will break it.

1576
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:25,568
Leave them.

1577
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:29,280
Just let them stay here.

as soon as I took off.

1580

I was going to stop him.

01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:22,294
but couldn't fulfill it.

1647
01:37:29,635 --> 01:37:33,264
and proved everyone wrong
by sticking after 3 days.

1648
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:34,723
Is everything ready?

1649
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:35,599
Yes, sir!

Why is your scores so less?

1652
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:03,210
Leave it.

1653
01:38:04,086 --> 01:38:05,504
I’m in college. Whatever.

1654
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:07,965
A college student doesn't study?

1655
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:14,179
I lost all my money
on stock trading.

1656
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:16,056
Thank god, it was only cyber money.

1657
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:17,725
So I didn't lose a lot of money.

Do you want to take the wheel?
- Yes, sir.

1662

Countless trials and errors
lie ahead of us

1663
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:38,245
but we can go back
if we take the wrong turn.

1664

I guess that’s why people call it
the good times.

You’ve got a draft notice.

1667
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:50,049
What’s the matter?

1668
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:51,842
I heard it’s like camp.

1669
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:54,845
That sounds like fun.

1670
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:57,264
You applied to
go together, right?

1671
01:38:57,431 --> 01:38:58,432
With Chi-ho and Dong-woo?

1672

1675
01:39:17,493 --> 01:39:22,373
I’m leaving... With my friends.

1676
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:28,003
We decided to go on a cross country hike
a week before the army.

1677
01:39:28,337 --> 01:39:32,466
Walking to the training base
felt like a cool thing to do.

1678
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:36,512
I told you
it was a stupid idea.

1679
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:38,806
Is this cool to you?

1680
01:39:40,015 --> 01:39:42,393
We’ll pass out before we even arrive.
Do you feel cool?

1681
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,895
How much more do I need to walk.

1682
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:48,065
I thought I will relax next month.

1683

This country has
forsaken me.

Ditto man.

1685
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:56,699
Despite everything,
I will not feel bitter.

Okay. Let’s go.
We have to cross many other tasks.

1690
01:40:09,086 --> 01:40:11,672
Yeah! Let’s do it!

1691
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,926
