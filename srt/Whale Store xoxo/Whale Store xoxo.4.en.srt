1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,840
<i>Som, do you think…</i>

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,640
I have feelings for Maewnam?

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,520
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>if she likes women or men yet.</i>

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,560
<i>- Then you have to check.</i>
- Smells good, huh?

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,360
Someone's inviting you
to a "Som Tam reconciliation party."

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,360
<i>I'll just pretend to be drunk</i>
<i>and fall asleep,</i>

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,960
<i>so I don't have to answer questions.</i>

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,880
<i>Wan.</i>

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,560
I like you.

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,520
<i>There's this theory that says</i>

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,480
<i>if you're not sure how you feel</i>
<i>about someone right in front of you,</i>

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,160
<i>try hugging them.</i>

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,120
<i>But for some people,</i>
<i>it might go as far as a kiss.</i>

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,360
I'm drunk.

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,880
Wan?

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,720
Wan?

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,080
Wan?

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,040
Did you even realize what you did?

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,560
I'm shy, you know.

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,880
Wan.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,560
I'll head home then.

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,600
What did I just do?!

23
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,520
I almost died holding my breath!

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,840
<i>Four blessings will increase.</i>

25
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,320
<i>Longevity, beauty,</i>
<i>happiness, and strength.</i>

26
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,120
I was just planning to nap for a bit.

27
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,040
<i>Is she going to bring up last night?</i>

28
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,880
<i>If she asks what happened,</i>
<i>what should I even say?</i>

29
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,360
<i>I guess I'll have to say…</i>

30
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,640
- Well, Maewnam…
- Last night…

31
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,600
everyone didn't clean up.

32
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,600
They got so wasted
they couldn't even go home,

33
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,880
so I had to send them home and planned
to come clean up early this morning.

34
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,560
I didn't think someone who was drunk
would wake up this early though.

35
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,720
Oh, right, usually when I drink alcohol,
I end up waking up early.

36
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,160
Oh, really?

37
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,040
Maewnam, don't.

38
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,280
Just put that there.

39
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,640
No, Wan. We need to sort the trash, okay?

40
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,520
There is food waste, bottles,
glass, plastic, and cans.

41
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,920
They all need to be separated.

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,800
I meant just leave it there.
I'll take care of it.

43
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh. I thought you meant
I didn't have to sort the trash.

44
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,120
Actually, most people think
there's no point in sorting trash

45
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,800
because garbage collectors
just mix it all together anyway.

46
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,640
But honestly, I don't think that's true.

47
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,320
I knew someone
who's been at it for ten years

48
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,120
but still hasn't been made
permanent staff.

49
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,480
Their salary's super low.

50
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,600
Maybe even lower than the minimum wage.

51
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Well…

52
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,920
<i>Should I tell her</i>
<i>I wasn't drunk last night?</i>

53
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,120
Actually,

54
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,480
I wasn't drunk.

55
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,920
Eh?

56
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,680
What was that, Wan?

57
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,000
Nothing.

58
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,080
Once I'm done cleaning,
can I use the bathroom?

59
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,360
Do I need to say it again?

60
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,320
Courage doesn't come around often.

61
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,600
Ugh!

62
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,920
You're leaving already?

63
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,000
- Is it hot?
- Huh?

64
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, right.

65
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,120
I was just cleaning up,
so yeah, I got a bit hot.

66
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,800
Hot, like summer?

67
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,560
I thought you meant cute.

68
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,560
So, am I pretty yet?

69
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,920
Yes, you are.

70
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,240
Are you sure?

71
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,880
You're not lying like last night, are you?

72
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
Last night?

73
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,960
I know you weren't really
asleep last night.

74
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,960
I'm heading out.

75
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,200
I have a morning meeting.

76
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,920
I'll be back to talk to you again tonight.

77
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,960
Bye-bye.

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,280
How wicked.

79
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,320
She knew I was pretending to be sleeping.

80
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,520
Now what?

81
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,680
Pinky. Am I pretty yet?

82
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,280
You're pretty.

83
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,840
Babe, can you do my mascara?

84
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,200
My hands are shaking.
I only slept for two hours.

85
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,400
Okay.

86
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,040
But why did you go to bed so late?

87
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,280
Well, my mom went out drinking
with her friends until 4:00 a.m.

88
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
She came back
and totally puked everywhere.

89
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,800
I had to clean it and I didn't finish
until almost morning.

90
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,920
Look. My eyes are all puffy.

91
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,920
Are they puffy?

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,880
Are they?

93
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,360
Not really.

94
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,760
You still look cute, as always.

95
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,160
Hang in there, okay?

96
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,360
Just a little longer
and we'll be able to live together.

97
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
Then you won't have to
deal with that anymore.

98
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,080
Where else needs a touch-up?

99
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,200
Wait, is this the professor's restroom?

100
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,679
I thought it was just
a couple of students gossiping.

101
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,760
Excuse me. I need to wash my hands.

102
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,960
Who is she?

103
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,880
I've never seen her before.

104
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,880
No idea.

105
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,680
Should we deal with her now?

106
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,000
Is it urgent?

107
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,280
I have to go testify soon.

108
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,760
<i>Well, when you're free,</i>
<i>can you call me back?</i>

109
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,960
I've got ten minutes for you.

110
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,400
All right, let's get to it.

111
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,800
- So?
- Well…

112
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,080
Last night, I kissed Maewnam.

113
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,240
Wait, what?!

114
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
<i>Shit.</i>

115
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,120
Oh, no, I wasn't swearing at you.
I spilled my coffee.

116
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,480
<i>So how did that even happen?</i>

117
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,640
Honestly, ten minutes isn't enough
to tell the whole story.

118
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,480
And why did you call me?

119
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,720
Just to say you kissed her already?

120
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,680
No, not just that.

121
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,360
I wanted to ask.

122
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,440
Does this mean it's real?

123
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,040
That's a question
you should be answering, not me.

124
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,880
If I had the answer,
I wouldn't be calling you right now.

125
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,920
Then why don't you have the answer?

126
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,720
I'm…

127
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,520
I'm just…

128
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,040
I'm just scared.

129
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,120
You're still not over her?

130
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,280
What are you looking at?

131
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,280
Nothing.

132
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,360
No.

133
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,400
<i>- Or is she just unlovable?</i>
- She's lovable.

134
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,120
- Selfish?
- Not at all.

135
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,560
- Arrogant?
- I don't think so.

136
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,480
- Rude?
- Polite. Every word.

137
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,440
Then what are you afraid of?

138
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,720
I don't know.

139
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,280
Maybe that it's just a fling, or maybe
I need to think this through more.

140
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,520
But how much thinking is enough
before it's not too fast?

141
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,520
Do I sound completely stupid?

142
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,880
Okay, I get it.

143
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,280
It's not wrong for you to overthink.
You're not being stupid.

144
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,600
This is love. This is your heart.

145
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,760
<i>You should take time to think it through.</i>

146
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,280
But if you're asking
whether it's real yet,

147
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,200
I think you should change the question.

148
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,920
Ask yourself, "Is it the one?"

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,360
And I think your heart already knows that
without having to ask me.

150
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,560
If it is, your heart will send the signal.

151
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,320
<i>You just have to tune in and listen.</i>

152
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,120
Thank you, Noey.

153
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,400
I'm really glad I called you.

154
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,520
Good luck with your case.

155
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,440
Bye now.

156
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,680
Yeah.

157
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,560
You can bring your stuff here.

158
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,840
This will be your office.

159
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,280
Oh! Perfect timing.

160
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,160
Tonnam, Chompoo, come.

161
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,400
This is Professor Mahnmook.

162
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,480
Let me introduce her to you.
She'll be joining our department.

163
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,680
This is Professor Tonnam
and Professor Chompoo.

164
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,320
They teach accounting and management.

165
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
We actually met just earlier.

166
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,920
Oh really? That's great!

167
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,240
Well, I'll leave her in your care then.

168
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,280
I have a meeting with the dean.

169
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,240
If she has any questions, just help out.

170
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,920
- You two, don't argue, okay?
- Of course.

171
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,520
Take care of her for me.

172
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,280
Sure.

173
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,440
Um, what has Tik told you?

174
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,880
About section assignments,
email access, parking for staff…?

175
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,560
She told me everything already.

176
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,520
But if there's anything else
you need help with, don't hesitate to ask.

177
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,320
I'll be happy to help.

178
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,000
Are you always this friendly by nature?

179
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,720
Why would you ask something like that?

180
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,760
She asked you nicely.

181
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,800
Well, in my experience,

182
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,200
people who are overly friendly
from the very first meeting

183
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,240
always want something.

184
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,720
Well, I just wanted to be nice.

185
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,000
Besides, you overheard us in the restroom,

186
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
so you already know about
our relationship.

187
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,920
No one else at the university knows yet,
and no one can know.

188
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,280
That's it.

189
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,840
"No one can know," huh?

190
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,600
You two aren't exactly discreet.

191
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,400
That's on me, not her.

192
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,240
Can you just pretend you don't know?

193
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,400
Whatever you two have going on,

194
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,200
it's really none of my business.

195
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,320
And even if people do find out,

196
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,640
it's your problem, not mine.

197
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,840
Excuse me.

198
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,400
Thank you.

199
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,800
THESIS TITLE

200
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,720
I don't like someone like that.

201
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,920
You think she will tell others about us?

202
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,280
Why is this place such a mess?

203
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,800
Look, you didn't even clean up.
It's dusty.

204
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,080
What's wrong with you two?

205
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,320
You look like you've been fighting.

206
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,160
Tik is not around.

207
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,080
You can drop the acting, okay?

208
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,800
Here.

209
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
The limited edition perfume
you asked me to buy.

210
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,840
Hey, have you met the new professor yet?

211
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,480
New professor? Which one?

212
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,640
The one with the confident look,
kind of fierce, long hair,

213
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,640
and wearing all black.

214
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,440
I think I just ran into her
in the elevator.

215
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,720
She seemed pretty friendly.

216
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,120
Friendly? How so?

217
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,640
Not even a little!

218
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,440
You're being biased, huh?

219
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,160
I'm not! You haven't seen what we've seen.

220
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,800
"Listen to your heart signals," huh?

221
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,200
Som,

222
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,040
has any cat ever tried to hit on you?

223
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,200
Or have you ever had a crush on someone?

224
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,440
You know nothing?

225
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,200
You only eat and sleep all day, huh?

226
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,240
Whoa. What's going on with you?

227
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,880
Are you so lonely
you're chatting with a cat now?

228
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,040
If you're that free, go gossip
and get your hair washed at my salon.

229
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,360
Sure thing.

230
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,920
By the way, what can I get you?

231
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,240
Something sweet.
I need to cure this hangover.

232
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,600
This one looks good.
I'll take one jelly, please.

233
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,960
We partied hard last night.
I felt like I was going to pass out.

234
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,280
- Please sit down.
- Okay.

235
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,760
I don't remember how much we drank.

236
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,560
I don't even remember how I got home.

237
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,280
I woke up and thought
I'd come help clean up a bit,

238
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,640
but turns out it's already done.

239
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,160
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

240
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,040
Maewnam already helped me.

241
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,560
What's with that tone?

242
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,280
I'm talking about Maewnam, of course.

243
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,080
I sense there's something going on
between you two.

244
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,240
She's always here at your store.

245
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,360
Don't tell me you two are…?

246
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,480
Come on. What are you saying?

247
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Don't deny it.

248
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,560
I know the signs.

249
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,440
Anyway, you wanted jelly, right?
I got it. My treat.

250
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,480
Take the whole pack.

251
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
And I think you should
go back to your salon.

252
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,280
- Your customers might start yelling.
- Cutting me off just like that, huh?

253
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,200
Okay, okay. I won't push it

254
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,440
since you bribed me with jelly.

255
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,920
By the way,
are you opening during Songkran?

256
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yes. Business as usual.

257
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,880
- I don't go out for water fights.
- Good. I won't be lonely then.

258
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,200
I can come buy stuff.

259
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,840
My daughter's busy.

260
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,319
She's moving into a dorm
near the university.

261
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,040
She's swamped with research work.

262
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,720
She'll never come home anymore, I guess.

263
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,640
This Songkran,
I swear I'll just be sitting in my salon

264
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,920
like some lonely old lady.

265
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,800
Ugh… it's so hot today.

266
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,000
I think you need to go rest.
Heat's bad for hangovers.

267
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,240
I'll pretend you didn't just try
to kick me out.

268
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,800
But yeah, I'm really hungover.
Ugh, I feel dizzy.

269
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,960
<i>And I think your heart already knows that</i>
<i>without having to ask me.</i>

270
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,560
<i>You just have to tune in and listen.</i>

271
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,320
Can I sit with you, please?

272
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,560
Sure.

273
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,480
You're Professor Mahnmook, right?

274
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,560
- Yes.
- I'm Professor Maewnam.

275
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,160
I'm teaching in the same department.

276
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,560
I heard you're working on PhD research?

277
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,000
- Yes, I am.
- I'm actually still figuring out my topic.

278
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,120
Really? What topic are you thinking of?

279
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,480
She's sitting with Maewnam now.

280
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,080
Should we go sit somewhere else?

281
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,200
But they seem to be talking
just fine though.

282
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,560
It doesn't look anything like the way
she snapped at us this morning.

283
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Maybe we came on too strong?

284
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,520
I don't know.

285
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,480
I just get this weird feeling about her.

286
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,720
Anyway, let me try again.

287
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,160
I brought some bubble tea for everyone!
Here you go.

288
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,880
I don't really like bubble tea.

289
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,760
But this one's famous on campus.

290
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,880
Give it a try.

291
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,480
Oh, this is Prof. Tonnam
and Prof. Chompoo.

292
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,040
They're close friends of mine
and also professors in our department.

293
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,240
We'll all be working together a long time,
so feel free to talk to us about anything.

294
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,480
Close friends, huh?

295
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,440
I see.

296
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,520
See what?

297
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,920
I see that your friend's trying
to smooth things over for you.

298
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,160
Well, I really don't care about
the relationship between you two.

299
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,680
It's personal, and I don't see
why I should get involved.

300
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,240
I really meant that.

301
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,040
But if there's anything you ever need,
let me know.

302
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,400
I'd be happy to help.

303
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,840
Yes.

304
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,880
All right. Then let's raise a glass
to welcome our new colleague!

305
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,360
<i>I know you weren't really</i>
<i>asleep last night.</i>

306
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,280
<i>I'm heading out.</i>

307
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,480
I'll be back to talk to you again tonight.

308
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,720
What if she asks why I kissed her?

309
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,080
How should I answer?
Should I just shut down the shop and run?

310
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,400
YUTH PANICH

311
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,320
Oh, shoot!

312
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,280
I forgot to feed Som!

313
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,920
Where are you, Som?

314
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,160
Wait!

315
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,640
What is this mess?!

316
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,920
Wan, I'm not trash, okay?

317
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,200
I'm just hungry.

318
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,000
Is that for Som?

319
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,760
Can I eat it?

320
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,160
It's for the cat. Humans can't eat it.

321
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,400
I'm starving.

322
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,240
Can you cook something for me?

323
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,560
This is a grocery store.

324
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,160
If you're hungry, go to Pin's shop!

325
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,960
Ugh, fine.

326
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,880
Just let me die here then.

327
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,840
I'm starving.

328
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,600
Okay, here you are.

329
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,960
Whoa!

330
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,600
That looks amazing. Thank you.

331
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,600
This is so good.

332
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,200
Seriously, these are
the best instant noodles I've ever had.

333
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,120
You're really the whole package.

334
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,760
Beautiful and delicious.

335
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,320
What do you mean, "delicious"?

336
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,520
This bowl of noodles, I mean.

337
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,360
It's super delicious.

338
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,600
What were you even thinking?

339
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,240
Nothing.

340
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,520
I just tossed in whatever I had.

341
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,520
Don't exaggerate.

342
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,520
I'm not exaggerating.
It's honestly amazing.

343
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,120
Your cooking brought me back to life.

344
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,720
What had you so exhausted anyway?

345
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,480
Aside from Maewnam Service,

346
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,720
there's research, writing exams,
and lesson planning.

347
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,960
Just thinking about it drains me.

348
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,960
But now? I've got energy.

349
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,840
I'm ready to talk.

350
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,240
Talk about what?

351
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,040
It's late.
Maybe we can talk some other time?

352
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,440
Nope. Tonight.

353
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,920
Didn't you just say you were tired?

354
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,160
You could just finish eating and go home.

355
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,520
It's late.

356
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,560
No.

357
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,080
I want to talk tonight.

358
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,960
Wan.

359
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,040
Is your store open during Songkran?

360
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:47,120
I was thinking of buying
snacks and drinks to take to work.

361
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,240
Yeah, we're open as usual.

362
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,520
What about you?

363
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,320
You get any time off during Songkran?

364
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,160
Time off? I can't.

365
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,440
I've got so much to do. Grading, research…

366
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
Just thinking about it makes me tired,

367
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,600
especially not seeing you.

368
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,080
Being a professor already pays okay.

369
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,320
And you're always doing extra stuff,
helping everyone out.

370
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,600
Honestly, you might even make less
than someone who just teaches.

371
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,320
But when I do something
and someone says I'm good at it,

372
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,640
it feels so rewarding.

373
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,600
You even told me I was awesome.

374
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,560
Yeah. Okay.

375
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,920
Just do what you want to do then.

376
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,800
Just thinking about working
in a dorm room all day,

377
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,880
I feel down already.

378
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,600
And not seeing you makes it worse.

379
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,400
If you don't want
to just stay in your room,

380
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,120
bring your stuff and work here.

381
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,680
Really?

382
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,440
Are you giving me permission to annoy you?

383
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,880
Hey. I said bring your work,
not your chaos.

384
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,000
All right then.

385
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,000
I'll be here every day.

386
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,680
Isn't it hot?

387
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,000
THE GRAND SONGKRAN FESTIVAL
THAILAND'S COOLEST CELEBRATION

388
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,960
Here we go.

389
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,240
One cold, sweet drink coming right up!

390
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,920
Thank you.

391
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,160
How many students did you grade today?

392
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,080
Not that many.

393
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,440
My brain's just not working.

394
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,040
It's so hot today, like sweating hot.

395
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,840
Songkran's hot every year.

396
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,840
In that case, why don't you take
your stuff back to your room?

397
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,440
Enjoy some AC while working, okay?

398
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,000
Nope.

399
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,040
Even if I did,
my brain still wouldn't work.

400
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,240
It's just too hot.

401
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,160
Hey!

402
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,800
Don't spray me, kid!

403
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,680
Wan, let's go play Songkran, okay?

404
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,600
But I don't really want to get wet.

405
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,760
We're already soaked in sweat anyway.

406
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,680
Come on, let's go.

407
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,560
Here. I'll give it to you first!

408
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,320
Hurry! Come on!

409
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,040
Hold on.

410
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,240
Should we head back
before we get splashed?

411
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,880
Come on, we've come this far already.

412
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,800
Let's go.

413
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,680
Hey!

414
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,440
Put it here.

415
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,360
Yay! My beloved kimchi soup!

416
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,840
What year's that wine from?

417
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,840
Year of the Dragon.

418
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,320
Babe, you're so random.

419
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,360
Tik gave it to me ages ago,
but I never opened it.

420
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,400
But today's special.

421
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,720
Let's crack it open.

422
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,480
Cheers!

423
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,360
Who's that?

424
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,640
Did you invite Maewnam to join?

425
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,160
My mom's here!

426
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,000
Open the door for me, sweetie.

427
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,440
Oh, I thought I had the wrong room.

428
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,960
- Open the door for me, sweetie.
- Just a sec, just a sec!

429
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,400
What are you doing in there?
You're so slow.

430
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,440
It's boiling outside!

431
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,040
It took you forever, sweetie.

432
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,440
Ooh, it's so cool here.

433
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,040
Shoes off here, right?

434
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,720
Yes, just leave them there.

435
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,440
Ta-da! I brought tons of stuff.

436
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,360
Let's have shabu.

437
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,760
Ah, kimchi soup!

438
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Mom, why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

439
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,920
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.

440
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,840
Wow, your room's actually pretty clean.

441
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,240
Is that the bathroom?

442
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,520
Bedroom's over there, right?

443
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,920
Let me take a look around to see

444
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,240
if you folded your blanket
and clothes properly.

445
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,640
- Wait. You're not allowed in there.
- Why not?

446
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,120
Come on. I've been cleaning your room
since you were a kid.

447
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Why can't I go in?

448
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,520
You just… can't right now.

449
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Aha!

450
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,720
Why not?

451
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,200
Are you hiding something?

452
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,040
- Are you!?
- Mom, you have to wash your feet first!

453
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,960
Living in a condo changed you.
You're so hygienic now, huh?

454
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,440
In the past, you used to walk barefoot
in dirt and mud.

455
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,280
- Go wash your feet first, Mom.
- But I didn't step in anything gross!

456
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,040
- The bathroom's over here. Turn that way.
- Goodness.

457
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,920
Let me have some too.

458
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,240
Hey! What are you doing?!

459
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,600
We're smearing powder.

460
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,720
Let me smear some on you too.

461
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,440
Wait! Who said you could?

462
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,640
Do I need permission?

463
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,040
It's Songkran, come on.

464
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,200
Hey. They've been campaigning
to stop this powder-smearing thing.

465
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Haven't you heard?

466
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,480
Don't use a festival
as an excuse to harass people.

467
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,800
Whoa.

468
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,800
Look at you.

469
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
What are you smiling at?

470
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,560
Do I have powder on my face?

471
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,920
You protected me.

472
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,160
That's it.

473
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
Let's not play anymore.

474
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,240
We're going home.

475
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,440
<i>Babe, I'm sorry.</i>

476
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
<i>My mom brought</i>
<i>a bunch of relatives over for a meal.</i>

477
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,480
<i>It looks like they'll be</i>
<i>staying for a while.</i>

478
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,480
<i>Do you want me to wait at home?</i>

479
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,120
<i>It's okay. Don't be mad.</i>

480
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,600
<i>I really didn't know.</i>

481
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,120
<i>Mom didn't tell me anything.</i>

482
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,560
<i>I'm not mad, okay? See you later.</i>

483
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,080
We shouldn't have gone out to play.

484
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm sorry.

485
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,120
I shouldn't have dragged you out.

486
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,880
Don't apologize.

487
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,200
It's not your fault.
It's not Songkran's fault either.

488
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,840
It's those people. They were wrong.

489
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,040
This is why I didn't want to go out.
We can't control people like them.

490
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,560
You're sneezing already.

491
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,720
Why don't you take a shower and change?
You'll catch a cold.

492
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,240
How? I don't have any clothes here.

493
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,160
I'd have to go back to my dorm
to get changed.

494
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,640
Then just shower here.

495
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,000
You can borrow my clothes.

496
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,560
- But if you feel awkward, then…
- Okay!

497
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,040
Thank you.

498
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,720
This one might be too big.

499
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,560
And this one… the neckline's kind of low.

500
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,680
Not this one.

501
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,800
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

502
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,200
It's fine.

503
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,280
I forgot to lock the door.

504
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,840
But wait, why didn't you change?

505
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,040
Oh, I brought you clothes.

506
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,360
Thanks.

507
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,120
Here's your towel.

508
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,880
You should change too,
or you'll catch a cold.

509
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,840
No, I'm fine. I'm super healthy.

510
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,120
You get changed first.

511
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,800
Let me see that healthy face.

512
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,200
I'm super healthy. You go change first.

513
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,520
You go first.

514
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,560
I'm leaving.

515
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,200
I'll spin dry your laundry here

516
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,040
so you won't have to carry
wet clothes home.

517
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,080
Okay.

518
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,360
Spin dry.

519
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,679
Hey! Where's this water coming from!?

520
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,719
Oh?

521
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,960
- Where?
- Aha! I found the culprit.

522
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,400
Can you shut off the water first?

523
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,560
Good thing those hoses
are easy to replace.

524
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,800
Uncle Lee's store sells them.

525
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,800
Can you go buy one?

526
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,480
Just ask for a water inlet-outlet hose
for a washing machine.

527
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,840
Is there another store I can go to?

528
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,960
Any hardware store should have it.

529
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,719
Okay, I'll go to a different one then.

530
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,639
Wait.

531
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,679
Why are you going to a different store?
Is something wrong?

532
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,600
How do I explain this?

533
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,000
I've been too scared to go to his store.

534
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,560
After I came back here, I greeted him,
and he didn't greet me back.

535
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,960
He didn't even look at me.

536
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,240
All right.

537
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,360
I'll go buy it for you.

538
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,120
Thanks.

539
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,320
Pinky, I'm here.

540
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,320
Eh?

541
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,520
Where are your shoes?

542
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,560
I couldn't find them.

543
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,120
Oh!

544
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,560
I'm sorry.

545
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,320
I accidentally put them in the cabinet.

546
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,880
Babe, can I get a hug?

547
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,280
I'm so tired. It took forever for Mom
and the relatives to finally leave.

548
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,480
The same old thing again?

549
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
She asked when you're getting married?

550
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,480
Yep.

551
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,520
- She asked if you have a partner yet?
- Yep.

552
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,160
- So you just said you're dating me?
- Yep.

553
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,920
Wait, no!

554
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,320
It's not like I didn't want to tell them.

555
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,160
I just get so tired of those questions,

556
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,680
from Mom, my aunt, and my other aunt.

557
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,200
Are you okay?
You're making that face again.

558
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,480
It's nothing.

559
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,520
I get it.

560
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,800
So, is there anything left to eat?

561
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,200
Wait, I'll go make you something.

562
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,000
No, it's okay.

563
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,360
I'm not hungry.

564
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,920
Are you mad?

565
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,600
No.

566
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,600
I'm just tired.

567
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,600
I'm sorry for making you feel tired, babe.

568
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,720
Mmm, it's okay. I understand.

569
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
It's not like you wanted things
to be this way.

570
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,240
I'm the luckiest person in the world
to have you as my partner.

571
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,400
Chompoo, I forgot my phone.
Let me go get it, sweetie.

572
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,960
Don't go.

573
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,400
Stay here.

574
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,880
Mm, I…

575
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,880
- Hello.
- Oh, hello!

576
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,800
Who's this?

577
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,120
This is Tonnam, Mom.

578
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
She's my roommate.

579
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,400
Well…

580
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,360
I didn't want to rent a whole place alone.
It's expensive.

581
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,080
She was looking for a place too,
so I invited her to stay.

582
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,720
I didn't tell you earlier
because I knew you'd complain about

583
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,440
the rent being too high
and say I'm wasting money.

584
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,600
She's also a professor at my university.

585
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,480
That's why I invited her
to be my roommate.

586
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,680
Yes.

587
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,080
"Yes." I wasn't going to say anything.

588
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,520
Geez, you gave such a long explanation.

589
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,320
You're staying together,
so take care of each other, okay?

590
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,680
Please look after my daughter.

591
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,000
Have you seen my phone?

592
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,000
Here it is. I left it here.

593
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,200
All right, I'm heading off.

594
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,200
Oh dear, I'm sorry.

595
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,200
Please look after my daughter.
Bye now!

596
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,240
- I'll come see you again.
- All right.

597
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,320
I thought she was going to complain.

598
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,400
I guess she won't
interfere with us anymore now.

599
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,520
There's nothing Maewnam Service can't do.

600
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,960
Thank you.

601
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,840
By the way, does Uncle Lee know that
you bought stuff to fix this for me?

602
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,200
I didn't tell him.

603
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,280
You don't need to stress about it.
He's just quiet and has a serious face.

604
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,400
That's just how he is.

605
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,160
But honestly,
he wasn't like this in the past.

606
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,160
He used to be kind.

607
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,400
I remember when I was little,
he was really close with Dad.

608
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,240
He helped him take care of me and took me
to school almost every morning,

609
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,320
so I respect him like a dad.

610
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,920
But as I grew up
and could go to school by myself,

611
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,720
we slowly drifted apart.

612
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,480
After I graduated,

613
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,400
I moved to a condo near my office.

614
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,480
I barely ever came home.

615
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,400
When Dad passed away,

616
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,680
I saw him at the funeral.

617
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,000
When I bowed to him,

618
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,680
he looked like
he didn't want to talk to me.

619
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,800
I don't know
if he was angry about something.

620
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,880
Nope.

621
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,320
Actually, I don't think he's angry.

622
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,520
To be honest,
I was just thinking about it earlier.

623
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,680
I can't even remember the last time
he smiled or talked a lot.

624
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,480
That serious face
is kind of his signature look.

625
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,760
But how about this?

626
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,640
Tomorrow is Family Day, right?

627
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,120
You go see him. I'll help.

628
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,200
If I can fix a washing machine,

629
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,120
I can also fix a relationship.

630
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,480
Don't stress.

631
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,680
Uncle Lee.

632
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,960
Soy milk and fried dough sticks are here.

633
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,920
Yeah, just leave them in the usual spot.

634
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,840
Come out for a second.

635
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,200
Someone wants to talk to you.

636
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,760
Wow, you look handsome today.

637
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,320
Smile a little, will you?

638
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Here you are.

639
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,400
Wan, come.

640
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,720
She wants to talk to you.

641
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,280
I'll wait at the grocery store.

642
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,040
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

643
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,920
I don't know what I did to make you upset,

644
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,360
but since I came back,
you haven't spoken to me.

645
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,880
You wouldn't even return my greeting.

646
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,880
I brought this garland to offer to you

647
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,400
as an apology and to ask forgiveness
for anything I've done wrong.

648
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,080
MOM

649
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,680
Hello? Yes.

650
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,240
Where are you now?

651
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,320
Um, I've been really busy lately.

652
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,360
I probably won't be coming home.

653
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,240
What? I even arranged
for Professor Witoon to come,

654
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,280
so you could consult him
about your PhD research topic.

655
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,920
I'm really sorry.

656
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,720
I've just been swamped.

657
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,280
If I get the chance,
I'll try to talk to him.

658
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,600
<i>Whatever happens,</i>
<i>don't abandon your studies.</i>

659
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,560
You must finish your PhD
before you're 30 like I did.

660
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,160
Yes.

661
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,200
Please send my apologies to the professor.

662
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,200
I have to go now.

663
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,280
Goodbye, Mom.

664
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,800
How did it go?

665
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,920
I asked for forgiveness.

666
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,720
He didn't say anything,

667
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,720
but he did accept the garland.

668
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,320
I don't think he's mad anymore.

669
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,880
Just having the courage to say sorry
is already a big thing.

670
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,280
Thank you, Maewnam.

671
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,520
And thank you
for getting the garland for me too.

672
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,400
My pleasure.

673
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,280
I'm really happy when I see you smile.

674
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,200
Whenever I go through something rough,

675
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,400
just seeing you makes it all go away, Wan.

676
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
You know why, right?

677
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,560
I think I do.

678
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,480
But I still don't know how you feel

679
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,080
after that night you…

680
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,360
What night?

681
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,680
The night you kissed me.

682
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,000
I want to know,

683
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,880
were you just drunk,

684
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,640
or did it mean something?

685
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,160
You can be honest with me.

686
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,840
Well…

687
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,160
That night…

688
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,800
I wasn't drunk.

689
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,080
And I've been thinking about how I feel.

690
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,200
I'm not sure if I was just
swept up in the moment or…

691
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,080
if I really like you.

692
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,320
So… now do you know?

693
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,000
I've been waiting for you
to soften your heart.

694
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,160
I'm not exactly made of stone, you know.

695
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,720
So that means…?

696
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,600
It means…

697
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,440
I like you.

698
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,040
- So we're together now?
- Hey! No, no, no.

699
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,680
We're not anything just yet.

700
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,520
Didn't you just say
you weren't made of stone?

701
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,480
I want to take things slow, okay?

702
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,360
All right, then here's the deal.

703
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,200
I'll give you a score out of 100.

704
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,600
Once you get a perfect score,
I'll reconsider.

705
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,240
Pulling tricks now, huh?

706
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,520
You're a professor.
It's usually you grading people.

707
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,520
How does it feel to be graded
for a change?

708
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,400
Wait and see.

709
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,600
I'm going to earn that perfect score.

710
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,560
Maybe…

711
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,280
I'll even graduate with honors.

712
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,120
Do it first, and then talk.

713
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,200
I'm going to love…

714
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,640
I mean study, really hard.

715
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,880
Please give me lots of points, okay?

716
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,520
I was going to ask you last time.
Did you just move here?

717
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,400
No. I'm overseeing the work
at Mouse Mart nearby.

718
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,400
Is something wrong?

719
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,000
Nothing. That'll be 100 baht.

720
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,160
Here you go.

721
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,920
Thank you.

722
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,840
Your lunch is ready now, Wan.

723
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,920
Thanks.

724
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,400
- Maewnam, come with me for a second.
- Where to?

725
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,320
Just a minute.

726
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,960
Come up here.

727
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,360
STORE DESIGN AND DECORATION LOCATION
MOUSE MART, BRANCH 001235

728
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,920
What are you doing here?

729
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,240
I came to see it with my own eyes.

730
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,640
This is the very store
that caused my dad's death.

731
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,720
MOUSE MART IS COMING SOON
WITH SPECIAL PROMOTIONS!

732
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,480
<i>Money flowing in! Luck's pouring down!</i>

733
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,840
I've got something big to tell you.

734
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,000
450,000? Seriously?

735
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,320
<i>It's because of that stupid Mouse Mart!</i>

736
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,240
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>I'm going to stand my ground more.</i>

737
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,520
You're doing this, huh?

738
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,200
Is your family the owner of Mouse Mart?

739
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,680
What defines the line for "knowing later"?

740
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,760
<i>Probably if you had the chance</i>
<i>to tell, but didn't.</i>

741
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,160
<i>I thought you weren't coming.</i>

742
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,960
I'll try harder from now on, Teacher Wan.

743
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,400
You got this, Miss Maewnam.

744
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,400
<i>Maewnam.</i>

745
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,960
Be my girlfriend.
