1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Is your family the owner of Mouse Mart?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,920
What defines the line for "knowing later"?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,119
Probably if you had the chance
to tell but didn't.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,160
Actually, dating Mouse Mart's
owner's daughter,

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,200
there was no need to open
your own grocery store.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,120
I know now that

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,960
Prof. Mahnmook isn't just your old friend.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,920
Maewnam.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,840
Be my girlfriend.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,040
I'm someone who puts a lot of effort
into everything I do,

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,200
including this.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,040
Actually, I brought something for you too.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,840
A whistle?

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,320
It's true you have a security camera,

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,240
but last time,
something bad nearly happened.

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,400
So, I brought you a whistle, as another
kind of alarm against intruders.

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,560
If something scary happens again,

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,760
blow it loud.

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,040
I'll come to you right away.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,000
Thanks.

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,720
Just "thanks"? That's it?

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,320
Okay then, if there's anything you want,
feel free to take it.

23
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,360
Get home safely, okay?

24
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,720
Okay.

25
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Hey!

26
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,320
YUTH PANICH

27
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
What?

28
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,400
It was working fine on my way here.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,320
It must have hit something.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,720
Uh… well…

31
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,440
How about staying over tonight?

32
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,640
It's already dark, so if you walk back,

33
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,200
it might be dangerous.

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,640
Mmm, it's okay.

35
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,160
My dorm's just right over there.

36
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,680
It's just a short walk.

37
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,040
Good night.

38
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,720
She actually asked me to stay over.

39
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,200
Why did I turn her down?

40
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,680
What if I turned back and said,
"I've changed my mind"?

41
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Ugh, that'd be so weird.

42
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,560
Is this how I should blow it?

43
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,600
Hey.

44
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,760
Wait, I'll help.

45
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,000
Maewnam, wait here for a sec.

46
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,160
Towel and pajamas!

47
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,160
Here you are. And there's
a new toothbrush in the bathroom.

48
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,520
Okay, thank you.

49
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,520
Som, Maewnam is staying over tonight.

50
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,200
Do you think
we should sleep in bed together?

51
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,840
Or should I sleep on the floor
and let her take the bed?

52
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,600
Here you are.

53
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,120
Option one. Sleep together.

54
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,840
Option two. I sleep on the floor,
and she sleeps on the bed.

55
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,840
Left or right?

56
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,800
One? Sleep together?

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
How can we do that?

58
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,600
Ugh, go out to get food.

59
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,480
I'm not talking to you anymore.

60
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,360
How could we sleep together?

61
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,880
It's better if I sleep on the floor
and she takes the bed.

62
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,040
Okay.

63
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,520
I'll sleep on the floor,
and you take the bed.

64
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,800
No, no. I'll sleep on the floor,
and you take the bed. That's better.

65
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,960
Hey, it's fine, Wan. You take the bed.

66
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,360
I'll sleep on the floor.

67
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,640
Hey, no.

68
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,200
Come on, Wan.

69
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,720
Fine.

70
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,120
You can't sleep?

71
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,720
I don't want to sleep yet.

72
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
I want to keep looking at you like this.

73
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,360
I'm scared that if I close my eyes,
I'll find that all this was just a dream.

74
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
You're exaggerating.

75
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,320
I mean it.

76
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,760
I'm so happy right now.

77
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,080
And you? Are you happy too?

78
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,480
Well,

79
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,520
of course I'm happy.

80
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,800
If you can't sleep…

81
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,760
should we find something to do?

82
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Yay! Gotcha!

83
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,360
Oh, come on, what is this?!

84
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,720
I've got so many cards left!

85
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,920
Fine, I give up.

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,760
Wow, why did you give up so easily?

87
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,240
Maewnam, the strongest person
in the world, come on, get up.

88
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,560
You want me to fight, right?

89
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,800
- Come here!
- Hey! Not like that!

90
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,600
Not that kind of fighting!

91
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,560
Don't fight me!

92
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,520
Ugh, that's cheating!

93
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,360
Don't fight like that!

94
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,400
Stop!

95
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,600
Give up yet?

96
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,039
I'm not giving up!

97
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,680
What? What happened?

98
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,720
Whoa, Maewnam!

99
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,480
Look at how you ate it so messily.

100
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,360
Let me carefully wipe it off for you.
Hang on.

101
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,040
Whoa!

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,720
Your mouth is all messy.

103
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,760
Okay.

104
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,560
Here. Do you want to wipe your hands?

105
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,800
Thank you.

106
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,480
Here.

107
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,360
Hey.

108
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,120
Is this you as a kid?

109
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,480
Your makeup was pretty bold.

110
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,920
Papa did my makeup.

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,680
He said I looked pretty,

112
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,920
and I actually believed him.

113
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
Your dad's amazing.

114
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,080
He can do everything, even makeup.

115
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,120
I think your dad trained you
for fashion week.

116
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,280
If he heard that, he'd be so delighted.

117
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,320
But honestly,
Papa really was my everything.

118
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,320
He cooked for me,

119
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,680
took me to school,

120
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,440
taught me how to swim

121
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,560
and how to drive.

122
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,880
The truth is, I grew up because of him.

123
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,320
My mom passed away when I was three,
and now I'm almost 30.

124
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
I was always with him.

125
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,600
But later,
I barely ever went home to see him.

126
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,160
It's been almost 100 days
since he passed away.

127
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,200
I really miss him.

128
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,840
Hey!

129
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
No, don't take that!

130
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,400
You looked so pretty at university.

131
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,960
And now I'm not pretty?

132
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,440
You are.

133
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,400
The older you get,
the more beautiful you become.

134
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,040
But I have memories with this one.

135
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,640
Papa, I asked to move into
a university dorm.

136
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,800
You're okay with that, right?

137
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,800
Here you are.

138
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,120
Hey, answer me first.

139
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,080
Aw, are you really leaving my side?

140
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,480
If you go, how am I supposed to live?

141
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,280
Come on. I'm going to study.

142
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't be so dramatic, okay?

143
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,040
Bro, you want Wan
to just stay stuck at home like you, huh?

144
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,600
She'll come home on weekends.

145
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,360
- True. It's not like I'm leaving forever.
- Yeah, right.

146
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,120
You two are in sync.

147
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,000
You're taking her side, bro.

148
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,040
Look at her now.

149
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,480
If the alarm doesn't go off,
she can't even wake up.

150
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,400
I have to be the one waking her up.

151
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,640
And if she lives on her own,
what's she going to eat?

152
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,800
She'll just eat bread
and microwaved meals all day.

153
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,680
No proper nutrition,
no balanced diet at all.

154
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,800
See? That's the problem.

155
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,920
You've done everything for her.

156
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,200
When will she ever learn
to do things herself?

157
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,680
Am I right?

158
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,120
Let her face the world, okay?

159
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,240
Exactly.

160
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,760
I can do it on my own.
I'm strong, you know.

161
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,480
I'm not forbidding you. I'm just worried.

162
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,720
- I'm worried, okay? Can't I be worried?
- Of course, you can worry.

163
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,160
Send all your worries over here.

164
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,280
Mmm, this is tasty.

165
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,440
A father's heart, you know…

166
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,880
When your kid leaves home, it's like
lightning strikes right through it.

167
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,360
I'm just kidding.

168
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,480
Hey, it's raining.

169
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,440
Eh?

170
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,320
Wan, pack up the stuff in front of
the store. I'll get the laundry.

171
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,040
I'll go get the motorcycle.

172
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,680
Hey, wait up!

173
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,520
I don't know what you're going through,

174
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,880
but don't stay out in the rain like this,

175
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,920
or you'll get sick.

176
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,480
Today might feel heavy,

177
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,400
but problems are like the rain.

178
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,640
Some days it pours hard.

179
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,600
Sometimes, there's a storm,

180
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,000
or sometimes it floods.

181
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,240
But trust me,

182
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,880
there will be a day when the rain stops.

183
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,320
I was really down back then,

184
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,480
but you came into my life
and became a source of happiness to me.

185
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,640
I'm really grateful that you helped me
get a hold of myself.

186
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,040
I was determined to thank you in person,

187
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,520
but when I came, there was no one there.

188
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,720
Excuse me.

189
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,240
Oh! What did you come to buy, dear?

190
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,960
I just came to return an umbrella.

191
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,920
A sister lent it to me last night.

192
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,320
Oh, Wan lent it to you?

193
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,720
Just leave it right there then.

194
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,880
Is she here?

195
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,840
Wan is not here.

196
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,720
She's moved to a dorm near her university.

197
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,240
But I lived with intention.

198
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,320
I studied hard, got into university,
and became a professor nearby,

199
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,120
all so I could meet you again.

200
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,160
That's ten years.

201
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
But it was worth the wait.

202
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,560
Wait.

203
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,320
I remember you told me back then that

204
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,160
you were crying because
your parents broke up, right?

205
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,080
Yes.

206
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,840
So does that mean
they're back together now?

207
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,720
No, they never made up.

208
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,680
Go then!

209
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,520
Go wherever you want!
Just get lost! I'm sick of you!

210
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
I was leaving anyway!
You don't need to tell me to!

211
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,440
And I'm not coming back!

212
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,280
Everything I have, I'm leaving to you.

213
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,720
All this time we've been together,

214
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
have you ever earned money
for the family?!

215
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,960
I've been the only one
supporting this family!

216
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,720
Let me talk to my daughter first.

217
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
No!

218
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,720
What's the point of crying?

219
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,760
It won't change anything.

220
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,720
There's no place for the weak
in this world.

221
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,160
If you're not strong,
you're totally worthless.

222
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,360
A few years later,

223
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
my mom remarried.

224
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,920
When she did, it even made the news.

225
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
WEDDING OF THE YEAR, HISO COUPLE
MOST SUITABLE COUPLE OF 2017

226
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,240
I see.

227
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,840
So Mouse Mart
belongs to your new family, right?

228
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Yes.

229
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,000
So that means

230
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,960
you're always helping others,
doing Maewnam Service,

231
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
because you don't want to
spend their money, right?

232
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,040
What was that sound, Wan?

233
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,920
That must be Som.

234
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,960
She probably wants to come into the room.

235
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,960
YUTH PANICH

236
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,800
Wan.

237
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,760
Thank you.

238
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,960
For what?

239
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,720
For giving me a chance.

240
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,400
I'll show you
that I'll support you in everything.

241
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,480
Yeah, yeah, I know.

242
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,640
I'm going to sleep at home tonight.

243
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,280
I'll try talking to my dad
about Mouse Mart

244
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,720
and see if there's any way to fix things.

245
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,320
You're this lovely.

246
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,120
How could I not give you a chance?

247
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,880
I'm lovely, and do you love me?

248
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,680
Say it.

249
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,880
Get going already.

250
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,360
Okay, fine.

251
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,320
Thank you, my love.

252
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,080
What? I didn't hear that.

253
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,240
Thank you, my love.

254
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,400
Hello. Are you the owner
of this grocery store?

255
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,720
Yes, I am.

256
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,320
Is there something wrong?

257
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,200
We got a report recently about a break-in
and assault. I'm here to follow up.

258
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,680
Do you have any evidence?
A description of the suspect?

259
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,320
I have CCTV footage.

260
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,280
CCTV?

261
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,280
Please copy the clip onto a flash drive
and send it to the station.

262
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,560
If the suspect returns,
please call the police station right away.

263
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,240
All right.

264
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,480
Okay, thank you.

265
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,120
- Um… is that all?
- That's all. Thank you.

266
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,680
Ugh.

267
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,400
It took them long enough to come.

268
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,200
Uncle, were you the one
who filed the report for me?

269
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,800
Why didn't you report it that day?

270
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,760
I thought if I just threatened him,
he wouldn't dare come back.

271
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,400
Besides, I wasn't hurt or anything.

272
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,360
Maewnam came and helped in time.

273
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,520
Still, the police have to be aware.

274
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,560
If this doesn't end here,

275
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,280
there needs to be proof that
you didn't start anything.

276
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,720
Yes.

277
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,760
I just don't get
why it's always the victim

278
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,480
who has to find the evidence
and prove everything.

279
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,440
That's just how our laws are.

280
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,440
They wait until the victim
gets hurt first.

281
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,800
They don't protect you
before anything happens.

282
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,480
Anyway, just be careful, okay?

283
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,520
Yes.

284
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,720
Don't tease me, or it won't be pretty.

285
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,520
Guys, I have something to tell you.

286
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,560
You're going to say
Wan is super cute again, aren't you?

287
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,320
Do you have any other words to say?

288
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,960
I do.

289
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,080
Wan and I are dating now.

290
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,960
What?! For real?! Congrats!

291
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,480
So? Spill it. What happened?

292
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,800
I literally dropped my nail polish
just to call you.

293
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,720
Don't be so dramatic.

294
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,200
Well, last night…

295
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,680
Miss Sudteerak.

296
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,480
I need to hang up now. I'm at
my dad's place for some business.

297
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,160
I'll tell you all about it soon.

298
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Yes, Mon.

299
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,360
Mr. Veerawat, have you ever
analyzed this phrase?

300
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,600
When one business grows,
another one collapses.

301
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Isn't every step Mouse Mart takes forward

302
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,640
also destroying grocery stores
and small family-owned shops?

303
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,040
Have you ever heard the term
"crown shyness"?

304
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,120
It's a natural phenomenon.

305
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,960
The natural gaps that exist
between treetops.

306
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,600
Every tree has its own space
to grow its branches

307
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,520
in a way that avoids
overlapping with others.

308
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,520
And I'm going to
make Mouse Mart a big tree,

309
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,240
one that doesn't block others' light.

310
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,960
Here you go. A nice cold drink.

311
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,120
Here you are.

312
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,080
By the way,
your sales this month still look okay.

313
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,320
We'll have to see how much they drop
once Mouse Mart actually opens.

314
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,440
I don't think Mouse Mart
will open here anymore.

315
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,600
Mouse Mart isn't opening here?

316
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,800
Maewnam helped me.

317
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,400
You two are dating now?

318
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,920
Her dad owns Mouse Mart, so she said
she'd talk to her family for you?

319
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,680
To cancel the construction?

320
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,280
Her stepdad, actually.

321
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,840
Yeah, whatever.

322
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,800
Honestly, I think it's going to be tough.

323
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,080
Canceling a construction contract without
solid grounds could lead to a lawsuit.

324
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,520
Seriously? It's that bad?

325
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,160
I'm just stating the facts.

326
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,560
Maybe Maewnam has a way to help you.

327
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,120
Hey, don't make that face.

328
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,360
Your store's definitely going to make it.

329
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,800
I hope so.

330
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,520
This was my dad's store. My dad's home.

331
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,960
I won't give up.

332
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,400
Good.

333
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,680
And now that you've got
someone supporting you,

334
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,200
you can totally do this.

335
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,280
So when's my friend getting someone, huh?

336
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
Ugh, no thanks.

337
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,480
Just working already wears me out.

338
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,360
But it's good you've got a girlfriend now.

339
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,800
I don't have to babysit you anymore.

340
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,920
Whoa. Listen to that.

341
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,600
I'd never leave you.
I'm sticking with you forever.

342
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,960
Okay, okay, that's enough.

343
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,840
- Let go!
- No!

344
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,600
Come on, let go.

345
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,160
You're wrinkling my shirt.

346
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,840
I've got to run now.
I've got a client meeting.

347
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,480
Thanks a lot, Noey.

348
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,680
Here, take them.

349
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,680
- You're not drinking this anymore?
- Nope.

350
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,480
I really need to move on from you now.

351
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,840
I'll send the work over once it's done.

352
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Okay. Thank you so much.

353
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,960
Mr. Vee, Miss Sudteerak is
waiting to talk to you.

354
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,560
I heard from Mon that
you wanted to talk to me?

355
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
Yes.

356
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,400
The new branch that's being built

357
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,080
is right near my dorm.

358
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,080
Construction has already been
going on for a while.

359
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,000
But I want to ask you to reconsider
opening that branch.

360
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,920
There's an old grocery store there,
and I'm worried they'll be affected.

361
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,800
But I'm not just here to beg.

362
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,800
I want to suggest a new location.
Inside the university.

363
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,440
There are lots of students there,

364
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,600
and the traffic flow is pretty good.

365
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,680
It lines up with what you said
in your interview just now.

366
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,320
Is it possible?

367
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,520
It's a great idea,

368
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,280
but I think you're telling me
a bit too late.

369
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,080
The construction's already over 70% done.

370
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,960
We can't cancel the contract.

371
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,240
Why not?

372
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,200
Well, it's a franchise location.
Someone already bought the rights.

373
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,120
And they've already started hiring staff.

374
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,800
Even if we cancel the contract
and refund the owner,

375
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,080
what about the workers
already in the system?

376
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,440
They've all got families too.

377
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,240
Wouldn't they be affected just as much?

378
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,800
All done!

379
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,400
Keep it for when you miss me,

380
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,720
so you'll remember
how pretty the maker is.

381
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,280
Just knowing you're going home
this weekend

382
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,880
already makes me miss you like crazy.

383
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,960
Can I miss you now?

384
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,680
Of course, my love.

385
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,040
You know, it's kind of great

386
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,720
that Maewnam finally got together
with that grocery sister.

387
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,840
Let's invite Wan into our gang.

388
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,160
We can go on couple dates,
like a double date vibe.

389
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,160
It'll be super fab.

390
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,480
Nice. I love it.

391
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,560
Come to think of it, Pinky,

392
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,080
Wan is pretty close with your mom, right?

393
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,760
How about telling your mom that
Wan is dating Maewnam?

394
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,760
We can also see how she reacts.

395
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,960
Really?

396
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,640
But would Maewnam be okay
with us telling her?

397
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,720
I'll ask first.

398
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Can we tell people you're dating Wan?

399
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,120
Sure. I'm okay with it, and Wan is too.

400
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,920
There you go.

401
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,960
I'll try asking my mom.

402
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,760
But if she's not okay with it,
what do we do then?

403
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,040
But if she is,

404
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,680
then we won't have to
hide it anymore, right?

405
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,800
This timing is perfect.

406
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,120
Maewnam is one of our close friends too.

407
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,080
How about calling your mom and asking now?

408
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,560
Okay.

409
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,000
Ooh, speaking of the devil!

410
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,600
Fern, my daughter's finally calling me!

411
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,960
See? She misses her mother!

412
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,040
Hey? What's up?

413
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,000
Planning to come home for once?

414
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,560
Geez, Mom, I've been working today.

415
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,400
And why do you want me to go back?

416
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,200
Do I even need a reason for that, huh?

417
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,320
Come on. Can't you just check in
and ask how I'm doing?

418
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,000
"Are you doing okay, Mom?"
"Have you eaten?"

419
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,680
But no, when I talk too much,
you say I'm annoying and naggy.

420
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,640
Whatever.

421
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,520
I'll just sit here all alone at home.

422
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,800
Oh my gosh, Mom.

423
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,640
That was so much drama
without taking a breath.

424
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,240
Why are you calling me anyway?

425
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,440
Did you know Maewnam is
dating someone now?

426
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Huh? Really? Who?

427
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,080
That grocery store sister.

428
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Huh? Wan didn't tell me anything!

429
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,560
Yeah, I just found out too.

430
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,240
That's why I called
to tell you right away.

431
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,040
I knew it.

432
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,400
I was wondering why
those two seemed so close.

433
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,360
Phew…

434
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,160
Phew what?

435
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,520
I'm relieved.

436
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,480
I was getting worried seeing her running
the store all by herself.

437
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,960
I thought she might be lonely.

438
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,960
It's good she's got Maewnam now
to look after her.

439
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,040
Now I guess I'm the only one sitting here,
old and lonely, watching over the salon.

440
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,400
- What about me?
- Stop it!

441
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,720
Mom, that's enough. Quit the drama.

442
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,600
I'll come home tomorrow, okay?

443
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,120
Good! Come home so I can see your face.

444
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,560
Tell me what you want to eat.
I'll prepare it for you.

445
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,600
Yes.

446
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Yeah.

447
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,240
See? She called me already.

448
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,080
I told you she misses me.

449
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,520
- Stick your hand in already.
- Okay, okay!

450
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,680
Oh, and wait, did I hear right?
Who's dating who?

451
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,240
Wan and Maewnam are a couple now.

452
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,280
Wan and Maewnam?

453
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,240
Yep.

454
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,840
- Aww, that's cute! Right, sis?
- Yes, they are!

455
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,360
Ugh, it's so hot, Fern!

456
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,520
What did she say?

457
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,360
Mom seems okay with it.

458
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,800
She even said she's relieved
Maewnam is helping take care of Wan.

459
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,640
That means there's
nothing to worry about on our end.

460
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,720
Pinky, you're going home tomorrow, right?

461
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,600
Try talking to your mom then.

462
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,360
I'll wait for the news here.

463
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,400
Please?

464
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,040
I love the nails you did for me so much.

465
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
You're amazing, babe.

466
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,880
You should open a nail salon.

467
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,120
DID YOU TALK TO YOUR DAD
ABOUT MOUSE MART YET?

468
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,240
HOW DID IT GO?

469
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,040
I'm sleeping alone tonight.
I'm so lonely.

470
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,760
I'M SLEEPING ALONE TONIGHT.
I'M SO LONELY.

471
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,840
I'm lonely too. I'm working on
my research all by myself.

472
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,640
Then I'll go sit with you.

473
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,960
Then I'll go sit with you.

474
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,720
You're so cute, Wan!

475
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,440
You're so cute, Wan!

476
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,440
You got this, little Maewnam.

477
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,600
You got this, little Maewnam.

478
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,280
Thank you!

479
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,160
YUTH PANICH

480
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,120
CLOSED FOR ONE DAY.

481
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,320
Wan.

482
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,520
- Are you going to make merit for your dad?
- Yes.

483
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,800
I'll come with you.

484
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,040
CLOSED FOR ONE DAY.

485
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,320
Just as rivers full of water
fill the vast ocean…

486
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,800
Here's a plum soda for you.

487
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,240
Oh, thank you.

488
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,480
Whenever we used to come to make merit,

489
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,840
Papa always bought me this.

490
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,480
It's packed with ice,
and it's always super sweet.

491
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,280
I never liked it,

492
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,920
but he loved it.

493
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,120
Whoa… it really is sweet.

494
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,920
How could he even drink this?

495
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,520
I guess it was a taste
he was just used to.

496
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,520
I wish he could have one again.

497
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,960
But honestly,

498
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,920
I should have brought him here
while he was still alive.

499
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,200
I shouldn't have just said it.

500
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,680
There were many times I said

501
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,200
I'd go home for meals and then didn't.

502
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,240
That makes me feel even worse.

503
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,800
Wan, he knew.

504
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,120
He knew you were busy.

505
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,800
Honestly,

506
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,640
someone like him never got mad at anyone.

507
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,440
He was incredibly patient.

508
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,040
It was just me
yelling at everyone all the time.

509
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,360
When I found out what kind of person
he really was,

510
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,840
I started wondering whether he was proud
or disappointed in what I was doing.

511
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,720
I kept thinking…

512
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,600
I needed to make him proud.

513
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,480
To show him that I was successful…

514
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,520
by having a house, a car,

515
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,920
and a stable job that would allow me
to take care of him

516
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,880
so he'd never have to work again.

517
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,159
But I strayed so far from that point

518
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,600
that sometimes,

519
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,560
I didn't even come back to see him.

520
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,880
Wan.

521
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,159
Listen to me.

522
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,960
I get it. Nothing in this world is free.

523
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,920
You can't survive without money.

524
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,920
The ones who say

525
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,159
"money can't buy happiness"

526
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,920
are already rich.

527
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,360
What I'm trying to say is,

528
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,440
if you keep your head down
chasing money for them,

529
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,560
and never once
look up to see if they're still there,

530
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,160
what's the point?

531
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,920
We all have
different circumstances in life.

532
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,440
But if you know you've done your best

533
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,880
under the circumstances
you have to deal with,

534
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,680
then don't beat yourself up.

535
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,440
Give yourself some credit.

536
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,000
Don't just criticize yourself
all the time.

537
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,080
Take it from me.

538
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,520
If I can keep going, I will do it.

539
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,120
If not, I'll take a break.

540
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,920
Your life belongs to you, Wan.

541
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,200
I believe you have the power to choose.

542
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,280
Thank you, Uncle.

543
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,880
CLOSED

544
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,360
Closed?

545
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,600
Hey?!

546
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,840
Closed? What do you mean, closed?

547
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,200
- You're shutting down for good?
- Why are you freaking out?

548
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,160
"Closed"? What does that mean?

549
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,040
Does that mean you're quitting?

550
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,000
Wait…

551
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,600
I wrote, "Closed for one day."
Where's the other bit of the sign though?

552
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,320
Did it blow away?

553
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,880
You scared me.

554
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,360
I thought you were closing the store
and leaving me.

555
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,840
Calm down. I'm not going anywhere.

556
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,800
So, how did the talk go?

557
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,680
Well,

558
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,920
I did try, but…

559
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,400
It's okay. I understand.

560
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,440
I know you did your best.

561
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,480
Thank you.

562
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,080
I'm sorry, Wan.

563
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,160
But I'll help you 1000%!

564
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,640
Thanks.

565
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,120
But the sign's still missing.

566
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,920
I remember writing it, but…

567
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,960
Wait, there it is!

568
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,200
Or maybe I really have to
shut this place down.

569
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,680
It's okay.

570
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,360
We'll open again tomorrow.

571
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,920
I'll go print a new sign.
There's a print shop over there.

572
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,480
SOM SALON

573
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,880
Bring the bowl, Fern.

574
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,760
Honestly, this job suits you.
Everything you do is half-boiled.

575
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,120
- Ugh! Is that really how you see me?
- Be careful.

576
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,480
I always see you as the odd one.

577
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,720
Look at you, all dressed up at the stove.
Is this winter for you or something?

578
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,000
Well, I have a date
with a motorcycle driver.

579
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,640
Another new one?

580
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

581
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,320
- You never stop arguing, huh?
- Hi there!

582
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Oh, hey, sweetie! How are you?

583
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,080
- Smells amazing, right?
- Yep.

584
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,320
- We're having sukiyaki tonight?
- Of course.

585
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,880
I just suddenly craved sukiyaki
with that fermented tofu sauce.

586
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,920
No idea why.

587
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,440
Maybe I just wanted a little pink in my
life since you moved to the condo.

588
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,800
Are you serving sukiyaki or sarcasm?

589
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,040
Your head's next!

590
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,920
What's up? Have you eaten yet?
Do you want a bowl?

591
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,680
Yes, and one more please.

592
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,800
Someone's joining me.

593
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,520
Hello, Mom.

594
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Hello, sis.

595
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,040
Hello!

596
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,760
I'm sleeping here tonight.

597
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,880
Really? All right!

598
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,600
Sit down. I'll bring it over.

599
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,040
My daughter is sleeping here!

600
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,840
Thanks, Pinky.

601
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,400
Staying here might not be as comfy
or private as our condo.

602
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,720
Even though I haven't told Mom
who you are to me yet,

603
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,200
I'm going to show her.

604
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,680
Are you okay with that, babe?

605
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,400
Mm-hmm, I'm okay.

606
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,520
Hot! Hot!

607
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,120
It's hot! Chom, help me.

608
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,920
Coming.

609
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,960
- Fern, bring the rest.
- Here you are.

610
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,400
- This one's mine.
- It's yours.

611
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,320
Yeah.

612
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,360
- That's for you, little sis.
- Thank you.

613
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,160
That's yours.
Bring the fried dumplings too.

614
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,200
Oh yeah, we have those too.

615
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,080
If you're into bold flavors,

616
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,760
feel free to add more chili, garlic,
and fresh lime juice.

617
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,000
- This looks so tasty, Mom.
- Dumplings coming up.

618
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,160
- Let's add dumplings too.
- Crispy!

619
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,960
Wow.

620
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,400
Chopsticks, sis.

621
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,160
Pinky, I don't eat dark leafy greens.

622
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,880
I'll eat them for you then.

623
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,760
Here, have some soft pork, your fav.

624
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,160
So… you said you're sleeping here tonight?

625
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
Why? What happened?

626
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,640
Condo blackout? AC broke?

627
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,360
I already gave the room back.

628
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,360
Huh?

629
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,680
I figured I'd just move back home.

630
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,400
You weren't really comfortable with me
being over there either, right?

631
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,400
Well, not that much.

632
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,800
Don't be dramatic.

633
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,960
Fine. Move back home then.

634
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,640
And what about her? Splitting up?

635
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Uh, no…

636
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,960
Well…

637
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,240
She's staying here with me.

638
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,520
Thinking about it, this place is actually
closer to the university,

639
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,480
so I invited her to move in with me.

640
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,160
Why? Is that a problem, Mom?

641
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,920
Not at all. I'm fine with that.

642
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,080
Make yourself at home.

643
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,240
Thank you.

644
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,560
Just stay together. Let's eat.

645
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
- Let's eat.
- It's sukiyaki, not rice.

646
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,000
You're arguing, huh?!
Whatever, it's still food, isn't it?

647
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,120
Are you a sweat machine or what?

648
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,920
Sukiyaki is spicy, okay?

649
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,960
Papa.

650
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,760
Oh, hey, Wan.

651
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,160
You're hungry already?

652
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,440
I'm sorry. I took a while prepping.
It's just finished.

653
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,120
I was just about to call you.
Come, let's eat.

654
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,200
Sit down.

655
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,000
Planning to eat standing, huh?

656
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,480
Here, try it.

657
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Tell me if it tastes delicious as always.

658
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,600
The veggies just went in,
so they aren't quite soft yet.

659
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,640
Do you wait for me often before eating?

660
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,480
Hmm… not really.

661
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,720
If I'm too hungry, I just eat first.
I won't wait. That's all.

662
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,480
And when I said

663
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,840
I'd come eat with you,

664
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
but I didn't,

665
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,560
how did you feel?

666
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,200
It's okay.

667
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,600
You're a grown-up now.
You have responsibilities.

668
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,920
I understand.

669
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,960
I'm sorry.

670
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,760
I'm sorry I didn't answer your call.

671
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,720
I'm sorry I didn't come back
to take care of you.

672
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,120
I'm sorry I was so neglectful
that I didn't even know you were sick.

673
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,080
I'm sorry.

674
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,040
I really did want to come back
and be with you more,

675
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,320
but I couldn't keep lying to myself
when you asked me

676
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,840
how work was going
or if everything was okay.

677
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,360
I'd always have to say,
"It's going great, Papa,"

678
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,560
even if I didn't feel like that at all.

679
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,040
I felt bad and didn't know
how to answer you.

680
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,840
Listen to me, Wan.

681
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:13,080
In this world, no parent wants to see
their child unhappy.

682
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,480
That's why I always asked how you were.

683
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,520
I was worried.

684
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,200
And I'm sorry too
if I ever made you feel bad.

685
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,080
I love you, Papa.

686
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,320
I know.

687
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,360
I love you too.

688
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,200
But at least
I don't have to worry anymore.

689
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,240
You've got someone good by your side.

690
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,280
I've seen it.

691
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,760
Now come on, let's eat mala!

692
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,800
I've been waiting for you forever.

693
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,080
If it's too spicy, just drink water.

694
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,960
- I might have overdone it today.
- Eat up, Papa.

695
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,920
Lots of chicken!

696
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,720
I miss you.

697
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,240
Wan, is something urgent?

698
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,320
Why are you here so early?

699
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,600
There are two things, actually.

700
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,720
I was going to talk to you last night,

701
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,280
but it got too late,
so I didn't want to bother you.

702
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,400
I got up early and came to talk here.

703
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,400
What's up?

704
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,440
Are you free today?

705
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,400
Can I use Maewnam Service?

706
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,920
What do you want to hire me to do?

707
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,400
Renovate the store.

708
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,600
Back when we weren't talking,

709
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,360
I actually thought about closing
the store down because of Mouse Mart.

710
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,520
I kept thinking about what I should do.

711
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,840
Should I go back to a full-time job?

712
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,080
Should I ask for my old job back,

713
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,040
turn the grocery store into a food store,

714
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,360
or just do something else entirely?

715
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,120
But in the end, I changed my mind.

716
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,160
I realized something.

717
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,560
How could I give up
without even putting up a fight?

718
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,800
But the most important thing is,

719
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,040
right now, I'm not fighting alone anymore.

720
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,080
I have a partner
who's ready to fight beside me.

721
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,280
Right?

722
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,520
You know what?

723
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,080
The way you think
is seriously the coolest, Wan.

724
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,240
Let's go.

725
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,680
MAEWNAM SERVICE

726
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,760
So what's the second thing?

727
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,240
I miss you.

728
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,440
I want to hug you.

729
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,360
Let's go now, shall we?

730
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,960
Have you picked a name yet?

731
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,560
I have.

732
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,800
I'll write it down.

733
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
Here.

734
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,000
Are you sure about this name?

735
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,240
This is the one.

736
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,840
It's straight to the point,
and 100% our selling point.

737
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,360
YUTH PANICH

738
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,760
MAEWNAM SERVICE

739
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,520
CHUM-LAE GROCERY

740
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,000
It's done, Wan.

741
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,080
Great job.

742
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,440
Hey, Wan.

743
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,640
Your top is stained with paint.

744
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,720
Here?

745
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,200
Don't wipe it.

746
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,800
It will just smear more.

747
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,840
You'd better go change your shirt.

748
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,920
Okay. You can come down, right?

749
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,160
Wan, are you seriously
taking your top off?

750
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,600
Well, it's got paint on it.

751
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,360
I was just going to
take it off to wash it.

752
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,840
Do you want to take yours off to wash too?

753
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,320
April is supposed to be hot,

754
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,440
but you're the one who's adorable.

755
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,280
I know Mouse Mart opening here…

756
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,280
It might be a problem for my store,

757
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,960
but I'll make sure
it won't be a problem for us.

758
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,960
How exhausting it must be to carry
the weight of taking care of someone!

759
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,000
Teach my daughter
some housework, will you?

760
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,480
Otherwise, what guy would ever like you?

761
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,520
Chompoo might not even like men.

762
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,440
Mouse Mart opens tomorrow.

763
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,440
Are you ready to fight?

764
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,640
Of course.

765
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,800
Because I've got you, Maewnam,
right by my side.
