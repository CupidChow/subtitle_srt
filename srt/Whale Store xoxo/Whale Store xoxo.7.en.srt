00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,600
I'll show you
that I'll support you in everything.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,960
I'll try talking to my dad
about Mouse Mart.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,320
I think it's going to be tough.
It could lead to a lawsuit.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,640
And what about her? Splitting up?

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,120
She's staying here with me.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,400
Are you free today?

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,520
What do you want to hire me to do?

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,440
Renovate the store.

CHUM-LAE GROCERY

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,800
Do you want to take yours off to wash too?

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,320
Have you been up long?

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,080
Yeah.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,240
Long enough to secretly watch you sleep.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,560
Hey, it turns out that
I didn't get to wash my clothes.

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,280
Wan, you're so beautiful.

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,720
You're beautiful too.

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,320
Wan.

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,080
Am I still your awesome person?

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,600
Of course.

21
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,760
You still are, and you always will be.

23
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,200
Are you here to shop?

24
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm sorry, we just opened.

25
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,360
Please come in.

26
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,240
How many years has this store been open?

27
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,400
Oh, I just took over from my dad.

28
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,320
All in all, it's been around 30 years.

29
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,240
Pretty long, huh?

30
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,399
Wan, this outfit is so cute.

31
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,800
Mom…

32
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,600
Wan, this is my mom.

33
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
Oh! Hello.

34
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,720
Would you like something to drink?
Or have you eaten already?

35
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,040
- I can--
- It's fine, thanks.

36
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,560
I'm taking Maewnam out.

37
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,960
Thank you.

38
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,040
You're not eating?

39
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,520
Have a little.

40
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,680
You might lose your appetite after this.

41
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,440
Just say what you came to say, Mom.

42
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,880
Have you been there since last night?
Or just this morning?

43
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,440
Judging by how you talked,
it's probably since last night, right?

44
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,880
You didn't tell me you were coming.

45
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,520
I wasn't planning to see you.

46
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,480
I was checking out the new branch nearby.

47
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,600
I saw your bike parked there.

48
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,000
So who is she? Where's she from?

49
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,000
Wan took over her dad's grocery store.

50
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,520
She used to be a secretary
at a Japanese company.

51
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,760
She's good-looking. She doesn't seem
like the type to run a grocery store.

52
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,000
Why would you say that, Mom?

53
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,640
Grocery stores are a sunset business now.

54
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,320
I know.

55
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,480
But plenty of them are still doing fine.

56
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,680
No wonder you went and told Dad
to cancel the lease.

57
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,840
You finished talking to him already?

58
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,680
Yes.

59
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,760
Please excuse me for now.

60
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Goodbye.

61
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,520
What were you two talking about?

62
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,760
She walked out looking so tense.

63
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,120
She wants me to cancel
the new branch lease,

64
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,440
but I told her I can't.

65
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,000
Why would she say that?

66
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,800
She normally doesn't care this much
about Mouse Mart.

67
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,160
She said the nearby grocery store
will be affected.

68
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,720
Either way, the mart has to open.

69
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,760
I know.

70
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,960
Honestly, I think the best thing is
to encourage her to do something else.

71
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,880
- She could go back to office work.
- Why do you think like that?

72
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,800
So you're really serious about her, huh?

73
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,480
Yes.

74
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,760
I am.

ANNOUNCES WEDDING

76
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,280
Why were you this silly, Wan?

77
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,400
That was a bad first impression.

78
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,320
Right now, you probably don't realize

79
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,560
how exhausting it must be to carry
the weight of taking care of someone.

80
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,760
You don't see yet how much trouble
Mouse Mart could bring

81
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,800
because you still believe love
is an important thing.

82
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,880
But one day in the future,

83
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,480
when your social statuses don't match,

84
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,520
you'll see reality isn't as beautiful
as you think it is.

85
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,080
Wan,

86
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,760
have you eaten?

87
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Not yet. I don't really feel like eating

88
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,480
because I don't know what your mom said.

89
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,919
Did she scold you?

90
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,120
You're overthinking.

91
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,120
It's nothing.

92
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,960
Don't worry.

93
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,520
You can tell me anything. I can take it.

94
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,600
Mom said that Mouse Mart opening here

95
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,520
will definitely cause problems between us.

96
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,000
It might be a problem for my store,

97
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,520
but I'll make sure
it won't be a problem for us.

98
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Okay. I'll believe you.

99
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,280
I'll believe that no matter
how big the problem is,

100
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,760
we'll get through it together.

101
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,400
SOM SALON

102
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,240
Tonnam, what are you doing?

103
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,840
There were a lot of clothes in the basket,
so I went ahead and did the laundry.

104
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,720
And the one with the towels?

105
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,720
I just hung them up a moment ago.

106
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,680
Thank you, sweetie.

107
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,560
Honestly, this isn't your job.

108
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,000
It should be my daughter's.

109
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,040
It's okay. I want to do it.

110
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,040
I already feel grateful that
you're letting me stay here.

111
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,160
Don't worry. Thanks again.

112
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,200
But it'd be even better
if you could go wake Chom up for me.

113
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,000
Is she planning to sleep through
the sun stabbing her eyes?

114
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,200
She's still not up even now.

115
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,600
She mentioned there's a seminar
at the university today.

116
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,160
She's probably up by now.

117
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,320
I'll check.

118
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,920
All right. Thanks, dear.

119
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,760
My daughter is just so lazy.

120
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,680
So? What did she say?

121
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,920
Nothing much, really.

122
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
She said I didn't need to do it.

123
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,280
But just do it, babe. Trust me.

124
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,760
She likes hardworking people.

125
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,960
Uh-huh, I remember.

126
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,160
Wake up early,

127
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,440
be attentive,

128
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,720
nod along with everything,

129
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
never disagree.

130
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,680
What a perfect next-door girl!

131
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
Yeah. Very good.

132
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm not going to be around today.
Good luck, babe.

133
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,040
Chom!

134
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,520
Are you up yet? How long are
you planning to sleep your life away?

135
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,280
I'm up!

136
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,520
Good. Go buy some eggs! We're out.

137
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,160
I'll get them, Mom.

138
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,280
Awesome. I'll go with you.

139
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Hurry. I'm cooking!

140
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,000
I remember seeing Dad's income
and expense record book around here.

141
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,640
Where did it go?

142
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,000
It's okay. If you find it, give it to me.

143
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,920
- I'll take a look.
- I'll go check the other side first.

144
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,000
It might be over there.

145
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,600
- I'd like to buy some eggs.
- Sure!

146
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,440
Eh? Maewnam?

147
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,160
What are you doing here?

148
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,960
And why are you dressed like that?

149
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,800
This is my girlfriend's shirt.

150
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,320
This is her store, so I came to help out.

151
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,680
What are you two doing here?

152
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,680
We're just getting eggs. Twenty, please.

153
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,720
Okay!

154
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,000
You two are strolling in
together like this.

155
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,440
- Does that mean Som gave the green light?
- Not officially.

156
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,840
But my chubby bae is doing her part,
acting like a good friend of her daughter.

157
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,320
Mom seems okay so far.

158
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,600
Found it.

159
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
Here it is.

160
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,720
Maewnam, I found the record book.

161
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,200
Okay.

162
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,360
This is Wan.

163
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,800
These are my friends, Tonnam and Chompoo.

164
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,680
We teach at the same faculty.

165
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,920
Hello.

166
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,320
Hi, Wan.

167
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,320
I've heard a lot about you
but never had a chance to say hi properly.

168
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,040
I'm sorry about my mom.

169
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,320
She can be a bit of a gossip.

170
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,600
No worries. It's nice.
She keeps me from feeling lonely.

171
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,120
You really are as beautiful
as Maewnam always says.

172
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,800
She keeps complimenting you
on how beautiful you are.

173
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,240
You're even prettier than the photos
she keeps showing off.

174
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,240
Really? Thank you so much.

175
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,240
You're making me blush.

176
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Buying eggs?

177
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,320
I'll throw in a few extras.

178
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,000
- Come on, I'll help.
- Thank you.

179
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,040
- Count how many, okay?
- Babe, go on to campus.

180
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
- I'll take these to your mom.
- Okay.

181
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,960
Hey, wait up.

182
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,600
I need your help.

183
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,600
You professors, I need your opinions.

184
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,120
What do you think of the store sign?

185
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
CHUM-LAE GROCERY

186
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,920
You made it?

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,160
I did.

188
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,040
- Pinky, say it.
- You go ahead, babe.

189
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,400
- What do you think, Pinky?
- You say it.

190
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,880
I mean… it's unique!

191
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,240
It's fine. Your reactions said it all.

192
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,640
Here you go. I added five extra eggs.

193
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,200
Thank you very much.

194
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,680
- There you go.
- Thank you.

195
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

196
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,840
The sign is kind of pretty.

197
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,240
Yeah, it's… unique.

198
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,040
CHUM-LAE GROCERY

199
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,840
Be careful.

200
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,000
The sign removal ceremony is now complete.

201
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,720
Looking closely,
I think it's kind of terrifying.

202
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,440
But I'll help you redesign it.

203
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,120
Just don't throw this one away.

204
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
Huh? Why not?

205
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,520
Why can't I throw it away?

206
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,440
Well,

207
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,000
that paint that dripped

208
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,120
brought some good things with it.

209
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,080
Your top is stained with paint.

210
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,360
You'd better go change your shirt.

211
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,400
Nonsense.

212
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,280
The record book's inside.

213
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,880
- Go take a look.
- Got it.

214
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,040
On it.

215
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,760
Tonnam, did you see Maewnam
at the grocery store earlier?

216
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,720
Yes, I did.

217
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,560
I knew it.

218
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,400
She's probably holed up with Wan.

219
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,840
Do you need anything from Maewnam?

220
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,800
No, not really.

221
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,840
Here you go.

222
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,120
It's just the house has run out of stuff.
I usually ask her to help restock.

223
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,280
But she's clearly in the honeymoon phase.

224
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,480
I don't want to bother her.

225
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,040
I can get it for you.

226
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,040
No need, I feel bad.

227
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,880
Please don't.

228
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,520
Living here makes me feel like
I'm one of your kids.

229
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,800
After we eat, just make a list.
I'll take care of it.

230
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,120
It's okay, really.
I don't want to trouble you.

231
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,040
All right?

232
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't worry about it.

233
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,640
Here, paper and pen.

234
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,200
- Just make a list.
- Oh, come on.

235
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,400
- All right. Let me see what we're out of.
- Yes.

236
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,440
You kept pushing, that's why
I'm bothering you with this, you know.

237
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,440
Swipe gently, not too much.

238
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,400
If it's too thin, dip again.

239
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,200
That's right.

240
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,240
Nice and slow.

241
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,800
Careful, careful.

242
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,240
Your work is pretty detailed, sweetie.

243
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,359
If you ever stop being a professor
in the future,

244
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,920
I'll offer you a job at my salon.

245
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,040
- Hi.
- Hello, dear.

246
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,800
I'm away for one day,
and she's already doing your nails?

247
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,480
Not just nails.

248
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,680
She did housework for me all day.

249
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,240
She's quick-witted, efficient, and easy
to work with, unlike you.

250
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,640
I have to nag endlessly
just to get you to move.

251
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,760
Ugh, I can never
do anything right in your eyes.

252
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,680
You're just endlessly complaining.

253
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,480
I have to complain because it's the truth.
You're a mess.

254
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,360
One. Careless.

255
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,720
Two. Slow.

256
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Sweetie, can I ask you something?

257
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,680
Since you're close, teach my daughter
some basic housework skills, will you?

258
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,000
Of course.

259
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,560
If she can't do anything,
how is any guy going to want her?

260
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,280
Oops! You went too far.
My nail's a mess.

261
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,200
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,720
It's fine. We can wipe it.

263
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,440
We can wipe it. It's fine.

264
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,240
Ugh, this topic again? I don't want to
talk to you anymore. I'm showering.

265
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,080
Fine, go.

266
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
But if I don't talk about it,
how will you find anyone?

267
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,080
It's wipeable, sweetie. Don't worry.

268
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,000
Hello, Maewnam?

269
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,360
Wan, come to my dorm.

270
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,640
Why? What happened?

271
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,960
Just come now.

272
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,360
What's going on? Tell me now.

273
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,200
Take your shoes off first.

274
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,600
Come.

275
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
What are you doing?

276
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,600
You'll see.

277
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,800
STRATEGIES TO MAKE
YOUR GROCER'S STORE A HIT!

278
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,960
Ahem.

279
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,920
This is Chum-Lae Grocery,

280
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,680
a store that's been part of the community
for over 30 years.

281
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,920
And this is Mouse Mart,

282
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,400
a modern trade or modern convenience store
which has been rapidly expanding,

283
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,720
and is now about to open a new branch
right near Chum-Lae Grocery.

284
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,840
But! Don't panic.

285
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,240
According to our research,

286
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,480
Chum-Lae Grocery
still has several advantages.

287
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,240
Number one. Pack Size.

288
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,560
Selling small portions
tailored to customers' needs.

289
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,720
Chum-Lae has it. Mouse Mart doesn't.

290
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,840
Number two. Free delivery with no minimum.

291
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,840
Chum-Lae offers it. Mouse Mart doesn't.

292
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,760
Number three.
Credit system. The trust system.

293
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,880
Chum-Lae has it. Mouse Mart doesn't.

294
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,440
Number four. Service Mind.
Service with heart.

295
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,920
Chum-Lae has it. Mouse Mart doesn't.

296
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,400
And the final
and most important advantage.

297
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,000
You are the store owner, Wan.

298
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,120
CHUM-LAE GROCERY TRADE MARK

299
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,320
Thank you so much for that presentation,
it really lifted my spirits a lot.

300
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,240
Honestly, I know we can't beat Mouse Mart.

301
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,520
But I'm not giving up.

302
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,160
I get it.

303
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,680
If your sales stay stable,

304
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,560
based on your income and expense records,

305
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,520
and if sales are still steady
after one month of Mouse Mart opening,

306
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,200
then you're good for the long haul.

307
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,480
But I don't think they will stay the same

308
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,280
unless we do something about it.

309
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,280
I'll support whatever you do 100%.

310
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,240
Thanks.

311
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Here.

312
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,600
Honestly, I want to help more,
but your car's condition is a mess.

313
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,880
The engine check light is on,

314
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,200
and I even have to peel
the back sticker off by myself.

315
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,680
I'll have to repaint the car too.

318
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,040
Here you go, uncle.

319
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,320
Oh, are you renovating the store?

320
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,280
Yes.

321
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,120
If we're going to compete with Mouse Mart,
we need to upgrade.

322
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,360
Let me know if I can help.

323
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,240
I will. Thank you so much.

324
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,240
Here we go!

325
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,200
Okay. It's just finished.

326
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Okay, let's start painting.

327
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,840
Maewnam, bend down a bit.

328
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,320
Your face is all messy.

329
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,360
You're sweaty.

330
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,880
April is supposed to be hot,

331
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,920
but you're the one who's adorable.

332
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,840
Whoa. Since when did you start
saying stuff like that?

333
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,080
Hello! Mouse Mart is opening soon.
Please check it out.

334
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,720
Lots of products to shop
and choose from, right nearby.

335
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,280
Please check us out!

336
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,640
I'll leave these brochures here, okay?

337
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,800
Tons of promos, giveaways, and discounts!

338
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,200
Please check us out.
Shop smart at Mouse Mart.

339
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,360
Feel free to take a look.
Brochures are right here.

340
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,000
Hello there, please check us out.

341
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,840
Mouse Mart is opening nearby!

342
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,920
Maewnam,
I don't think I have much time left.

343
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,360
You've got this, Wan.

344
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,080
Keep going.

345
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Beep, beep.

346
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,800
How much is this?

347
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,080
I won't tell. Someone already claimed it.

348
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,320
Here.

349
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
- Here?
- Yep.

350
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,840
I think the original location
is still the best.

351
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Original?

352
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,520
Having a store like this nearby
really brings development, huh?

353
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,600
But I worry about Wan's grocery store.

354
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,120
Right.

355
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,760
I heard from the neighbors that every time
Mouse Mart opens near a grocery store,

356
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,520
that store dies off.

357
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,160
These big corporations are already rich
but still want more.

358
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,560
They're planning to take it all, huh?

359
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,840
Not even letting
the small shops make a living?

360
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,360
Exactly. So what do we do?

361
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,840
We just don't shop there.
It's as simple as that.

362
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,680
Yeah!

363
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,960
If we all don't shop at Mouse Mart,
Wan's store will survive.

364
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,560
Yeah!

365
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Let them open if they want. We won't go.

366
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
Totally!

367
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,240
You're right.

368
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,280
Why couldn't I think of
something this simple?

369
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,720
Can I lie down for a second?

370
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,080
Just a quick nap.

371
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,040
You're hungry?

372
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,320
What's so funny?

373
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,960
Your stomach was growling so loud.

374
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,160
Wan, are you tired?

375
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,800
Not as much as you. You've done so much.

376
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,120
I'm not tired.

377
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,880
For you, babe, this is nothing.

378
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,600
Thank you.

379
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,600
Hungry?

380
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,520
Let's go eat.

381
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,200
Let's go.

382
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,320
My bones cracked.

383
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,680
What happened?

384
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,520
I think I've been lifting stuff all day.

385
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,840
Let's go put on some ointment.

386
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,800
Thank you.

387
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,240
Feeling better?

388
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,840
Feeling better?

389
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,440
All better?

390
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,960
Mm, no more pain.

391
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,920
Mouse Mart opens tomorrow.

392
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,040
Are you ready to fight?

393
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,440
Of course!

394
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,080
Because I've got you, Maewnam,
right by my side.

395
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,040
CHUM-LAE GROCERY

396
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,120
Wow, the renovated store looks amazing!

397
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,600
Wow!

398
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,600
Gosh, Maewnam!

399
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,040
You scared me!

400
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,720
Congrats! You're our very first customer
since the grand reopening,

401
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,240
bigger and better than ever!

402
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,240
Yeah.

403
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,160
But next time,
no need to scream like that.

404
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,160
I'm old, you know.
What if I had a heart attack?

405
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,080
Okay, okay.

406
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Wow, the upgrade really makes
it look more beautiful.

407
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,960
The place looks pleasant and welcoming.

408
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,800
Then you'd better come often.

409
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,920
I'm so happy you came.

410
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,200
- I thought you'd gone off to Mouse Mart.
- What? Mouse Mart? No way.

411
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm not going.
I'm sticking with this store.

412
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,800
You always know exactly what I want.

413
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,600
So since it's the start of the month,

414
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,600
that means you want two boxes of shampoo
and conditioner, right?

415
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,840
Exactly.

416
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,400
See? No one knows me like Maewnam Service.

417
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,200
Got it. I'll deliver them
right to your salon.

418
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,880
- Please take care of it for me.
- Sure.

419
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,320
- Yeah. Stop lighting firecrackers, okay?
- Got it.

420
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,440
Please put it on the tab.

421
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
- Sure.
- I'll pay later.

422
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,640
- I'll go get some papaya salad first.
- Okay.

423
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,160
Whoa, it looks nice.

424
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,600
- Wan.
- Yeah?

425
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,680
I'm heading out for deliveries.

426
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,400
Ride safe, babe.

427
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,360
Copy that.

428
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,840
Are you sure you can handle it?

429
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,800
Of course.

430
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,920
- Wait for me!
- One pack of sugar for me, Wan.

431
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,120
Sure thing. One moment.

432
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,160
Geez!

433
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,600
The store looks great.

434
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,360
Uncle Lee, Kung,
what would you like today?

435
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,360
- Just two things for me.
- Got it.

436
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,400
ROASTED WATERMELON KERNELS

437
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,760
This machine is pretty good.

438
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,920
- It is.
- It's fast.

439
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,800
That'll be 58 baht.

440
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,200
Here's 42 change.

441
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,520
Here you are. Thank you so much.

442
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,800
Thanks, dear.

443
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,640
- I'm off.
- Okay.

444
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,880
Here you go.

445
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,240
- Do you want a bag?
- No need.

446
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,640
That's 42 baht.

447
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,640
This is 25?

448
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,000
Yes.

449
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,280
But at Mouse Mart, if you buy two tubes,
it's just 20 each.

450
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,240
Can't you match that?

451
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,200
Thank you for shopping at Mouse Mart.
Come again soon!

452
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,080
Hello, please check us out.
New minimart in town!

453
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,840
I'm sorry, I can't.

454
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,760
It's already selling at cost.

455
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,560
I thought grocery stores
were supposed to be cheaper.

456
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,760
I should've just gone to Mouse Mart.

457
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,760
Eh? Where are you going?

458
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,680
I'm going to drop by Mouse Mart for a bit.

459
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,360
Fern, it's still hot. It tastes good.

460
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
The filling is really packed in.

461
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,920
I'll order again next time.
It's totally worth it!

462
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,960
What was worth it?

463
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,400
Worth… worth losing your mind, huh?!

464
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,000
You always recommend the worst stuff!
This isn't good at all! Ugh, never again.

465
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,000
- So salty, right?
- Yeah!

466
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,760
Fern, you always upset me.
This month, I'm cutting…

467
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,760
Cutting my hair?

468
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,640
- For what? I'm cutting your salary!
- No!

469
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,000
Here's the cooking oil, Pin.

470
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,800
Yeah. Just leave it inside.

471
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,960
It's tasty. Do you want some?

472
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,000
Two packs of heat-resistant bags, ready.

473
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,560
Maewnam.

474
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,280
You went to Mouse Mart too?

475
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,200
Well, they offered free membership
and a free sausage.

476
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,440
But to make it less awkward,

477
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,280
I bought these too.

478
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,880
Not bad, right?

479
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
Is everyone going to Mouse Mart now?

480
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,880
Well, it's new.

481
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,560
People are just curious, that's all.

482
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,440
Hey, you didn't have to
go this far, Tonnam.

483
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,480
You're so hardworking, really.

484
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,200
I saw Maewnam bringing in supplies.

485
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,960
I thought you'd have to use them,
so I'm organizing them for you.

486
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,320
- It'll be easier to grab later.
- Thanks, dear.

487
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,640
Look, I bought a bunch of fish balls
and fried snacks.

488
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,800
Come join me for a bite.

489
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,680
Ooh, what's this?

490
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,040
I bought it for you.

491
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,680
It smells amazing.

492
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,120
Just having it here really changes
the vibe of the salon, doesn't it?

493
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,040
Thanks a lot, sweetheart.

494
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,160
If only Chom had even a fraction
of your motivation…

495
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,840
You always scold your daughter, don't you?

496
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,760
How could I not?

497
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,560
Chom's got zero homemaking skills.

498
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,800
She doesn't fold clothes
or clean her room.

499
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,320
I don't know if the guy she's talking to
knows she can't do any of that.

500
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,000
If he finds out after they get married,
that's a disaster waiting to happen.

501
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,960
Come on, Lady Som.

502
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,920
That's so old-fashioned.

503
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,320
What era are we living in, huh?

504
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,520
Expecting women to do
all the housework is outdated.

505
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,120
Everyone should help each other.

506
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,840
Everyone's working hard these days, right?

507
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,640
I know, but let's be realistic, okay?

508
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,640
No guy wants to be with a woman who
doesn't work and can't manage a household.

509
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,640
They want someone nurturing
and skilled at running the household.

510
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,200
Who would like a woman
who can't do anything like Chom?

511
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,720
If that wasn't true,
she'd have found a husband long ago.

512
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,080
Chompoo might not even like men.

513
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,239
How is it going, neighbor's kid?
Things are going great today, aren't they?

514
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,440
I'm waiting to hear
what you talked to my mom about today.

515
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,639
Babe.

516
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,320
Babe, is something wrong?

517
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,120
Pinky, can you give me a hug?

518
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,719
I'm sorry.

519
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,880
I raised my voice
at your mom earlier today.

520
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,800
I don't know how she's doing right now.

521
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,680
I walked past her just now
and she didn't say a word.

522
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,200
Why, what happened?
Did she say something to you?

523
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,520
I kept hearing her complain about you,

524
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,720
the same things over and over.

525
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,240
She said you're bad at everything.

526
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,720
Hearing that made me feel bad.

527
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,840
She even said…

528
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,480
no guy would ever
want you as a girlfriend.

529
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,560
When I heard that,
my ears just started ringing.

530
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,560
My brain just shut down.

531
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,320
I don't like
hearing her talk about you like that.

532
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,760
I couldn't stand it,

533
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,200
so I blurted out,
"Chompoo might not even like men."

534
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,200
Then she just went silent.

535
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,520
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

536
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,800
It's okay. Really, it's okay.

537
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,000
It's okay.

538
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,200
It's okay. It's totally fine.

539
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,960
Hey, listen,

540
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,960
don't feel bad.

541
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,200
I'm grateful, actually.

542
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,400
You stood up for me,

543
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,600
even though I've never done that for you.

544
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,200
I'm sorry.

545
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,280
It's okay.

546
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,920
I didn't mean to.
You're not mad at me, right?

547
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,840
Babe,

548
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,440
I think I've made my decision.

549
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,920
Mom.

550
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,800
Tonnam and I are dating.

551
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,520
So, how is it going?

552
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,120
This one's from today,

553
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,360
and this one's from yesterday.

554
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,600
Try pulling this one out.

555
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,320
Our sales have dropped in half.

556
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,160
Wan, I told you that the new store
has just opened.

557
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,680
When something's new, people get excited,

558
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,440
but that excitement doesn't last.

559
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,880
Soon, they'll come back to your store.

560
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,680
Do you think they'll really come back?

561
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,680
Then what if we go to them first?

562
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,760
Let customers know
your store is still here,

563
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,960
a true part of the community,
not just a place that sells stuff.

564
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,400
Whose girlfriend are you again?

565
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,360
You're so smart and cute.

566
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,320
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

567
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,560
Just in case words aren't enough,

568
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,960
here's a little extra.

569
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,280
Aw, you're the cutest.

570
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,680
You're the best.

571
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,560

- Dessert after meal?
- No, thanks.

586
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,000
Would you like some?

587
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,440
Yes, you can scan here. Here you go.

588
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,360
Hello! Chum-Lae Grocery Delivery here.

589
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,920
Two boxes of instant noodles, right?

590
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,440
TOKYO PANCAKES

591
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,480
Thanks a lot.

592
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,760
If you need anything else,
come grab it from my store.

593
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,040
I'll give you more credit than
when my dad was around.

594
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,120
F1, I have a side gig for you.

595
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Interested?

596
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,720
If you bring more than five friends
to Wan's store a day,

597
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,960
I'll give you snack money.

598
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,120
Whoa, where is this place?

599
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,840
Chum-Lae Grocery!

600
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,960
- Is this store owned by a cat?
- Of course, human!

601
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,320
Since I've got a fierce servant,
I'll put her to work!

602
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,800
Recommend me some good snacks, Som.

603
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,160
What do you have in stock anyway?

604
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,400
Don't forget to pay, human!

605
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,200
Come support Som and her servant.

606
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,400
Check the location tagged here!

607
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,720
How is it? Do I sound like Som?

608
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,680
Did you just use her to say
what you really feel?

609
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,240
No! I was just voice-acting
based on vibes.

610
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,600
Okay, okay, I'm posting it now.

611
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,720
But if this flops,
Som is sleeping outside.

612
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,080
That's too much!

613
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,520
TWO WEEKS LATER

614
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,160
Look. It's already been two weeks,

615
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,160
and our sales just keep dropping.

616
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,960
Everyone's choosing to go to Mouse Mart.

617
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,720
We've tried so many things,
but nothing's worked.

618
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,760
There has to be something that will work.

619
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,920
We just haven't found it yet.

620
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,000
Right now,

621
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,920
it feels like we're trying
to break down a wall,

622
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,880
but it won't budge.

623
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,640
I don't even know
what we're doing anymore.

624
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,800
How about this?

625
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,520
Let me try to come up with
some fresh ideas, okay?

626
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,720
I don't think there's any way out of this.

627
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,480
Dad's store is going to go down
in my generation.

628
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,920
Wan,

629
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,280
the store hasn't gone down yet.

630
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,680
We're just facing a storm.

631
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,200
There might be some damage,

632
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,280
but once the storm passes,
we can repair it.

633
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,720
Just don't give up.

634
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,600
And no matter how bad the storm gets,
you'll always have me.

635
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,800
What's going on?!

636
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,320
- Som!
- Are you up already, Som?

637
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,120
I want to shop at Som's place already.

638
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,920
- Som!
- Wait for me.

639
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,440
- Can I go in now?
- Where's Som?

640
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,320
- Please, come inside.
- Som!

641
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,560
Som!

642
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,280
- Geez!
- Where are you, Som?

643
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,960
- May I go through?
- Where's the cat?

644
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,880
- Is that Som over there?
- Let me see.

645
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,440
Right now…

646
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,840
So cute!

647
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,920
- Call Som's name.
- You're so cute!

648
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,600
Maewnam, come to the store now.

649
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,800
There are so many people here. I have
no idea where they're all coming from.

650
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,480
REUSABLE ECO-FRIENDLY BAGS

651
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,800
Wow, the seal is so adorable.

652
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,240
It's super cute.

653
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,480
- Does it suit me?
- Very much!

654
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,920
Wan.

655
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,360
- So many customers are here.
- So many!

656
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,400
That means…

657
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,560
Our store is working!

658
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,960
Ever since you found out that
Tonnam was my girlfriend,

659
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,440
you haven't been acting the same.

660
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,400
Part of the reason Mom is like this
is because of me.

661
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,280
It's fine.

662
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,920
Yay!

663
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,520
Amazing!

664
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,040
You're competing
with a big business like Mouse Mart.

665
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,880
Do you even realize what you're doing?

666
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,800
I just want to keep my dad's store.

667
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,560
I'm not giving it to you.
I'm lending it.

668
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,760
I guess we need a contract then.

669
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,320
But the only paper I'll sign…

670
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,640
is our marriage certificate.
