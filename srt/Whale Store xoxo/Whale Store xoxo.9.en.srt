1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,360
I found out the reason
we had so many customers

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,960
was because she shared the clip of Som.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,360
But I can help you.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,760
I don't want to owe anyone anything.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,200
Mom, ever since you found out
Tonnam was my girlfriend,

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,600
you haven't been acting the same.

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,440
I just feel like
maybe I shouldn't be here.

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,360
But being apart
won't mean we break up, right?

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,520
Where did you get this much money?

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,480
She didn't go for her PhD
because she gave the money to you.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,480
You've always supported me.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,960
But now, I don't want to receive help
from you anymore.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,040
ARTS, LAW, ARCHITECTURE FACULTIES

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,520
1108, right?

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,320
She was my first friend and acquaintance
when I started my first year

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,519
because my student ID number
was next to hers.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,200
Is something wrong?

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,800
No, nothing.
I just wanted to ask your name.

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,000
MANATSANAN

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,440
Manatsanan? I'm Thantara.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,600
Back then, I thought I was lucky
I got to know Mahnmook.

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,440
I saw you couldn't take notes in time.

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,240
You can copy mine first.

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,400
She always helped me out.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,960
Thanks.

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,640
You can copy this.

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,200
Ask me if there's anything you don't get.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,200
I'm so tired of always helping you.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,560
Can you learn to do it yourself?

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,720
Please.

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,600
From that day on,
I decided not to rely on anyone again

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,120
until I met Maewnam.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,440
Oong!

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,200
The one who changed that feeling
without me realizing it.

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,720
The store hasn't gone down yet.

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,720
We're just facing a storm.

37
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,760
There might be some damage,

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
but once the storm passes,
we can repair it.

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,720
Just don't give up.

40
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,800
She's the one who showed me

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,480
how good it feels to have someone's hand
to hold when I'm tired.

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,160
Don't stress too much, okay?

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Smile.

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,720
She didn't go for her PhD

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
because she gave the money to you.

46
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
I thought I had changed,

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,600
but the truth is,
I'm still Wan, the same old mess.

48
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,840
Where have you been?
Why didn't you answer my calls?

49
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Are you okay?

50
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,760
I'm fine.

51
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,120
Wait, did we have plans today?

52
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,440
Yeah. I came to return this.

53
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,640
LAND TITLE DEED

54
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,160
What's wrong?

55
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,840
Why are you crying again?

56
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,800
You got it back now, didn't you?

57
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,360
CHUM-LAE GROCERY

58
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,040
So it was Maewnam's money?

59
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,960
I thought your store was making a profit.

60
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,360
Profit? Please.

61
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,800
Just getting by each day is hard enough.

62
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,760
Hang in there.

63
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,200
Noey, do you know any way
I could pay Maewnan back

64
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,040
besides borrowing from you?

65
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,520
Hey, maybe she didn't really want
to get a PhD, like she said.

66
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
If she didn't want to study,

67
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,640
what other reason could there be
other than saying it to ease me?

68
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,640
I don't know,

69
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,800
but I believe there must be one.

70
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,840
But for now, let me rest.

71
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,240
I'm really tired.

72
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,560
- Can you close up the store for me?
- Sure. Get some rest.

73
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,280
Okay, and thanks a lot.

74
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,200
How is Wan?

75
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,640
Is she mad at me?

76
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,920
Not really,

77
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,280
but it's hard to explain.

78
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
Should I go talk to her now?

79
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,680
No. Let her be by herself for now.

80
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Trust me. Head home first.

81
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,800
Thanks for helping
with my store this much.

82
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,480
It's our success together anyway.

83
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,559
I love you, Maewnam.

84
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,800
I love you too, Wan.

85
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,440
Hey, Chom!

86
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,360
Are you feeling okay, sweetie?

87
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,480
Hold still!
Let me take a photo as a keepsake.

88
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,400
Click! Wow.

89
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,720
Once in a hundred years,
you actually do your own laundry.

90
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,080
Come on, Mom.

91
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,440
People have to improve
themselves sometimes.

92
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,440
I can't let others say I'm acting worse
just because I have a girlfriend now.

93
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,920
What do you want for breakfast?
I'll make you some.

94
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,160
Nothing. I'm having breakfast
with my girlfriend.

95
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,000
You got a problem with that?

96
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,120
Nope.

97
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,800
Good. That saves me
the trouble of cooking.

98
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,160
Girlfriend this, girlfriend that.

99
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,120
She keeps saying that.

100
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,760
Have you been waiting long?

101
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,240
No, not really. I don't mind.

102
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,160
What time did you leave home?

103
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,480
I left as early as I could.

104
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,720
- Good morning, Professors.
- Good morning.

105
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,120
You two look so cute together.

106
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,920
Here. Pinky's special tom yum fried rice.

107
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,640
And a less-sweet cappuccino
for my chubby babe.

108
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,880
Huh? This is "less sweet"?

109
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,880
And this is tom yum?

110
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,160
It's super sweet.

111
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,160
It's very sweet indeed.

112
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,480
This is great.

113
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,640
Now we've decided to go public, we finally
get to eat with just the two of us.

114
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
I've been waiting so long for this.

115
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,080
Same here.

116
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,200
Hold up.

117
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,960
It's yummy.

118
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,200
I'll join you two.

119
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,320
Oh? You two can sit together now?

120
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I've noticed
you haven't argued much lately.

121
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,880
Right? That's a good sign.

122
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,520
Well, we're dating.

123
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,440
There it is!

124
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,320
Dating?

125
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,040
- You two are dating?
- We've been together for so long.

126
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,160
So long? Oh my gosh.

127
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,800
So all the bickering was just an act?

128
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,880
Yeah. We had to fake it
because we didn't want Mom to find out.

129
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,240
Does she know now?

130
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,880
She does, so we decided to go public.

131
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,920
- And how did she take it?
- She didn't say much.

132
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,520
She seems okay with it.

133
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,760
Oh? Maewnam, there you are.

134
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,760
Why didn't you come eat with us?

135
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm not hungry.
I don't feel like eating either.

136
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,360
What's wrong?

137
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,840
You haven't cleared things up
since that day?

138
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,840
Oh. Wan's pretty tough, huh?

139
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,200
She even showed up here to break up.

140
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,760
She just said no more help.

141
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
She didn't actually ask to break up.

142
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,200
I only wanted to help however I could.

143
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,560
I didn't think it'd make her feel bad.

144
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,120
You could tell her that.

145
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,240
I don't know.

146
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,480
I'm scared it'll make her feel worse.

147
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,800
But are you really okay with
letting it go on like this?

148
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,640
No.

149
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,200
Sure, she might be mad or avoiding you.

150
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,440
But if you love her, you shouldn't
let things stay like this, right?

151
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,800
Tell her you'll wait until she's ready,
however long it takes.

152
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,040
But if you don't want to say that,

153
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,880
just show up
and let her see your face often.

154
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,760
It's better than sitting around like this.

155
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,280
SOM, HELP US PICK!

156
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,760
I'm really sorry.

157
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,480
Som's feeling stressed right now.

158
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,640
There were so many people this morning.

159
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I'm sorry.

160
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,000
But I came all the way from Nakhon Nayok.

161
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,000
I wanted Som to help me do a random pick.

162
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,600
Can't we try just once?

163
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,680
I'm really sorry.
I just can't make an exception.

164
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,320
If I do it for you,
I'll have to do it for everyone.

165
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,320
Also, I don't want to force Som.

166
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,520
If you're not ready,
maybe you shouldn't be doing it at all.

167
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,880
Ugh! I traveled so far to get here.

168
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,040
Hey, you don't need to buy anything here.

169
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,080
Let's head back.
She's not ready for anything.

170
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,800
Let's go. Don't bother with this store.

171
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,000
- I'm sorry.
- So annoying.

172
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,880
PAY HERE.

173
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,280
Som, take a break.

174
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,080
You did great today.

175
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,840
When I'm full, I feel sleepy.

176
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,120
So, you've got no more work left?

177
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,200
Just this!

178
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,000
A plushie prize for Som.

179
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,040
Do you want help?

180
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,000
Sure.

181
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,240
We just have to stuff it real fat.

182
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,720
How? Like this?

183
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,400
- Yeah, make it chubby.
- Wow.

184
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,040
Som will be so happy

185
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,119
because we put a lot of effort
into making it together.

186
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,520
- Right?
- Yeah.

187
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,359
Aw, it's done.

188
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,040
Our baby plushie is so cute.

189
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,440
What? Baby?!

190
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,600
Did I say something wrong?

191
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,200
I meant the baby mouse
we made for Som together.

192
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,520
Ah, I see.

193
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,560
Let's bring this and play with Som.

194
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,560
- Like this.
- No, don't!

195
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,200
Wait, how do you play with it?

196
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,400
How do you play with it?

197
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,720
Like this? Like this?

198
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,960
Hey, come on!

199
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,840
Did you break up
with Prof. Maewnam already?

200
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,120
Who told you that?

201
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,160
That whistle sound was loud.

202
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,360
I never said we broke up.

203
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,520
But honestly, whatever.

204
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Now is not the time to care.

205
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,040
Your store is more worrying.

206
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,200
No customers again, right?

207
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,600
Well, I still have regulars,

208
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,800
people in the neighborhood.

209
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,840
But is that really enough?

210
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,000
What are you doing?

211
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm making your store survive.

212
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,400
- How could you come up with this?
- Look.

213
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,200
Think smart, sell smart.

214
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Oh? Professor Maewnam?

215
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,800
You came to shop?

216
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
I came to see Wan.

217
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,640
What are you guys doing?

218
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
This area's close to campus.

219
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,440
I think there's a whole target group
we've been overlooking. Students.

220
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,320
You know, students at our university love
anything they can share and talk about.

221
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,520
We need catchy phrases or copy
that grabs their attention.

222
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,720
SHARP ENOUGH TO CUT PAPER,
BUT CAN'T CUT YOU OUT OF MY HEART.

223
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,600
You said you didn't want help from anyone.

224
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,360
This kind of help doesn't bother me.

225
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,960
It's because it's from
Professor Mahnmook, right?

226
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,760
Maybe she could be a good friend,

227
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,120
like you said.

228
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,880
Oh… I get it now.

229
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,080
Was that too harsh just now?

230
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,040
So you're still not on good terms, huh?

231
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,680
Or is it because I'm here?

232
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,280
Should I leave?

233
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,760
It's fine.

234
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,120
It's good, actually.
I can focus on the store.

235
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,440
You might break up for real
if this keeps going.

236
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Okay, okay. I'll shut up.

237
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,840
Hey, I'll post the clip
with those sticky notes.

238
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,560
It might bring in more students.

239
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,160
Can I also film a video of you
introducing the store?

240
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,600
Say anything you want.

241
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,400
Thanks.

242
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,120
Today, I'm showing off
a cute grocery store

243
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,840
with quotes that'll steal your heart.

244
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,760
NEVER LOST A GAME OF PING PONG,
BUT NEVER WON AN ARGUMENT WITH MOM.

245
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,160
A PENCIL GETS SHARPENED, SO WHY
CAN'T I GET A PLACE IN YOUR HEART?

246
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,680
IF YOU WANT SWEETNESS, ADD SUGAR.
IF YOU WANT LOVE TO LAST, ADD CARE.

247
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,040
LOLLIPOP? IF YOU WANNA SMILE,
THEN JUST SMILE, DON'T HOLD IT IN!

248
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,280
OUR DONUTS? SWEET ENOUGH,
JUST NOT TOO MUCH.

249
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,960
CHICKEN STICKS. SO SALTY THEY
HIT THE HEART AND WRECK YOUR KIDNEYS.

250
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,720
CRUNCHY NUTS GO CRACK,
AND YOUR TEETH GO CRUNCH!

251
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,720
Chum-Lae Grocery is near the campus.

252
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,120
Tell me what you want,
and I'll stock it just for you.

253
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,720
- SEE YOU TOMORROW, LET'S GO
- THE OWNER IS SO CUTE

254
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,000
I hope a lot of you
come to visit us, okay?

255
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,000
When did she reconcile with Mahnmook?

256
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,360
Oh no, Tik!

257
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,560
I'm so sorry I forgot
you were waiting to get your hair washed.

258
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,600
It's okay. I'm just resting my eyes.

259
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,480
Oh no! I'm sorry.

260
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,320
You fell asleep, didn't you?
I heard snoring.

261
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,680
No. Nobody was snoring.

262
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,920
What are we doing today?

263
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,160
Wash and blow-dry.

264
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
- No treatment, right?
- Yeah. Just make me look pretty.

265
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,920
- I'm sorry again for the long wait.
- Yeah.

266
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,440
- Ugh!
- Tik!

267
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,720
I'm sorry!

268
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,960
What happened? Why are you so tired?

269
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,760
How did your arm get burned like that?

270
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,640
It's nothing, really.

271
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
"Nothing"? Look at that.

272
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,680
You were being careless, huh?

273
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,160
Ever heard the saying,
"Pretty girls are always clumsy"?

274
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,600
Ugh, and what about your arms and legs?

275
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,440
They were too weak
to dodge hot water or what?

276
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,520
If I'd known, I'd have brought
Snow Lotus cream.

277
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
It's good.

278
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,600
Apply it in the mornings and evenings,
and the scar will be gone for sure.

279
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,920
All right.
I'll have Chompoo bring you some.

280
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,040
Oh, no need. I already took medicine.

281
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,920
What medicine could beat Snow Lotus?

282
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,840
I'll send some with Chompoo.

283
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,760
Really, no need.

284
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,720
But speaking of Chompoo,
I'm still in shock, you know.

285
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,160
The other day, she held Tonnam's hand
and confessed they've been dating.

286
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,160
Not just dating.
They've been together three years!

287
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,040
The reason they hid it that long was you.

288
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,160
She said she didn't tell anyone
because she was scared you'd find out.

289
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,880
But, well, you know now, right?

290
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,960
Ow! Sis! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

291
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,920
- Ah! My ear!
- Oh gosh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

292
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,720
I'm sorry!

293
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,200
So today I'm not going to the campus.

294
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,080
I have to go see the ear doctor.

295
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm not going deaf.

296
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,280
Your mom's hot hair straightener
clipped my ear.

297
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
Really?

298
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,840
But my mom's a master at straightening.

299
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,080
Exactly! She's done my hair so many times.

300
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,800
But this time, we were just talking,

301
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,800
and then I mentioned
her daughter has a girlfriend,

302
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,240
and bam, straight to my ear.

303
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,280
She said sorry countless times.

304
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,240
But I think your mom's been
kind of distracted lately.

305
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,480
Yeah.

306
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,320
I want to apologize for her again.

307
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,360
It's okay. All right, that's it for now.

308
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,880
Mom accidentally clipped Tik's ear
because she said we're dating.

309
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,880
How's your mom now, Pinky?

310
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,680
She's fine.

311
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,160
I guess she's not okay with us
being together.

312
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,720
That's okay.

313
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,920
NEVER LOST A GAME OF PING PONG,
BUT NEVER WON AN ARGUMENT WITH MOM.

314
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,120
How much is it?

315
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,400
50 baht.

316
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,880
- I'll scan it.
- Okay.

317
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,880
All done.

318
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,480
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks.

319
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Do you sell erasers too?

320
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,320
Sure, hang on a sec.

321
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,920
Here it is.

322
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,480
An eraser that can erase anything,
except that person from your heart.

323
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,440
Whoa! That hit hard.

324
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,640
But when someone leaves a mark on
your heart, it's hard to forget them.

325
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,320
- You'll take one, right?
- Sure.

326
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,720
- Scan to pay.
- Got it. It's 5 baht.

327
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,320
Here you go.

328
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,200
- Thanks. Here you are.
- Thank you.

329
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,120
Professor, here's
what you asked me to buy.

330
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,160
And did you say it?

331
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,000
When someone leaves a mark on your heart,
it's hard to forget them.

332
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,600
Good job. You've learned well.

333
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,160
Thank you.

334
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,440
Is Wan mad at me?

335
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,680
I shouldn't have spoken
sarcastically like that.

336
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,320
Crunchy nuts go crack,
and your teeth go crunch?

337
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,800
Is this your new marketing strategy?

338
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,640
Yep. Mahnmook helped with it.

339
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,840
It's pretty good, actually.

340
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,240
Just a few days after posting,
we're packed with customers.

341
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,200
Huh…

342
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,760
So, when did you two reconcile?

343
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,000
You didn't even tell me.

344
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,040
I've wanted to for a while,

345
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
but you seemed busy from your stories.

346
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,240
I didn't want to bother you.

347
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,680
Even if I'm busy,
you can still message me.

348
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,680
I'll catch up later.

349
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,680
So what happened?

350
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,800
Did she come and hurt your feelings again?

351
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,600
Not really.

352
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,440
She just wanted to help.

353
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,640
Help? Or flirt?

354
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,360
She's not flirting.

355
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,800
She really came to help,

356
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,880
and she said
she genuinely wants to be friends.

357
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,520
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

358
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,200
But like, can people actually
be friends with their ex?

359
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,360
I don't know.

360
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,760
I've never had a relationship like that.

361
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,320
But if she can, I'm fine with it.

362
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,200
Don't worry about how she feels.

363
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,640
Worry about yourself. Are you okay?

364
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,120
Me and her? It's been over ten years.

365
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,400
Honestly, I don't feel anything now.

366
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,400
If she says she wants to be friends,
then I can be friends.

367
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,880
Do you think it'll work?

368
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,760
Someone like Mahnmook
is blunt and straightforward.

369
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,520
If she says "friends,"
I believe she means it.

370
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,080
What about Maewnam?
Are you two okay now?

371
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,600
It's not like Maewnam saw you with her
and misunderstood like in a drama, huh?

372
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,280
She did see us,
but I don't think she felt anything.

373
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,080
So you two are good now?

374
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,640
Not yet. That's a long story.

375
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,640
Long stories are fine.

376
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,640
I'm not busy today. I can listen all day.

377
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,760
Here.

378
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,720
Crunchy nuts got your teeth going crunch.

379
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,680
Chom, why are you staring at me like that?

380
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,960
Since I've been away from home,

381
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,840
you've been hurt from hands to feet.

382
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,120
What happened, Mom?
Why didn't you tell me?

383
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,400
Do I have to tell you everything?

384
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,320
It's just some pain.
It can happen every day.

385
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,120
Sure, pain happens, but not every day.

386
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,440
Tik told me everything.

387
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,680
When she mentioned I was dating Tonnam,

388
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,480
you clipped her ear and your own hand too.

389
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,880
Can you please just talk to me, Mom?

390
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,840
I'm tired of having to guess
how you feel all the time.

391
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,160
And you keep avoiding
talking to me like this.

392
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,120
See? Even now, I'm speaking
and you're not even listening.

393
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Tell me what's wrong. Please.

394
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,240
What if I said I don't like
that you have a girlfriend?

395
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,600
I kind of already know
you're not okay with it.

396
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,160
But I convinced myself
you just needed time.

397
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,760
So I kept my distance…

398
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,240
hoping you'd open your heart one day
and understand me better…

399
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,800
because when other people came out,

400
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,840
you always supported them
and cheered them on.

401
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,800
Why can't you do that for your own kid?

402
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,400
I never wanted things to be like this.

403
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Chom.

404
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,640
I've had you as my daughter
for over 20 years.

405
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,560
Then suddenly you tell me

406
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,440
you like girls and you want to date one.

407
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,320
How am I supposed to feel?

408
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,320
I'm not angry or disgusted.
I'm not pushing you away.

409
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,400
I just hate myself.

410
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,000
I feel like I don't know you at all.

411
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,200
Every day I ask myself,
what have I been doing?

412
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,360
Am I that blind to my own daughter?

413
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,840
It felt like we could talk about anything,

414
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,520
but maybe we couldn't.

415
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,040
I just feel like
I don't understand you at all.

416
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,000
I've been such a bad mom.

417
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,320
I know I've hurt your feelings
in the past.

418
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm sorry.

419
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,840
I love you, Mom.

420
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,000
I love you so much too.

421
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,880
I just don't know how to deal with this.

422
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,560
CHUM-LAE GROCERY

423
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,720
Wan.

424
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,400
Hey.

425
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,320
Are you okay?

426
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,960
Yeah, but I'm just sleepy.

427
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,120
Hey.

428
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,040
You drank so much
and still say you're fine?

429
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,200
You're such a lightweight,
but you still drink anyway.

430
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,120
Why aren't you drinking?!

431
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,600
I'm driving.

432
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,800
I told you to just sleep here.

433
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,240
Go sleep upstairs.
I'll close the store for you.

434
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,880
Hey.

435
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,000
Take care of it for me.

436
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,000
Ow!

437
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,240
Ow!

438
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,720
Noey?

439
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,600
Long time no see.

440
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,240
Why did Wan close her store already?

441
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,920
It's just closed.
What are you doing here this late?

442
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,480
What about you?

443
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,239
I'm her close friend.

444
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,199
I can come here anytime.

445
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,000
Really?

446
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,159
What about you then?

447
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,199
When you left Wan,
you didn't seem to care.

448
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,840
It's been ten years.
You've been gone for so long.

449
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,480
Why show up now and play nice?

450
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,840
I just went to study.

451
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,760
Now I'm back and want to be friends.

452
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,320
- Can't I do that?
- What an excuse.

453
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,159
You never wanted to be friends before.

454
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,120
Or is it because she has a girlfriend now?

455
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,880
You're jealous and want her back?

456
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,239
Of course.

457
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,159
They're fighting now too.

458
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,920
Perfect timing, huh?

459
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,320
Taking advantage of their rough patch?
This is what you call being a "friend"?

460
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,880
Do friends do that?

461
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,760
Who's really catching feelings here?

462
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,440
You think I didn't notice

463
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,480
the way you looked at Wan back then?

464
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,960
- It's yummy.
- Is it?

465
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,320
It's yummy.

466
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,320
Blue Hawaii.

467
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,960
Fine, I like Wan,

468
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,520
and I know she never felt the same.

469
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,040
I'm so tired of always helping you.

470
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,800
Can you learn to do it yourself?

471
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,120
Please.

472
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,200
I've always been a close friend to her.

473
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,960
I've never crossed the line

474
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,000
because I didn't want to lose
this relationship.

475
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,920
Just cry.

476
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,200
Let it out if it hurts.

477
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,040
Really?

478
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,760
Or were you just waiting
for a chance to swoop in?

479
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,360
Hey, that's going too far.

480
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,960
You feel hurt now?

481
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,080
That hit a nerve?

482
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,880
I just stood there and let you scold me
without saying a word.

483
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,280
I said hurtful things to Maewnam too.

484
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,640
But I didn't mean it.

485
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,920
I just didn't want to burden her.

486
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,040
People in love should grow together.

487
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,800
Think about it. If I dragged her down,
how do you think I'd feel?

488
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,600
And when you said hurtful things,
how do you think she felt?

489
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,160
Yeah. That's why I'm sitting here,
full of regret.

490
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,600
At least I know my limits.

491
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,640
I'd never cross the line.

492
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,520
And sure, I was happy to see the deed.

493
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,160
But thinking it over,
it's her money anyway, you know?

494
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,720
What should I even do?

495
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,440
Go talk to her.

496
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,480
I can't! I don't want to be
a burden anymore.

497
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,880
Hey. Partners don't
see each other as burdens.

498
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,280
Well, I do.

499
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,520
That's because I know
who she really loves.

500
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,400
My monthly sales didn't go well.
I can't beat Mouse Mart.

501
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,480
I can barely get by each month.

502
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,440
I have to keep selling, doing more.

503
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,200
Why can't I be good at anything?

504
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,000
Think about it.

505
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,720
How can someone like me date her?

506
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,400
Everything I said…

507
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,920
I believe you're someone
who understands things easily.

508
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,560
And if you mean well regarding Wan,

509
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,680
you should know what to do.

510
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,200
Maewnam, I'm sorry.

511
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,560
I didn't mean to…

512
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,680
IM SORRY FORR BEING SOO DUMB, MAEWNAM.
I JUS DIDNT WANNA MAKE U STRUGGLE,…

513
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,760
Huh?!

514
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,480
What did I send?!!

515
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:59,360
"I'm sorry for acting so dumb, Maewnam."

516
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,960
"I just didn't want to make you struggle,
always helping me."

517
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,120
"I'm really sorry for how I acted."

518
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,080
"I'm sorry."

519
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,640
How should I deal with this?

520
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,480
Can I just say the cat typed this?

521
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Geez!

522
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,800
You came early.

523
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,640
I read the message you sent.

524
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,800
I've acknowledged
and understood everything,

525
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,400
and I'll do exactly what you said.

526
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,800
I won't forgive you just yet,

527
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,760
and I won't be helping you anymore either.

528
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,040
I'm sorry for bothering you
with that text.

529
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,240
I haven't finished talking.

530
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,760
I won't help you anymore,

531
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,360
but I've got something for you to do.

532
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,840
WAN SERVICE

533
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,800
"Wan Service"?

534
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,840
That's right.

535
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,160
You have to work
and pay off your debt to me.

536
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,240
What do I have to do?

537
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,680
Say, "Fifteen kilos of rice have arrived."

538
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,560
Fifteen kilos of rice have arrived.

539
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,880
Put them next to the gas tank.

540
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,880
It's just fifteen kilos.

541
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Just!

542
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,200
Hey, careful. The bag might tear.
Don't spill the rice.

543
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,560
Lift it properly.

544
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,880
Hurry up.

545
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,920
- Make it fast. It's just two boxes.
- Yeah, yeah.

546
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,760
Say you've arrived too.

547
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,240
How do I say it?

548
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,640
Wan Service is here.

549
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,720
Wan Service is here!

550
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,160
Wow, such teamwork.

551
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,640
Sis, this is not a team. I'm the boss.

552
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
She's my assistant.

553
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,520
Right. The money's where it always is.

554
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,320
- Just grab it.
- Got it.

555
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,320
Hurry up!

556
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,560
We passed the shop!

557
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,920
Call him. Say, "Uncle Lee, I'm here."

558
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,440
Uncle Lee, I'm here.

559
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,120
Louder. He can't hear that.

560
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,920
Uncle Lee, I'm here.

561
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,640
Fried dough sticks and soy milk are here.

562
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,840
Fried dough sticks and soy milk are here.

563
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,160
Louder.

564
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,280
Fried dough sticks and soy milk are here!

565
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,240
No wonder that voice sounded familiar.

566
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,000
You're working for Maewnam now?

567
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,400
Uh-uh-uh. Please don't say "working for."

568
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,920
She's my assistant now.

569
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,280
What about the store?

570
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,840
F1 is watching the store for her.

571
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,200
Finish it all, okay?

572
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,160
Got it.

573
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,800
Next stop, the massage parlor.

574
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,800
- But I don't know how to massage.
- You're not massaging.

575
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,920
You're hanging curtains.

576
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Huh!?

577
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,200
Don't say, "huh?" You're tall.

578
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,040
Let's go hang curtains. It's easy.

579
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,720
She's trying to adjust,

580
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,720
but it might not happen right away.

581
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,360
It must be tough for her
when it's her beloved daughter.

582
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,600
I think I understand her, though.

583
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,640
Before I met you, Chom,

584
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,360
I didn't even understand myself either.

585
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,080
I used to wonder why I didn't like guys

586
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,960
and whether not liking them
would hurt my family.

587
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,680
But in the end,
there was no reason at all.

588
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,040
Love is love.

589
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,960
It's about feelings.

590
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,280
Chom, you've made me more sure
about my feelings.

591
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,240
What about you?

592
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,520
I only feel this way with you.

593
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,720
Then there's nothing
to be afraid of anymore.

594
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,440
Even if it's not right away,

595
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,920
however long it takes…

596
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,200
I'll still be right here.

597
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,720
We'll get through this together.

598
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,040
Here's your pay.

599
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,120
Thank you!

600
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,080
Feel free to hire me often.

601
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,920
Watching Wan's store is super easy.

602
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,160
I got paid even more than
washing dishes for Mom.

603
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,960
Don't be so loud. She'll smack you.

604
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,640
- Got it.
- I'll call you if I need help again.

605
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,680
Sure. Thanks.

606
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,640
Yeah.

607
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,920
Whoa, I biked more today than
I have in my whole life.

608
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,040
My legs are dying.

609
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,880
How do you even bike like this every day?

610
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,000
You're awesome.

611
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,120
That's the whole reason I did it.
To hear this word.

612
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,840
I'm sorry, my dear.

613
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,880
Did you just call me "my dear"?

614
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:50,440
I'm sorry, and I promise I won't ever
make you cry again, my dear.

615
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,240
Apology accepted,

616
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,240
and you can take your stuff back too.

617
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,520
I'm sorry.

618
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,600
Don't ever do that again, okay?

619
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,400
And from now on,
what will you do when I call you?

620
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,920
Come to see you.

621
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,080
Or if I don't…?

622
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
Is this place selling love too?

623
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,520
Maewnam Service is temporarily closed.

624
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:19,560
I'll make every second we spend together
the happiest from now on!

625
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,360
Mom, you don't have to do anything.

626
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,280
Just see us as Tonnam and Chompoo,
just like before. That's enough.

627
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,280
I might not need to restock
the store anymore.

628
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,640
Why?

629
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,280
I do want you to go…

630
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,320
but at the same time, I don't!

631
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,600
We'll get through this together.
I'll always be by your side, Maewnam.
