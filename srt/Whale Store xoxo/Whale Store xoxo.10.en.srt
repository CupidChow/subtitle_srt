1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,560
Huh?! What did I send?

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,520
Can I just say the cat typed this?

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,840
I read the message you sent.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,120
I won't forgive you just yet,
and I won't be helping you anymore either.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,760
I'm sorry, and I promise I won't ever
make you cry again, my dear.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,520
Did you just call me "my dear"?

7
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,640
STUDENT REPORT

8
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,280
Only 3.7?

9
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,960
You've got to work harder than this.

10
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,400
I'll pick you up at ten tonight.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,640
Study well, okay?

12
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,720
And next term, you must get a 4.00.

13
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,200
Go on, get to class.

14
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,240
She has such high hopes for me.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,720
I must study well.

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
I must make it.

17
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,080
From all the equations I've written here,

18
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,080
can you calculate
the value of the last line?

19
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,520
That's because if we're not smart,
we're worth nothing.

20
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,360
If you calculate this value, you don't
even need me to write the last one.

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,240
- You must be able to answer.
- This thought keeps circling in my head.

22
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,200
Try writing it down.

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,160
- And then we'll take it from…
- You studied so hard.

24
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,840
Well, ever since Grade 10,

25
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,400
I've just been buried in textbooks,
head down studying,

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,560
without really living my life.

27
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,760
Do you remember that photo of my mom
I showed you when she'd just remarried?

28
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,040
WEDDING OF THE YEAR, HISO COUPLE
MOST SUITABLE COUPLE OF 2017

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,120
You're always helping others,
doing Maewnam Service,

30
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,160
because you don't want to
spend their money, right?

31
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,600
What was that sound, Wan?

32
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
That must be Som.
She probably wants to come into the room.

33
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,000
I remember, of course.

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,720
Is there something you want to tell me?

35
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,600
The reason I started doing
Maewnam Service…

36
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,120
Apart from not wanting
to ask her for money,

37
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,440
there's something
I've been holding onto deep inside.

38
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,680
People might think I'm capable,
that I can do anything,

39
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,200
and that I'm confident.

40
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,800
But before I became like this,

41
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,400
I had very low self-esteem.

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,480
I never once got a compliment from my mom,

43
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,520
no matter how well I did.

44
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,959
So I tried to make myself useful,

45
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,160
just to hear someone say
I was good at something.

46
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,200
Whenever someone says,
"You're awesome. You can do it,"

47
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,600
it's so fulfilling,

48
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,640
especially for someone like me
who's always lacked confidence.

49
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,600
Maewnam, you're so awesome.

50
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,160
Can you say it again?

51
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,400
You're so, so awesome.

52
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,880
You're the best in the world.

53
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,600
I think only you and your dad

54
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,800
have ever given me this sincerely.

55
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,720
It's because of your dad that
I've learned to feel like I have worth.

56
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
That will be 40 baht.

57
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,880
Thanks.

58
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,040
Back then, I was studying
almost all the time,

59
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,000
rushing to finish my master's

60
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,920
so I could apply
to be a university professor.

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
Like I said, I never really
lived my life like other people.

62
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,480
Maybe your dad felt sorry for me.

63
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,440
I used to sit and sigh
in front of his store all the time,

64
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,240
so he gave me a chance
to live the life I should've had.

65
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,240
Hey, you've got sharp eyes.
Read this for me.

66
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,480
SAFETY INFORMATION

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,960
Water filters should be used for…

68
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,160
After that, he never
let me stay idle again.

69
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,960
All done.

70
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,680
Whoa, you're good!

71
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,120
He'd go around telling everyone,

72
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,480
"She's good. She can do it.
Let her handle it."

73
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,200
People here, when they needed something…

74
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,200
The rice is here, Pin.

75
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,760
Thanks. Leave it inside.

76
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,320
…they'd always call me to help.

77
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
The money's right there.

78
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,000
- That's how I learned to do things.
- Thanks.

79
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,640
What? You can't fix it?

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,040
If you can't, you shouldn't call yourself
"Maewnam Service," right?

81
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,520
All right, all right.

82
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,680
It's because of your dad
that I feel like I have worth.

83
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,480
Honestly, the person you really want
to compliment you isn't other people.

84
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,880
It's your mom.

85
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,160
That's true.

86
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,720
The reason I did Maewnam Service,

87
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,760
pushed myself to finish my master's,

88
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,880
became a professor,

89
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
and kept going for my PhD…

90
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,960
was because I wanted her to compliment me.

91
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,200
Sudteerak, I'm sorry.

92
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,120
I didn't listen to your reasons at all.

93
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,840
It's okay.

94
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,960
Hold on, it's almost done.

95
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,920
It smells so good.

96
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
I'll pay the money you gave me back soon.

97
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,880
The store's been doing well lately.

98
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,320
And who do we have to thank for that?

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
Professor Mahnmook, maybe?

100
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,560
Maewnam, are you jealous?

101
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,520
I told you, there's nothing
between me and her.

102
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
Seriously.

103
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,600
But Professor Mahnmook thinks otherwise.

104
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,240
I'm sorry for calling you
on such short notice.

105
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,560
I just wanted to clear things up fast.

106
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,440
This is about Wan, right?

107
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,680
Things between us didn't end very well,

108
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,320
and she's been on my mind ever since.

109
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,600
When I met her again,

110
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,840
I honestly just wanted to be friends.

111
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,240
But seeing her with you,

112
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,720
I have to admit…

113
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,280
I felt a little irritated.

114
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
That's why I stepped in to help her.

115
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,440
Thanks for being honest.

116
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,440
But I trust Wan.

117
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
I know,

118
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,920
and I've accepted

119
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,520
that Wan doesn't feel anything
for me anymore.

120
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,840
But I'm actually fine

121
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,720
if you two go back to being friends.

122
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,120
I get now…

123
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,960
why she likes you.

124
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
What else did she say?

125
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,320
I'm not telling.

126
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,480
What?

127
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,680
You want to know?

128
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,680
Yeah.

129
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,840
What? Come on.

130
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,640
Nothing.

131
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,160
Professor Mahnmook is nice, though.

132
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,400
She says what she likes and doesn't like.

133
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,200
No secrets.

134
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,640
Unlike someone here…

135
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,680
acting all cold.

136
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,920
I've already captured
all the messages you sent.

137
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,720
Eh? But that was when I was drunk.

138
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,160
Where's your phone? I'm deleting them.

139
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,640
It's not here.

140
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,800
Where's your phone?

141
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
- No, no.
- Babe, give it to me!

142
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,480
I'm deleting them right now.

143
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,480
SOM SALON

144
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,120
Let's eat.

145
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,440
Today's menu looks delicious.
Perfect with porridge.

146
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,680
- Mom, it's rice.
- Oh, it's plain rice.

147
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,040
Why didn't I make porridge?

148
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,360
Stop nitpicking me so much.
Let's eat. It's tasty.

149
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,480
Mom, chopsticks.

150
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,200
Eh? Wrong way.

151
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,280
Wrong way round.

152
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,600
Eat up, eat up.

153
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,160
Babe, can you pass me that?

154
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,240
Don't stick the chopsticks in like that!

155
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,120
It's like sticking them
in rice for the dead.

156
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,960
I just didn't know where to put them.
There's no space.

157
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,880
Here.

158
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
- Hey, Mom?
- What?

159
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,600
Why don't you scold her for that?

160
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,000
When I did it, you yelled at me.

161
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,640
She said she didn't know.

162
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,680
Come on.

163
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,080
Next time, don't do that, okay?

164
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,800
It's like lighting incense for the dead.

165
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,720
Well, when I did it, I didn't know either,
but you still kept nagging me!

166
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,360
Why do you have to nitpick everything?

167
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,400
Just eat.

168
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Eat up, dear. Go ahead.

169
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,400
Mom, can't you act normal?

170
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,360
I am acting normal.

171
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,120
Eh? Oh no!

172
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,760
Wrong way. Here, this way. Like this.

173
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,960
Yeah, this is already right.
It's right. It is.

174
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,400
Mm, eat, eat.

175
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,680
Wan, can you zip me up?

176
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,680
Sure.

177
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,440
Are you ready?

178
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,280
Well…

179
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,760
I guess so.

180
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,080
Don't worry.

181
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,480
We'll get through this together.

182
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,720
I'll always be by your side, Maewnam.

183
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,680
Miss Sudteerak requests to see you.

184
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,080
Hello.

185
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,360
Have a seat.

186
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,120
What is it?

187
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,000
Well, I just wanted to let you know

188
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,120
it'll take me about two years
to pay off my debt.

189
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,400
Money's not a problem.

190
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,800
I understand.

191
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,760
I just wanted to inform you.

192
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Also, today,

193
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,360
Maewnam wants to talk to you about
why she's not continuing her PhD.

194
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,120
Hear her out, please.

195
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll excuse myself now.

196
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,720
Go ahead.

197
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,880
What's your reason?

198
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,520
Wan is not the reason
I'm not studying anymore.

199
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,880
I didn't want to from the start.

200
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,320
But you're about to have
the chance to study.

201
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,080
That's a good future.

202
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,520
Good for who?

203
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,720
You or me?

204
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,240
All this time…

205
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,880
I've lived the way you wanted me to.

206
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,120
I tried to do everything.

207
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,320
I tried to study well.

208
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,080
I tried to make you proud.

209
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,240
But it's like

210
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,120
that day never comes.

211
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,920
I wait every day to hear you say,
"You're good."

212
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,280
But it never happens.

213
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,080
It's exhausting, Mom.

214
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,040
Now,

215
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,640
I just want to live my life
the way I want.

216
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,920
I want to do the things I want to do.

217
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,120
Can I?

218
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,440
Just once, can I do something for myself?

219
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,600
Can't we just be mother and daughter?

220
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,720
I don't even know…

221
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,760
if you love me.

222
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,480
That day I took you away…

223
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,240
it was because he didn't love us anymore.

224
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,319
Go then!

225
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,079
And don't ever come back.

226
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,839
I'm leaving anyway, no need to tell me!

227
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,839
Everything I have, I'm leaving it to you.

228
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,839
Consider it my stupid-ass mistake.

229
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,079
He had another woman…

230
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,400
and told me

231
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,000
it was because I made him feel inferior.

232
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,840
You think I can't earn my own way?!

233
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,320
All this time we've been together,
who's been earning for the family?!

234
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,360
- It's been me all along!
- Exactly!

235
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
But I think that's just an excuse.

236
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,400
Then go!

237
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,160
But let me talk to my daughter first.

238
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,440
No. You can't.

239
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,720
I won't let you.

240
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,080
Sudteerak is mine alone!

241
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,920
What's the point of crying?

242
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,160
There's no place
for the weak in this world.

243
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,920
If you're not strong…

244
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,440
you're totally worthless.

245
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,640
He said I was much more talented than him.

246
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,000
He…

247
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,000
He couldn't bear

248
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,680
to see me outshine him.

249
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,320
But you know what?

250
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,440
I was willing to give him everything

251
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,320
except you, Maewnam.

252
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
I always told you

253
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,400
that if we're skilled and strong,

254
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,480
we can live without pain.

255
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,880
But I was wrong.

256
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Today, I'm the one causing you pain.

257
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,840
I love you, Mom.

258
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,720
It's because we never talked.

259
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,720
No.

260
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,600
It's me.

261
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,400
I've always done things my way.

262
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,920
It's okay, Mom.

263
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm sorry too, for never talking to you.

264
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm sorry, Maewnam.

265
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,720
I'm sorry, dear.

266
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,160
It's okay, Mom.

267
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,520
SOM SALON

268
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,400
Mmm, they loaded us up with shrimp.

269
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,800
Yeah.

270
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,120
- Oh, jeez!
- Ugh!

271
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,280
Forget it! Maybe
you shouldn't eat anymore.

272
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,240
Stop messing with it. The food's ruined!

273
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,200
What's with you, huh?

274
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,880
- The lottery hasn't even come out yet.
- It has nothing to do with that.

275
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,800
It's just, today Chompoo brought
Tonnam over for a meal.

276
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,880
- And?
- Then Chompoo said I was acting weird.

277
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,000
Did you freak out at her or something?

278
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,600
No! I didn't squeal.
I didn't yell a single word.

279
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,880
I… I just…

280
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
I just didn't know how to act.

281
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,400
So that means you're okay
with them now, right?

282
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,200
Oh, come on.

283
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,720
You don't have to put on an act.

284
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,160
Do what you want to do. Just be yourself.

285
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,920
Make her feel you're genuinely okay.

286
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,760
Right?

287
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,000
- Exactly!
- Yeah.

288
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,680
I can just do what I want.

289
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,480
Of course you can, Ms. Som Salon.

290
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,400
Eat.

291
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,640
Okay.

292
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,240
- Are you feeling at ease now?
- Yes. Thank you so much.

293
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,560
All this time,

294
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,600
you've always been fixing things
for others,

295
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,120
but this time,

296
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,200
I wanted to help fix your relationship.

297
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,360
Also, there's something
I need to tell you.

298
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,640
From now on,

299
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,120
I might not need to restock
the store anymore.

300
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,880
Why?

301
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,640
While you were talking to your mom,

302
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,000
my old client called me.

303
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,520
They invited me to work

304
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,560
in Japan.

305
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,200
When I first opened this store,

306
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,160
it was fun.

307
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,960
But now, I kind of miss office work.

308
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,360
The most tiring part back then
was commuting.

309
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,480
The most stressful part
was meeting daily deadlines.

310
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,000
But once the work was done,
there was no stress overnight.

311
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,280
I had fixed days off.

312
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,720
At the end of the month,
I just waited for my salary.

313
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,120
But now that I have my own business,

314
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
sure, I don't have
to take orders from anyone,

315
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,920
and it's true that I don't have to
commute and get tired,

316
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,040
but I have to remember that
if I take a day off,

317
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,080
the income stops too.

318
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,160
I went from never worrying about money
to constantly wondering,

319
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,200
"Will this month's sales be okay?"

320
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,120
"Will I be able to pay debts?"

321
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,960
"Will I make a profit or a loss?"

322
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,680
So that means running the store
is stressful for you.

323
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,560
Honestly, it's a different kind of stress.

324
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,360
I can't say which is better.

325
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,680
I just feel like my Japanese skills
are going to waste.

326
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,680
So you'd rather work in Japan
than stay here anyway?

327
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,440
There you go, overthinking for me again.

328
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,400
Nope! I'm not overthinking.

329
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
You're not?

330
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,000
You're telling the truth?

331
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,480
But hey, you put this upside down.

332
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,240
Now it's obvious you're stressed.

333
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm sorry.

334
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,640
But honestly, I'm not stressed about this.

335
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,200
I'm more stressed about us.

336
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,720
About us?

337
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,560
I just wonder if I really go,
what will happen to us?

338
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,360
We'll just keep dating like this.

339
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,760
There's nothing to worry about.

340
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,920
No matter what, I'll always support you.

341
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,800
And I'll be happy for all your successes.

342
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,800
I really don't want her to go!
What did I just say to her?

343
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,840
What should I say?

344
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,360
"Wan, I think you shouldn't go
because if we're apart,

345
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,440
we'll end up missing each other too much."

346
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,480
No, wait.

347
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,800
"Wan,

348
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,280
how about we focus on
running the store together?"

349
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,960
"It could be successful."

350
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,160
I do want you to go,

351
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,400
but at the same time, I don't!

352
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,520
Maewnam!

353
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,520
What's up, Wan?

354
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,320
You've got time today?

355
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,640
Well, my friend's leaving Thailand,

356
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,160
so no matter how busy I am,
I have to make time to see her.

357
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,880
Thantara-san.

358
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,600
I'm secretly happy
you're going back to work,

359
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,840
but I'm also a bit sad.

360
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,960
Hey, I'm just going to work,
not settling down there.

361
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,320
You never know. If it doesn't work out,
I might come back and run the store again.

362
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,560
Nothing is certain.

363
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,080
But your life swings around a lot.

364
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,880
At the start of the year,
you worked in Sathorn.

365
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,840
Suddenly, you're running a store
in Phukhao Thong.

366
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,600
And at the end of the year,
you're going to Japan.

367
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
Look at me.

368
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,520
My life's stuck in the same loop.

369
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,400
Seeing clients, examining witnesses,
and going to court.

370
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,840
If I win, I'm happy.

371
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,440
If I lose, I get scolded over and over.

372
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,120
I want to do something else too.

373
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,360
How about this?

374
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,800
You can take over my store.

375
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,600
That'd be nice.
I wouldn't have to close it.

376
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
No thanks.

377
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,080
I'm not cut out to be a store owner.
I'll just be your customer.

378
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,760
Oh, but I didn't just come
to see you today.

379
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,080
My client owns a bakery,
and the bread is amazing.

380
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,520
It must be, judging from
that big grin on your face.

381
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,240
And it looks good too, huh?

382
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,200
It's probably super sweet.

383
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,520
Oh, shut up.

384
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,520
Want to eat together?
Or have you already had enough?

385
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,880
All right. I've got all the answers
I need from you now.

386
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,920
But I have one more question.
This is the last question.

387
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,400
Miss Thantara, have you ever regretted
the conflict with Mr. Pruk

388
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,560
that led to you leaving
your previous workplace?

389
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,040
I see.

390
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,480
I consider my previous workplace

391
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,000
a school that taught me many lessons.

392
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,840
Even though the outcome
was that I had to leave my job,

393
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,640
every decision we make is something

394
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,120
we must always be ready
to face the consequences of.

395
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,120
Hey! I passed!

396
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,480
Congrats!

397
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,040
I passed!

398
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,520
I'm about to cry.

399
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,400
Tell me honestly.

400
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,560
If I had to go, would you want me to?

401
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,000
Honestly,

402
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
who'd want to be away from their partner?

403
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,440
But this is about your future, Wan.

404
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,560
No one has the right
to stop you from going.

405
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,080
Thank you.

406
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,480
But

407
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:57,360
I'll make every second we spend together
the happiest from now on!

408
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,600
You said it!

409
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,520
Ta-da! Maewnam Service
is temporarily closed.

410
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,160
Don't you have to go teach?

411
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,520
Nope. Someone's covering for me.

412
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,480
Why are we spacing out now?

413
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,040
Professor Maewnam is on vacation.

414
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,920
This week, you get to study with me.

415
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,960
Don't forget there's a quiz
at the end of class.

416
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,480
If you're not ready for the lesson,
you can leave now.

417
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,320
I've prepared everything.

418
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,800
All that's left is you.

419
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,840
Tell me where you want to go,
what you want to do.

420
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,960
Make a list.

421
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,760
Well, then…

422
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,160
Before this, I might have said
some things the wrong way

423
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,200
and acted awkwardly.

424
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,440
Maybe I made you uncomfortable, Tonnam.

425
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,160
It's okay.

426
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,400
That's why I got little gifts
for both of you.

427
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,440
Fern.

428
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,480
What is it?

429
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,520
Bring me the bags I picked.
They're at the back.

430
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,160
- Yes, the ones bought together.
- Here you are.

431
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,800
Yeah. Thanks.

432
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,080
- This one is for you, Tonnam.
- Thank you.

433
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,080
- And this one is for you.
- Thank you.

434
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,800
Take a look.
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

435
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,680
What were you thinking,
buying me something like this?

436
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,040
It was just a feeling.

437
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,480
I thought you seemed sweet,
so a dress might suit you.

438
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,400
And Tonnam has got a cool vibe,
so a T-shirt and jeans felt right.

439
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,320
A manly look, you know.

440
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,200
It's okay. Thank you so much.

441
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,240
- I'll go try them on.
- Sure.

442
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
What? What's with that face?

443
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,600
Did I do something wrong again?

444
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,480
Then what am I supposed to do?

445
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,920
Mom, you don't have to do anything.

446
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,680
Just see us as Tonnam and Chompoo,
just like before. That's enough.

447
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,120
Like the other day when Tonnam
stuck chopsticks in the rice,

448
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,440
you can scold her for that.

449
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,960
Are you crazy?

450
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,880
We just made peace,
and you want me to scold her?

451
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,280
It could turn into some mother-in-law
vs daughter-in-law thing.

452
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,120
There's no mother-in-law here.
No daughter-in-law.

453
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,840
Just Tonnam and Chompoo as a couple.

454
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,720
Don't overthink it.

455
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,880
Praise us when we're right
and tell us off when we're wrong.

456
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,200
Just be normal.

457
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,320
And what exactly is "normal"?

458
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,400
Just normal.

459
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,640
Not extreme one way or the other.

460
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,840
We're all normal people,
and we just want to be treated normally.

461
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,880
That's it.

462
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,800
Got it?

463
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,800
I'm trying to.

464
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,040
I'm trying to understand.

465
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,080
But thanks for buying it anyway.

466
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,240
No worries.

467
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,560
But if you don't like it,
you don't have to wear it.

468
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,960
I'm not good at this thing, you know.

469
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,600
What about Tonnam?

470
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,680
I think what you were wearing earlier
looked better than this outfit.

471
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,960
I'm sorry.
I'll find you something else next time.

472
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,680
It's really fine.

473
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,000
I think this outfit's nice,

474
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,920
and I'm happy you've finally accepted me.

475
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,600
Thank you so much.

476
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,800
All right.

477
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,400
I'll go get some nice cold drinks.
Good idea, huh?

478
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,080
Sweet and icy. I'll be right back.

479
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,760
SOM SALON

480
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,440
Go change. I don't like it.

481
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,680
If you want me to change,
then come change it for me.

482
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,400
Of course.

483

CHUM-LAE GROCERY

484
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,960
Ready for our date, beautiful?

485
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,960
Yes.

486
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,560
I've been ready since yesterday.

487
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,200
I just had my nails done.

488
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,040
This color's pretty.

489
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,160
Oh, yeah?

490
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,120
- I've booked a table.
- Your name, please.

491
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,560
Sudteerak. Table for two, please.

492
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,680
One moment, please.

493
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,520
This is scallop steak
with pomegranate sauce.

494
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,240
And this one's seared tuna
with cha-om sour curry paste.

495
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,880
Please enjoy your meal.

496
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,240
Grandpa once brought me here.

497
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,600
I see.

498
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,960
So you like this kind of place?

499
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,120
I can't afford it.

500
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Thank you.

501
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,040
Good?

CHUM-LAE GROCERY

503
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,560
You weren't full after dinner earlier?

504
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,920
This feels much more comfortable.

505
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,320
I guess I'll be eating alone after this.

506
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,880
Don't make that face.

507
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,320
I'll be fine.

508
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,800
Delicious?

509
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,920
Do you want some?

CHUM-LAE GROCERY

511
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,440
Is there space for this?

512
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,520
Here it comes.

513
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,640
Sticky rice.

514
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,200
I'm handing it out.

515
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,600
- Here. Put it here.
- Do you want sticky rice or rice noodles?

516
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,640
- Put it there. Over there.
- Here?

517
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,760
That's right.

518
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,200
Hey.

519
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,360
Wan's not here yet. Let's wait.

520
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,840
Right.

521
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,040
She's probably still talking to her boss.

522
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,160
I'll go get her.

523
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,880
Good idea, dear.

524
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,440
And don't sneak any.

525
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,040
I'm hungry already.

526
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,400
I see.

527
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,920
So that handsome guy who picked Chom up
from home the other day

528
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,800
was your younger brother?

529
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,760
Yes.

530
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,520
I'm sorry for lying for so long.

531
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,560
It's okay. I understand.

532
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,880
There must've been someone
who started all this mess.

533
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,880
Right? The main character, you know.

534
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,200
Mom, anyway, it's hot today.

535
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,320
Let's have something cold to cool down.

536
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,360
Come.

537
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,080
- Baifern, can you get some for Mom?
- Sure thing.

538
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,240
Yeah.

539
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,120
You're good at changing the subject.

540
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,120
Come on, sis.

541
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,680
- Hurry up.
- All right, all right.

542
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,920
Here, this one is for you.

543
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Hold it.

544
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,840
- This one is yours.
- Cheers!

545
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,960
Bottoms up, Mom?

546
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,840
Oh, you little rascal!

547
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,320
Are you drinking with Lam Yong,
the drunkard?

548
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,560
Mom, if you get drunk and sleep there,
I'll let the mosquitoes carry you home.

549
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,840
I'm not scared.

550
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,680
If you don't take me,
my daughter's girlfriend will, right?

551
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,760
I think I'd probably pass out
before you did.

552
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,720
Eh? Pfft, fine.

553
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,600
- Cheers! Cheers!
- Cheers.

554
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,280
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

555
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,000
Whoa. Whose mom is this?

556
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,160
Easy! This is nothing.
Let's continue drinking there.

557
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,080
Here I come.

558
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,080
Here I come.

559
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,800
- Wow, look at that spicy walk.
- Whoa. Well, well, well…

560
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,040
You're tipsy, huh?

561
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,560
I'm not tipsy. Where I'm from,
we call it a warm-up drink.

562
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,280
- Just a warm-up drink?
- Come.

563
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,520
Set your glass down.

564
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,280
- Come on. Give me a glass.
- Just a little.

565
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,000
My tongue's getting heavy.

566
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,640
I'm sorry.

567
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,600
I had some errands.

568
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,440
And thank you so much

569
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,920
for this farewell party.

570
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,160
You're just starting to speak,
and I'm already tearing up.

571
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,680
I've decided.

572
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,960
I'm not going.

573
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,560
Good luck.

574
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,600
I'm cheering you up.

575
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,760
Wait.

576
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,040
Eh? Wait.

577
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,160
What was that?

578
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,520
At first, I thought running
a grocery store wasn't fun at all.

579
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,080
I needed to adjust so much.

580
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,200
And honestly, I missed office life.

581
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,840
I missed being an office girl.

582
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,480
Lunching out during the day,
then hitting the gym in the evening.

583
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,200
When I got the job offer from Japan,

584
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,000
I was happy and also glad

585
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,400
that I'd get to return to the job
I had run away from.

586
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,720
But thinking it over,

587
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,960
if I really have to close it down,
I feel a pang in my heart.

588
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,960
Most importantly,

589
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,720
everyone here has shown me
that I'm valued,

590
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,360
and I'm happy to live here.

591
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,600
I've met someone I love…

592
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,240
and I've been loved by many.

593
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,920
So I'll keep the store
and stay here forever.

594
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,120
Wow, the sky just turned pink.

595
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,640
Whoa. I can see that.

596
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,320
I'm not leaving you anymore.

597
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,560
Aw!

598
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,800
I can't. I want to join them.

599
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,680
- Aw.
- Oh, hey!

600
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
Aye.

601
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,920
I'm so happy.

602
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,960
- Here.
- Oh, hey.

603
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,040
Let's just stay together.

604
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,160
- Come, come.
- Let's stay together.

605
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,680
Hey, Som, this is pretty, right?

606
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,400
I'll give it to Maewnam.

607
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,520
Do you like it? You do?

608
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,920
Today you'll be Cupid, okay?

609
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,880
No acting suspicious.

610
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,600
Let me put it on for you.

611
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,400
Don't lose it.

612
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,080
Watch the store for me, all right?

613
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Don't go anywhere.

614
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,720
I'm just going to check
my hair and makeup.

615
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,960
Som?

616
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,920
Som!

617
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,880
Som!

618
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,120
Meow, meow!

619
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,040
- Som!
- Wan!

620
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,800
Can I help you?

621
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,360
Have you seen Som?

622
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,280
I put her right here just now,
and now she's gone.

623
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,760
She comes and goes all the time.

624
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,000
- No need to look. She'll be back.
- No, no!

625
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,200
I have to find her!

626
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,440
Uh… I don't know.

627
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,280
Anyway, if you see her, tell me.

628
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,760
Please help me look.

629
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,320
Som!

630
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,920
Som!

631
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,720
Where did she go?

632
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,320
Som!

633
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,240
Wan.

634
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,320
I found this mischievous one.

635
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,960
Hey!

636
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,720
What? Aren't you happy I found her?

637
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,920
Well, I'm happy.

638
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,880
Where did you find her?

639
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,440
Over there.

640
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,520
Over there?

641
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,760
Is something wrong?

642
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,120
- Som…
- Were you looking for something?

643
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,720
Uh… no.

644
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,880
I'm just glad you found her.

645
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,720
Where did you put the thing, Som?

646
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,920
Were you looking for this?

647
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,520
Our hearts think alike.

648
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,320
You're so sneaky.
Are you in cahoots with Som?

649
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,000
Nope.

650
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,840
Our hearts are just aligned.

651
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,600
Wan.

652
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,200
What is it, Sudteerak?

653
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,440
Is this place selling love too?

654
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,960
Not anymore.

655
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,480
Oh? Why?!

656
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,760
That's because
I already gave it all to you.

657
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,800
In life, we all have to face change.

658
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,400
Change that ends one thing
and starts another.

659
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,920
Growth is something that's always been
part of being human.

660
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,600
The desire to be better, to be stronger,

661
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,360
pushes us to become
a more complete version of ourselves

662
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,800
than we were yesterday.

663
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,360
Some people want to improve
for themselves.

664
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,400
Some want to improve for others.

665
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,080
Have you ever heard the saying,

666
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,800
"When one door closes,
another one always opens"?

667
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,600
The end of something can also be
the good beginning of some stories.

668
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,200
- Would you like a bag?
- No, thanks.

669
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,720
Thank you so much for your purchase.

670
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,000
- CONGRATULATIONS

00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,040
It's delicious with coffee, Counselor.

673
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,000
Don't be afraid of change

674
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,120
because every change brings
something good waiting for you.

675
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,480
Here's your iced, sweet drink.

676
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,560
Encouragement?
