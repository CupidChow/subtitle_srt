1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,280
<i>I'm so lucky.</i>

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,640
<i>Like with this store,</i>
<i>if it weren't for Maewnam…</i>

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,680
<i>She works part-time jobs in the morning.</i>

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,800
<i>She even teaches in the evening.</i>
<i>She's amazing.</i>

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,640
- Admit it.
- What?

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,760
You like that girl Maewnam now, don't you?

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,760
<i>If you're unsure whether you like someone,</i>
<i>just try hugging them.</i>

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,440
But for some people,
it might go as far as a kiss.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,480
A kiss?

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,320
You're into older ones again, huh?

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Not "again."

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,760
<i>Just… once more.</i>

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,440
<i>The night it rained and there was</i>
<i>a student crying right here.</i>

14
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,200
<i>Do you remember, Wan?</i>

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,000
That student

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,200
was you?

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,360
Uh-huh.

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,840
Every time it rains,

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,360
I remember that night.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,520
My beautiful grocery sister.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,120
Ugh! It's getting wet!

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,920
Here. Dry yourself first,
or you'll get sick.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,640
Thank you.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,280
Is something wrong?

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,840
At first, I didn't recognize you,

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,760
but now I look closer,
your face seems familiar.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,160
Oh, you're looking at my face.

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,520
I thought…

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,040
What?

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,160
Nothing.

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,600
What happened that day?

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,440
But if you don't want to
talk about it, it's okay.

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,560
That day, my parents separated.

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,400
At the time, I didn't understand
why it had to happen.

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,240
It felt like

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,320
I was about to lose
the most important thing in my life.

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,040
It felt like the love my parents had
for each other was a lie,

38
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,000
or like maybe it was because of me.

39
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,400
Was I about to lose love from one of them

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,320
or from both of them?

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,840
But as I got older,

42
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,480
I realized that it wasn't about me.

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,240
And… are you okay now?

44
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm okay now.

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,360
But look at you.

46
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,760
You told me to dry my hair,
but you're still soaking wet yourself.

47
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,880
- Here.
- It's okay. Go ahead and dry off first.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,200
I only have one towel.

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,520
How come?

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,440
Well, I only just moved in and live alone,
so I didn't bring extras.

51
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,440
Oh, come on.

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,680
- Dry off first, or you'll get sick.
- It's fine. You take it.

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,240
When I get back to my condo,
I'll bring like ten towels next time.

54
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,600
How stubborn you are.

55
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,480
Fine, let's dry off together.

56
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,800
Here. Dry off now, or you'll get sick.

57
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
It's okay.

58
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,680
I think the rain has stopped.

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,280
I can finish drying off back at my dorm.

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,839
Bye-bye.

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,800
I'm so happy!

62
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Hey, sis, do you have any fermented pork?

63
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,600
Yes, I do.

64
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,160
Oh, I'm not actually buying it.

65
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,320
I'm just asking.

66
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,520
I'm here for something else.

67
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,080
Come on, let's go.

68
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,320
Don't take her stuff.

69
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,840
I'm just messing around, you know.

70
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,920
What are you even doing, Maewnam?
You've been working on that forever.

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm just making something
to return to her.

72
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
Her? Who's "her"?

73
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,760
Don't tell me it's that grocery sister.

74
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,240
Uh-huh.

75
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,480
So you're making something to give back?

76
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,600
Does that mean
she gave you something first?

77
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,000
Look!

78
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,520
Wan made two of these

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,640
so I can wear one and match Som.

80
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,760
No wonder you've been looking
so in love lately.

81
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,720
Pinky, do you want one too?

82
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,200
I'll make one for you.

83
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,240
I mean, I kinda do,

84
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,480
but I don't want my mom to see.

85
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,640
Huh? Why not?

86
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,960
What happened?

87
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,200
Babe, that day after your brother
came to pick me up,

88
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,920
I got interrogated like crazy.

89
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
Are you two dating yet?

90
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,800
Who asked who out first?

91
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,640
I told you, we're not!

92
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Oh, don't be shy with your mom.

93
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
Have you guys fought sometimes?

94
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
We're not dating!

95
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,640
So, have you kissed yet?

96
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,840
Ugh! I said we're not dating!

97
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,360
What? Come on, just date already.

98
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,640
I want you to have a boyfriend.

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,760
He's a good one! I approve.
His skin is, like, glowing white.

100
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,600
Now, whatever I do, whether it's eating,
sleeping, or using the bathroom,

101
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,000
she's always asking.

102
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,600
Serves her right that the grocery girl
insulted her the other day.

103
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,560
I think your mom's hilarious.

104
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,720
She cracks me up.

105
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
I wish I had a funny mom like yours.

106
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,160
Do you want to trade?

107
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,320
I do!

108
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
Honestly though,

109
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,520
your mom seems pretty open-minded.

110
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Don't you think you should tell her
about you and Tonnam dating?

111
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,000
Your mom might actually be okay with it.

112
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,880
She's only open-minded with other people,

113
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,360
not with her own kid.

114
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,920
Have you tried talking to her?

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,640
Not yet.

116
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,160
Hey, Maewnam,
can I crash at your place sometime?

117
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,360
I'm tired of my mom.

118
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,240
Sure, but do you really think
you can escape your mom?

119
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,160
No way!

120
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,240
Ugh, why did you say something
that cuts so deep, huh?

121
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,600
Babe, comfort me, please.

122
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,640
It's okay, Pinky.

123
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,320
Don't listen to her.

124
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,559
Ow!

125
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,520
Too sweet.

126
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,080
Can you two lovebirds
go somewhere else, please?

127
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,440
Damn! I want to date someone too!

128
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,600
Eh?

129
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,000
You have that grocery store sis,
don't you?

130
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,400
Calm down. I don't even know
if she likes women or men yet.

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,400
Then you have to check.

132
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,520
But go in naturally. No being obvious!

133
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,080
But don't be too subtle either.

134
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,400
Here's what I suggest.
Two killer moves.

135
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,080
Step 1: Skinship.

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,480
Get close. Give a gentle touch
to stir something in them.

137
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,960
Watch their reaction.

138
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,360
And if they look you in the eye,
go to Step 2. Manifesting.

139
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,480
Say, "I love you. You love me."

140
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,880
Just think it. Don't say it out loud.

141
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,920
Stay positive and believe it's possible.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,960
And don't laugh.

143
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,880
The pull of the universe's energy
will help you succeed.

144
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,920
Will that actually work?

145
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,840
Of course!

146
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,640
It's the law of manifesting.

147
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,920
I mean, I don't know if it really works,

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,040
but thinking positively
is better than thinking negatively, right?

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,520
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

150
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,320
- I'll go grab some drinks.
- Okay.

151
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,560
Excuse me.

152
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,880
Wait, no ice?

153
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,880
Should we order some?

154
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,560
It's okay. I'll go buy it.

155
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,600
I'll grab something else too.

156
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,160
Something to deal with too much sweetness.

157
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,760
Help me open this. You two eat first.

158
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,240
Okay, hurry back.

159
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,280
YUTH PANICH

160
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,440
Did I drop it?

161
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,960
Where is it? There were a bunch of coins.

162
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,320
Where could they have gone?

163
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,280
Wan, what are you doing?

164
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,440
Uh… I think I lost some money.

165
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,240
I had a lot this morning.

166
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,160
But look, now there's barely half left.

167
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,520
Eh?

168
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,440
But this morning, I had three customers
who seemed kinda sketchy.

169
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,600
One stood here talking on the phone,

170
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,160
<i>and the other two were just</i>
<i>walking around the store.</i>

171
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,720
I wasn't really being careful though.

172
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
Should we file a report?

173
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm not sure.

174
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,120
I could be remembering it wrong.

175
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,160
Wan.

176
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,400
Do you want a security camera?

177
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,560
I can help set one up.

178
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,640
Is the footage showing?

179
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,480
Yeah, it's up.

180
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,800
Is it clear?

181
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,440
It's crystal clear.

182
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,640
Okay.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,560
And if they look you in the eye,
go to Step 2. Manifesting.

184
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,560
Say, "I love you. You love me."

185
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,040
Just think it. Don't say it out loud.

186
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,880
Stay positive and believe it's possible.

187
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,720
<i>Perfect timing!</i>

188
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,640
<i>I love you. You love me.</i>

189
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,760
<i>I love you.</i>

190
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,040
<i>You love me.</i>

191
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,320
<i>I love you.</i>

192
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,400
<i>Oh, it's really working, huh?</i>

193
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,560
<i>I love you--</i>

194
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,560
Ugh, it's so dusty!

195
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,400
<i>I shouldn't have trusted those two.</i>

196
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,640
All done!

197
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,640
Can you come down?

198
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,800
Yup, yup!

199
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,440
I'll put the ladder away.

200
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,760
Here, your payment,

201
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,160
and a shampoo, free gift for you.

202
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,160
Hey, this is the shampoo I use!

203
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,160
Oh? Were you secretly sniffing it?

204
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,240
I just wanted to make sure
you're not all grubby.

205
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,000
Of course I'm not.

206
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,840
I shower and wash my hair daily.

207
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,040
Smells nice, right?

208
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,840
You can't smell it?

209
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Smells good, huh?

210
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,320
Yeah.

211
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,480
No need to make me sniff it.

212
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,280
If you say so, I believe you.

213
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,480
I'm an easy believer.

214
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,120
Okay! If there's ever a day
you don't believe me,

215
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,600
you can come sniff my hair.

216
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,080
Anytime.

217
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,840
Maewnam, did you forget your stuff?

218
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,120
Nope. I brought this for you.

219
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,360
Oh. I actually needed one.

220
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,600
Thanks.

221
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,320
<i>Eh? Why doesn't she look happy?</i>

222
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,840
Did Maewnam go all the way
to the North Pole to get ice?

223
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,360
Or maybe my mom intercepted her
and made her help buy things?

224
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,200
Just thinking of my mom gives me chills.

225
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,320
Chom.

226
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,880
Chom, when are you going to
tell your mom about us?

227
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,240
We've been together
almost three years now.

228
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,880
I'm trying to find the right time
to tell her.

229
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,360
I'm not trying to pressure you,

230
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,680
but right now, it feels like
I can't see our future at all.

231
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,560
Guys!

232
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,720
I tried that method you told me about
with the grocery store sister.

233
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
How did it go?

234
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,240
I don't know.

235
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,280
Things weren't clear.

236
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,480
Like, there was some touching,

237
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,440
but only because it was necessary.

238
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,440
When I tried flirting,

239
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,360
she acted all taciturn.

240
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,880
But…

241
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,720
I'm not giving up yet!

242
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,480
I'm going to make
that grocery sister fall for me!

243
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,320
That's my girl!

244
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,200
Wait, where's the ice?

245
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,000
Oops.

246
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,440
I forgot.

247
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,120
Ugh.

248
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,480
AWESOME

249
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,080
Som.

250
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,360
Do you think something is wrong with me?

251
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,280
Come, let's talk.

252
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,680
Do you think I'm weird?

253
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,760
Ugh, you're not even paying attention.

254
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,440
Okay, fine.

255
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,119
Here.

256
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,200
This way we can actually talk.

257
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,200
Pick one, okay?

258
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,200
Help give me the answer.

259
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,440
Do I miss her?

260
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,840
Hey! Why'd you pick that one?

261
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,920
Let's do it again.

262
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,160
Switch, switch.

263
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,800
Think carefully this time.

264
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
Pick again.

265
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,800
Som, do you think…

266
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,200
I have feelings for Maewnam?

267
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,640
This one again?

268
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,280
Do you like this one or something?

269
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,480
Is that why you keep picking it?

270
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,960
Wait.

271
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,640
Do I actually have feelings for Maewnam?

272
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,800
Don't look at me like that.

273
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,120
Sis, can I have some cold sweet drink?

274
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Hey, sis, do you sell trash bags?

275
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,160
Sure. Come on, follow me.

276
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,120
<i>This is the moment.</i>
<i>They're definitely going to grab it.</i>

277
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,400
Here are some drinks.
Take whatever you need, please.

278
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,120
And the trash bags are right here.

279
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,920
Here you are.

280
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,840
There! See? It's really gone.

281
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,440
What's gone?

282
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,440
When you guys came in earlier,
there were still bills in here.

283
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,560
Now there's nothing left.

284
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,000
Hey, don't say stuff like that carelessly.
Do you have any proof?

285
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,280
Proof?

286
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,520
Fine. Give me a second.

287
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,720
Here.

288
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,920
What do you mean, "took something"?

289
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,240
You're seriously making stuff up.
Take a look yourself.

290
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,880
See?

291
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,640
Next time, check your facts
before accusing people.

292
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,960
Forget it.

293
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,640
We're not buying anything here anymore.

294
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,200
Next time, let's not even set foot
in a store like this.

295
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,560
Hey, let's go.

296
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,960
Don't ever come back to a place like this.
The owner's got a terrible attitude.

297
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,360
STARTING FRESH

298
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,240
What happened, Wan?

299
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,200
Well, I accused those guys
of stealing my money,

300
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,560
but it turned out they didn't.

301
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,440
Did you check the security footage?

302
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,440
Yeah, I did.

303
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
That's how I found out
who actually took it.

304
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,480
It was F1?

305
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,640
Babe, I'm sorry.

306
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,440
This morning, I got grilled again
about your brother.

307
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,280
"Where are you two going?" "How will you
get there?" "Isn't he picking you up?"

308
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,160
I had to come up with a whole story
just to get out of it.

309
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,720
If it's really that much trouble,

310
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,800
you can cancel our plans next time.

311
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,920
No, no, it's not like that.

312
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,920
I'm not mad.

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,120
I'm okay.

314
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,400
I just think

315
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,520
you should do
whatever makes you feel comfortable.

316
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,560
Really, I'm totally okay.

317
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,760
But since you're already here,

318
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,840
it's fine, okay?

319
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,000
Don't be so down.

320
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Do you want to eat something?
Should we order now?

321
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,680
Excuse me, can we have a menu, please?

322
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,040
Thank you.

323
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,480
I don't know what to do about this.

324
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,640
I think I need to tell Pin.

325
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,800
Wait, Wan.

326
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,600
I don't think you should.

327
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Why not?

328
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,440
She's the one who told me that if anything
happened, I should be honest with her.

329
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,480
I just think if Pin finds out about this,
it's not going to go well.

330
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,040
So we're just going to ignore it?

331
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,560
F1 will think he can get away with it
and do it again to someone else.

332
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,320
I'm not saying we should
let F1 get away with it

333
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,840
and go around doing the same thing again.

334
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,480
I just think that maybe
Pin shouldn't know about this.

335
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,760
Why?

336
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,520
You've seen it yourself.

337
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,920
She's a single mom, raising her kid alone.

338
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,160
Her husband left when F1 was still little.

339
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,880
She wakes up early
to go to the market alone,

340
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,760
buy ingredients, and cook food to sell.

341
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,040
Some days she sells,
and some days she doesn't.

342
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,000
And with the economy like this…

343
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,960
I get that.

344
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,360
But I don't think
it's the right way to handle this.

345
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,920
Even if she's a single mom,

346
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,080
if her kid did something wrong,
she deserves to know.

347
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,080
Being a single parent isn't a free pass
for her child to do anything wrong

348
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,120
without her finding out about it.

349
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,840
You're right.

350
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,440
But I just understand where she's coming
from, as another human being.

351
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,040
I know how people around here are.

352
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,800
F1 might have had some deeper reason
for taking the money too.

353
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,720
So if you get your money back,

354
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,160
you're not going to tell Pin?

355
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,920
Let me try talking to F1 first.

356
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Wan, what are you doing here?

357
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,040
Didn't we agree you'd talk to F1 first?

358
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,680
I'm just here to eat.

359
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,400
I know they're struggling,

360
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,000
so I wanted to support the place.

361
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,360
F1, bring me a plate.

362
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,400
Just a sec.

363
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,920
Stop playing games and get me a plate!

364
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,040
Can you hear me?!

365
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,080
You're always playing games all day.

366
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,640
Where do you even get the money
to top up like that?

367
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,560
Hey, take it easy, okay?

368
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,360
Just talk to F1 first.

369
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,280
F1.

370
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,760
Yes?

371
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,560
Can we talk for a sec?

372
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,040
What about?

373
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,280
It's not really something
we should talk about here.

374
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,680
F1, did you steal money from my store
to top up your game?

375
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,640
Calm down.

376
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,880
Let's just talk this through slowly.

377
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm calm, Maewnam.

378
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,080
I just want to talk to him directly.

379
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,240
Answer me.

380
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

381
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,640
I'm giving you a chance to come clean.

382
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,320
The other day, money went missing
from the jar on my counter,

383
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,480
so I installed a security camera.

384
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,680
And now, I know who took it.

385
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,120
Sis.

386
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,920
Please don't tell my mom.

387
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,400
I'm begging you,

388
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,920
don't tell her.

389
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,360
You stole her money?

390
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,880
Why did you do something like that?! Huh?

391
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,160
How much did he take? I'll pay it back.

392
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,480
Pin, we can talk through this calmly.

393
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,480
How much?

394
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,720
Around 500 baht.

395
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,800
Where did you learn to behave like this?!

396
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,680
Who taught you to be a thief, huh?

397
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,720
Babe, I could've stayed a bit longer

398
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,720
to make up for being late.

399
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
It's okay.

400
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,240
If you get home late, your mom will call

401
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,400
and you'll have to
lie to her again, Pinky.

402
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,960
You can save your lie quota
for another day, okay?

403
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,280
All right, I'll go then.

404
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,200
Yeah.

405
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
You're really not mad, right?

406
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,240
I'm not.

407
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,760
Okay, go,

408
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,200
before your mom starts calling again.

409
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,560
Just go.

410
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,040
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

411
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,880
SOM SALON

412
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
- Mom, hi.
- Hello, sweetie.

413
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,680
- Time to touch up your roots?
- Yes.

414
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,960
I can't let them go patchy like that.

415
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,840
- It looks messy.
- That's right.

416
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,960
But once I hit 70, my scalp
won't tolerate chemicals anymore,

417
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,480
so I'll agree to let it fade
just like my grandma's.

418
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,840
But let's not hope too hard.
Will you even live to 70?

419
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,320
Hey! Of course I will.

420
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,680
- I'm just joking.
- I will, of course!

421
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,360
If you're getting your hair dyed,
take off your glasses and earrings.

422
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,240
Oh no! You didn't remind me.

423
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,440
Can I leave the earrings on?

424
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,360
<i>Let me know when you get home.</i>

425
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,160
These days, everyone's into that
smoky white-gray bleach look.

426
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,680
Really? Do kids these days
want to look old?

427
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,240
It's just fashion, sis!

428
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,640
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
- Boy, I don't understand!

429
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,040
Ooh, I've got some gossip.

430
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,720
F1, Pin's son, stole money
from Wan's store today.

431
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,240
What?! Seriously?

432
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
My goodness.

433
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,240
Pin's always busy working. She probably
has no time to teach her kid right.

434
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,880
And you know, this is such a critical age.
It's dangerous.

435
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,880
Well, not every family
turns out like that.

436
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,400
Look at Chompoo.

437
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,360
See? She's always been such a good kid.

438
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,720
She's never caused any trouble,

439
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,920
even though her dad passed away
when she was five.

440
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Right? She kept studying hard,
focused on her education,

441
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,680
and now she's even a professor
in your faculty, isn't she?

442
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,040
Mom, you're bringing this up again.

443
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,440
It's exhausting to hear, huh?

444
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,480
That's what teaching students
is like, right?

445
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,400
Yeah.

446
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,160
Now, you're acting like
you understand your daughter.

447
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,520
I can hear you, you know.

448
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,440
That's just how I am, Fern.

449
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,400
If my daughter wants something,
I give it to her. I always give in.

450
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,560
There was one year I received
a Model Mother Award.

451
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,200
When are you going to
tell your mom about us?

452
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,440
We've been together
for almost three years now.

453
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,280
- Really?
- Of course.

454
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,840
I'm a good example, you know.

455
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,640
Mom.

456
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,720
There's something I want to tell you.

457
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
I just feel bad.

458
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,360
At first, I was mad at F1.

459
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,160
But after seeing that fight
between him and his mom,

460
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
I feel awful.

461
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,200
Hey, don't be too hard on yourself.

462
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,720
I totally get why you were upset with him.

463
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,480
I mean, F1 really was being frustrating.

464
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,600
Yeah?

465
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,920
But kids his age are at a turning point.

466
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,040
There might be reasons why
he did what he did.

467
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,880
Reasons we don't know about.

468
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,640
What he did was wrong, absolutely.

469
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,080
I know he's wrong,

470
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,480
but maybe it's because
no one taught him better.

471
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,520
No one corrected him the right way.

472
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,920
People mess up. It happens.

473
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,040
But what matters is whether
they learn from it.

474
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,240
But honestly,
it's not just the kid who was wrong.

475
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,920
I was wrong too
for accusing them of stealing.

476
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,960
Just thinking about it
makes me feel awful.

477
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,480
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.

478
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,120
You were just trying to protect the store.

479
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,640
You did great, seriously.

480
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,760
Don't beat yourself up.

481
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,240
Thanks.

482
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,760
Thanks for not making me feel
worse than I already do.

483
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,640
Thanks for not piling it on.

484
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,520
Wan.

485
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,000
Um… Pin.

486
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,880
I shouldn't have caused that fight
between you and your son.

487
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,840
I'm sorry.

488
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,400
There might've been reasons
why he did what he did.

489
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,640
I talked to him.

490
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,560
<i>He told me that at school,</i>
<i>he has no friends.</i>

491
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,480
<i>They tease him every single day.</i>

492
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:16,040
<i>When he saw others playing games,</i>
<i>he wanted to join in,</i>

493
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,000
<i>but everyone else</i>
<i>had topped up their accounts.</i>

494
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,600
<i>He just wanted to be seen.</i>

495
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,280
<i>That's why he did it.</i>

496
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,120
I'm sorry.

497
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,360
It's my fault.

498
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,080
I've been busy,
so I haven't really talked to him.

499
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,080
I'm sorry.

500
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,720
It's okay.

501
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,640
People make mistakes.

502
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,680
Why are you standing here like that?

503
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,480
Are you seeing each other or something?

504
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,800
I was just checking the security footage.

505
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,400
Ooh, getting defensive, huh?

506
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,320
- Business going well, yeah?
- Right.

507
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,520
I'll go help out next time.

508
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,520
Uh-huh.

509
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,360
Come on, follow me in then.

510
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,960
I want to eat
basil stir-fry with a fried egg.

511
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,560
You do?

512
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,560
Grab whatever you want.

513
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,320
Why are you being so generous?

514
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,080
Just take it.

515
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
All right. I'll agree
because you keep asking me to.

516
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,960
You've helped me out so much

517
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,760
with the CCTV
and even just keeping me company.

518
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,880
This is just a little thank-you gift.

519
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Thanks a lot.

520
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,240
You've helped me understand a lot,

521
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,880
including the people here.

522
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,240
It's like you said.

523
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,120
F1 just wanted to feel seen.

524
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,520
When an opportunity came along,

525
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,840
he just took it,
without thinking about right or wrong.

526
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,200
Sometimes,
all people want is to feel valued.

527
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,480
<i>You keep running around</i>
<i>helping this person and that one.</i>

528
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,480
I honestly don't see
what good comes from it.

529
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,920
<i>You're an adult now.</i>

530
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
<i>You should know what matters</i>
<i>and what doesn't.</i>

531
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Hey, is something wrong?

532
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,120
I'm just wondering
if I should take all of this.

533
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,320
I haven't eaten anything decent
in a while.

534
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,960
I've been starving.

535
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,679
If you think you can eat them up,
go ahead.

536
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,800
I'm kidding.

537
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,480
Or maybe I should sell it all?

538
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,600
Hey, wait.

539
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,560
I've got to go teach.

540
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,840
I'll hurry back and bother you later.

541
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,719
Bye-bye.

542
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'll be waiting.

543
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,360
What was that?

544
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,360
I said it once.

545
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,280
Go already.

546
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,400
Say it again.

547
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,760
Nope! You'll be late.

548
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,520
Come on, one more time?

549
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Get going already.

550
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,280
Pedal safely.

551
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,560
That way. Over there!

552
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,880
- Yeah?
<i>- My little babe, are you home yet?</i>

553
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Yeah, I'm home.

554
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,440
Liar.

555
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,680
How did you know?

556
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,200
I've been your partner for so long, babe.
Why wouldn't I know?

557
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,120
I know when you're stressed,
you don't want to do anything.

558
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,600
You don't even want to move or drive.

559
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,520
I'm not stressed.

560
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,880
Come on.

561
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,000
Well, maybe just a little.

562
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,040
But I'm not stressed.

563
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,360
I just feel slighted, being in
a relationship that has to be kept secret.

564
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,120
I talked to my mom.

565
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,680
You talked to her

566
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,560
about us?

567
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,200
Something like that.

568
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,680
I told her I wanted to move into a condo,

569
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,160
because it would be easier
to commute to uni.

570
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,080
And she agreed.

571
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,480
So now, we can finally live together,
just the two of us.

572
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,160
No more hiding.

573
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,560
Isn't that great?

574
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,400
Why do you look like that?

575
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,400
Don't you want to live together?

576
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,240
It's not that.

577
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,200
I do want to.

578
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,720
But at first, I thought you had told her
about us, for real.

579
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,800
I've been trying to find
the right time to do that.

580
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,560
But hey, at least now we can be together.

581
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,160
That already means a lot, doesn't it?

582
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,680
I'll find the right moment
to tell her about us soon.

583
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,520
Yeah.

584
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,640
Just being able to stay together now
already means a lot.

585
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Can I pay for these, please?

586
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,760
Sure.

587
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,320
Soy milk, toothbrush, and toothpaste.

588
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,240
That's 100 baht in total.

589
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,520
Here you go.

590
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,000
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

591
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,720
Excuse me,

592
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,720
do you know any good places
to eat around here?

593
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,640
There's Pin's made-to-order stall
just over there.

594
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,960
It's on the left.

595
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,440
Or if you prefer snacks,
try Kung's Tokyo crepes.

596
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,680
They're so good!

597
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,880
Give it a try.

598
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
- Sounds great. Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

599
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,840
I'm pretty good at customer service, huh?

600
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,120
Wan, are you closing the store already?

601
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,880
Um, yeah.

602
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,800
Someone's inviting you
to a "Som Tam reconciliation party."

603
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,560
Huh?

604
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,920
This is grilled chicken,
and this is veggies.

605
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,040
- Whoa, looks delicious!
- Salad with spicy bamboo shoots!

606
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,240
Fern, go help her.

607
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,520
Okay, coming. Here you go.

608
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,480
Thank you.

609
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,920
If you want anything, just let me know.

610
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,880
I'll grab it for you.

611
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,360
That's enough, no need to walk around.

612
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,600
Just sit here, sweetie.

613
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,000
So, someone wanted to apologize
about her son

614
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,360
but wouldn't say it outright.

615
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,000
She had to use this
"reconciliation Som Tam" excuse.

616
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,240
Gosh, you're spilling everything.

617
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,920
Was I right or wrong to bring you along?

618
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,080
Right, of course! Bringing me
was the best idea you ever had.

619
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,880
The truth is,

620
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,880
we misunderstood you about so many things.

621
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,760
Maybe it's because we don't really
know each other that well yet.

622
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,320
So let's take today as a chance
to get to know each other better.

623
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,440
Fern, did I say it well?

624
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,280
You're the best.

625
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,520
You're my best duo.

626
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,680
Anyway, I'm sorry and thank you, truly.

627
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,320
Let's lighten the mood.

628
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,440
Fern, go grab those beers
we kept in the fridge.

629
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,560
- Go, go!
- Got it.

630
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,720
I'm just craving one.

631
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,200
So, what did you do
before opening this grocery store?

632
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,680
I was a secretary and interpreter
for an event company.

633
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,360
The company was based near Sathorn.

634
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,400
Whoa, you used to work in an office,

635
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,760
and now you're suddenly
running a grocery shop.

636
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,440
Wasn't it hard to adjust?

637
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,600
Honestly, it was confusing at first.

638
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,160
Still kind of is, to be honest.

639
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,920
I still don't know if I made
the right choice quitting my job.

640
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,880
Nah, this is just the transition period.

641
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,240
You haven't found your path yet,

642
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,280
so you're worried
you've made the wrong choice.

643
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,480
That's why you feel uneasy.

644
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,920
I used to work in an office too.

645
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,720
Then, suddenly, I got laid off.

646
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,760
I was totally lost back then.

647
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,800
On top of that, I stood as guarantor
for my younger brother.

648
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,680
I was already over 40.

649
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,440
Who would hire me at that point?

650
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,280
So I took my last savings
and started this shop.

651
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,560
I was worried at first if I could make it.

652
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,760
But in the end, I've managed

653
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,640
and even taken care of others too.

654
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,280
Anyway, what about you?

655
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,760
Got someone to take care of you yet?

656
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,120
Not yet.

657
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,840
Why not?

658
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,160
Is it because your standards are too high?

659
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,600
Um, I think they're pretty normal.

660
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,200
Really? Tell me what type you like.

661
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,480
I know everyone around here.
I'll play matchmaker.

662
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,320
How about we talk about someone else?

663
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,400
Don't be shy.

664
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,040
Just say it.
I'll introduce someone to you.

665
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,400
Well, how about we have a toast instead?

666
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,000
Oh, beers are here!

667
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,320
Pass the glasses.

668
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,240
Here you are.

669
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,200
Cheers!

670
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,680
<i>I'll just pretend to be drunk</i>
<i>and fall asleep,</i>

671
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,160
<i>so I don't have to answer questions.</i>

672
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,080
Standing at the stove all day,
my back's killing me!

673
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,440
Those food delivery folks
always complain about my shop.

674
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,160
Too slow, this and that.

675
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,640
But I'm working alone here!

676
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,680
My hands are flying everywhere.

677
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,720
<i>When are they heading back? I'm so sleepy.</i>

678
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,280
Wan looks pretty drunk now, huh?

679
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,520
She's a lightweight for sure.

680
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,360
So what do we do?

681
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,680
<i>- Yes! Just go home, please.</i>
- Should we head home?

682
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,520
We're all tipsy already.

683
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,520
We've come this far.

684
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,320
Let's go all the way!

685
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,560
Yeah!

686
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,640
<i>When will I get to sleep?</i>

687
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,760
Oh, she's here! She's here!

688
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,080
She's here!

689
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,880
<i>Who else just came, huh?</i>

690
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,040
Are you partying?

691
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,920
<i>- I'm saved!</i>
- Not at all!

692
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,360
<i>- Thanks, Maewnam.</i>
- No one…

693
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,680
What happened to Wan?

694
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,640
This one?

695
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,920
She's a lightweight.

696
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,800
This Bangkok city girl is a lightweight.

697
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,240
- A lightweight?
- She passed out already.

698
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,480
I'll join the party in a bit.

699
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,200
- Yep.
- I'll get Wan upstairs first.

700
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,840
Got it. Go ahead.

701
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,040
I told you to pass it to them.

702
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,440
It's not for you to drink!

703
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,800
Wan.

704
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,800
Wan.

705
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,880
Are you okay?

706
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,320
Come on, let's get you upstairs. Let's go.

707
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,400
<i>What should I do?</i>

708
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,200
<i>Should I admit I'm not really drunk</i>

709
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,400
<i>or just go along with it?</i>

710
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,360
Wan.

711
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,040
I like you.

712
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,800
Well…

713
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,760
Wait, were you just pretending
to be asleep?

714
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,040
I just didn't dare to get up earlier.

715
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,600
Everyone went out of their way to come
and treat me to a meal to apologize.

716
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,200
But I was so sleepy,
my eyes were about to shut.

717
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,840
Were you… sleepy?

718
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,360
But I'm not anymore.

719
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,280
So that means

720
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,920
you heard what I said earlier, right?

721
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,600
I really like you, Wan.

722
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,120
How about you?

723
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,680
Do you feel the same way about me?

724
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,440
There's this theory that says

725
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,120
if you're not sure how you feel
about someone right in front of you,

726
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,240
try hugging them.

727
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,440
<i>But for some people,</i>

728
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,360
it might go as far as a kiss.

729
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,920
<i>You're really the whole package.</i>

730
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,640
Beautiful and delicious.

731
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,080
What do you mean, "delicious"?

732
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,160
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

733
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,240
<i>The same old thing again?</i>

734
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,400
<i>She asked when you're getting married?</i>

735
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,520
Mm, I…

736
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,720
Who's this?

737
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,960
This is Tonnam, Mom.

738
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,800
<i>Whenever I go through something rough,</i>

739
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,240
<i>just seeing you makes it all go away, Wan.</i>

740
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,120
<i>But I still don't know how you feel</i>

741
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,760
<i>after that night you…</i>

742
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,840
Well…
