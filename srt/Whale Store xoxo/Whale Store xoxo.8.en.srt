1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,240
No matter how big the problem is,
we'll get through it together.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,040
Thank you so much for that presentation,
it really lifted my spirits a lot.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,600
Honestly, I know we can't beat Mouse Mart.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,360
But I'm not giving up.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,560
Mom.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,120
Tonnam and I are dating.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,360
Mouse Mart opens tomorrow.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,720
Are you ready to fight?

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,160
But if this flops,
Som is sleeping outside.

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,000
That's too much!

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,560
What's going on?!

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,800
So cute.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,320
Som is so cute.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,640
Wow, the seal is so adorable.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,080
It's super cute.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,320
- Does it suit me?
- Very much!

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,840
- Please ring this up for me.
- Got it.

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,040
Which shelf is this from?

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,880
- I'll take this one too.
- Sure.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,960
Thank you.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,120
- Wan.
- Yeah?

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,760
I think they came because of our clip.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,600
Everyone wants to shop with Som.

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,640
- Here you are.
- Here you are. Thank you.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,480
Okay, thank you.

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,000
Thank you very much.

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,160
Thank you!

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,560
Whew, finally, the customers
are thinning out.

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,560
When did it start being busy like that?

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,720
People were lining up
even before seven in the morning.

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,040
They were all asking for Som.

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,240
We really have to thank Som.
All that wet food was worth it.

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,680
Where is she now?

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,600
You did so well today.

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,800
Come here.

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,760
You did so well, Somharuthai.
You were trained well, huh?

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,280
Congrats, Wan.

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,400
Actually, I don't want it to be
just today that we sell well.

39
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,760
No way. We'll sell well every day.

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,240
Right, Som?

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,720
Come on, wave your paw!

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,920
Wave your paw.

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,000
Say, "Everyone, come buy lots."

CHUM-LAE GROCERY

46
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,720
Som, can you pick one for me?

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,040
Pick one for me.

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,600
- This one?
- This one? Is this the one?

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,320
Got it.

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,160
- Okay.
- Thank you.

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,520
- Can I take a photo of you?
- Sure, go ahead.

52
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,160
- Here you are.
- Yes.

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,000
- Payment done.
- Okay. Thank you so much.

54
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,640
So many people brought stuff
for Som to randomly pick today.

55
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,040
I'm so happy.

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,400
Congrats!

57
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,080
I hope sales stay strong tomorrow.

58
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,080
AWESOME

59
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,080
SOM, HELP US PICK!

60
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,720
Next in line, please.

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,360
Som, go ahead. Pick one for her.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,680
Stop.

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,640
Pickled mango.

64
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,600
Next customer, please.

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
Cheer up!

66
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,480
Soda.

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
Next in line, please.

68
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,120
- One, two, three.
- Pick one.

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,160
Oh my God!
We made tens of thousands today.

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,440
Yay!

71
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Amazing!

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
Look at this.

73
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Here.

74
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,920
It's pretty funny, huh?

CHUM-LAE GROCERY

76
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,280
What's this?

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,280
They're using this orange cat
as a selling point.

78
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,760
I think Maewnam helped come up with
this marketing plan for sure.

79
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,000
I only watched the clip of Som once,

80
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,120
and there are lots more clips
following it.

81
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
It's probably just a fluke, you know.

82
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,600
The honeymoon period for a trending shop
isn't usually long.

83
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,520
Really?

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,400
So how long do you think
this trend will last?

85
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,720
I don't know.

86
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,080
But people get bored easily nowadays.

87
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,440
It dies down quickly.

88
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,680
But a honeymoon is still a honeymoon.

89
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,400
They don't last very long.

90
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,480
SOM SALON

91
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,360
I've already applied
the nail treatment for you.

92
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Som's place's gel nails are finished.

93
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,080
They're super cute. I love them so much.

94
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Som is the cutest.

95
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,880
- Babe, look! Aren't they cute?
- They are.

96
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,320
The cutest ever. Look.

97
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,000
Can I take a few photos here for my clip?

98
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,200
Sure. Thank you so much.

99
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,240
Thanks.

100
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Let's go, babe.

101
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,680
Mom.

102
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,800
- Fern.
- Yeah?

103
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,320
Hand me the ginger serum.

104
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,280
I took my polish off. My nails are dry.

105
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,720
Why did you take it off?
You just painted them.

106
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,160
I don't want yellow nails.

107
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,040
Here.

108
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,480
Stop pretending you don't know anything.

109
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,240
I'll do them later.
Fern, let's go to Wan's shop.

110
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,600
Let's take photos with Som.

111
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,400
- Som is trending right now.
- What about the salon?

112
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,200
Don't worry about it. No one's coming.

113
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
If there's nothing going on,
just close up.

114
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,080
Let's go see Som. It's the trend.

115
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,800
- All right.
- Come on already. Don't be slow. Walk.

116
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,080
It's fine.

117
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,240
Let's go to the university first.

118
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,520
We can come back and talk later. Okay?

119
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,960
Let's go.

120
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,520
Come on, Fern. Let's go.

121
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,040
Sis, stop using me
as your escape from your daughter.

122
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,960
Ugh, I hate it when people catch on.

123
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,360
What's up with you two again?

124
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,640
Hey, look over there.
Something new came in.

125
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,680
- Come on, follow me!
- She didn't even answer.

126
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,640
Oh my gosh, what's this?

127
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,560
Hello there.

128
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,920
Hey, hey! Som, help us pick?

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Nowadays there are tons of mystery boxes,

130
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,720
so I made my own mystery picks
with Som helping you choose.

131
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,720
If you can't decide, just spin this.

132
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,560
Nice. It looks fun.

133
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,800
All right, Som, help me pick.

134
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,600
Here we go, spinning! One, two, three.

135
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,920
Stop!

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,840
Lollipop.

137
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,720
This is fun! One more.

138
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,160
- Fern, are you filming?
- Yep.

139
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,600
- Keep filming.
- Yeah.

140
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,880
One, two, three… stop!

141
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Orange juice.

142
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,040
This is so fun. One more!

143
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,680
Ready, Som? One, two, three, pop! Stop!

144
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Cookies!

145
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,120
Next, next! It's fun.

146
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,600
Peanuts.

147
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,080
One more time.

148
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,360
Stop!

149
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
Stop! Stop!

150
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,560
Cookies!

151
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,800
Keep going, keep going! This is fun.

152
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,360
Som, can I get a big prize?

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,920
BOILED EGG

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,640
This is actually really fun, Fern.

155
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,240
No wonder her store's got
so many customers these days.

156
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,200
I never thought an orange street cat
like Som would get this famous.

157
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,080
Well, things are stressful these days.

158
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:39,200
People come in tired and just want
something harmless and healing to watch.

159
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,400
So you're saying it's popular
because it heals people?

160
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,400
Well, I think it's a mix of things.

161
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,320
Timing, luck,
and being in the right place.

162
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,080
But I think this case has more to do with

163
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
the one who cut the umbilical cord,
starting the buzz.

164
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,440
Umbilical cord?

165
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,640
The person who shared the clip.

166
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,040
She's a social media celeb.

167
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,040
Who?

168
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Oh, you forgot your stuff.
You spun so many times.

169
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sorry I forgot.
My brain's all over the place lately.

170
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,040
I'm heading back to the salon.
I've been gone too long.

171
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,760
Sure. Fern, earlier,
who were you talking about?

172
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,560
The one who shared the clip?

173
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,320
Who?

174
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
- It was this person.
- Show her.

175
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
Coming.

176
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,560
Pizza delivery.

177
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,360
Thanks.

178
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,880
Whose girlfriend is this? She's so cute.

179
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
Why are you making that face?

180
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
You're tired out from selling stuff?

181
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,400
Partly.

182
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,600
But I'm a bit bummed too.

183
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,680
I found out the reason
we had so many customers

184
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,800
was because she shared the clip of Som.

185
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,640
The store is owned by a cat.

186
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,760
Som, Chum-Lae Grocery's cat, is cute.

187
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,600
I definitely want to check it out myself.

188
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,800
You already knew?

189
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,000
I only found out today.

190
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,760
Everyone in our faculty's

191
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,160
been talking about following in
Prof. Mahnmook's footsteps.

192
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,520
She's an influencer.

193
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,120
I don't know why she did it or what for.

194
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,920
But I was clear with her.

195
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
You talked to her already, Wan?

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,840
She came to see me at the store.

197
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,640
Dad's store is going to go down
in my generation.

198
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,160
Wan,

199
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,760
the store hasn't gone down yet.

200
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,000
We're just facing a storm.

201
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,720
There might be some damage,

202
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,520
but once the storm passes,
we can repair it.

203
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,760
Just don't give up.

204
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,600
And no matter how strong the storm gets,
you'll always have me.

205
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,640
Bye-bye.

206
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,920
Get home safe.

207
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,040
Is the store closed already?

208
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,200
What do you want to buy?

209
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,440
Nothing.

210
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,400
I just want to talk.

211
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,600
It's already late.

212
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,800
Can we talk tomorrow?

213
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,720
Why?

214
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
Are you afraid someone will see me
coming to see you at this hour?

215
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,960
CHUM-LAE GROCERY

216
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,560
Maewnam has really been helping you out
with everything.

217
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,640
Is it because she feels guilty

218
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,200
her family's a major competitor
to your store?

219
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,480
Hey, she's helping because she wants to.

220
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,040
She wants to help…

221
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,080
but can she really?

222
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,560
I'm seriously asking you.

223
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,160
Do you even realize what you're doing?

224
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,960
You're competing
with a big business like Mouse Mart.

225
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,320
I'm not trying to discourage you,
but there's no way you can win.

226
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,880
She's a professor.

227
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,360
Didn't she tell you this is a losing game?

228
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,800
She let you build a new store
and make a new sign.

229
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,360
You must have spent so much money.

230
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,080
I did it because I wanted to.

231
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,120
I wanted to see for myself
whether it could survive or not.

232
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,320
So is it surviving?

233
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,880
If you came here just to say this, leave.

234
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,200
But I can help you.

235
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,320
You know that.

236
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,160
Should I help?

237
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,560
Do you want to let me help?

238
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,640
Do you want my help?

239
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,640
Go home.

240
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,280
I don't want any help from you.

241
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,640
I don't want to owe anyone anything.

242
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,040
But I'll help.

243
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,320
I want to be your friend again.

244
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,200
Still, it's good
to have so many customers come in.

245
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,600
I just don't want help from her.

246
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,760
Maybe she really just wants
to be your friend again.

247
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,800
Do you think exes

248
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,000
can really go back to being friends?

249
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,720
Sometimes, yes.

250
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,280
But not always.

251
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
Was it really that bad back then?

252
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,520
Well, I met her at university.

253
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,120
ARTS, LAW, ARCHITECTURE FACULTIES

254
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,200
Our student numbers were
next to each other.

255
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,960
She was talented and smart,
a leader of the group.

256
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,200
But back then,
I was only good at languages,

257
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,000
so I could only help her with that part.

258
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,000
She helped me with something else.

259
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,400
But then came the thesis.

260
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,440
Thantara, is this your thesis?

261
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,960
Yes.

262
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,880
Why does it look
so much like Manatsanan's?

263
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,400
She submitted this a long time ago.

264
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,720
Can you explain this to me?

265
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,600
People thought I'd plagiarized her work.

266
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,720
I had to waste another semester
rewriting the entire thesis.

267
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,320
It's the topic I wanted to do.

268
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,920
I never said I'd give you the topic.

269
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,440
I was the one who researched it.

270
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,080
I even asked you to help review it.

271
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,240
How could you not know
I was doing this topic?

272
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,640
I just thought maybe you'd want to help.

273
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,080
I've been helping you all four years.

274
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,280
And one more thing.

275
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,560
I got a scholarship to study in Japan.

276
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,400
I'm tired of constantly
worrying about you.

277
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,280
I feel like I can't give it my all.

278
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,640
So I think the best thing for us

279
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,200
is breaking up.

280
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,760
- What?
- Let's break up, Wan.

281
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,440
And as for her…

282
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,120
She completely disappeared from my life.

283
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,560
I guess I'm just not that capable.

284
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,080
I'm just a loser.

285
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,040
Otherwise, I would've handled
all of this better.

286
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,119
Even with the store, I've tried so hard,
and in the end, nothing's working.

287
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,160
That's not true.

288
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,960
The Wan I know is so talented,
and she never gives up.

289
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,319
Sure, you've stumbled before
and gotten stuck.

290
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,040
But now sales have gone up again, right?

291
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,080
That's only because she helped.

292
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,240
You've worked so hard and given your all.

293
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,720
She's the one who shared posts
about your effort and dedication.

294
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,600
Also, I think
she might genuinely feel guilty.

295
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,880
Do you really think so?

296
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,680
People can change over time.

297
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,360
I believe that.

298
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,720
But me? I'm not changing.

299
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,320
I'll always love you the same,
and I'll love you forever.

300
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,640
I won't let you change, that's for sure.

301
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,520
Let's eat the pizza.

302
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,680
Otherwise, it'll get cold
and won't be any good anymore.

303
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,880
What topping is it?

304
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,920
"Cute" topping.

305
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,280
Eh?

306
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,800
That was adorable. Let's redo it.

307
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,760
- Wait, no! I'm not doing it again.
- Come on!

308
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,200
Hurry and eat. I need to head back soon.

309
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,640
Why won't you eat with me?

310
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,560
I bought it for you.

311
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,320
It's late already. I'll get bloated.

312
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,280
I can't.

313
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,360
What was that sound?

314
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,160
What? Pardon?

315
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,520
What?

316
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,200
Did you say you really want to eat pizza?

317
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,320
See?

318
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,920
No, I didn't want to eat.
You made that up.

319
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,080
I didn't hear anything.

320
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,920
Eat. Come on.

321
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,320
Maewnam…

322
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Eat it.

323
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,920
I bought it for you. Just eat.

324
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,360
I'm even feeding you.

325
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,280
Mmm, it's so delicious.

326
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,320
- You're being so fake.
- I'm not!

327
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,000
It's really good.

328
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,920
Well? Is it good?

329
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,600
Why did Mom go to bed so early tonight?

330
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,520
It's only 8:30 p.m.

331
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,120
Maybe she went to shower?

332
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,320
I bought it for you.

333
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,000
It smells amazing.

334
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,640
Just having it here really changes
the vibe of the salon, doesn't it?

335
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,440
Thanks a lot, sweetheart.

336
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,080
I think it probably fell on the floor,
so Mom threw it away.

337
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,520
Are you trying to make me feel better?

338
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,520
It's okay.

339
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,200
Oh, Mom?

340
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,680
You're back?

341
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,480
What are you doing in my room?

342
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,440
The AC in my room is broken.

343
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm sleeping in your room tonight.

344
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,360
Sorry, Mom.

345
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,080
Hey, Chom. I'm lying my knees
on that pillow.

346
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,400
I'll find another one instead.

347
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,440
Why can't I use this one?

348
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Please, just use it, Mom.

349
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,560
I'll sleep downstairs.

350
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,760
Mom. You're acting like a soap opera
mother-in-law right now.

351
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,800
Do you even realize it?

352
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,920
What did I do?

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,120
Do I really need to spell it out?
You've been picking on Tonnam.

354
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,800
She sleeps on that pillow.

355
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,480
You won't talk to her.

356
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,320
You removed the nail polish
she put on for you.

357
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,960
You threw out the reed diffuser
she gave you.

358
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,120
Well, the smell was too strong.
I didn't like it.

359
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,280
Everyone can see you don't like her.

360
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,560
You used to be all,
"My sweetie this, my sweetie that."

361
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,480
Now suddenly everything is wrong.

362
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,920
What's going on with you, Mom?

363
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,520
Nothing.

364
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,000
I said there's nothing.
Can you stop nitpicking too much?

365
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,720
Mom, ever since you found out
Tonnam was my girlfriend,

366
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,320
you haven't been acting the same,

367
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,880
even though she's still the same person.

368
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,320
What's the problem? Just tell me.

369
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,200
What? I said nothing's wrong!

370
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,360
Ugh! I'm getting a leg cramp now.

371
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,920
Nothing is wrong, okay?

372
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,240
But you still need to talk
to me about this

373
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,360
because if you try to run from this,

374
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,000
I will too.

375
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,320
CHUM-LAE GROCERY

376
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,760
This one, please.

377
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,920
Sure.

378
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,400
Thank you.

379
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,080
Do you have a black trash bag?

380
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,040
- Yes, I do. Just a sec.
- Sure.

381
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
What's wrong, sweetie?

382
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,160
- What happened?
- That cat scratched my face.

383
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,080
Hey, your cat scratched my child!

384
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,440
What are you going to do about this?

385
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
I'm so sorry! I'm really sorry!

386
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,520
Are you okay? Does it hurt a lot?

387
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,080
Is the wound big?
Can I see it for a second?

388
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,880
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,160
Oh, it's hot, but it smells so good.

390
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
Oh, wow!

391
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,120
You're all awake now?

392
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,120
Come here, come on.

393
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,880
You always wake up late, Chom.

394
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,680
I went out early to get some stuff.

395
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,160
Sit down, sweetie, right here.

396
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,720
This rice porridge is really good.

397
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,160
I bought it for you both.

398
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,560
I got yours too.

399
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,840
Did you forget your spoon?

400
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,440
Let me get it for you. Just sit down.

401
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,200
Where's the spoon?

402
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,960
Here, here!

403
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,920
Here's your spoon, Chom.
This one's yours, sweetie.

404
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,280
Do you usually season your porridge?

405
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,640
- Yes, I do.
- No, no! Stay seated.

406
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,440
Let me get it for you
so you don't have to reach.

407
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,640
Season it so it tastes good.

408
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,800
Just plain porridge
won't keep you full anyway.

409
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,360
Do you want anything else?
I can go buy it.

410
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,000
Some fried dough sticks?
Fried dough sticks and soy milk?

411
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,800
There's a good shop at the market.

412
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,080
Want anything, Chom?
I'll just grab a bunch for everyone.

413
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Where's my wallet?

414
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,200
Oh, it's in front of the shop.
Ugh, I'm so forgetful.

415
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,240
Soy milk, fried dough…

416
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,600
What's up with my mom?

417
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,280
You're asking me like I'd know.

418
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,800
What did you talk to her about last night?

419
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,960
Not much.

420
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,320
I just told her that
if she was planning on avoiding me,

421
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,120
then I'd avoid her too.

422
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,240
Why is she being so sarcastic?

423
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,400
Calm down. Don't get upset.

424
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,520
And don't do anything about it, okay?

425
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,960
I've been thinking about it.

426
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,400
Part of the reason Mom is like this
is because of me.

427
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,000
I really don't want to be the reason
you and your mom fight.

428
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,920
I feel like I need to do something.

429
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,320
Wait, you mean…?

430
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,920
No way!

431
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,160
No, no, calm down.

432
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,720
That's not what I meant.

433
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,840
Well…

434
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,880
I'm not breaking up with you.

435
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,560
I've never even thought about that.

436
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,800
I just feel like
maybe I shouldn't be here.

437
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,360
But being apart
won't mean we break up, right?

438
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,240
We won't.

439
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,240
We'll still be together.

440
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,720
We aren't breaking up.

441
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,800
We just…

442
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,480
won't be living together, that's all.

443
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,960
It's okay.

444
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,400
Let's give it a try. Maybe it'll work out.

445
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,080
I just took the kid to get vaccinated.

446
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,680
The doctor's fee was nearly 10,000.

447
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,720
And I paid another 5,000 as compensation.

448
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,160
At first, I was going to use that money
to pay off some debt.

449
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,400
Well, now there's not a single baht left.

450
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,240
If you really don't have any,
you can borrow from me.

451
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,200
No. I've told you this already, Noey.

452
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,120
Okay. I'm not going to bring it up again.

453
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,760
I just don't want anyone to suffer
because of me.

454
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,800
I chose to run this store myself.

455
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,160
Also, I don't want to look like
I'm completely incapable.

456
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,120
Okay. I understand.
But that's not what I meant.

457
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,680
Everyone has ups and downs. It's normal.

458
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,040
I just want you to know you still have me,
a friend who'll always support you.

459
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,960
That's all.

460
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,240
I know. Got it.

461
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,200
I just really want to do this by myself.

462
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,480
All right, then how about this?

463
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,880
I'll show you how to
negotiate debt restructuring.

464
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,440
Monthly payments will go down a bit,
but you'll have to pay longer.

465
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,120
With interest, it might double.

466
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,880
Double?

467
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,280
Yeah, it's time in exchange for money.

468
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,600
I know. I'm just bugged out.

469
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,200
Wan.

470
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,160
Hi, Kung.

471
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,040
Uncle Lee told me
about Som scratching that kid.

472
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,520
Cats are like that. When they get cornered
like that, they get irritated.

473
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,920
I understand.

474
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,520
Are you here to buy something?
I can get it for you.

475
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,640
No, not today.

476
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,440
I just came to pay what I owed you.

477
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,400
But it's not even
the end of the month yet.

478
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
It's fine. Just take it.

479
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,560
Thank you so much.

480
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,280
I had to spend a lot
at the hospital just now.

481
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,200
Having this money now is such a relief.

482
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,160
Okay then, I'll head out.
Take care of the store, okay?

483
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,720
Wait, aren't you buying anything?

484
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,600
You haven't run out of any supplies?

485
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,800
Not today. I'll go now.

486
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,800
You could stock up now, though,
so you don't have to keep coming back.

487
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,120
Help me out a little, please.

488
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,320
Wan, I get that you're having a hard time.

489
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,400
I don't know how to explain this.

490
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,040
I sell things too.

491
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,240
You probably understand that
I need to choose what's best for me.

492
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,600
Wait, what do you mean?

493
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,800
I don't really get it.

494
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,720
Mouse Mart offers this pay-later system,

495
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,960
a credit system, same as your store,

496
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,400
except they give discounts too
if you reach a certain purchase amount.

497
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,840
I had to go that way first.

498
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,560
Okay.

499
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,320
Well, I'm heading back.

500
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,040
CHUM-LAE GROCERY

501
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,040
Wan, what's this from the bank?

502
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,400
A letter? It says, "Very urgent."

503
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,120
It's nothing.

504
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,720
What's going on? Why won't you tell me?

505
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,360
Well, I haven't paid the bank
for two months.

506
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,600
I make some money,
and then I use it to restock.

507
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,920
I'm afraid I'll run out of stuff to sell.

508
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,800
But at the end of the month,
the profit isn't enough to pay the debt,

509
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,400
but I still have to
buy stock for the store.

510
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,720
It's a cycle.

511
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,320
Why didn't you tell me about
all this stressful stuff?

512
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,120
I just want to keep my dad's store
going on my own.

513
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,880
I've put so much into this place.

514
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,440
I want to make it better.

515
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,560
But whenever it starts getting better,
something bad happens again.

516
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,360
I just paid medical bills
and compensation.

517
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,760
Mouse Mart's also stealing our customers.

518
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,120
I don't even know what to do anymore.

519
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,000
I feel like I'm at a dead end.

520
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,920
It's not a dead end.

521
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,400
There is a way out.

522
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,920
Maybe you just haven't seen it yet.

523
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,720
But I've tried everything.

524
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,960
I don't even know
if I can keep the store going.

525
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,760
Wan, don't forget I'm still here.

526
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,160
I'll help you think.

527
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,200
I'll figure this out.

528
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,040
Don't stress too much, okay?

529
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Smile.

530
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,600
Smile.

531
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,520
If you're lively,
your brain will work better.

532
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,920
You'll figure things out.

533
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,760
If I blow this, will she really show up?

534
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,600
I'm here!

535
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,240
You really came, huh?

536
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,360
Come on. This is the magic whistle.

537
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,360
Once you blow it, I appear instantly.

538
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,600
I'm just kidding.

539
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,680
I've actually been
standing there for a while.

540
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,800
I saw you were about to blow it,
so I waited for the right timing.

541
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,120
Good thing you did. Otherwise,
I'd be left standing there awkwardly.

542
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,640
I should have left you hanging.

543
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,080
Wow, you're so mean.

544
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,120
I even came with good news too.

545
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,440
What is it?

546
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,800
Please, have a seat.

547
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,640
Maewnam Service is happy to help.

548
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,520
But hush-hush, okay?

549
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,800
Where did you get this much money?

550
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,760
It's my own savings.

551
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,640
Consider it a new business branch of
Maewnam Service. Personal finance.

552
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,160
No way. That's way too much.

553
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,160
I'm not giving it to you.

554
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,920
I'm lending it.

555
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,920
From now on, I'm officially your creditor.

556
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,920
But I feel bad.

557
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,440
Why? I'm not giving it away.

558
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,600
You're borrowing it.

559
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,200
That makes you my debtor now.

560
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,920
You have to charge interest then.

561
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,880
Interest?

562
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,280
Oh yeah,

563
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,760
but not in money.

564
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,920
I'll charge it as…

565
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
this.

566
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,880
So you can pay like this…

567
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,120
right?

568
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,000
Sure.

569
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,600
But I do have to pay you back. Okay?

570
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,320
Still, it's better than you having to
pay a lot of bank interest.

571
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,960
Now your cash can flow a bit more freely.
Just pay me back little by little.

572
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,600
No pressure.

573
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,640
Thank you so much.

574
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,800
Maewnam Service is always happy to help.

575
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,440
I guess

576
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,160
we need a contract then. Okay?

577
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,360
A contract?

578
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,960
Sure.

579
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,480
But the only paper I'll sign…

580
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,600
is our marriage certificate.

581
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
13 DAYS LATER

582
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,120
Hello, Mom.

583
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,680
Thanks for coming out to see me.

584
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,680
So, why did you call me out here?

585
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,200
Maewnam doesn't know, right?

586
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,280
I didn't tell her because
you didn't want her to know.

587
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,640
Have you ever thought about
quitting the grocery store

588
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,640
and going back to a full-time job?

589
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,880
I've thought about it before,
but not anymore.

590
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,160
Then maybe you should start
looking for something else to do.

591
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,240
Forcing yourself to keep that store going
is only going to lead to losses.

592
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,600
I only just started
running the store myself,

593
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,760
but I believe
it has the potential to survive.

594
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,000
Businesses survive
because people come back.

595
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,720
It's brand loyalty.

596
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,160
That's how Mouse Mart has kept growing.

597
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,800
It's not about creating a buzz
to bring people in once

598
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,280
and never seeing them again.

599
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,000
Determination and fighting spirit
are good things.

600
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,360
But sometimes, no matter
how much you fight, you just can't win.

601
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,200
At best, you break even or you lose.

602
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
You need to accept that.

603
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,840
Go back to doing
what you're actually good at.

604
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,840
Stop forcing it.

605
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,520
SUBMIT GRADES,
EVALUATE TEACHING, MEETING

606
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,280
- Oh, you're still here?
- Yeah.

607
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,320
I thought you'd already
gone home with Chompoo.

608
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,440
Is something wrong?

609
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,480
No.

610
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,960
Being in a relationship

611
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,360
doesn't mean we have to be glued
to each other all the time.

612
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,520
Excuse me, Professor Sudteerak.

613
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,400
You have a guest asking to see you.

614
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,720
Oh, Wan?

615
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,920
Wan.

616
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,040
What's going on? You look tense.

617
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,320
I found out the truth.
That wasn't your savings, was it?

618
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,680
That really was my savings.

619
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,600
It was your PhD tuition money, wasn't it?

620
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,960
How did you find out?

621
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
You need to accept that.

622
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,000
Go back to doing
what you're actually good at.

623
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,520
Stop forcing it.

624
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,200
But if you are going to force yourself,

625
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,560
don't drag Maewnam down with you.

626
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,360
She didn't go for her PhD

627
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,440
because she gave the money to you.

628
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,240
Come here.

629
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,000
Look at the reality around you.

630
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,680
What do you really see?

631
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,400
HOT DRINKS
ONLY 35 BAHT

632
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,000
BUTTER CROISSANT
ONLY 20 BAHT

633
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,240
CHEESE SANDWICH
ONLY 25 BAHT

634
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,480
SMOKED SAUSAGE
ONLY 35 BAHT

635
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:27,120
PORK BUN
ONLY 25 BAHT

636
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,000
SHRIMP DUMPLINGS
FIVE FOR 19 BAHT

637
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,720
I'll quickly find money to pay her back.

638
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,480
Thank you so much for telling me.

639
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,120
My mom told you?

640
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,760
But I'm glad she did

641
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,480
because this doesn't just
affect the two of us.

642
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,640
But I don't want to do a PhD anymore.

643
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,680
It was never really what I wanted
in the first place.

644
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,840
You knew…

645
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,600
I wouldn't accept the money
if I knew, right?

646
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,040
That's why you lied?

647
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,440
I didn't lie.

648
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,760
It just wasn't my first choice
to begin with.

649
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,320
Maybe it wasn't your first choice,
but you still gave up the money for me.

650
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,400
That's because I want to live my life.

651
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,560
I want to live that life with you, really.

652
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,280
Wan.

653
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,320
Listen to me.

654
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,120
You know what?

655
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,640
You've always helped me so much.

656
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,840
I'm deeply grateful. I really am.

657
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,080
But at the same time,
I don't want to be a burden to you.

658
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,320
Wan, it's…

659
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,720
I don't want to be
a bad part of your life.

660
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,120
Please.

661
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,000
Since the day we met,

662
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,960
you've been nothing but kind to me.

663
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,080
You've always supported me.

664
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,120
But now…

665
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,400
I don't want to receive help
from you anymore.

666
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,160
A whistle?

667
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,320
If something scary happens again,

668
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,760
blow it loud.

669
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,760
I'll come to you right away.

670
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,440
I'm sorry, Maewnam.

671
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,560
Did you break up
with Prof. Maewnam already?

672
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,320
Did she come and hurt your feelings again?

673
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,680
She just wanted to help.

674
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,240
Help? Or flirt?

675
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,480
But if you love her, you shouldn't
let things stay like this, right?

676
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,760
- You two are dating?
- We've been together for so long.

677
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,880
Love is love. It's about feelings.

678
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,240
Chom, you've made me more sure
about my feelings.

679
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,880
Huh?! What did I just send?

680
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,200
"Wan Service"?

681
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,360
You have to work
and pay off your debt to me.

682
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,360
Uncle Lee, I'm here!

683
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,640
I promise I won't ever
make you cry again, my dear.

684
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,280
"My dear"?
