If we talk about a grocery store,
[LOVE PATTRANITE AS MAEWNAM]

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,010
I think of ice-cream.

5
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:25,614
Back then, I’d ask my grandpa
for 5 or 10 baht to buy some ice-cream.

6
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:28,037
Sometimes it came in a cup.

7
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:31,305
I’d eat it, sharing with my younger sibling.

[MILK PANSA AS WAN]

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,903
I think of those clear plastic bags,
we use to carry things

10
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:41,482
because my mom once owned a bakery in the market.

11
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:43,602
That’s why I’m pretty familiar
with grocery stores.

12
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:46,053
My mom would ask me to go buy bags,

13
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:48,365
the kind people use for curry,

14
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:49,453

00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,010
that was like cocoa powder
in colorful little cups.

18
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,102
That’s what I think of.

19
00:01:02,303 --> 00:01:06,857
I used to get it
whenever I visited my aunt’s house.

[JUNE WANWIMOL AS TONNAM]

21

because when I was a kid,
I liked to buy and eat them.

22
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,604
At my house, we sold some kind of goods,

23
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:19,423
and I would get pocket money
from my grandparents,

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,837
who would open the drawer
and give me money to go buy them.

when there were soft drinks
in a bag with a straw.

29
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,900
I’d hold them like this and drink.

30
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:32,174
Does that show my age?

31

I think of things like candies,

[PIPLOY KANYARAT AS NOEY]

32
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:40,614
When I went to school,
there was a grocery store in front.

33
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:43,730
I would stop by and buy those things to take into school.

34
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:45,500
So these are the two things I think of.

Wan is the daughter of the grocery’s owner,

but she has a full time job.

47
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,280
There is a certain reason
that makes her leave the job,

48
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:25,899
and it’s during the time
her father has just passed away,

49
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:28,494
so Wan comes back to carry on the business.

50

Wan faces many problems
coming at her all at once.

51

Maewnam is the superhero
who comes to solve the problems

52
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,388
because she’s running
“Maewnam Service” in that community.

She could do everything.

54
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:47,202

Wan doesn’t like being taken advantage of.

66

She’s firm when it comes to work and words.

67
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:15,672
When the boss lashes out at coworkers,

68
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:18,921
puts pressure on them, or speaks harshly,

69
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:21,102
Wan stands up for them.

70
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:23,708
Wan gives off the big sister vibe.

71
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:25,945
She’s a big sister who is quite mature.

72
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:30,798
She speaks with a bit of arrogance,
but still polite.

73
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:34,216
I really like her chemistry with Maewnam.

74
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:38,106
It gives the feeling of a beautiful big sister

75
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,103
who doesn’t speak from the heart.

76
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:43,271
She hides her feelings,

77
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:47,143
but when she’s with Maewnam,
she slips up a little

78
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,087
because Maewnam can make her smile.

79
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,737
I think they’re such a cute couple.

80
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,503
In the story, Wan is mature and calm.

81
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:59,798
When Maewnam teases her, she stays quiet.

82
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:04,663
It makes her wonder
if she has feelings for her or not.

83
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,002
- She’s hard to read.
- Yes, exactly.

84
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,118
She seems like someone who hides things in her heart,

85
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:12,297
but her heart is beating so fast.

86
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:16,180
She fights through life and faces problems well,

87
00:04:16,198 --> 00:04:18,597
but that’s partly because of Maewnam,

88
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:20,795
who’s such a great supporter.

89
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,662
That’s true. I won’t argue with that.

90
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:35,531
The acting is good.

91
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,459
I’m only worried about
memorizing the language.

92
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:41,706
The hard part about playing this role is that

93
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:44,202
even though Wan is the same age as me,

94
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:50,274
there are certain thoughts
she has that stress me out.

95
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:52,805
There are some scenes where it’s like — wow,

96
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,642
Wan’s fighting so hard,

97
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:57,441
but deep down, she’s actually really scared.

98
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:00,657
I think that’s such a painful thing to play,

99
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,497
because it feels suffocating and so on.

100
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:04,595
Everything is just pressing in.

101
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,200
That part is challenging
for me in portraying Wan.

103
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:10,485
It’s something new, for sure.

She’s become calmer, but still talks a lot.

105
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,954
Her lines are so long.

106
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:17,514
- They’re so long.
- She has really long lines.

107
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:19,604
She talks a lot, but is more composed.

109
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,069

She's open and optimistic.

Maewnam is super determined and headstrong.

Whatever she decides to do, she gives it her all.

139

For example, when she’s going to
hit on the grocery sister,

140
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:52,291
she does it with full effort.

141

I’ll quickly make her fall for me,

ready to support and hold others up.

147
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:13,539
In the series, when I act alongside
this character Maewnam,

148
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:16,002
I feel she’s the kind of person...

149
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,797
who always tries to hold things together
and make situations better.

150
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,640
Even when things are bad, she won’t make it worse.

She tries to make sure
everyone is okay and feeling better.

(That’s so heavy.)

153

It really is.

154
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,268
Maewnam has two sides.

155
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:47,056
As a professor, she wears a blazer or a shirt.

156
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:49,595
Then, as Maewnam, she wears active clothes,

157
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,971
something she can wear to ride a bicycle
to provide Maewnam Service,

158
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:54,497
fixing electricity and climbing up
to do this and that.

159
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,902
It feels like there are two sides to her —

160
00:07:57,973 --> 00:08:00,002
totally mature but still cute,

161
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:02,739
and the other side is just totally cute
but also agile.

Maewnam has this graceful
and respectable vibe as a professor.

I think students love her.

164

She’s not the scary or strict type,

165
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:17,456
but still a professor the students respect.

this is a new age range I’ve never played before.

170
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:36,303
She’s someone who’s already
graduated and is now a professor.

171
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:40,970
I feel like the management team
sees me now as someone who’s graduated.

172

I got the chance to try something new.

173
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:47,536
In my whole acting life,

174
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:48,700
I’ve never "graduated" in a role.

175
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,798
The roles were always
a university student or a student.

176
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:54,342
But this time, I’ve graduated,
and I’m even a professor.

177
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,762
So I really want to say thank you for
seeing me as someone who’s grown up.

178
00:08:57,774 --> 00:08:59,333
I’m 25 now.

179
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:02,294
Hello, students.

180
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,522
Hello!

181
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:11,401
I feel like Maewnam lives life with her heart,

182
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:14,527
while I live life more with my head.

183
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:16,078
She does everything from the heart first

184
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,226
but deep down, she actually
has emotional wounds,

185
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:22,509
things that make her quite sensitive.

186
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:24,499
What’s similar between us?

187
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,614
It’s probably the ability to do many things.

188
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,961
It’s like we both have 10 hands
and can do everything.

189
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,201
We’re bright, bold,

190
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,617
and always want to help others.

191
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:41,205
Maewnam loves helping people.

192
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:45,134
In real life, when my friends need something,

193
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:48,808
I always say, I want to help — I can help.

194
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:50,453
I pick up people, deliver people,

195
00:09:50,468 --> 00:09:52,004
deliver stuff, and fix things.

196
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:53,561
I provide all services.

197
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,102
I do everything that is legal.

198
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,022
What is difficult about playing this role?

199
00:09:58,426 --> 00:10:01,287
There were so many things in “Maewnam Service”

200
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:02,463
that I had never done before.

201
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,312
I literally had to learn on set.

202
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:06,997
I did things I had never done in my life.

203
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:08,155
It took a lot of courage.

204
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:12,001
I screamed once, and then just went for it.

205
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:13,275
Yes, I was scared.

206
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:16,306
Please look forward to it.

207
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:23,801
As everyone knows, Maewnam is a professor,

208
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:25,798
but I’ve never taught anyone before.

209
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:29,351
In the story, though, I have to teach students,

210
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,091
and it really opens up a whole new world for me.

211
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:38,508
P’Love brought so much brightness
and liveliness to this character.

212
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:42,708
In the story, she’s truly loved by everyone
in the village and the community.

213
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,349
Whatever people need, they call for Maewnam.

214
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:50,499
I feel like P’Love gives off that same feeling.

215
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:53,690
When you need advice or support,
you’d naturally go to her.

216
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,625
I think there are some similarities too.

217
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:59,401
They have that “organizing” energy,
very good at taking care of things.

218
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,764
And the energy!

219
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:05,943
Lately, I feel like Love has become even more energetic,

220
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,201
- like she has more presence.
- Why?

221
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:09,934
Is that because of Maewnam?

222
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:11,450
Maybe partly.

223
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:13,645
She definitely has more energy now.

224
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,710
[WHALE STORE XOXO SPECIAL:

[WHALE STORE XOXO SPECIAL:
FIRST DAY OPENING THE STORE]

226
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:35,279
Aww, I’m sorry, babe.

227
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:37,011
Wait…are you two dating?

228
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:37,967
Shhh!

229
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:39,909
Keep it low.

230
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:42,021
I play Tonnam,
[JUNE WANWIMOL AS TONNAM]

231
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:44,607
a gorgeous professor.

232
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,670
She’s in the same gang as Maewnam and Chompoo.

233
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:51,626
This character is mature,

234
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:55,687
very responsible, and naturally a leader.

235
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,937
That’s because of her background.

236
00:11:57,947 --> 00:12:04,421
She has a younger brother
and parents to take care of.

237
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:09,706
Since she’s a gentle older sister type,
she takes on more responsibility.

238
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:14,598
Another thing is, this character
tends to give in to others a lot.

239
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:18,153
Normally, I’m also someone who gives in,

240
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:20,131
but only when it makes sense.

241
00:12:20,143 --> 00:12:23,035
If something doesn’t feel right,
I’ll stand my ground.

242
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:26,230
But this character gives in on a lot of things,

243
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,297
especially to people she wants to give in to.

244
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:31,504
It was hard for me, you know,

245
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:35,609
as I wanted to really
understand this character,

246
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:37,332
figuring out why she gives in.

247
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:39,223
There’s a deeper reason behind it —

248
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,033
more than what people might see on the surface.

249
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:44,984
I feel like she’s quite similar to P’June.

250
00:12:44,993 --> 00:12:49,118
She has a leader vibe, looking mature.

251
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:54,030
She also shows a different side
when she’s with others,

252
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:56,423
compared to when she’s with me.

253
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:58,393
Since I also have a younger brother,

254
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:01,999
I relate to that feeling of having
to hold many things

255
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:03,510
and handling my brother.

256
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:05,787
When we were filming the scenes
with my on-screen brother,

257
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,008
P’Golf gave me a lot of freedom

258
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:12,470
because in real life, I’d naturally do things
a certain way with my brother.

259
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,706
So I pitched some ideas, and P’Golf was like,

260
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:17,722
“Okay, okay —let’s go with it.”

261
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:22,881
“Manifesting” means

262
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:24,738
“I love you, and you love me.”

263
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,805
If you want me to get changed,

264
00:13:26,214 --> 00:13:26,950
just come and do it for me.

265
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:28,285
You’re such a tease!

266
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:31,069
I play Chompoo in this series.
[MEWNICH NANNAPHAS AS CHOMPOO]

267
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:33,903
She’s a university professor,

268
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:41,596
someone cheerful, lovely, bright,
and full of positive energy.

269
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:45,516
She’s the kind of person
who listens to her heart,

270
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:47,660
who follows her emotions
when making decisions.

271
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:51,233
She really listens to her own feelings.

272
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:56,038
Chompoo can be a little bit stubborn,

273
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:59,307
in a cute, girly kind of way.

274
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,157
But Tonnam understands her.

275
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:06,626
She’s such a lovable character.
She’s like the sun and liveliness.

276
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:10,921
In her free time, she’s usually with
Tonnam and Maewnam.

277
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:13,378
They’re a close trio,
a gang of university professors.

278
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:18,252
There are scenes where I teach
and interact with students.

279
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:19,817
I had to carry myself
more maturely in those scenes.

280
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:25,558
But out of the three professors in the series,
I think she’s the kindest one.

281
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:31,781
She’s not too strict,
more like a friend to the students.

282
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:34,670
People often think of Mewnich as youthful.

283
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:35,906
Her image comes off as quite young.

284
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:37,909
But in truth, her mindset is
actually quite mature,

285
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:40,675
and she has certain habits that reflect it.

286
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,921
So this character doesn’t really
clash with Mewnich’s,

287
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:48,233
though it may be slightly different from
how she appears physically.

288
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:51,035
Like her voice — it’s naturally soft and high,

289
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:53,307
so sometimes P’Golf would ask her

290
00:14:53,561 --> 00:15:01,106
to adjust the tone depending on the situation.

291
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:03,807
At first, I thought this role would be easy,

292
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:06,937
but once we started filming,
I realized it was quite challenging.

293
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,949
One big challenge was the huge
age gap between this character and me.

294
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:14,500
I’ve graduated in real life,

295
00:15:14,562 --> 00:15:18,407
but in the series, I’m already a professor,
a quite mature role.

296
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,241
I had to figure out how to appear mature,

297
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:24,307
while still having youthful energy
without looking too young.

298
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,709
It took a lot of effort to find that balance.

299
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:30,858
My voice already sounds young,

300
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,713
and when I try to make it sound more mature,

301
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:36,741
it ends up sounding too mature,
which doesn’t fit the character.

302
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:38,522
So I need to sound younger —

303
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:44,129
but how can I sound young in a way
that’s not too whiny or childish?

304
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:46,374
That’s the challenging part.

305
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:50,586
If there’s anything I can help with,
please feel free to reach out anytime.

306
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:51,630
It’s my pleasure to help.

307
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:53,657
I’m delighted.

308
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:59,178
As I’ve said, it took quite
a few rounds of casting

309
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,476
to arrive at this final pairing “JuneMewnich.”

310
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:04,236
I got the chance to speak with many teams,

311
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:06,695
and to finally work with
MilkLove in a full project.

312
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:09,285
This is my first time doing that.

313
00:16:09,297 --> 00:16:11,087
It’s been exciting.

314
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:15,242
I’m glad because ever since the pilot aired,

315
00:16:15,252 --> 00:16:18,430
the feedback has been amazing.

316
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:24,910
I really want to thank everyone
for this much love and support.

317
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,774
I’m really grateful
they gave me this opportunity.

318
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:32,168
When I found out I’d be acting
alongside Mewnich,

319
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:34,941
I felt even more at ease to work with her.

320
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:37,408
I didn’t even want to beg.

321
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:39,937
Say that again?

322
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:41,851
This character I play

323
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:46,983
mainly has a close relationship
with Tonnam, played by P’June.

324
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:50,892
It’s a type of relationship I think a lot of
couples out there can relate to.

325
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,636
I can’t say much yet about
what kind of relationship it is exactly,

326
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:57,673
but I believe it’ll really hit home
for a lot of people.

327
00:16:57,687 --> 00:17:02,104
It might even serve as
a message for those...

328
00:17:02,162 --> 00:17:05,408
who haven’t fully understood
love in this form.

329
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,562
What’s new about the relationship

330
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:10,586
between Tonnam and Chompoo is that

331
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,661
on the surface, they may seem one way,

332
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:14,964
but once they’re alone,

333
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:18,967
every viewer gets to see another side
of both Tonnam and Chompoo,

334
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:21,863
a side that you might not see
from JuneMewnich either.

335
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,284
It goes over-the-top, compared to JuneMewnich.

336
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:26,592
I hope everyone will stay tuned and see

337
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:29,485
how sweet things get to the point
where it might even make you roll your eyes.

338
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:33,380
In the series, Mewnich’s character is someone
who tries so hard to make everything perfect,

339
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:34,809
but June’s is more like:

340
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:35,969
"Hey, don’t do that.”

341
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:38,535
“You need to have your own thoughts too.”

342
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:41,672
Mahnmook sees quite a lot of
arguments between them.

343
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:44,811
They’re the kind of couple
who always bicker playfully.

344
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,513
One gets sulky, and the other one
has to make up for it.

345
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:51,918
One is super clingy,
and the other spoils her a lot.

346
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:53,014
It’s that kind of dynamic.

347
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:54,823
Admit it.

348
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:57,208
You like that girl called Maewnam now, don’t you?

349
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,149
In Whale Store xoxo, I play Noey,
[PIPLOY KANYARAT AS NOEY]

350
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:04,015
a lawyer and Wan’s close friend.

351
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:08,332
Her personality is cheerful and bright
when she’s around her friends.

352
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:11,008
But one thing that really stands out about her is

353
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:15,095
how strongly she fights for
what’s right and wrong.

354
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:17,180
That’s something super important to Noey.

355
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:21,666
I think this character suits
Piploy really well

356
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:23,812
because they kind of give off that nerdy vibe,

357
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:26,288
but they also have this energy

358
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,007
where they’ll snap or complain a little.

359
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:31,675
But it’s the kind of complaining
that comes from care.

360
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,390
It’s how she expresses that she cares.

361
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:36,303
You can tell, like, “Oh… she’s saying this
because she cares about me.”

362
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:39,737
I can fully lean on her and be vulnerable,

363
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:41,449
because we’re close enough for that.

364
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:45,712
Two glasses?

365
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:46,672
You’re making me blush now.

366
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:52,441
Portraying Noey, who is a lawyer,

367
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:57,972
I have to be more articulate,
more calm, and more composed,

368
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:00,906
which is quite tough for me, honestly,

369
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:03,901
because in real life,
I don’t always speak that clearly.

370
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:06,541
Portraying a lawyer,

371
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:09,750
I had to do a lot of prep.

372
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:12,436
This is the very store
that caused my dad’s death.

373
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,109
If she knows it’s your family business—

374
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:16,762
boom!

375
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:18,540
But if she finds out later—

376
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:19,506
boom again.

377
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,906
Actually, dating
the owner’s daughter at Mouse Mart,

378
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:23,798
there was no need to open your own grocery store.

379
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:28,587
In this series, I play Mahnmook.
[JINGJING PRARIYAPIT AS MAHNMOOK]

380
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:31,361
She’s a fierce woman.

381
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:33,306
Her fashion style is cool and polished

382
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:35,842
with a little touch of sexy.

383
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:39,952
She’s another professor who joins later on.

384
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:44,663
On the outside, she seems
fierce and self-assured,

385
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:49,990
but deep down, she might not be
as intimidating as she looks.

386
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:51,134
P’Jingjing—

387
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:52,615
At first,

388
00:19:52,744 --> 00:19:55,638
because of her calm look —

389
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:56,441
She has that fierce vibe.

390
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:57,060
Exactly.

391
00:19:57,075 --> 00:19:57,971
I was a little scared.

392
00:19:57,986 --> 00:20:00,910
But then we had lunch together,
sat down and talked.

393
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:03,658
- I realized she’s actually really sweet.
- She really is.

394
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:09,110
I think P’Jingjing is funny — naturally funny.

395
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:12,132
People who see her for the first time
might think she’s a bit strict,

396
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,605
but she’s actually adorable, really.

397
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:17,768
Her look and character

398
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,738
fit the role of a university professor
in this story so perfectly.

399
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:23,737
Oh! Please come in, dear customer!

400
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:26,335
Do you want to make merit together first?

401
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:28,343
Let’s chip in, okay? 10 or 20 baht will do.

402
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:31,666
There were scenes where I had
to act with senior actors,

403
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:34,103
and honestly, they had some kind of energy.

404
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:36,289
Their sense of timing was so on point.

405
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:37,270
I laughed.

406
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:39,852
It was a scene where I had to stay serious.

407
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:43,125
There I was, squeezing my own hands

408
00:20:43,197 --> 00:20:46,316
because I’m the type who breaks easily. I’d laugh.

409
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:47,698
They’re just so good at this.

410
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:52,020
Their comedic rhythm, the way they
bounce off each other — it’s flawless.

411
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,024
(P’Chompoo, I know you can speak Southern Thai dialect.)

412
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:56,692
I can do that.

413
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:59,349
My husband is from the South, you know.

414
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,753
I like that one moment you said,

415
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:03,249
“Keep eating!”

416
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,701
“Keep eating! Just eattt~”

417
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:07,756
And then there’s P’Chompoo,

418
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,208
from Kon Bai Klai Khried (Comedy Sketch Show),

419
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,500
who plays Chompoo’s mom.

420
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:14,513
She was so funny and so full-on
with her performance.

421
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:21,661
Working with her, I realized she could
handle everything about herself.

422
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:24,772
She came fully prepared, knowing her lines.

423
00:21:24,787 --> 00:21:28,356
She had no problem on set at all.

424
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:30,264
She’s very professional,

425
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:35,340
She’s warm — like a real mom figure.

426
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:37,180
I felt at ease having her around.

427
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,735
Whenever I had scenes with her,
we exchanged emotions perfectly.

428
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:44,168
I really felt that she adored me.

429
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:48,378
They’re kind of like a mom
and daughter who bicker,

430
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,703
but in a cute and good way.

431
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:52,946
Their energy was both good.

432
00:21:53,248 --> 00:21:54,309
They just clicked.

433
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:56,211
I said, not yet!!

434
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:58,190
You don’t have to be shy with me.

435
00:21:58,205 --> 00:21:59,052
Just say it!

436
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,121
Uncle Wor, plays Uncle Lee,

437
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,812
a character from the same community.

438
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,510
Maewnam is worried about him

439
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,615
as he’s an elderly living alone.

440
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,962
She’d bring him soy milk and fried dough sticks.

441
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:18,187
He acts all tough, but he actually
adores and cares about us.

442
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:19,624
He’s so sweet.

443
00:22:19,786 --> 00:22:24,337
I loved working with him — he’s full of energy.

444
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:27,772
Even just seeing his expressions
or hearing her voice over,

445
00:22:27,864 --> 00:22:29,689
I felt his powerful energy.

446
00:22:29,857 --> 00:22:32,867
As for the character who plays my dad —

447
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:38,750
I liked it when filming scenes
with both Uncle Wor and P’Durian.

448
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:42,002
There’s a scene where
the three of us were together,

449
00:22:42,014 --> 00:22:45,158
and it made me truly believe
that he was my real dad.

450
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:47,504
Their chemistry felt so real.

451
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:48,601
It flowed so naturally.

452
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:50,306
They improvised a lot too.

453
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,275
Are you really leaving me, Wan?

454
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,159
If you go, how will I be without you?

455

[WHALE STORE XOXO SPECIAL:
FIRST DAY OPENING THE STORE]

456
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:10,687
[WHALE STORE XOXO SPECIAL:
FIRST DAY OPENING THE STORE]

457
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:14,136
Since you’re this lovely,

458
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:15,976
how could I not give you a chance?

459
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:18,411
You think I’m lovely, and do you love me?

460
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,357
What?

461
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:26,367
Overall, I think it’s about love.

462
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:28,385
There are different kinds of love, right?

463
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:31,197
There’s one that’s growing,

464
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:32,325
one that you’ve just known each other

465
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:35,177
or one that you’ve been friends for a long time

466
00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:38,281
then gradually moving on to another stage.

467
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:44,133
But love can’t always be
a path of rose all the time.

468
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:46,811
There are stories and obstacles
to each love story.

469
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:48,971
And each couple also
faced different situations.

470
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:50,903
There aren’t just two couples.

471
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:53,865
There are also other characters
that help make the story fun

472
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:56,514
or create more conflicts in the story.

473
00:23:57,764 --> 00:24:00,102
Whale Store xoxo is a rom-com,

474
00:24:00,124 --> 00:24:02,106
a fluff romantic comedy story.

475
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:04,537
I believe it’s a story that’s
very very easy to digest.

476
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:06,429
Yes, it can give out positive energies
to lots of people.

477
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,194
That’s right.

478
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:15,942
Why are you crying?

479
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:18,438
I was trying to avoid eye contact.

480
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:21,536
I was avoiding eye contact but I’ve noticed.

481
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:24,939
P’Milk and Love couple?

482
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:29,185
Honestly, both on and off the camera,

483
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:32,032
they would take care of each other,

484
00:24:32,229 --> 00:24:33,952
asking, “Have you eaten?”

485
00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:35,694
“What are you doing?” “Are you alright?”

486
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:36,848
Things like that.

487
00:24:37,115 --> 00:24:39,309
That’s very cute.

488
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:42,634
They have matching chemistry
both on and off camera.

489
00:24:42,918 --> 00:24:44,179
They are always together.

490
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,865
When there’s food support, they would go

491
00:24:47,223 --> 00:24:50,242
“Let’s save this one for Love.”
or “Let’s save this one for P’Milk.”

492
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:51,835
This is what I noticed.

493
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:55,130
They would take care of
each other down to minor things.

494
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:58,097
They seem like a couple that’s quite “soft”.

495
00:24:58,137 --> 00:24:59,066
Yes, yes, that’s right.

496
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,251
They’re really “soft”.

497
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:02,444
They are quite cheerful,

498
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:07,928
in a way that is definitely
more grown up than in 23.5.

499
00:25:07,987 --> 00:25:09,268
- I hope you will stay tuned to see.
- That’s right.

500
00:25:09,282 --> 00:25:13,051
I notice that there are
improvisations in the scenes.

501
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:19,198
Unless the director calls a cut,
they will keep going.

502
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:23,533
They’re improvisations that I find adorable.

503
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:35,642
P’June and I got along and it was easy to get along.

504
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:39,842
We're the same in that, we’re both
very hard-working when it comes to work.

505
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,894
We take the job very seriously

506
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:46,797
and had done quite
a deep research on the script.

507
00:25:46,816 --> 00:25:51,168
So when we did the workshop,
we tuned in very well to each other.

508
00:25:51,435 --> 00:25:57,157
I feel like, both characters are
similar to the real life

509
00:25:57,174 --> 00:26:00,660
so it wasn’t awkward when we acted it out.

510
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:04,282
On the other hand, I feel like
they’re just like us in real life.

511
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:06,374
So it’s comfortable working with her.

512
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:11,465
I was glad and comfortable
that my partner was going to be her.

513
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:12,693
It’s like a big burden has been lifted

514
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:17,253
because we’re close even before we realize
that we’re going to get paired up.

515
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:24,359
Like, okay, this person is going
to help me take our pairing all the way.

516
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,911
I mean, a lot of our thoughts align.

517
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:29,943
The things we want to do
and stuff like that are pretty similar.

518
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:32,017
I feel very comfortable.

519
00:26:32,148 --> 00:26:34,671
The two get along really well.

520
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:36,829
They have similar energy.

521
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:39,354
If they were to take the role of friends,
they would look like good friends.

522
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:40,594
- Right, right.
- They have this…

523
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:41,813
They’re similar.

524
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:42,851
Yes.

525
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:45,146
- “On the same wavelength” is that the word?
- “On the same wavelength”.

526
00:26:45,223 --> 00:26:47,159
They have this very girly, feminine vibe.

527
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,687
Yes, yes.

528
00:26:54,850 --> 00:27:00,277
Wan’s grocery store is located
in a community area in Bangkok.

529
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,143
Things sold there are just like
any grocery store

530
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:09,157
like ice cream, drinks, or small groceries,
like household goods.

531
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,568
There are also snacks that we’re familiar with.

532
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:12,241
Yes.

533
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,034
Like crispy shrimp crackers.

534
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:18,237
Are we going bankrupt?
Miss Wan is not doing any business.

535
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:19,577
She’s only getting hit on by a girl.

536
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:21,807
I can help you.

537
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:22,487
<b>CHUM-LAE GROCERY</b>

538
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,557
Chum-Lae Grocery.

539
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:28,139
That’s right, that’s the name Wan
came up with, “Chum-Lae Grocery.”

540
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:32,290
People are like, “Are you really
going to use this name?”

541
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:34,391
But I’m quite confident.

542
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:36,154
Yes. Wan is a bit creative.

543
00:27:36,162 --> 00:27:37,244
She named it "Chum-Lae Grocery"

544
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:38,970
so she could compete with her competitors.

545
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,355
The name is quite unique.

546
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,540
For me, I’m okay with anything.

547
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,439
There’s one scene that I find very cute.

548
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:03,025
That’s the scene of our
first impression when we first met.

549
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:04,514
What are you doing here?!

550
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:10,943
It’s playful.

551
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:14,208
It’s the scene where I was looking for
something in front of her house.

552
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:17,331
Then I turned around and saw her.
I find it adorable.

553
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,721
For me personally, every time
Maewnam sees Wan,

554
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,777
she will always have her rizz,

555
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:26,994
the words that people would think
Love would never say.

556
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,853
- But Maewnam would say it so many times
throughout the series.
- But those were improvised.

557
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:32,242
I’m telling you, they were improvised.

558
00:28:32,408 --> 00:28:34,637
That’s why you should look forward to it.

559
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,717
Your mom seems pretty open-minded.

560
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,337
Don’t you think you should tell her
about you and Tonnam dating?

561
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,777
Chompoo might not even like men.

562
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:44,296
I like the scene at my house.

563
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,291
It was touching.

564
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:51,094
It was a resolution for lots of things.

565
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:55,531
It was also that I might have said
something on behalf of many others.

566
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:56,096
Oh, yes.

567
00:28:56,108 --> 00:29:02,136
And my Mom might have said something
on behalf of people in their generation.

568
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:05,752
- It’s very relatable for people in the society,
- Yes, it’s very relatable.

569
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:09,032
When you see this scene, you might go,

570
00:29:09,254 --> 00:29:11,102
- “Oh, that’s me.”
- “I’ve felt that before.”

571
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:12,279
Yes, something like that.

572
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:15,586
I like one dramatic scene.

573
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,500
It was also at her house.

574
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:19,328
Like I said, I’ve only been rolling
around in her house.

575
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,041
Chom, when are you going to tell
your mom about us?

576
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:24,134
It feels like I can’t see our future at all.

577
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,930
It’s a drama scene where I feel like
that time was very tough for me.

578
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:36,943
But having her beside me makes
everything feel much more simple.

579
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:41,282
I don’t know, it’s like she’s embracing me

580
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:46,268
who has become a little kid in her embrace.

581
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,623
I like that scene too.

582
00:29:48,008 --> 00:29:50,391
P’Golf told me I didn’t have to stick to the script.

583
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:53,322
Just go with however I feel at that moment.

584
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:01,438
The vibe at the production?

585
00:30:01,557 --> 00:30:05,435
Since we were shooting in summer
and doing outdoor shootings,

586
00:30:05,911 --> 00:30:10,143
we never get to experience
any wind except for hot air.

587
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:13,216
Everyone knows without saying
that after the director calls ‘cut’,

588
00:30:13,231 --> 00:30:18,074
we would save up our energy
and just talk during mealtime.

589
00:30:18,392 --> 00:30:22,786
Yeah, but I feel like,
since it’s all girlie pops power…

590
00:30:22,884 --> 00:30:25,943
- It’s another mood.
- Yeah, another mood.

591
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:30,862
Like, P’Milk save the food for me
or calling me and asking what I want to eat.

592
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:33,768
Say, when I’m waiting to go on another scene
and P’Milk’s already finished,

593
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:35,565
she would call me and ask what I wanted to eat.

594
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,697
She would tell me there are this and that,
and she would save it aside for me.

595
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:41,737
Wow! Delish!

596
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:44,394
Honestly, the girls in
this production are obedient.

597
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:46,279
They would come running right
when you called them.

598
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,647
- They’re quick to act.
- It’s like they know their own roles.

599
00:30:48,831 --> 00:30:53,020
We all want to get it done and get it done in time.

600
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:58,508
The fun is mostly behind the scenes,
with our makeup artist and hairstylist.

601
00:30:58,521 --> 00:31:01,103
We would get to fool around
behind the scenes.

602
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:04,463
We also talk and play around a lot
before entering the scenes

603
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,336
because the mood at the production
wasn’t too stressful.

604
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:09,521
The vibe at the production was fun.

605
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:12,179
We would do a bit of chit-chatting.

606
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:16,601
Since there were lots of girls,
it was easy to get along,

607
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,687
easy to talk about things,
and we weren’t too awkward.

608
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:21,484
The staff were also lovely.

609
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:22,454
It didn’t feel stressful when working.

610
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,810
It was really good!

611
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:27,205
As in, we didn’t have to be careful about things.

612
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:28,048
That’s right.

613
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:30,817
Let's say if we were to work with male actors,

614
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:34,010
even if they are a junior
or a senior we’re close to,

615
00:31:34,188 --> 00:31:36,496
we would still have to be careful to some extent.

616
00:31:36,712 --> 00:31:40,431
- As in the way we talk, our body, or whatever.
- The way we dress or with our skirts.

617
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:45,305
But when it’s girls, it’s somewhat
more chill when we do things.

618
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,322
I feel comfortable.

619
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:48,797
There were lots of food support.

620
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:49,398
That’s right!

621
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:53,974
- Thank you so much, everyone.
- Thank you so much for supporting this series.

622
00:31:53,982 --> 00:31:56,949
Even when you don’t know how it will turn out yet

623
00:31:56,964 --> 00:32:00,546
but you all have been welcoming
and supporting it so well.

624
00:32:00,931 --> 00:32:02,442
The entire production had
delicious and fulfilling meals.

625
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,792
There were so many
that we had to pack them home.

626
00:32:04,804 --> 00:32:05,788
We really had to take them home, always.

627
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:13,491
Maybe you want to sit like this first.

628
00:32:13,502 --> 00:32:15,065
Then lay down like this, perhaps.

629
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:15,894
Then the hands.

630
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,079
The director just let it roll.

631
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,377
So much so!

632
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:27,478
I have worked with him before
and I think he’s very chill.

633
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,321
But he’s not too chill.

634
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:32,496
Yes, I mean it's not like he takes his job lightly

635
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:35,171
but he made the vibe of the production…

636
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:36,136
He’s fun.

637
00:32:36,152 --> 00:32:36,848
Yes, yes.

638
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:41,903
But when it comes to work, he would be
serious when he’s supposed to be.

639
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:44,183
It’s to ensure that the work
comes out with good quality.

640
00:32:44,207 --> 00:32:49,439
I mean, he’s never pressured us
too much that we can’t act.

641
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,460
He’d always ask if we’re okay.

642
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:54,922
He asked how we were feeling
or what we thought.

643
00:32:54,937 --> 00:32:56,299
He would always ask for our opinions.

644
00:32:56,413 --> 00:33:01,856
So the two of us and the other cast
can design the character along with him.

645
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:04,351
This is my first time working with P’Golf.

646
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:06,490
We’ve never worked together before.

647
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:07,900
When I first met him,

648
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:11,082
I was wondering if he would be tough or kind.

649
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:13,493
But when we started shooting
and I arrived at the production,

650
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:17,411
he kept making jokes with me
and I started to get confused like,

651
00:33:17,422 --> 00:33:21,216
“Are we filming or is he pulling
a joke on me again?”

652
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:23,740
That was nice and fun.

653
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,792
This is my second series working with him.

654
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:29,014
The first one was Only Boo.

655
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:32,041
He’s the kind of person
who you can share thoughts with.

656
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:34,811
If you have anything that bugs you,
you can let him know.

657
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:36,127
It's my first time working with him.

658
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:39,288
I find that he’s funny and chill.

659
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:40,767
He’s the kind of person...

660
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:45,062
who can just start a small talk
based on things around you so casually.

661
00:33:57,277 --> 00:34:00,627
[WHALE STORE XOXO SPECIAL:
FIRST DAY OPENING THE STORE]

662
00:34:01,412 --> 00:34:05,702
[WHALE STORE XOXO SPECIAL:
FIRST DAY OPENING THE STORE]

663
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:20,939
The OST for this series is called
“Rang-wan-khon-geng”.

664
00:34:21,188 --> 00:34:26,730
When I first heard it briefly,
I thought, would this fit only for me?

665
00:34:26,742 --> 00:34:28,494
Is this song only for Maewnam?

666
00:34:28,512 --> 00:34:30,231
But after listening to it in detail,

667
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:33,674
it’s an “award” for all characters in the series.

668
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:39,428
It’s not only for Wan or Maewnam
but also for Tonnam and Chompoo,

669
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:48,229
even for the Dad, Wan’s Papa, or Uncle Lee
and every character in the story.

670
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:50,749
They are all good in their own ways.

671
00:34:50,826 --> 00:34:53,247
All characters have their own struggles
and they overcome them.

672
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:54,743
Yes, they overcame it.

673
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:57,684
I feel like this is a song for you.

674
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:00,521
It's an award, an award for great people.

675
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:04,152
Yes, I hope it will be a song
that helps heal your hearts

676
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:10,437
or pull people out if they’re having a hard time.

677
00:35:10,782 --> 00:35:19,034
From what I heard, there are songs
that are happy ones and sad ones.

678
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:25,348
I feel like, when it’s added to the series
it would make it complete.

679
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:26,232
Yes.

680
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:28,366
As in, for the happy song,
when added to a happy scene,

681
00:35:28,382 --> 00:35:29,930
- it would turn out so great.
- It would go all mellow and nice.

682
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:30,777
Yes.

683
00:35:30,902 --> 00:35:34,908
But for the sad songs, when it’s added to
a scene that’s disheartening…

684
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:35,899
It hits hard.

685
00:35:35,908 --> 00:35:36,917
That’s right!

686
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:37,936
You would really feel it.

687
00:35:37,952 --> 00:35:42,374
When I heard the songs together with the others,

688
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:47,148
I feel like wow, the scenes
would pop right up in my head.

689
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,494
That’s right! Same here!

690
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:53,001
When it comes together in a series
with all the elements intact,

691
00:35:53,023 --> 00:35:54,653
imagine how great that would be.

692
00:35:55,426 --> 00:35:56,822
I like you, Wan.

693
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:58,434
How about you?

694
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,751
Something to look forward to
in this series is that

695
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:06,037
the cast members are serving
romance with each other.

696
00:36:06,974 --> 00:36:10,474
I believe there will be lots of cute
and lovey-dovey moments in the series.

697
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:14,075
Everyone has been working so hard,
whether it's the cast or the staff

698
00:36:14,092 --> 00:36:17,890
because it was scorching hot
at the filming location or the main location.

699
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:22,604
But everyone worked hard
and we were sweating all over.

700
00:36:22,623 --> 00:36:23,620
There was no air to breathe.

701
00:36:23,632 --> 00:36:27,339
But everyone did their best to make sure
all the scenes came out perfect.

702
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:29,296
What will you get from this series?

703
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:30,871
I think it's definitely entertainment.

704
00:36:31,337 --> 00:36:32,665
It’s surely going to be fun and entertaining.

705
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:33,613
You would also be kicking your feet

706
00:36:33,629 --> 00:36:37,217
with the chemistry from
the many couples in the series.

707
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:42,782
You would also get to understand and sympathize.

708
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,389
There’s also drama and comedy to it.

709
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:50,441
I believe that this series has all the emotions.

710
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,946
You really should tune in.

711
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:56,329
I think it gives a perspective
and a support for those

712
00:36:56,348 --> 00:37:02,142
who are doubting about what they are doing.

713
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:06,806
Wan might not be confident about
how far she can take this grocery store

714
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:09,166
but she has someone beside her.

715
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:13,483
Since she has gained lots of support,
she could feel so firm

716
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:14,859
so she decided to keep pushing.

717
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:18,874
The characters in this series
teach you lots of things

718
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:24,506
but it weighs a lot on love
which comes in different forms and types.

719
00:37:24,518 --> 00:37:26,332
It’s not limited to gender.

720
00:37:26,552 --> 00:37:32,653
It also has to do with family
which becomes involved in a relationship.

721
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:37,511
I think this series is very easy to appreciate.

722
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,763
Anyone of any age can watch it.

723
00:37:40,964 --> 00:37:48,483
It mentioned problems in
a relationship that can be so minor

724
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:50,299
but can lead to such a big problem.

725
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:53,766
Or like, it’s a problem that has
never been talked about before.

726
00:37:54,102 --> 00:37:58,025
It’s also something that allows you
to better understand

727
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:04,932
the perspective of Girls’ love
or woman loves woman.

728
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:06,577
Damn! I want to date someone too!

729
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,231
You have that grocery store sis, don’t you?

730
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,934
Chom, when are you going to tell
your mom about us?

731
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:13,140
It feels like I can’t see our future at all.

732
00:38:13,472 --> 00:38:15,949
It’s my girlfriend’s store,
so I have to help sell, right?

733
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:18,029
<i>The end of something</i>

734
00:38:18,186 --> 00:38:21,262
<i>can also be a good beginning for some stories.</i>

735
00:38:21,915 --> 00:38:26,934
Please support “Mahnmook”, my latest role.

736
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:31,886
Please tune in to this series from
the first until the final episode.

737
00:38:31,903 --> 00:38:33,400
You will definitely be surprised

738
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:36,037
because all characters have
their own struggles.

739
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:40,449
How would each character overcome
the struggle of their couples?

740
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,580
I hope you will stay tuned.

741
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:44,216
Please support “Noey”.

742
00:38:44,232 --> 00:38:46,992
It’s a new role that I’ve been
assigned for this series.

743
00:38:47,172 --> 00:38:50,666
I really did my best
and worked really hard for it.

744
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:54,906
Not only me but everyone in this series,

745
00:38:55,192 --> 00:38:56,878
the director, and all cast members.

746
00:38:56,896 --> 00:38:59,686
I hope you will support this series and tune in.

747
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:05,917
Please support “Tonnam”,
Whale Store xoxo, and all characters.

748
00:39:05,939 --> 00:39:09,449
Everyone put their hearts
and minds into this series.

749
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:16,995
It was another difficult series for me
and I gave all my heart and soul.

750
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,743
I hope you will be rooting for
Tonnam and Chompoo’s couple.

751
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:25,523
I believe it is relatable for so many of you

752
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:28,563
and it would definitely make society
become more open-minded.

753
00:39:28,837 --> 00:39:31,654
Please support “Chompoo”.

754
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:37,746
It’s my first official work with GMMTV.

755
00:39:38,037 --> 00:39:43,789
I poured a lot of my heart into this work.

756
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:47,912
I worked hard to portray
her life for you all to see.

757
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:50,440
I worked hard behind the scenes for this series.

758
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:54,177
So please support Whale Store xoxo.

759
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:57,146
Please support “Wan”.

760
00:39:57,163 --> 00:39:59,536
It might be a character that might seem new to me.

761
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:02,137
You might have seen me being bubbly often

762
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,542
but I’m more composed this time.

763
00:40:03,697 --> 00:40:07,237
Anyway, lastly, please support Whale Store xoxo.

764
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,712
All the cast members and staff
poured their hearts into this series.

765
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:11,945
I hope you all will like it.

766
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:14,351
Please support Whale Store xoxo.

767
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:21,629
I believe “Maewnam” will provide
liveliness and kindness to you all

768
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,582
because she has lots of positive energy
and likes to help others.

769
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:30,109
Regardless of how exhausted she was,
she would always fight for others.

770
00:40:30,186 --> 00:40:34,330
If you have Maewnam in mind,
you would probably be happy.

771
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,723
Please support Tonnam
and Chompoo’s relationship.

772
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:42,508
Stay tuned to see how friends
would change into other things

773
00:40:42,517 --> 00:40:44,828
and on what or how they would fight.

774
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:49,278
It’s very intense and there are
conflicts in every episode.

775
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:53,023
I hope you will keep climbing up
the level with us.

776
00:40:53,057 --> 00:40:53,641
That’s right.

777
00:40:53,660 --> 00:41:01,539
Please support us and don’t forget
to watch Whale Store xoxo.

778
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:07,817
What you will get to see in this story is
Maewnam trying to win Wan’s heart.

779
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:13,031
It’s something that’s very new for
the MUVMUVs, Mini Hearts, and Mimivs.

780
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:15,543
Apart from that, there are also conflicts from…

781
00:41:15,566 --> 00:41:17,420
- From all. From all the cast members.
- All cast members.

782
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:23,235
Whether it’s about family, work, or such things.

783
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:24,791
Isn’t that exciting?

784
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:27,434
Please stay tuned to Whale Store xoxo.

785
00:41:27,522 --> 00:41:29,471
The store is almost open!

Please support Whale Store xoxo.
[EVERY WEDNESDAY. PREMIERES JUNE 25, 8:30 PM.]

787
00:41:33,536 --> 00:41:35,071
I hope a lot of you will tune in!

788
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:36,062
Bye-bye!

789
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,976
Bye-bye!

790
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:47,232
Som, do you think…

791
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:49,614
I have feelings for Maewnam?

792
00:41:53,526 --> 00:41:57,532
When you're this great, it's impossible

793
00:41:57,552 --> 00:41:59,632
Not to wrap myself around you

794
00:42:00,632 --> 00:42:04,552
My heart is already yours

795
00:42:17,672 --> 00:42:21,592
If I could hand out one grand prize

796
00:42:22,112 --> 00:42:26,192
You're the only winner in my eyes

797
00:42:28,352 --> 00:42:32,872
I'd steal your heart and keep it by my side, yeah

798
00:42:33,152 --> 00:42:37,032
Won't let you be all alone tonight

799
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:41,312
So in love, I just can’t let you out of sight

800
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:44,032
My restless heart always wants you to be mine

801
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:49,592
My Only Champion Award goes to you, hmmm

802
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:52,352
Who cares what people think and say

803
00:42:52,432 --> 00:42:55,112
My heart belongs to you right away

804
00:42:55,192 --> 00:42:59,752
You are the only champion for me

805
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:03,752
When you're this great, it's impossible

806
00:43:03,752 --> 00:43:05,872
Not to give you a warm embrace

807
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:09,272
You're great, it's impossible

808
00:43:09,272 --> 00:43:12,192
Not to love you and put you first

809
00:43:12,512 --> 00:43:15,112
No need to be the very best

810
00:43:15,272 --> 00:43:17,832
Being who you are earns you an embrace

811
00:43:17,912 --> 00:43:22,072
My heart is already yours

812
00:43:23,552 --> 00:43:28,792
Ba-da-dup ba-ba-ba-da-dup-ba
Ba-da-dup ba-ba-ba-da-dup-ba

813
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:34,312
Gonna hold you tight, you're the one (la-la-la-la)

814
00:43:34,592 --> 00:43:39,832
Ba-da-dup ba-ba-ba-da-dup-ba
Ba-da-dup ba-ba-ba-da-dup-ba

815
00:43:40,072 --> 00:43:44,312
Gonna hold you tight, you're the one (la-la-la-la)

816
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:12,992
I promise I won’t ever let your hand slip away

817
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:18,192
I’ll cheer you on, I’m here to stay

818
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:23,752
No fear, whatever challenges you may face

819
00:44:24,192 --> 00:44:28,032
Just know that you're already the best

820
00:44:28,912 --> 00:44:31,632
So in love, I just can’t let you out of sight

821
00:44:31,832 --> 00:44:34,392
My restless heart always wants you to be mine

822
00:44:34,392 --> 00:44:39,992
My Only Champion Award goes to you, hmmm

823
00:44:39,992 --> 00:44:42,712
Who cares what people think and say

824
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:45,432
My heart belongs to you right away

825
00:44:45,472 --> 00:44:50,072
You are the only champion for me

826
00:44:50,112 --> 00:44:54,072
When you're this great, it's impossible

827
00:44:54,112 --> 00:44:56,112
Not to give you a warm embrace

828
00:44:56,312 --> 00:44:59,592
You're great, it's impossible

829
00:44:59,592 --> 00:45:02,512
Not to love you and put you first

830
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:05,392
No need to be the very best

831
00:45:05,552 --> 00:45:08,152

When you're this great, it's impossible

Not to give you a warm embrace

835
00:45:18,392 --> 00:45:21,672
You're great, it's impossible
