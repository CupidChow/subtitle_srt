1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,360
<i>Let's take a moment for a safety alert.</i>

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,800
<i>This household got broken into twice,</i>
<i>and that's not all.</i>

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,600
<i>Over ten homes in the neighborhood</i>
<i>got broken into.</i>

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,600
<i>They chained it up and everything,</i>
<i>but their motorbike still got stolen.</i>

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,080
<i>Do you know how the thieves did it?</i>

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,800
<i>They sneaked in quietly,</i>
<i>targeting Buddhist holy days</i>

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,640
<i>when people leave for the temple.</i>

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,800
<i>Seriously, that's next-level bad karma.</i>

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,800
<i>This thief has a thing</i>
<i>for victims who live by Dharma.</i>

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,080
Who the heck is that?

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,080
YUTH PANICH

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,880
What are you doing here?!

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,520
Who are you? What are you doing here?

14
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,240
Rat! A rat!

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,520
Ugh! Rat!

16
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,960
TWO WEEKS BEFORE

17
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,480
MOUSE MART: FOOD, ESSENTIALS
EVERYTHING YOU NEED, ALL IN ONE PLACE

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,920
MAEWNAM SERVICE

19
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,960
Order 3308 is ready.

20
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,160
It's mine.

21
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,440
- Your order is here, Pin.
- Sure.

22
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,000
Thanks. Put them inside the store.

23
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,520
Maewnam, hold on.

24
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,240
Eat something first.
I'll cook for you.

25
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,720
Thank you!

26
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,920
I'm off, Mom.

27
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,880
Yeah.

28
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,400
Look at you.

29
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,480
Here's a fried egg to go with your meal.
It's on the house.

30
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,880
Packed with protein.

31
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,120
Mama, where do you want me to put it?

32
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,280
I'm washing my customer's hair.
Put it there.

33
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,920
- The money is right there, okay?
- Okey dokey!

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,520
Call me if you need anything.

35
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
Wait for me. Wait, please.

36
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,519
Please wait for my friend.

37
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,399
Hey, hurry up. She's waiting.

38
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,080
Uncle Lee!

39
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,400
Uncle Lee, hello?

40
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,640
Uncle?

41
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,600
Yeah.

42
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,280
Here's your soy milk
with fried dough sticks.

43
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,080
- Got it. Thanks.
- Make sure you eat it.

44
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,360
PAPA

45
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,000
Hello, Papa?

46
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,120
<i>What's up? What are you doing, beautiful?</i>

47
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,520
I'm about to go to work.

48
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh? All right, go ahead.

49
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm just calling to ask
what time you're coming this Saturday.

50
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,320
Well, I think I'll be there
in the evening.

51
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,360
I need to go work onsite with my boss.

52
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,080
Don't worry. Prioritize your work.

53
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,360
What do you want to eat?
I'll prepare it for you.

54
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
What should we eat?
How about Mala?

55
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,120
Papa, I have to rush to work now.

56
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,120
Oh? Well…

57
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,320
This daughter is always in a rush, huh?

58
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,400
How's Chun-Li doing, Maewnam?

59
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,040
I think it's broken.
The power's not coming through.

60
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,200
Let me see what I can do.

61
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,680
See? I told you I never mess up.

62
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,240
The power's not coming through.

63
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,720
Ugh, seriously?
You're broken already, Chun-Li?

64
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,960
You're not durable at all.
I've barely used you.

65
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,040
It might be barely used, but look here.
It's already covered in cobwebs.

66
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,200
It's already old, Uncle.

67
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,000
- Please just buy a new one.
- What? You can't fix it?

68
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,400
If you can't, you shouldn't call yourself
"Maewnam Service," right?

69
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,880
All right, all right.

70
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,840
Don't challenge me.

71
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,400
This will be a piece of cake.

72
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,920
Fine. Let's see if that's true.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,480
Get it fixed for me.

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,600
But please hurry up.

75
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,920
Wan is coming for dinner this Saturday.

76
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
Which day again?

77
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,760
This Saturday.

78
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,080
Or is it next Saturday?

79
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,560
Or this Saturday?

80
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,200
Yeah, this Saturday.

81
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,040
Be quick, and don't make it expensive.

82
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,520
I never charge expensive prices.

83
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,480
It's just a bit over the usual.

84
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,440
That's literally what expensive means.

85
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,320
Good morning.

86
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,440
Dome, good morning.

87
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,640
Is Pruk here yet?

88
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,200
Nah.

89
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,120
How about Yu?

90
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,680
I haven't seen her yet.

91
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Are you guys ready?

92
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,360
It seems you aren't.

93
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,480
Where is the presentation board?

94
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,120
It's with Yu.

95
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,320
Huh? And where is she?

96
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,320
She hasn't arrived.

97
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,200
But the meeting is only at ten, right?
We have ten minutes left.

98
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,600
Even if we still have ten minutes left,
we need to prepare, don't we?

99
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,880
The client is already here.

100
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,760
Go take care of him first.

101
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,960
Got it.

102
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,800
- Got it.
- All right.

103
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,920
Hello, Mr. Tanaka.

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,320
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Thantara.

105
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,720
I look forward to working with you.

106
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,680
Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you.
You must be Miss Thantara.

107
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,320
I also look forward to working with you.

108
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,240
Of course.

109
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,160
Please, take a seat.

110
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,039
PAPA

111
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,840
Let me give you some quick background
about our company first.

112
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,880
At M Think, we've been
bringing in international events

113
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,880
for over 10 years now.

114
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:56,480
We've organized concerts,
seminars, and meetings

115
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,760
in more than 60 countries
around the world.

116
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,680
We're very pleased

117
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,280
to be working with you, Mr. Tanaka.

118
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,000
Excellent.

119
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,600
Thank you very much.

120
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,360
Thank you so much.

121
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,000
Hello, Mr. Tanaka.

122
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,760
Hello, Mr. Pruk.

123
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,840
Ah, the presentation file is with
one of my team members.

124
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,360
I'll have her bring it over right away.

125
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,720
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

126
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,440
That's all right.

127
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,880
It's exactly ten now. We're still on time.

128
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm so sorry I'm late.

129
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,160
That's irresponsible.

130
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,480
My son had a fever this morning, so I…

131
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,360
Stop making excuses.

132
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,880
Let's get to work. Go!

133
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,520
Sure.

134
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,320
Just a moment, please.

135
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,440
What's going on?

136
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,760
The battery died.

137
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,360
You don't have a backup?

138
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,200
Uncle, I got it fixed already.

139
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,960
The part cost 300, but since we're close,
I'll charge you 1,000.

140
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,440
See? I said 1,000
and now you're pretending to fall asleep.

141
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,640
Come on. We are close, aren't we?

142
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,200
Give me an extra, okay?

143
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
Uncle?

144
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,800
Did you upload it to the cloud
by any chance, Yu?

145
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,800
Maybe we can open it from Dome's laptop.

146
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,520
I was going to,
but my son threw up real bad.

147
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,640
I don't care.
Whatever it takes, make it happen.

148
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,040
Otherwise, Mom's going to end up
throwing up instead of her son.

149
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm being serious here. It's not a joke.

150
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,880
Noted.

151
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,000
Mr. Tanaka, downstairs,
we have a smoothie stall.

152
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,760
It's mango season right now.

153
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,240
There are lots of delicious Thai desserts.

154
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,160
If you're into that,
I'd love for you to give it a try.

155
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,840
Anyway, once everything's ready here,
I'll give you a call.

156
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,240
Dome, can you take him?

157
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,800
Okay.

158
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,560
Sure, I'll take you there.

159
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,000
This way, please.

160
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,320
I love mangoes.

161
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,480
Thank you.

162
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Hey.

163
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,040
Take care of this for me.

164
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,800
Yu, let's talk.

165
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,280
What's going on with you?

166
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,160
You showed up late,
and the work isn't ready.

167
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,480
Well, my kid's sick.

168
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,800
He had a fever last night
and cried all night.

169
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
I was working the whole night
and barely got any sleep.

170
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,160
Enough with the "my kid's sick" excuse.

171
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,040
Is that your problem or my problem?

172
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,840
Honestly, I never should've hired a mom.

173
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,040
You can't even focus on work.

174
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,920
How can you even say that?

175
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,720
Why not?

176
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,160
I'm just telling the truth.

177
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,480
Women with kids are just full of problems.

178
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,920
They can't focus on work.

179
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,880
First, their kids get sick.
Then they get sick.

180
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,440
They arrive late, and then
they leave early to pick their kids up.

181
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,480
It's always something.

182
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Let me ask you honestly.

183
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,760
If having a kid is just a burden,
why did you even have one?

184
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,480
Excuse me,
but don't you think that's too harsh?

185
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,000
Yu should have gotten
proper maternity leave.

186
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,920
But what's this?

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,680
Instead, she barely had a month off
before being dragged back to work.

188
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,640
Honestly, she could file a complaint
with the labor department.

189
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,520
I'm sorry, Wan.

190
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,560
I did ask Yu if she was okay working.

191
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,000
She said yes.

192
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,960
Didn't you, Yu?

193
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,440
Am I right, Yu?!

194
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,240
I'm sorry,

195
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,480
but who would dare say no to you?

196
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,560
Wan, can you stop speaking
for other people?

197
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,040
Yu messed up today,
and now we're in trouble because of her.

198
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,000
What's this, huh?

199
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,160
Now I'm expected to not only do my job
but also babysit everyone's emotions too?

200
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,160
Damn. You've really got zero humanity.

201
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,640
I don't care.
Say whatever you want about me.

202
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,360
But I need us
to do this presentation today,

203
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
so just get it done.

204
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,440
Hey, pick up your call already.

205
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,560
It's been ringing forever.
It's so annoying.

206
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Hello, Papa? What is it? I'm in a meeting.

207
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,600
<i>Your father's condition has worsened.</i>

208
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,520
<i>Please come to the hospital immediately.</i>

209
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,360
Is something wrong, Wan?

210
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,920
Someone called to tell me that
my father's condition has worsened.

211
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,640
I need to rush to the hospital now.

212
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,240
Well, then you'd better go now.
I'll take care of things here.

213
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,880
- Please take care of this for me. Thanks!
- Of course.

214
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,480
Hey.

215
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,800
Hey…

216
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,520
I'm sorry.

217
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,920
I didn't get your father here in time.

218
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,360
I'm sorry.

219
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,080
Wan? How is everything?

220
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm okay.

221
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,560
This is from me.
I'm sorry I didn't attend the funeral.

222
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,720
Don't worry. The temple is
pretty far. I understand.

223
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,720
Take it.

224
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,880
Thank you.

225
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,119
Wan.

226
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,359
Pruk said to go see him
in his office once you arrive.

227
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,400
I'm sorry I didn't have time
to attend your dad's funeral.

228
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,480
But I already sent a funeral wreath.

229
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,040
Yes, I saw it.

230
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,800
Do you need anything else?

231
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,640
Let's get to the point.

232
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,880
As your supervisor, I have to say this.

233
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,200
I feel that you were overly aggressive.

234
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,000
That kind of behavior, especially in front
of others, was completely inappropriate.

235
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,080
I was just standing up for someone
who didn't dare speak up to you.

236
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,720
And did you forget that I'm the boss?

237
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,320
It's my right to give orders,
critique work,

238
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,840
or do anything I find appropriate.

239
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,160
I understand that work is
important to you.

240
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,760
But don't forget you're not working alone.

241
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,440
We work as a team.

242
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
Have you ever stopped
to think about how your behavior

243
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,640
affects the people under you?

244
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,120
My behavior?

245
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,800
What exactly did I do?

246
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,120
When you want something done
on a day off, you demand it.

247
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,800
You call on weekends even late at night.

248
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,760
I don't get it, but after work,

249
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,720
you run meetings so long that
everyone's drained by the end.

250
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,200
It feels like we're all expected
to be on standby for you.

251
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,200
But don't forget,
everyone else has their own lives too.

252
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm sorry, but I pay their salaries.

253
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,000
Does that pay make up for
the life they're losing?

254
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,560
Your money can't buy everything.

255
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,520
Work means a lot to you, but we all
have other responsibilities too.

256
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,160
So you can't balance your life and your
work, and you're blaming it on me?

257
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,280
Originally, I just wanted
to have a conversation to clear things up.

258
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,840
But now, I've changed my mind.

259
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,000
With this kind of attitude,
we can't work together anymore.

260
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,440
Yes, I agree.

261
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,080
I've already prepared for this.

262
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,000
You think that if you quit now,
it's going to be easy to find another job?

263
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,520
Ever since my father died,
I've realized work isn't my whole life.

264
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,400
If I quit, sure,
you'll find someone to replace me.

265
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,800
But I only had one father.

266
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't want to dedicate my whole life

267
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,720
to working with someone with no empathy
who thinks the world revolves around them.

268
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,200
Let it all revolve around you.

269
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,960
I'm stepping out of that orbit.

270
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,320
And one more thing.

271
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,880
Even if something happened to you,

272
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,000
the company would just replace you
like anyone else.

273
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,920
We just saw each other not long ago.

274
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,560
YUTH PANICH

275
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,360
I'm finally here.

276
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,720
SOM SALON

277
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,720
Ever since Yuth closed his shop,

278
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,080
I've had to drag myself all the way
to Khlong Thom just to buy things.

279
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,760
It's hot, and now my back hurts.

280
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,320
Chom, once you're done with your hair,
take the stuff to the back for me.

281
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,600
This daughter just got her nails done.

282
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,840
She's not in the mood
to lift anything heavy.

283
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,720
Bifern!

284
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,840
Help carry some boxes
out the back, please.

285
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,280
Sure. I'm coming!

286
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,720
What needs moving?

287
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,560
These two boxes, Fern.

288
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,280
Got it.

289
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,960
Whoa!

290
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,240
See? My life!

291
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,560
I make my daughter help me,
and she passes it off to someone else.

292
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,040
In the end, I still have to pay
someone else's kid to get the job done.

293
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,520
Why do you have to go buy stuff yourself?

294
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,240
You can just use Maewnam Service.

295
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,560
She leaves for university
early in the morning.

296
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,560
You two are friends, aren't you?
How come you don't know?

297
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,960
And you? Aren't you in a hurry
to get to university?

298
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,960
I've already calculated the time.
I'll make it.

299
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,520
I'm a responsible person, you know.

300
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,720
Oh wow.

301
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,600
Should I give you this for that one?
Listen to your tone!

302
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,080
Mom, no way!
I'm under the hair steamer.

303
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,200
You're getting all glamorous, huh?

304
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,160
Did you come to class alone?

305
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,920
Same here. I came by myself too.

306
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,840
Here, let me get the door for you.
It looks like you're carrying a lot.

307
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,040
Thanks.

308
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,280
But I'm not here to study.

309
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,600
I'm here to teach.

310
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,200
If you don't want to sit with me,
there's no need to crack a joke like that.

311
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,000
I'll take that as a compliment.
You think I look young.

312
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,160
But I'm used to it by now.

313
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,800
Thanks anyway.

314
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,960
Good morning, everyone.

315
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,200
Hello!

316
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,680
PROF. MAEWNAM

317
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,840
I'm Professor Maewnam.

318
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,680
Wow!

319
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,040
You're a professor?!

320
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,360
Easy, easy.

321
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,400
Now that you're here, let me ask you this.
Do you know what marketing really is?

322
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,120
What's with that face?
Are you about to snap or something?

323
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,920
Whoa. You quit at almost 30?

324
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,800
You know jobs are hard to find
these days, right?

325
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,800
Who the hell could put up with
a boss like that anyway?

326
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,520
So yeah, I'm out. I quit.

327
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,840
But honestly, I get it.

328
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,640
Your boss was toxic as hell.

329
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,600
If I'd been there,
I would've punched him already.

330
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,760
So if I actually did that,
would you be my lawyer?

331
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,680
Nope!

332
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,200
- Hey, have you eaten yet?
- Yeah.

333
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,720
Where are you coming from? Your office?

334
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,080
Nope. I just got back from
the district office.

335
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,480
Why did you go there?

336
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,120
To remove my dad's name
from the household registration.

337
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,120
You know what?

338
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,840
To get his birth certificate,

339
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,280
I had to go all the way back to
the town he was born in

340
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,920
to dig through piles of documents.

341
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,840
Here you are.

342
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,600
You're lucky you even found it.

343
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,640
Otherwise, you'd have to file
a "lost document" case.

344
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,400
Do you have everything you need now?

345
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,600
I want to hurry up and file for you to
become the estate administrator.

346
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,120
You need your dad's bankbook too.

347
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,600
I don't have it yet.
I'm thinking of going back to find it.

348
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,040
I have no idea where he kept it.

349
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,960
I need the household registration too.

350
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,320
We need to hurry up
and transfer the house too.

351
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,720
If it weren't for your help,

352
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,000
I probably would've broken down.

353
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,400
These past few days,
I have been exhausted.

354
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,480
Have you even had time to grieve?

355
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,040
I've barely had time to eat.

356
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,800
Hey.

357
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,280
If you need anything, just let me know.

358
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,560
Thanks.

359
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
I'll be okay.

360
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,320
Phones away.

361
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,520
It's time for class.

362
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
ACCOUNTING FORMULAS

363
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,400
And you didn't erase the board again.

364
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,960
Yes, Mama Som.

365
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,360
You can order now.

366
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,760
Maewnam, look!

367
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,560
I gave my nails a break and redid them.

368
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
They're sticking on so well now.
It's so sparkly.

369
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,240
- Blonde hair dye, shade .3 gold shimmer.
- Here, look.

370
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,400
- Two boxes, right?
- Look.

371
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,640
I picked a new gem design.

372
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,360
Cute, right? It's so sparkly.

373
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,360
- All right. You can continue.
- Where are you going?

374
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,800
- One box.
- Hey.

375
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,960
Doesn't this color shine?
It's super sparkly.

376
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,160
- Pomade 80 grams, strong hold formula.
- Bling-bling!

377
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,560
And bling-bling too?

378
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,320
Could you go show off
your gel nails somewhere else?

379
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,280
You're ruining my focus.

380
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,240
- What are you up to, girls?
- Hello? Yes?

381
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,160
Tik, hello.

382
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,400
Hello.

383
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,560
I bought some Pla Naem sausages.

384
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,840
Come eat.

385
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,440
You mean… Naem sausages?

386
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,000
Pla Naem sausages.

387
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,320
You don't know it? Ugh, kids these days…

388
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,880
This is signature and yummy stuff, okay?

389
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,120
I even got it from Nang Loeng Market.

390
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,760
You know, my grandmother used to
buy it for me when I was little.

391
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
It's top-tier stuff.

392
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,800
Anyway, I also wanted to talk about
summer session planning.

393
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,040
By the way, where's Tonnam?
She hasn't finished her class?

394
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,120
Has she finished?

395
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,120
Oh, here she comes.

396
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,680
- Hello, Tik.
- Hello.

397
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,360
Why didn't you erase the board
after you finished teaching?

398
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
I just got my nails done.
I didn't want them to get dirty.

399
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,880
You didn't want to get dirty,
but you wrote all over the board?

400
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,240
Well, I had to write to teach.
You want me to do it via telepathy?

401
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,280
Hey, I'm talking nicely here.
Why do you have to be sarcastic?

402
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,800
All right, all right. Relax, girls.

403
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,480
As the monks say,
"Anger is foolishness, rage is madness."

404
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,960
There's only a few of us here.

405
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,840
Let's discuss work.

406
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,280
We need to divide
the summer teaching schedule.

407
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,280
Who wants which section?

408
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,960
I'd like the evening section again.

409
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,400
I can keep my side gigs in the morning.

410
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,440
Wow, how hardworking you are.

411
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,520
You're shipping orders and fixing lights
and washing machines.

412
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,720
And you're teaching a bachelor's degree
and prepping your PhD too.

413
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,760
Aren't you tired, dear?

414
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,360
Well, I'm not.

415
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,960
Poverty is scarier.

416
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,040
- Excuse me, I have to take this call.
- There she goes.

417
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,840
Then I'll take the early morning class,
the very first class of the day.

418
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,120
So I don't have to use the room
after a messy person like her.

419
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,400
Oh? Did you just insult me?

420
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,760
Why so harsh?

421
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,920
Harsh? Look at this.

422
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,800
You stained my dress
and didn't even say sorry.

423
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,320
I don't really feel like
I did anything wrong.

424
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,680
Okay. Is that how it's going to be?

425
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,400
Step outside. Let's talk.

426
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,440
Whoa, whoa! Chill!

427
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,400
Relax. Talk nicely, both of you.

428
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,080
Come on. Why do you two fight
every single time!?

429
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,600
Wait.

430
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,560
What about my Pla Naem sausages?

431
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,720
Let go!

432
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,120
- No! Come with me.
- Where are you taking me? That hurts!

433
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,320
Just come with me already.

434
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,560
Let go! I said let go! Ouch!

435
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,720
See? Now my dress is all stained!

436
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,280
I'm sorry.

437
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,480
I thought you'd never apologize.

438
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,880
Aww, I'm sorry, babe.

439
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,440
I ruined your dress, didn't I?

440
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,600
I'll buy you a new one, my dear.

441
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,600
I don't want a dress.

442
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,920
There's something else I want more.

443
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,720
No way.

444
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,200
We're on campus. Someone might see us.

445
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Come on. Nobody will see us.

446
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,240
Nobody's around.

447
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,480
Come on. Hurry up.

448
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,240
- We can't do that.
- Come on.

449
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,760
Wait, are you two dating!?

450
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,240
All right, that's it for today.

451
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,400
Don't forget, like we talked about,
there's a graded quiz next week.

452
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,840
No absences, okay?

453
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,200
We have a graded quiz.

454
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,640
You can go home now.
Don't forget to review at home.

455
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,400
Bye-bye.

456
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,840
Could someone close the door, please?

457
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,400
- Yes, Professor.
- Thanks.

458
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,920
What a day.

459
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,360
MOM

460
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,720
MAEWNAM SERVICE

461
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,640
Is that a cat?

462
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,960
Where are you, little kitty?

463
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,800
What are you doing here?!

464
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,680
Who are you? What are you doing here?

465
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,360
Rat! A rat!

466
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,880
Ugh! Rat!

467
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

468
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
What are you doing in front of
someone else's house?

469
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,280
Well, I heard a cat
meowing behind that cabinet.

470
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,600
Let me go get my umbrella first.

471
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,720
Where is it?

472
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,640
Well, it probably chased a rat
and got stuck in there.

473
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,760
Let me help.

474
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,160
Push hard.

475
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,280
I'm good at stretching.

476
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,120
- Okay. Okay, got it!
- Whoa.

477
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,800
You're such a troublemaker.

478
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,280
What were you doing in there, huh?

479
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,040
How naughty you are.

480
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,880
You're safe now.

481
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,160
Huh? Why did the power go out?

482
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,840
Let me check.

483
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,160
Well, all right.

484
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,280
It should be back now, Wan.

485
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,240
Okay!

486
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,960
It's on again, Wan.

487
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,640
This is just a temporary fix.

488
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,000
I'll get a new wire
and come back to replace it.

489
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,440
You know how to fix electrical stuff?

490
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,640
Actually, I can fix lots of things.

491
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,560
If anything breaks, just call me, Wan.

492
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,560
Thanks.

493
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,280
Uh… how do you even know my name?

494
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,120
Well, Papa Yuth…

495
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,000
Uncle Yuth often talked about you.

496
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,880
He always said you were
smart and hardworking.

497
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,719
He was really proud of you.

498
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,600
What are you doing here anyway?

499
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,080
It's pretty late.

500
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,840
I just came back to grab some paperwork.

501
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,880
I've been swamped, but I remembered it
suddenly and rushed over.

502
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,080
I've been trying
to handle everything since…

503
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,639
he's gone now.

504
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,440
Before, I was always busy with work.

505
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,080
When he called, sometimes I'd answer,
and sometimes I wouldn't.

506
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,000
I just thought I could always
call him back, or see him back home.

507
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,560
But you know what?

508
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,240
One day, suddenly…

509
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,720
I came back and he was no longer here.

510
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,000
I didn't come for the documents tonight.

511
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,040
I came because I miss…

512
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,920
I miss him,

513
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,600
the one who was always waiting for me.

514
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,000
No matter when I came back, he'd be here.

515
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,720
I figured that

516
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,720
at least…

517
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,040
this was where he and I
once shared time together.

518
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,400
Papa, I'm home.

519
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,440
I believe Uncle Yuth knows how you feel.

520
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,880
I really hope you can find
your strength again soon.

521
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,320
I'm sure he's cheering for you

522
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,200
and watching you from afar.

523
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,920
He'll always be proud of you,
just like he has always been.

524
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,680
If you ever need anything,
please let me know.

525
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,880
Thanks.

526
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,840
I cried a lot,
so I must look awful right now.

527
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,280
No, you still look beautiful, Wan.

528
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,280
I mean, you're always beautiful.

529
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,920
Are you feeling better now?

530
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Yeah.

531
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,320
All right then. I'll get going.

532
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,360
Wait, the cat's still here?

533
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,320
Do you want to keep it?

534
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,800
Nope.

535
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,760
I can't even
take care of myself right now.

536
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,760
So what do we do with it?

537
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,640
I can't keep it in the dorm
because they don't allow pets.

538
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,240
Or should I sneak it in?

539
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,440
Hey.

540
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,720
You're a student. Don't go breaking rules.

541
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,240
- Oh, well, I'm…
- People did it constantly back in the day.

542
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,280
But looking back now, I'm not sure why.

543
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,200
Honestly, maybe just let it go.

544
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,880
It came here on its own,
so maybe it'll find its way back too.

545
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,280
I'm heading inside now.

546
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,600
Have a safe trip home.

547
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,800
Yes.

548
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,200
If I were to keep you,

549
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,240
it'd have to live at home.

550
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,400
But I don't want to go back home.
What should I do?

551
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,360
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>
<i>Why didn't you answer my call?</i>

552
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,400
<i>Come see me at home tomorrow.</i>

553
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,600
Papa,

554
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,240
I'm just going to look for your bankbook.

555
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,440
MOUSE MART IS COMING SOON
WITH SPECIAL PROMOTIONS!

556
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,720
"Mouse Mart"?

557
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,360
<i>Your father's condition</i>

558
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,120
<i>was acute heart failure.</i>

559
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,760
It could have been caused
by several factors.

560
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:06,640
Diet, high blood pressure,
and also chronic stress.

561
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,200
RIVAL, FIGHT OR DIE.

562
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,920
I'LL TAKE OVER
YOUR GROCERY STORE, PAPA.

563
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:44,640
I'LL TAKE OVER
YOUR GROCERY STORE, PAPA.

564
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,240
Hello, Mom.

565
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,120
Why didn't you pick up my call yesterday?

566
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,080
Well, I was teaching.

567
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,240
Have you eaten anything?

568
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,880
Not yet,

569
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,880
but you don't need to trouble yourself
making anything for me.

570
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,720
- I'll just go find something to eat.
- It's no trouble at all.

571
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,040
I called you here because
I've got something for you to eat.

572
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,760
Come here.

573
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,000
Try this.

574
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,360
How is it?

575
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,320
Tell me what you think.

576
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,160
It's pretty good.

577
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,520
Right?

578
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,040
You can barely tell it's ready-made food.

579
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,560
This…

580
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,560
is one of our Mouse Mart's products.

581
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,120
Does it look nice?

582
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,080
It does.

583
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,680
So, how's your PhD going?

584
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,480
Have you found your research topic yet?

585
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,960
I'm still looking.

586
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,240
Still?

587
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,040
And what about that "Maewnam Service"?

588
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,160
Are you still doing that?

589
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,680
<i>I think you're focusing on</i>
<i>the wrong things.</i>

590
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,920
You keep running around
helping this person and that one.

591
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,360
I honestly don't see
what good comes from it.

592
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,400
You're an adult now, Maewnam.

593
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,560
You should know what matters
and what doesn't.

594
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,920
I'm already feeling down.

595
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,560
Why'd it have to fall now?

596
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,440
That just made it worse, you know?

597
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,040
Maybe it really isn't important after all.

598
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,000
Are you going to throw it away?

599
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,520
Are you quitting?

600
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,680
Uh… it just fell off, that's all.

601
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,840
I see.

602
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,680
Let me fix it for you.

603
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,080
- Well, I…
- Don't worry about it.

604
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,240
I'll fix it for you.

605
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,080
There, all done. See?

606
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,120
I didn't have any screws,
so I tied it up with string and tape.

607
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,320
But don't worry, it's super secure.
It won't fall off

608
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,360
It's okay.

609
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,520
I'll screw it in later.
Just a bit more and it should be fine.

610
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,960
The fact that you helped
means so much to me already.

611
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,120
You fixed the light in my cabinet.

612
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,680
I wanted to return the favor.

613
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,560
<i>I don't know what you're going through,</i>

614
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,360
<i>but problems are like rain.</i>

615
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,400
<i>Some days it pours hard.</i>

616
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,200
<i>But trust me,</i>

617
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,960
<i>there will be a day when the rain stops.</i>

618
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,640
But don't worry.

619
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,320
Even if it's not that perfect, I really
put my heart into fixing it for you.

620
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,520
Hey, are you okay?

621
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,360
Did I say something wrong?

622
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,600
No, not at all.

623
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,400
Thank you.

624
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,440
Don't cry.

625
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,120
<i>It's Somharuthai.</i>

626
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,080
<i>Your name-choosing skill</i>

627
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,160
<i>is adorable.</i>

628
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,280
And what's your name?

629
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,200
Oong!

630
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,160
<i>I have to quickly win Wan over.</i>

631
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,520
I'll make her fall for me,
and ask her to be my girlfriend.

632
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,000
<i>No class this Saturday, right?</i>

633
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,080
<i>Let's go on a date, Pinky-Pinky.</i>

634
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,120
<i>Wait. You work as a waitress here too?</i>

635
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,280
<i>I'm here for a shampoo and blow-dry.</i>

636
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,720
You again?!

637
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,760
How do you shampoo someone
and end up with foam on your cheek?

638
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,200
<i>Admit it.</i>

639
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,720
You like that girl called Maewnam now,
don't you?
