1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
<i>You're really the whole package.</i>

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,760
Beautiful and delicious.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,200
<i>The same old thing again?</i>
<i>She asked when you're getting married?</i>

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,480
Mm, I…

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,680
Who's this?

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,920
This is Tonnam. She's my roommate.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,520
- Can I sit with you, please?
<i>- Hey, have you met the new professor yet?</i>

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,000
Let me introduce her to you.
She'll be joining our department.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,560
Then let's raise a glass
to welcome our new colleague!

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,400
But I still don't know how you feel

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,760
<i>after that night you…</i>

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,400
I like you.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,520
This is the very store that
caused my dad's death.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,840
She took me biking
to this construction site.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,000
At first, I was confused, like,
where are we going?

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,240
When we got there,

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,240
I was like,

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,280
how could it open here?

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,240
Then she told me

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,320
this caused her dad's death.

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,880
My whole body just froze.

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,680
I couldn't say a word.

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,320
I get how you feel.

24
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,640
If she knows it's your family business,

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,560
boom!

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,240
But if she finds out later,

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,280
boom again!

28
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,800
Seriously, what should I do?

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,600
I've been thinking about it
day and night for days.

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,720
I have no clue.

31
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,480
S stands for "strengths."

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,920
What gives your business the edge?

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,520
How are your products
and services different?

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,760
Do you have any special skills
or knowledge?

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,680
Easy to understand, easy to access.

36
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,000
No competitors.

37
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,120
But being the only one
doesn't mean people will buy.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,440
Next, W. Weaknesses.

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,200
What puts us at a disadvantage?

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,080
New brand.

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,000
Owner's emotionally distant.
No idea what she's even thinking.

42
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,320
Maybe it's her background.

43
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,160
Then there's O. Opportunities.

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,520
External factors
that could help us succeed.

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,280
Trends, government policies, social media.

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
60%.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,880
I'm not sure how I feel about you.

48
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,680
So, now do you know?

49
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,640
I like you.

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,280
80%.

51
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,800
Okay. Last one.

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,200
T. Threats.

53
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,240
Forecast negative impacts
from external factors,

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
both direct and indirect.

55
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,000
Mouse Mart.

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,200
Professors, please help assess the risk.

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,600
Should I tell her about Mouse Mart or not?

58
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,360
Risk of not telling?

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,600
50%.

60
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,960
If you don't tell her now,
you may as well never.

61
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,200
Just wait and see
if she finds out on her own.

62
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,000
But I believe secrets don't stay secret.

63
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,440
100% this business crashes
if she finds out later.

64
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,960
But how do we define "later"?

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,520
One day? Two days?

66
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,960
That counts as "later," right?

67
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,160
What defines the line for "knowing later"?

68
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,040
Probably if you had the chance
to tell but didn't,

69
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,720
anything after would count as "later."

70
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,800
Hey, where are you going?

71
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,280
I'll be right back.

72
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,360
MOUSE MART IS COMING SOON
WITH SPECIAL PROMOTIONS!

73
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,160
Coming soon? When's that supposed to be?

74
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,080
What are you looking at there?

75
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Oh, I just came to see
how far along the shop is.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,320
I see.

77
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,760
- Do you want to take a look inside?
- No, thanks. I appreciate it.

78
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,320
Um… I brought this for you.

79
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,960
I didn't order anything.

80
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,400
Maybe a worker did?

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,040
No, I just noticed you buy them often,
so this is a little gift from me.

82
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,680
Please take it. It's on the house.

83
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
Thanks.

84
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,520
So, when's "coming soon"?

85
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,280
It should be ready
by the end of the month.

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,200
Drop by if you have time.

87
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,640
I'll give you a discount.

88
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,240
Sure. Thanks a lot.

89
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,080
Good luck with your work.

90
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Sure. Thank you.

91
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,040
STORE DESIGN AND DECORATION LOCATION
MOUSE MART, BRANCH 001235

92
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,720
Ugh! End of the month?

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,000
That's like a doctor saying,

94
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,920
"Sorry, you've got one month left."

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,560
Ugh, I'm freaking out.

96
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,960
Who's dying?

97
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,080
No one, except maybe me.

98
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,720
Seriously, I'm losing it.

99
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,840
Do you want some coffee?
I brought you one.

100
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,720
Nope. Just looking at it gives me chills.

101
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,720
From now on,

102
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,560
I'm never buying or using anything
from Mouse Mart again.

103
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
What?

104
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,560
You used to go there all the time.

105
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,480
When you were too lazy to go out,
you even had stuff delivered.

106
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,920
That was then.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,800
Now they're opening right here.

108
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,400
You know they're the reason my dad died.

109
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,920
Okay, okay.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,120
Then I won't drink it either.

111
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,680
But actually, I came because
I've got something big to tell you.

112
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,680
YUTH PANICH

113
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,080
Wan, are you okay?

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,960
My friend just came by and said…

115
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,520
So these are your assets.

116
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,320
And this is your debt.

117
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,160
You don't have to read it. I'll summarize.

118
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,640
You're in debt. 450,000.

119
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,200
Legally, you're the sole heir,

120
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,800
which means you inherit the debt too.

121
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,920
Debt is a kind of inheritance.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
450,000? Seriously?
I don't even have 100,000.

123
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,560
Take a breath.

124
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,960
You don't have to pay it all at once.

125
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,400
I did the math.

126
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,520
Your dad mortgaged the house,
this grocery store.

127
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,320
He got 2 million,

128
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,640
and more than half is already paid back.

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,880
If you pay the bank 30,000 a month,

130
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,160
then in 24 months,
just two years, it's done.

131
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,360
Hey.

132
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,760
It's just two years. It's not too bad.

133
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,760
If I had a full-time job,
maybe it'd be possible.

134
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,080
But right now,

135
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,040
I'm barely making half a regular salary
from selling stuff.

136
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,360
What if I pay 15,000 a month?

137
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,040
Then it'd take 6 years.

138
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,760
Six years?! Wasn't it two before?

139
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,040
If I pay half, shouldn't it be four years?

140
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,880
No, you can't think like that.

141
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,320
This isn't borrowing from a friend.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,320
Interest is brutal, you know.
Don't you know the saying?

143
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,640
"Bought a house for two million, ended up
paying four to five with interest."

144
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,040
Compound interest is like a snowball.

145
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,080
Ugh, it's all because of that
stupid Mouse Mart.

146
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,200
It's opening at the end of the month.

147
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,400
Once it's here,
my sales will drop for sure.

148
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,760
I don't even know
when Dad mortgaged the shop.

149
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,400
But if I miss a payment, they'll take it.

150
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,560
Even now, just selling
to make debt payments is already hard.

151
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,040
There's food, bills…

152
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,560
and now Mouse Mart is right next door.

153
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,120
Honestly, I don't think
I can last six months if this keeps up.

154
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,600
<i>Risk of not telling?</i>

155
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,080
50%.

156
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,640
If you don't tell her now,
you may as well never.

157
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,880
Just wait and see
if she finds out on her own.

158
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Why open here of all places?!

159
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,800
It's like they're trying to kill me!

160
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,640
I got stressed.

162
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,400
I'm just scared I'll be the reason
my dad's business fails.

163
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,960
Don't say that, Wan.

164
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,240
You're doing great.

165
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,400
Every problem has a solution.

166
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,720
I'll help you.

167
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,840
Thank you.

168
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,760
- Whoa.
- Hold this for me. It's super heavy.

169
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,720
What did you buy so much stuff for?

170
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,200
So I still couldn't
bring myself to tell her.

171
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
Eh? Why not?

172
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,360
The timing was just not right.
Like, it was really wrong.

173
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,560
How so?

174
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,280
Where's Chompoo?
I'll just wait and tell both of you.

175
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,840
She's not here.

176
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,920
Eh? You two are already done
with the exams?

177
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,960
The new professor called her,
asking for help prepping next term.

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,760
Chompoo's been cozying up to her,

179
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,360
scared she'll tell Tik about us.

180
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Now it's like, she calls, she runs.

181
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,160
She snaps, she jumps.

182
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,320
And what's with all this food?

183
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,320
Three people can't eat this much.

184
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,960
Come on. It's not just for us.

185
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,880
I wanted to support Wan,

186
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,720
and I'll give the rest
to students tomorrow before the exam.

187
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,360
Okay, but let me vent a little more.

188
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,520
I just don't get it.

189
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Why'd she call now of all times?

190
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,760
This is supposed to be our personal time.

191
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,440
At first, she didn't even want to go.

192
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,640
She was whining about
how fierce and snobby she seemed.

193
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,240
And look at her now.

194
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,640
Thanks.

195
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,080
Girl, calm down.

196
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,880
The snack didn't do anything wrong.

197
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
It's okay. Let's just switch bags.

198
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,120
Let's just switch bags.

199
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,080
Right.

200
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,400
That face says, "I don't like you," huh?

201
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,280
Maybe they're just gossiping.

202
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,520
Stay positive.

203
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm going to wash my hands.

204
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,480
Calm down. Positive thinking.

205
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,440
Can I help you?

206
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,680
Is your family the owner of Mouse Mart?

207
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,040
Why do you ask?

208
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,760
I'm just surprised
you're still working here as a professor.

209
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,880
I'm not saying
people can't do lots of things,

210
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
but I imagine things must
be hectic on your side.

211
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, it's my family's business, not mine.

212
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,360
Can I help you with something?

213
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,920
I'm looking for funding
for a research project.

214
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,160
It's about key factors
influencing visits to convenience stores.

215
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,320
Prof. Chompoo said I could ask you.

216
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,240
I've got a lot on my plate right now,

217
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,440
finalizing my PhD thesis topic and all.

218
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,520
I don't think I have time to help.

219
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,360
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,600
That's okay.

221
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,440
I'll ask Prof. Chompoo like before.

222
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,800
EXAM: ACCOUNTING THEORY 3(03)
50 QUESTIONS IN TOTAL

223
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,640
Babe, I'm sorry
I didn't do the dishes this morning.

224
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,280
I had to leave in a rush.

225
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,760
What time's the exam?

226
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,640
Are you okay?

227
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,960
I'm not okay.

228
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,880
Are you really only doing all this
so she won't talk about us?

229
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,680
You didn't even like her at first.

230
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,320
- Now you're suddenly close?
- Wait.

231
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,520
Are you mad about this?

232
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,480
Do you know why I'm doing this?

233
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,360
It's to protect our relationship.

234
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,640
Really?

235
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,280
I always thought protecting a relationship
means telling the truth

236
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,760
when you have the chance.

237
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,520
Your family's cool with us.

238
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,000
You don't understand what it's like
to have a family that isn't.

239
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,680
Try putting yourself in my shoes for once.

240
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,600
Hey, don't let this blow up.

241
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,120
Do you get that--

242
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,800
Students, please take a seat.

243
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,240
Sit anywhere you'd like.

244
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,760
Don't be surprised.
Those snacks are from me.

245
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,240
Acting like you two were fighting?

246
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,080
Nope.

247
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,560
Exam's in ten minutes.

248
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,120
Call your friends.

249
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,800
Ugh, I didn't even finish selling these,
and now they're expired.

250
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,000
Another loss.

251
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,040
Ew, this one's moldy.

252
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,720
Why'd they go bad so fast?

253
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,280
- Thank you. It's okay.
- No problem. Here, let me help.

254
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,800
Thanks again.

255
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,600
- Just hang it here, right?
- Yes, thanks.

256
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,160
What can I get you today?

257
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,040
Fresh delivery just came in.

258
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,000
We have pandan filling,
golden egg yolk threads,

259
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,680
strawberry, and taro fillings too.

260
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,160
Or do you want to try this one?
It's khanom ping.

261
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,440
Try one first.

262
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,560
If you like it, great.
If not, no pressure.

263
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,720
Here you go.

264
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,480
How is it? Do you like it?

265
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,480
I do.

266
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,120
Do you want to buy one?

267
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,400
I'll get you a new jar. Here you go.

268
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,240
That'll be 500 baht.

269
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,160
Here you go.

270
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,280
Thanks a lot.

271
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,599
Keep the change.

272
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,319
It's just a small thank-you for the drinks
you brought me the other day.

273
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,920
Are you sure?

274
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,160
That's too generous.

275
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,520
- Wait--
- It's okay, really. No change.

276
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,839
Thank you so much.

277
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,720
What time do you normally close?

278
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,000
Usually around nine in the evening.

279
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,960
But if you're coming, just call.
I'll wait for you.

280
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,320
Yes. Thanks.

281
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,240
Whoa, just a few sales
and I've already hit 1,000!

282
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,160
Money flowing in! Luck's pouring down!

283
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,680
Wan!

284
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,880
Today's exam day,

285
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,880
so I made one for you too.

286
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,040
If you hand this in, that's effort points.

287
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,680
But…

288
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,200
I'm not giving you full marks just yet.

289
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,960
I'll try harder from now on, Teacher Wan.

290
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,200
You got this, Miss Maewnam.

291
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,200
But hey, I didn't just come here to whine.

292
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,360
I'm here to shop, buying snacks
to give the other professors.

293
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,040
Sure. What would you like?

294
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,440
Maybe I'll just buy the whole store?

295
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,320
Wait, really?!

296
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,480
I don't have money.

297
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,560
Well then, just grab what you want.

298
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,320
- Grab what you want.
- Wait, free?

299
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,600
We'll settle up later.

300
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,520
These are for you, Tik.

301
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,320
Such a generous soul.

302
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,440
Thanks, Maewnam.

303
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,440
I bought a bunch for students
and had some left.

304
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,680
Fine. I'm taking it anyway.

305
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,640
Thank you.

306
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,120
But I bought this just for you,
Prof. Mahnmook.

307
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,120
Thank you.

308
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,720
About the research,

309
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,640
you can ask me directly.

310
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,840
No need to go through Prof. Chompoo.

311
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,200
I'll help.

312
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,120
You have time now?

313
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,520
Well…

314
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,520
I think your topic is something
I can help with better.

315
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,160
Then thank you.

316
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,880
Okay, everyone's here.

317
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,840
Girls, I want to invite all of you
to stay after class.

318
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,560
Let's go find something really good
and delicious to eat together.

319
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,080
Let's celebrate finishing exams,

320
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,520
and we'll also use it as a chance
to welcome Prof. Mahnmook.

321
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
But no flaking!

322
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,720
If anyone bails, I'm adding
an extra morning class to your schedule.

323
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,320
Now pack it up. Hurry up.

324
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,200
Yummy.

325
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,280
I'm sorry. I got lost on the way.
I took a huge detour.

326
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,200
Oh, no worries. You're here now.

327
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,400
I already ordered tamarind shrimp,
stir-fried bitter melon with egg,

328
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,720
and the star,
banana blossom chicken curry.

329
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,680
Banana what?

330
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,520
Eh? You've never heard of it?

331
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
It's just unripe banana.

332
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,320
- Ah, got it.
- Hungry? I'll get you a menu.

333
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
Hey, can we get a menu please?

334
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,920
Just order anything you like.

335
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,080
It's all good.

336
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,760
No, it's okay.

337
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,120
It's fine. Don't worry.

338
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,240
Thanks.

339
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,360
You should've told her
you couldn't eat it.

340
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
It's fine.

341
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,240
Are you allergic to shrimp?

342
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'll just take an antihistamine.

343
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,240
See? That's what you're always doing.

344
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,880
You're always putting up with it.
You keep tolerating nonsense.

345
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,480
And you end up hurting yourself.

346
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,000
Calm down.

347
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,640
It's not a big deal.

348
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,400
Why make it into one?

349
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,600
And you snapping at everyone,
is that fair?

350
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,280
Hey.

351
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,720
Have you ever stopped
and asked yourself why I'm upset?

352
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,600
Then you ask yourself
why I keep putting up with stuff.

353
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,480
Tolerating doesn't mean I'm not trying.

354
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,520
Ugh… can we go one day without fighting?

355
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,240
I'm sorry. I think I should go, Tik.

356
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Oh?

357
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,400
Well, are we still eating or not?

358
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,520
Here, help finish the shrimp.

359
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,240
- Sure. I think four dishes are plenty.
- No need to order more, right?

360
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,800
YUTH PANICH

361
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,440
Wan!

362
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,520
I thought you weren't coming.

363
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,800
Were you waiting?

364
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,360
No. Didn't you see?
I'm just about to close up.

365
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,120
Geez, today was the last exam
I had to proctor.

366
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,480
It was total chaos. I was drained.

367
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560
At first I thought
the store was already closed,

368
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,240
but I saw it was still open,
so I ran right over.

369
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,880
To see me?

370
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
To buy ice cream.

371
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,040
Someone's smiling.

372
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,360
I'm here to buy ice cream and see you.

373
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
What's up, Wan?

374
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,760
Long time no see.

375
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,360
Oh? You two know each other?

376
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,720
How do you two know each other?

377
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Oh, this is Prof. Mahnmook.

378
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,360
She's new at the department.

379
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,400
We had a faculty dinner earlier,
and I got a ride with her.

380
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,000
Aren't you going to answer her question?

381
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,400
How did we know each other?

382
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,640
Old friend.

383
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,200
Two ice creams, right?

384
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,800
Do you want anything else?

385
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,440
Can I use your bathroom?

386
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,920
Can you show me where it is?

387
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,520
I'm sorry about your dad.

388
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,640
I just found out,
so I didn't make it to the funeral.

389
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,240
Are you into Prof. Maewnam or something?

390
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,880
So why didn't you tell her what we were?

391
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,960
Are you worried she'll overthink it?

392
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,640
So you're in the talking stage then?

393
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
After you're done,
don't forget to turn off the light.

394
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,840
Actually, dating Mouse Mart's
owner's daughter,

395
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,840
there was no need to open
your own grocery store.

396
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,640
What did you just say?

397
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,080
I'm heading out.

398
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,160
Why are you even shopping here?

399
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,280
Why not Mouse Mart?

400
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,200
You're their daughter.

401
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,400
How do you know that?

402
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,320
Why didn't you tell me?

403
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,440
I…

404
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,240
I wasn't trying to hide it.

405
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,040
I was going to tell you yesterday.

406
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,440
Remember when I biked over
and bought a bunch of stuff?

407
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,280
But when I found out you were in debt,
hundreds of thousands,

408
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,160
I didn't want to make it worse.

409
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,800
So I was waiting for a better moment.

410
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,360
I'm…

411
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,040
I'm not making excuses.

412
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,720
I really care about you.

413
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,320
That's the truth.

414
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,440
You know how I feel
about Mouse Mart, right?

415
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,160
I do.

416
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,800
Then why didn't you tell me that day?

417
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,480
This is the very store that
caused my dad's death.

418
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,440
<i>Where are you?</i>

419
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,600
<i>I'm sleeping at home tonight.</i>

420
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,440
GROCERY VS CONVENIENCE STORE

421
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,200
A CONVENIENCE STORE WITH A MOUSE LOGO JUST
OPENED NEARBY, AND EVERYONE'S GOING THERE.

422
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,520
SAD, REALLY.

423
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,640
CAPITALISM ONLY FAVORS THE RICH.
IT EXPLOITS PEOPLE LIKE US.

424
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,080
Why does it have to be this way?

425
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,920
<i>You know</i>

426
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,640
how I feel about Mouse Mart, right?

427
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,960
Then why didn't you tell me that day?

428
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,280
YUTH PANICH

429
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,880
<i>Wan, I don't want to bother you</i>
<i>when you need time to think.</i>

430
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,480
<i>But I don't want to disappear to the point</i>

431
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,160
<i>where it feels like</i>
<i>I'm not even here anymore.</i>

432
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,800
<i>I just want you to feel like</i>
<i>I'm still here.</i>

433
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,600
<i>Maewnam.</i>

434
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,960
<i>P.S. If anything breaks,</i>
<i>call me like always, okay?</i>

435
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,920
<i>If anything breaks,</i>
<i>call me like always, okay?</i>

436
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,200
MAEWNAM

437
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,280
I'd like to buy something. Is anyone here?

438
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,440
Coming!

439
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,040
I'm sorry. I was in the middle
of a fight with the faucet.

440
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,600
The faucet's broken?

441
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,480
Just a little. It keeps dripping
even when I turn it off.

442
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,320
Do you want me to take a look?

443
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,000
Well…

444
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,400
You can turn on the water pump now.

445
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,240
Okay, give me a sec.

446
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,960
How is it?

447
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,080
All done.

448
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,440
Thank you so much. How much do I owe you?

449
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,560
Oh, don't worry.

450
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,760
It wasn't a big deal.

451
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,240
Then… just a sec.

452
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,080
Here. I see you come here often for these.

453
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,120
You can share these
with the other workers too.

454
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,880
Thank you.

455
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,000
I thought you'd stop by last night.

456
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,360
Ah, it was one of the workers' birthdays.

457
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,880
We ended up drinking a bit
and it went on for a long time.

458
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,480
I didn't think you'd be waiting.

459
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,560
Then I'll come by tonight.

460
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,920
Okay. Only if it's convenient for you.

461
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,720
I'll step out for now then.

462
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,760
Sure.

463
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,760
Professor.

464
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,080
Can I talk to you for a minute?

465
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,720
Did you tell Wan about me?

466
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,960
About you?

467
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,480
About what?

468
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,840
That I'm the daughter of
Mouse Mart's owner.

469
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,080
Wait.

470
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,520
She didn't know yet?

471
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,320
I thought she already did.

472
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,920
No. I haven't told her.

473
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,360
I kind of figured
you two had something going on,

474
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,679
so I just said, "That's great."

475
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,560
"Her family is the owner of Mouse Mart."

476
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,440
"You must have great advice
for your grocery store."

477
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,639
I assumed you two shared everything.

478
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,480
Wan's the kind of person
who hates anything insincere.

479
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,960
It makes her feel lied to.

480
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,320
You really seem like a friend

481
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,760
who knows her well.

482
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,520
Nope.

483
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,880
Not just friends.

484
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,480
I handled the problem the wrong way.

485
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,720
I cared too much about others.

486
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,840
I hate how we don't talk like this.

487
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,760
I even bought this to apologize
without caring what others might think.

488
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,680
Aren't you going to say something?

489
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,280
Hi, Tik.

490
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,040
Why did you tease me?

491
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,360
I wanted to see if hearing that name
would make you drop the act.

492
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,280
You see it now?

493
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,440
When I went home,

494
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
and had time to think alone…

495
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,920
<i>In a relationship, nothing ever ends</i>
<i>in complete disappointment</i>

496
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,920
<i>or goes exactly 100% as we hope.</i>

497
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,200
<i>Something that feels easy for us</i>

498
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,600
<i>might be the hardest thing</i>
<i>for someone else.</i>

499
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,440
<i>Think about it once again.</i>

500
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,720
<i>Are we placing our expectations</i>

501
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,680
<i>on someone we love</i>
<i>and asking them to carry them for us?</i>

502
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,000
I understand you better now.

503
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,480
I know you've been trying hard.

504
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,080
I just don't want to be a source
of stress in your life anymore.

505
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,880
And about us…

506
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,920
If you're not ready to tell your mom,

507
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,680
then don't.

508
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,080
Just being together right now
is good enough for us.

509
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,160
Then from now on,
I'm going to stand my ground more.

510
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Starting with you.

511
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
Stand up.

512
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,560
Come closer.

513
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,880
Closer.

514
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,520
You're doing this here?

515
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,200
Aren't you afraid someone might see?

516
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm blocking the view.

517
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,800
There's a CCTV camera.

518
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,200
You're doing this, huh?

519
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,760
She's probably not coming anymore.

520
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,480
You're closing up already?

521
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,120
Not yet. Come on in.

522
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,040
We've got fresh snacks this evening.

523
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,920
Actually, I didn't come to order anything.

524
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,680
But…

525
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,600
I brought something for you.

526
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,680
Oh? What?

527
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,880
Flowers.

528
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,200
I searched for a flower bouquet shop,

529
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,960
and this one makes beautiful arrangements,

530
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
so I ordered one for you.

531
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,640
No, thank you.

532
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,360
I…

533
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,800
I don't know what I'd do with them.

534
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,800
Why would you say something like that?

535
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,680
Haven't you shown signs
you're interested in me?

536
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,480
When… did I ever show that?

537
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,640
Well, you gave me snacks.

538
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,080
You brought me drinks.

539
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
You kept the store open waiting for me.

540
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,920
If that's not interest, what is it?

541
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,560
It's…

542
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,480
It's called customer service.

543
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,560
You're a customer.
I treat you well. That's it.

544
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,640
But I call it "throwing yourself at me."

545
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,480
Come on, just admit it.

546
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,400
I actually like women
who make the first move.

547
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,440
I wasn't throwing myself at you.

548
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,680
Being friendly
doesn't mean I'm interested.

549
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,040
You're not?

550
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,000
You smiled at me like that.

551
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,880
You even took me to the back
of the store. Come on.

552
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,720
Stop playing hard to get.

553
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,680
It's just us here.

554
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,600
Stop pretending already.

555
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,880
Hey, let go! You creep! Let go!

556
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
- Ow! Let go!
- You creep!

557
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,760
- Let go!
- Shut up!

558
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,120
- Someone, help!
- Let go!

559
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,320
- Help!
- Shut up!

560
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,880
Hey!

561
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,680
Ouch!

562
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,840
Don't mess with my Wan!

563
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,520
Leave now, or I'll call the police.

564
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,720
Go ahead. Let's see who hurt whom.

565
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,880
But you harassed her first.

566
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,200
We've got evidence.

567
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,440
Call the police, Wan.

568
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,520
Wan, are you hurt?

569
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,760
I'm fine.

570
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,280
I'm so sorry I came late,

571
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,160
so you got hurt.

572
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,480
But you made it, didn't you?

573
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,680
Are you going to dock my points?

574
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
No way.

575
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,240
You get bonus points.

576
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,520
You're incredible, Maewnam.

577
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,560
He flew across the room.

578
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,200
My mom made me take Taekwondo as a kid.

579
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,160
She said it was for self-defense.

580
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,200
Guess I finally used it to protect you.

581
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,000
At first, I didn't think
I'd see you again.

582
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,120
Honestly, I wasn't planning to come.

583
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,320
But there's something
I needed to talk to you about.

584
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,720
That's why I rushed here.

585
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,480
About Mouse Mart?

586
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,600
No.

587
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,840
But if you want to talk about
that first, we can.

588
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,360
Talk about your matter first.

589
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,600
I know now that

590
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,080
Prof. Mahnmook isn't just your old friend.

591
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,720
She's more than that.

592
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,880
I didn't want to overthink,

593
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,520
so I came to ask you directly
what the truth is.

594
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,480
She told you already?

595
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,160
You can say I'm making excuses,

596
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,800
but truthfully, I don't even know
if she considered me her girlfriend.

597
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:20,520
I can't even say when we ever
officially got together.

598
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,600
If you don't want to talk about it,

599
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,480
we don't have to.

600
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,160
But I just want you to know that

601
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:44,080
I came to ask
because I really wanted to know.

602
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,400
I'm not mad at you.

603
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,520
Your answer was honest.

604
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,560
That's more than enough for me.

605
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,720
Ask me about Mouse Mart now.

606
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,880
I've been thinking about it all night.

607
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,680
After I found out,
what's the point in being mad at you?

608
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,880
What does it change?

609
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,840
I'll admit, I felt numb when I found out.

610
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,600
But then I reminded myself

611
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,160
that the Maewnam I know
isn't a cunning person.

612
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,600
Still, anger is anger.

613
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,680
It's like someone punching you
and saying "sorry."

614
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,080
It still hurts at the time,
so it can't just go away instantly.

615
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,720
I understand.

616
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,440
And I'm sorry for not telling you
from the beginning.

617
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,640
Once I missed the right moment,
everything just felt off.

618
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
Can I ask you one more thing?

619
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,440
That thing you said about grocery stores--

620
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,480
could you say it again?

621
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,160
Sure.

622
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,280
Lots of grocery stores can absolutely
stand against big convenience stores.

623
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,680
Community-based marketing is powerful.

624
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,520
People shop where they feel comfortable.

625
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,200
Your store is exactly
where they feel more at ease.

626
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,280
People prefer shopping
where they feel comfortable.

627
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,240
Even if you just left your full-time job
and came back to this,

628
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,920
you've always been talented.

629
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,440
You've always been
a talented person I like.

630
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,720
Do you think I'm lying?

631
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,080
The store's almost out of stock.

632
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,600
Do you want to go restock together?

633
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,080
Sure.

634
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,520
Whoa… it's this late already?

635
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,920
Do you think anywhere's still open?

636
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,560
Good point.

637
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,920
I've got a mountain of exams to grade too.

638
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,000
I should probably head back then.

639
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,720
Oh, wait.

640
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,760
I forgot to ask.

641
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,640
Where's my score at?

642
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,680
Well…

643
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,920
When it's close to full,
I'll let you know.

644
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,400
Sure.

645
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,920
I'll be waiting.

646
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,280
GRADE SUBMISSION SYSTEM

647
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,920
Hello? What's up, Wan?

648
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,640
<i>Maewnam, something's wrong</i>
<i>with the CCTV at the store.</i>

649
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,000
<i>Can you come take a look?</i>

650
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,240
Sure. Just a sec.

651
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,360
What seems to be the issue?

652
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,080
YOU'VE GOT FULL MARKS ALREADY

653
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,240
When I found out you were
the daughter of Mouse Mart's owner,

654
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,800
I thought I'd be really mad at you.

655
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,000
But in the end, I wasn't.

656
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,080
I forgave you so easily.

657
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,480
Just like you forgave me easily

658
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,840
when you found out about me and Mahnmook.

659
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,160
Now I understand something.

660
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,800
When two people like each other enough,

661
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,920
things don't have to be so complicated.

662
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,920
Right?

663
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,120
Yeah.

664
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,400
And this is a reward
for an awesome person.

665
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,680
YUTH PANICH UNIVERSITY
FACULTY OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

666
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,280
HEREBY GRANTS THIS DEGREE
FOR THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF STUDIES

667
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,920
I graduated with First-Class Honors.

668
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,640
Maewnam.

669
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,440
Be my girlfriend.

670
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,400
You're so dramatic, Professor Sudteerak.

671
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,920
And calling me here
just to "check the CCTV"?

672
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,160
That wasn't dramatic at all,
my beautiful grocery sister?

673
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,680
I really put my heart into this, you know.

674
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,120
Didn't you like it?

675
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,280
You know what?

676
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,640
I'm someone who puts a lot of effort
into everything I do,

677
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,160
including this.

678
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,640
How about staying over tonight?

679
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,280
Wait here for a sec.

680
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,800
<i>Even though I haven't told Mom</i>
<i>who you are to me yet,</i>

681
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,440
<i>I'm going to show her.</i>

682
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,360
<i>Are you okay with that, babe?</i>

683
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,400
<i>I'm so happy right now.</i>

684
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,840
<i>And you? Are you happy too?</i>

685
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,080
<i>Maybe Maewnam has a way to help you.</i>

686
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,720
<i>Your store's definitely going to make it.</i>

687
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,800
<i>Right now, I'm not fighting alone anymore.</i>

688
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,720
<i>I have a partner</i>
<i>who's ready to fight alongside me.</i>

689
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,000
<i>Right?</i>

690
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,440
The way you think
is seriously the coolest, Wan.
