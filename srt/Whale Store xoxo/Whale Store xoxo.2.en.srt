1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,240
<i>You quit at almost 30?</i>

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,200
<i>You know jobs are hard to find</i>
<i>these days, right?</i>

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,400
What are you doing here?!

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,880
<i>- You know how to fix electrical stuff?</i>
- Actually, I can fix lots of things.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,520
If anything breaks, just call me, Wan.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,640
<i>You keep running around</i>
<i>helping this person and that one.</i>

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,480
I honestly don't see
what good comes from it.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,680
I'm already feeling down.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
Don't cry.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,120
YUTH PANICH

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,640
Are you feeling better now?

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Yes.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,600
I just feel a bit tired.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,080
But seeing your face,
I'm not tired anymore.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,840
Eh? That voice…?

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,440
It's Somharuthai.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,239
MAEWNAM SERVICE

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,000
What did you just call her?

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,320
Som…?

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
Somharuthai.

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,080
Somharuthai.

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,760
You've got a name now.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
She wouldn't go anywhere
and just kept hanging around here.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,240
So, I decided to adopt her.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,880
Somharuthai, it's your meal time.

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,280
Your name-choosing skill

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,760
is just like Uncle Yuth's.

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,680
And how is that?

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,400
It's adorable.

30
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,680
Somharuthai.

31
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,560
And what's your name?

32
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,680
Take a guess.

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,520
Maew?

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
Nope.

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
Suea? Singto?

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,600
Give me your hand.

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Nhoo?

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,520
Oong!

39
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,840
You could've just told me your name.

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,080
I already know your name, Maewnam.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,440
I fixed your sign for ages,
so how could I not know?

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,960
Why did you make me do that then?

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,200
I just wanted to tease you.

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,840
Wan…

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
Sudteerak.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,120
What's with you?
Why did you suddenly call me "teerak"?

47
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,160
Sudteerak is my full name,

48
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
but I only tell people
I want to hear it from.

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,560
Try calling me "Sudteerak."

50
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
No.

51
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,840
I'll just call you Maewnam.

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,720
Come on. Just try.

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Say, "Sudteerak" in a sweet tone.

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,600
"Sudteerak." Let's try.

55
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Nope.

56
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,320
Sudteerak.

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,200
It felt like
my heart skipped a beat for a second.

58
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,040
You're exaggerating.

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,920
And you said you were going to
take care of Som.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Does that mean
you're staying here for good?

61
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,440
I think I'll be sticking around here
for a long time.

62
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,160
Why are you so happy about it?

63
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,640
It's just that

64
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,240
I won't have to bike so far anymore.

65
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,560
I'll just come to your grocery store
to buy stuff

66
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,080
and then get to play with Som too.

67
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,520
Am I right, Som?

68
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,120
Whoa. How come you got so rich?

69
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,320
- Did you win the lottery?
- Nope.

70
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
I went to support Uncle Yuth's grocery.

71
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,680
His daughter just came back to take over
the business, so I stopped by.

72
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,600
- I can eat anything, right?
- Yes. That's 20 baht.

73
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,880
Even among friends, you're still charging?

74
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,880
Keep the change.

75
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,560
Oops, that is 100 baht,

76
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,320
and I can keep the change.

77
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,640
Paying for her like this,

78
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,040
are you two dating or something?

79
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,480
Crazy!

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,120
We're on campus.

81
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,640
Others could find out we're dating.

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,600
Come on. Nobody will see us.

83
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,720
Nobody's around.

84
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,000
Wait, are you two dating!?

85
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,200
Keep it low!

86
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,240
That's enough. Stop acting, okay?

87
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,120
Seriously, you two can't hide anything.

88
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,880
You're all lovey-dovey in this room, huh?

89
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,760
You know it's not just
the three of us here.

90
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,880
Tik is here too.

91
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,280
If Tik finds out, the world finds out.

92
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,640
Who's asking for me?

93
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,120
Oh! When did you get here?

94
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,480
We didn't even hear the door.

95
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,160
Well, my grandma always taught me that
a proper lady does everything quietly.

96
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,400
When I was young, she used to whack me on
the ankle if I stepped on a creaky board.

97
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,120
So, why were you calling me?

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,720
The three of us were just wondering how
you were going to schedule our classes.

99
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,360
So that's what this is about.

100
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,160
Tonnam, you don't want to teach
after Chompoo, right?

101
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,520
Then take a morning slot.

102
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,840
Chompoo, you take the afternoon.

103
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
And our diligent Maewnam,
you take the evening class.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,440
- Good?
- Yes.

105
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,560
You two, don't fight, okay?

106
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,120
No fighting at all!

107
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,800
But this time, I'm writing on
the entire board and not erasing it.

108
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,720
Tik, can I get a morning class
next term too, please?

109
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,960
My head's already hurting.

110
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,880
And what's this?
You're selling snacks now?

111
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,960
- Can you support me a little bit?
- What've you got? Let me see.

112
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,840
Ugh, these are such ordinary snacks.

113
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,840
Don't you have anything royal?

114
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,040
Do you have Chor Muang or Phuang Khram?

115
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
Flowers?

116
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,800
Come on. Let's see what I can eat.

117
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,320
<i>No class this Saturday, right?</i>
<i>Let's go on a date, Pinky-Pinky.</i>

118
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,720
<i>Okay, my little chubby boo!</i>

119
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,320
Five snacks, four jellies,

120
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,520
two chicken feet snacks,

121
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,560
six milk cartons, and thirty eggs.

122
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,000
It turns out selling stuff is not so hard.

123
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
I made nearly 300 baht off that kid.

124
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,760
It's almost noon. Let's get lunch.

125
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,640
Here's your Dry Chicken Suki, no skin.

126
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,680
Thanks.

127
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,800
Wait.

128
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,760
You work as a waitress here too?

129
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,360
Yep. Lunchtime is chaos.
It's packed with people.

130
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,160
- You're not going to uni?
- I will--

131
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,920
Ten boxes of stir-fried crispy pork
with basil are ready, Maewnam.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,840
Got it.

133
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
I'll go later in the evening.

134
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,400
Take them to the police station, okay?

135
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,520
Got it.

136
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,400
You got a new order, Pin.

137
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,000
She's hardworking.

138
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,720
How much is mine?

139
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,400
60. The ice is on the house.

140
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,720
Here. I already transferred.

141
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
Yep, got it.

142
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,360
F1!

143
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,680
F1!

144
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,240
I was washing dishes.

145
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,120
Go buy one bottle of fish sauce for me.

146
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,480
Now!

147
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,400
Also grab some rice.

148
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,680
One bottle of fish sauce. Rice, 30.

149
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,520
30?

150
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,880
One kilogram of rice is like 20, right?

151
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,360
Divide by 15…

152
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,720
That's about 1.3 liters?

153
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,280
Do you know how much 30 gets you?

154
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,880
Just scoop it, then.

155
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,120
Fish sauce.

156
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,920
Be careful with the change.

157
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,040
Get everything on the list, okay?

158
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,160
Sugar.

159
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,200
What's a "heat-resistant bag," bro?

160
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,360
It's okay.

161
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,800
- Can you carry that?
- Yes, I can.

162
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
Wait, you're not paying?

163
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,760
Oh, put it on Kung's tab.

164
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,040
Kung? Who's he?

165
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,000
Kung?

166
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,360
Is this the right one?

167
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,840
Over 3,000 baht due?
And he hasn't even paid?

168
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,360
So this is how it is, huh?

169
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,760
I don't get the nature
of people around here.

170
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,000
But this is too much.

171
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,280
And what did he just buy?

172
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,960
Sugar?

173
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,000
How much is the heat-resistant bag?

174
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,520
Ugh, this is stressing me out!

175
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,200
Looking good, sis.
It'll brighten up one more level.

176
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,800
Oh! Please come in, dear customer!

177
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,760
Do you want to make merit together first?

178
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,560
Just 20 baht will do
if you'd like to chip in.

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
So, you're back to running
the store again, right?

180
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,240
How's the business going?

181
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,280
It's okay, just going with the flow.

182
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,640
I actually thought at first
you weren't going to reopen,

183
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
but I'm so glad you did.

184
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,720
Otherwise, I'd have to haul myself
all the way to Khlong Thom just to shop.

185
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,440
So, you've moved back home for good?

186
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,840
What about your boyfriend?
Is he okay with it?

187
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,400
Well, I'm single.

188
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
Really? You're this pretty
and still single?

189
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,160
Are you being picky or what?

190
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,720
Listen, let me tell you something.

191
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,160
Once women like us hit 30,
it gets hard to find a man, you know.

192
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,680
You're still young and gorgeous.
Lock someone down while you can, okay?

193
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,200
Even me! I married fast,
and still, my man died on me early.

194
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,600
I've been raising our kid alone
ever since.

195
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,480
My daughter still doesn't have
a husband either.

196
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,440
I'm so worried about
who will take care of her when she's old.

197
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,360
I'm here for a shampoo and blow-dry.
Can I go in now?

198
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,800
Sure. Right inside the shop, dear.

199
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Have you made your merit yet?

200
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,720
Fine. You can do it after.

201
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,080
- Will my hair be done in time though?
- Of course!

202
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,320
Let's call this a gossip break from work.

203
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,280
Make it pretty.

204
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,400
Shampoo and blow-dry.
Take care of the customer, please.

205
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,520
Got it.

206
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,000
You again?!

207
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,240
It's me.

208
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,960
Fern, her assistant, is on her
lunch break, so I came to help out.

209
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,480
I'll rinse your hair now, okay?

210
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,040
Just tilt your head up a bit.

211
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,280
How many jobs do you have?

212
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,640
I actually do everything.

213
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,960
I take orders, deliver people,
deliver stuff, and fix things.

214
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,080
I do everything that is legal.

215
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,560
Just like my slogan.

216
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,240
"Maewnam Service. You think it, I do it!"

217
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,760
If there's anything you need help with,
just let me know, okay?

218
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,840
You're working while studying.
That's so hardworking.

219
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,400
- No, no, it's just--
- I only do one thing. The grocery store.

220
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,440
I thought it would be easy,
but in the end, it's not.

221
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,760
It gave me a headache.

222
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,040
Let me give you a head massage today
to help clear your mind.

223
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,040
It's done.

224
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,720
Maewnam.

225
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,880
How do you shampoo someone
and end up with foam on your cheek?

226
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,200
Maybe I was a bit too focused on
washing your hair.

227
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,320
Hey, do you know Kung's shop?

228
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,680
Of course.

229
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,440
Then can you take me there?

230
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,080
Here you are.

231
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,760
Is business good today?

232
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,240
Oh, hey Maewnam!
What filling would you like?

233
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,280
Thank you.

234
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,720
I didn't come to eat today.

235
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,800
I brought you a customer instead.

236
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,520
Thanks.

237
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,920
So, the thing is,

238
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,440
you owe my store 3,568 baht.

239
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,840
I came to check in about that…

240
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,760
Wait a second.

241
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,240
It's not even the end of the month yet.

242
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,480
Your dad said I could have until
the 15th of every month to pay.

243
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,600
But this isn't "end of the month."
It's been a month and a half already.

244
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,560
Well, your dad let me pay like that.

245
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,080
You're taking over your dad's store
and you don't even know how things work?

246
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,920
That was my dad. This is me, okay?

247
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,200
Okay, okay, let's all calm down here.

248
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,760
Wan's only just started running the store.
She probably didn't know.

249
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,680
Let me clear things up, okay?

250
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,400
Wan.

251
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,440
Yeah, trade is about buying and selling.

252
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,560
But what Uncle Yuth practiced
was mutual support.

253
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,560
If you have money, you pay.

254
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,280
If you don't, it's okay.

255
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,760
It's like a credit card,

256
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,960
but here, credit means trust.

257
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,080
That's how he's always done it.

258
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,320
You can't just change that overnight.

259
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,920
But trust me,

260
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,520
if he has the money, he'll pay.

261
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,480
All right then.

262
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,560
I'll do it the way Dad did.

263
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,400
Thank you, Wan.

264
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,800
You can drop me off here, Maewnam.

265
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay.

266
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,120
Be careful.

267
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,280
By the way…

268
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,960
You're this articulate and reasonable.
What faculty are you studying in?

269
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,120
The faculty of…

270
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,720
crispy pork with kale.

271
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,200
Come on.

272
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,760
I shouldn't have complimented you.

273
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,240
Maewnam Service at your service!

274
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,920
TV not turning on?

275
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
Okay, I'll fix it for you.

276
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,440
Wan, I've got to go fix a TV now.

277
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,280
Mm-hmm, I heard. Go on then.

278
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,240
Okay.

279
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,360
Take care.

280
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,880
Oh, you're here?
I've been waiting forever.

281
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,400
Is there something wrong?

282
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,880
I sent my son to buy fish sauce and rice.

283
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,720
He said you didn't give him the change.

284
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,440
But I already did.

285
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,319
He gave me 100 and I gave 35 baht back.

286
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,440
Did you ask him properly?

287
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,160
Are you saying my son stole the money?!

288
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,319
35 baht, right?

289
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,000
Wait! The rice too.

290
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,280
I paid 30 baht,
but this is way less than usual.

291
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,800
But your son scooped it himself.

292
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,720
What?

293
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,360
So now you're blaming everyone else?

294
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,320
First the change, now this?

295
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,040
Back when Yuth was around,
stuff like this never happened.

296
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,400
He used to give extra.

297
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,800
Then how much would you like?

298
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,320
You're welcome to go scoop it yourself.

299
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,240
It's fine.

300
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,040
I just wanted to let you know.

301
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,160
I won't be coming back
to this store anymore.

302
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,520
Short on product, short on change!

303
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,000
No one should buy from here again.

304
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,920
A store like this won't last.

305
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,120
Your words are so nasty,
even a dog wouldn't take them!

306
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,160
Hello. I was just thinking about you.

307
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,400
I'm so exhausted, girl.

308
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,040
With how tired you sound,
business must be booming.

309
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
Booming? Please.

310
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,720
I made just over 300 baht today.

311
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,960
That's less than minimum wage.

312
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,560
Why don't you come back to an office job?

313
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,280
<i>By now, your base salary</i>
<i>should be over 1,000 baht a day.</i>

314
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,240
Come back and find a job already.

315
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,240
Once you're over 30,
it's harder to get hired.

316
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,160
Is it really that hard
to find a job after 30?

317
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,320
<i>This country's weird. You know that.</i>

318
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,320
Most job listings say
they won't take anyone over 35.

319
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,160
Like, seriously? People over 40 aren't
supposed to eat, live, or work anymore?

320
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,360
<i>Exactly!</i>

321
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,520
Right?

322
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,920
Someone with your skills
should get back into the job market.

323
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,400
Well, I just opened my shop,

324
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,080
so give me three more months.

325
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,320
If it turns out to be too toxic,
I might just shut it down.

326
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,560
But judging from your tone,

327
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,160
I bet you've been through a lot, huh?

328
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,440
Hey.

329
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,400
Someone owes me thousands,

330
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,080
and when I went to collect,
he refused to pay.

331
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,000
Another sent her kid to buy stuff
and yelled she didn't get the change.

332
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,160
Just recently, someone bought rice.
I wasn't sure how many scoops.

333
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,200
The wrong amount was scooped
and she went off on me!

334
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,560
I really try to be patient
and understand people around here,

335
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,920
but… it's just the local crowd, you know?

336
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,360
Oh, I just went to get my hair
washed at a salon.

337
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,960
The lady there kept asking questions,
so curious about my life.

338
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,160
Am I moving back home for good?

339
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,400
Do I have a boyfriend?

340
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,000
Are my standards too high?

341
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,880
I was like, "What"?

342
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,320
I was going crazy.

343
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,320
<i>That kind of behavior is</i>
<i>so your pet peeve.</i>

344
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Right? I seriously hate it.
What's with her?

345
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,640
Why does she feel the need to dig
into other people's lives like that?

346
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,840
What does she get out of it?

347
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,480
It's just too much.

348
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,880
Yeah!

349
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,600
Just talking about it gets me annoyed.

350
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,240
SOM SALON

351
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,800
Are you okay, sis?

352
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,280
Nope, sis.

353
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,520
Goodness. You must've been stretching
your arms writing on the board all day.

354
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,480
Then let me give you three words
to honor you as a teacher.

355
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,160
<i>Aanjalee, Wanthaa, Apheewat.</i>

356
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,400
That's how you worship a Buddha.
It's supposed to be Paajeraa!

357
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,560
Oh right, I totally failed there.

358
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,160
I haven't said that in so long.

359
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,920
I'll give you a strong massage.

360
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,400
<i>I'm home now, tiny darling.</i>

361
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,080
<i>I've planned our date schedule, Pinky.</i>

362
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,720
What?

363
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,640
You have someone you're talking to now?

364
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,280
- Fern!
- Yes!

365
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,680
Why are you so slow at everything?

366
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,280
When you're done,
why don't you help fold the laundry?

367
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,440
I was sweeping the floor, Mama!

368
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,200
- Is it done now?
- Yeah.

369
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,040
Then go fold the laundry already!

370
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,160
What bit you today? You're so fierce.
Did you eat a giant or something?

371
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,720
Are we friends or what?

372
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,160
Mom, are you okay?

373
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,920
You've been moody since yesterday.

374
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,000
Hey, Chom. Let me ask you
something seriously.

375
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,760
Do I really seem like someone who pokes
their nose into other people's business?

376
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Do you want a real answer
or just a comforting one?

377
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,240
Who insulted you?

378
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,280
I think you should gather
some preliminary information first.

379
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,400
Then next week, I'll help review it.

380
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,000
- Yes, thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

381
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,480
- Thank you, Professor.
- Thanks.

382
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,160
<i>Girl, that grocery sister has</i>
a sharp tongue, huh?

383
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,000
Hello?
What's up? What did Wan do?

384
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,280
YUTH PANICH

385
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,920
Hello, hello, hello!

386
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,760
Come see me at my store, Noey.

387
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,720
I've got no customers now.

388
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,280
Som!

389
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,240
Help wave in some customers, will you?

390
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,840
I've even got something for you.

391
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,800
Here. See?

392
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,480
Hello?

393
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,040
Is this a grocery store
or a haunted house?

394
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
There's not a single soul in sight.

395
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,160
If you're just here to mess around,
then leave.

396
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,760
So harsh for real!

397
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,000
You're not getting any customers because
you messed with the wrong person.

398
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,040
Oh no! She heard all that?

399
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,240
Mama Som is super influential, you know.

400
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,640
As you probably know, a beauty salon
is like the community's loudspeaker.

401
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,840
By now, the whole place
has probably heard everything,

402
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,680
and that's why
no one's coming to your store.

403
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,320
What should I do then?

404
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,000
If things go on like this, I'm done for.

405
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,200
I can help you.

406
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,640
Okay, Wi. I'll leave
the steamer on for 15 minutes.

407
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,680
Be right there. See you soon.

408
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,440
Just a second.

409
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,160
All right.

410
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,320
Where are you going, Chompoo?

411
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,520
To the uni, Mom.

412
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,720
I have class.

413
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,320
Wait, you said you only teach
Monday to Friday, didn't you?

414
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,080
That's kind of suspicious, huh?

415
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,760
Just a little bit.

416
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,560
Fern! Fern!

417
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,360
- Have you been waiting long?
- Yep.

418
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,200
Did I see that right?
The driver's a guy, isn't he?

419
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,600
I can't see clearly.

420
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,080
Should I go introduce myself?

421
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,320
You shouldn't.

422
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,160
Why did you even ask me?!

423
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,720
- Hello.
- Hello, sweetie.

424
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,560
Who's he? I don't think I've ever met him.

425
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,560
He's a new professor at my university.
His name is Wanan.

426
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,160
Oh my! And that handsome face!

427
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,200
Do you have a girlfriend?

428
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,920
Coming to pick up my daughter…

429
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,280
Do you like her?

430
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,040
- Feel free to make a move, you know.
- Mom!

431
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,440
No need to be shy, dear.

432
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,920
I'm not that old-fashioned.

433
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,960
If a nice guy like this comes
to pick you up, I'm all for it.

434
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,480
Go ahead and woo her.

435
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,080
Love is a beautiful thing, right, Wasan?

436
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,680
Wanan, Mom!

437
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,800
- Right, Wanan.
- I'm running late.

438
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,960
Next time, just tell me straight
if you're going on a date.

439
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,880
No need to lie about
having class on Saturday.

440
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,040
Anything else you've lied about?

441
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,200
Nothing!

442
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,000
All right then.

443
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,360
Take good care of my daughter, okay?

444
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Sure.

445
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,400
- Drive safe.
- Bye-bye.

446
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,080
Bye-bye, dear.

447
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,480
Let's hurry before traffic gets worse.

448
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,280
Drive carefully.

449
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,480
Fern! Fern!

450
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,440
- What now, sis?
- Fern, Chompoo is officially taken!

451
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,760
- Seriously?
- There! Look! The guy is super handsome.

452
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,680
His skin is, like, glowing white.

453
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,800
- Your mom is quite good at conversations.
- Yep.

454
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,160
Let's get moving already.

455
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,840
You're sitting around looking so relaxed.

456
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,240
Nope!

457
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,240
Are you leaving nicely or not?

458
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,200
Nope.

459
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,760
I showered, got dressed,
washed my face, brushed my teeth,

460
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,520
and ironed my shirt
just to drop Chompoo off.

461
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,080
So where's the money, sis?

462
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,040
If you want it, come get it.

463
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,640
Whoa.

464
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,680
Thank you!

465
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,880
Pleasure doing business.

466
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,160
Call me anytime.

467
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,120
Nice hair, by the way.

468
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
Boo, I'm sorry.

469
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,680
Things didn't go as planned.

470
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,040
I didn't think my mom would call me over.
Once she did, it went on nonstop.

471
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,080
I left just five minutes late,

472
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,560
and didn't expect traffic to be that bad.

473
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,440
If you want anything to eat today,
order whatever you want.

474
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,480
Even if you want every cake
on display, I got you.

475
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,200
But if you keep making
that moody face, no dessert.

476
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,600
I'll start sulking too,

477
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,360
because I already told you what happened.

478
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,480
I told you already.
When I sulk, don't talk too much.

479
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,480
Just do what?

480
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,800
There are a lot of people.

481
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,960
Hurry up. Are you doing it or not?

482
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,600
Fine, I'm not mad anymore.

483
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,680
You said you'd treat me, right?

484
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,360
- Everything on display, really?
- Yep.

485
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,560
Okay then, I'm ordering.

486
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,120
But before you go order the cakes,
take photos of me first.

487
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,040
Of course.

488
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,560
Okay. One, two, three.

489
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,840
That's so cute. Babe, pose like
you're looking at the view.

490
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,200
- Take some photos of me too.
- Sure. Give it to me.

491
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,360
Hmm, this is not working.

492
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,720
I can see your neck,
and it makes me want to bite.

493
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,400
Cover it with your hair.

494
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,000
All right. Ready now.

495
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,960
One, two, three, gorgeous.

496
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,920
One, two, three!

497
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,840
MOM

498
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,000
<i>Don't rush home. Take your time.</i>

499
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,120
Your mom texted you to go back home?

500
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,480
Nope. It's just horoscope stuff.

501
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,080
You said your mom wouldn't stop talking.
What was she talking about?

502
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,040
If a nice guy like this
comes to pick you up…

503
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,320
Go ahead and woo her.

504
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,680
Anything else you've lied about?

505
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,800
It's nothing.

506
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,440
It's hard to explain.

507
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,320
Let's eat our cakes.

508
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,480
Here. Does it look like me?

509
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,080
Let me sit and eat with you, Kung.

510
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,200
Everyone.

511
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,960
Do you want to join the robe-offering
ceremony with me?

512
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,320
Let's make merit together.

513
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,360
I'll be closing in ten minutes.

514
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,400
Whoa, look at that face when it comes to
making merit. Frozen in shock?

515
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,360
Thinking too much?

516
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,640
I'd like to make merit too.

517
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,560
Anyone else joining?

518
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,400
If not, I'm heading out.

519
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,720
Actually, I'd like to apologize.

520
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,600
I want to say sorry to everyone
for speaking badly behind your backs.

521
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,000
I just recently moved back here

522
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,480
and only recently started running
the grocery store full-time.

523
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,040
Even though I'm the daughter
of the store owner,

524
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,320
I was barely ever around here before.

525
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,720
So all of this is new to me.
I have to adjust to it.

526
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,480
At first, I thought running a store
would be easy.

527
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,560
But it's not.

528
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,040
I'm still not good at it.

529
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,200
I can't compare
to everything my dad used to do.

530
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,200
Also, I don't really know everyone here.

531
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Kung, I didn't know you had to keep
owing money at the store

532
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,560
because you needed to pay off a debt,

533
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,320
one you guaranteed
for your younger brother who ran away.

534
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,000
Hello?

535
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,760
Could I get three more days?

536
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,640
Please, just three days?

537
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Pin, you have to look after your child

538
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,280
while working over a hot stove alone.

539
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,520
Som, you asked personal questions

540
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,800
just to be friendly and build
a connection with me.

541
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,120
So, you're back to running
the store again, right?

542
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,240
How's the business going?

543
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,640
You're still young and gorgeous.
Lock someone down while you can, okay?

544
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,400
Even me! I married fast,
and still, my man died on me early.

545
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,200
I've been raising our kid alone
ever since.

546
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,400
I don't know everyone well enough yet,

547
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,040
and I also misjudged your intentions.

548
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,400
I'm truly sorry.

549
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,800
You don't have to stop
being upset with me right now.

550
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,040
It's okay if none of you
are ready to forgive me yet.

551
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,080
I just want you to know
that I truly feel sorry.

552
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,520
I'm sorry.

553
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,280
Um… no one else joining the merit-making?

554
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,840
All right then. I'm heading off.

555
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,960
Did I say something wrong again just now?
Or did I say anything rude?

556
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,320
No, not at all.

557
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,040
I was listening the whole time.
You spoke well.

558
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,880
You did your best.

559
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,120
YUTH PANICH

560
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,320
I'll be able to keep this
grocery store running, right?

561
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,840
I think you just need
a bit more time to adjust.

562
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,800
You've got what it takes.

563
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,840
Believe in yourself.

564
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,240
You're already doing great.

565
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,040
Oh, hello!

566
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,320
This is for this month.

567
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,280
I'm sorry it's a bit late.

568
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,440
I'll bring it earlier next month.

569
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,400
Thank you.

570
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,560
Here's the interest.

571
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,000
I'll take two bottles. How much?

572
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,960
20 baht, please.

573
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,240
Here you go. Keep the change.

574
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,120
Here's yours.

575
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,320
You're good.

576
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,120
30 baht of rice, please.

577
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,920
- Um…
- Sure.

578
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,280
So do you know now
how many scoops I'm getting?

579
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,320
Uh…

580
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,199
Come here. Look.

581
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
This is exactly 30 baht worth.

582
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,440
Here you go.

583
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,920
And from now on, if my kid ever acts up,
just tell me directly, okay?

584
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,080
Thank you so much.

585
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,520
I'm off.

586
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,199
Wait. Don't be in a rush to leave.

587
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,560
Stay and keep me company for a bit.

588
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,920
Wan, I brought you prayer books.

589
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Thank you so much.

590
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,040
I heard you just reopened the shop
and you're living here alone.

591
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,640
I was worried you might not have
anyone looking out for you.

592
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,440
If you need anything, let me know.

593
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,320
And if I ever come off as nosy
or overbearing, just say so too.

594
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,920
Thank you so much. I'll come in often
for a shampoo and blow-dry.

595
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,200
As well as wash-and-blow,
I also do 4-D eyebrow tattoos now.

596
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,400
I just finished training.
You should try it.

597
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,800
Just take a nap.
You'll wake looking fabulous.

598
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,480
All right. I'll bring Maewnam with me.

599
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,480
Yes!

600
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,560
Kung said he wants his brows done too.

601
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,640
I'll give you 16-D brows then.

602
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,600
Deal?

603
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,240
Wait, just one side, okay?

604
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,040
Who even tattoos one eyebrow only?

605
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,800
You're talking nonsense.
How about 24-D brows?

606
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,240
- Oh, it splashed.
- Ice delivery!

607
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,040
All right, just leave it there, please.

608
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,160
Here. I'll handle the payment
with your mom.

609
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,600
Let's add it all together. How much?

610
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,160
- 40 baht, please.
- 40? Here you go. Thanks.

611
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,680
Thank you.

612
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,480
Hey.

613
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,240
See? Customers are coming back
to your store again.

614
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,360
People are starting to understand you now.

615
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,640
Don't worry too much.

616
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,280
It's hard not to worry.

617
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,880
Honestly, not many grocery stores make it.

618
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,240
One reason my dad's store is still fine is
because Mouse Mart hasn't opened yet.

619
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,000
I keep thinking, you know.

620
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,080
If Mouse Mart opens, I'm doomed.

621
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,680
Wan, I don't think so.

622
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,920
Lots of grocery stores can survive.

623
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,440
Most people in the neighborhood prefer
shopping where they feel comfortable.

624
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,760
Your store is exactly
where they feel more at ease.

625
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,920
There you go again,
talking all wise and logical.

626
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,400
Are you really a university student?

627
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,120
When did I ever say I was a student?

628
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,440
I'm a professor, actually.

629
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,440
A professor?!

630
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,400
University professor.

631
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,240
I look young, right?

632
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,760
Exactly.

633
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,120
You've been tricking me for so long.

634
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,440
Who tricked you? I didn't!

635
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,640
I was going to tell you at first,

636
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,560
but then you started looking out for me
as my elder and caring for me.

637
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,320
I didn't want to ruin the vibe,

638
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,280
so I just let myself
stay being your "kid."

639
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,320
Don't be mad. I'm kidding.

640
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
I'm not mad.

641
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,920
You're awesome, Maewnam.

642
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,080
What's wrong?

643
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,960
Why are you frozen?

644
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,880
Am I really awesome?

645
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,360
Of course.

646
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,720
You fix things, teach,
and can do so many things.

647
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,480
You even helped me
clear things up with everyone.

648
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,880
If it weren't for you,
I'd be in serious trouble.

649
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,560
Thank you so much.

650
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,440
You're amazing.

651
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,040
Thank you.

652
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,480
Wait, I've got something for you.

653
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,000
Here.

654
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,520
It looks just like Som's.

655
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,040
AWESOME

656
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,880
Give me your hand.

657
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,480
This one's to match with Som's.

658
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,640
So you two can be friends.

659
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,240
It's a reward for someone awesome.

660
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,160
Thank you.

661
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,200
Aww, it's got that "Oong" too!

662
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,040
Isn't it adorable? I made it myself.

663
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,200
Two dishwashing liquids, one canned fish,
and one bottle of fish sauce.

664
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,480
That's 80 baht, please.

665
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,400
Thanks.

666
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Thank you.

667
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,880
80 baht.

668
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,440
Hey there, Madam Wan.

669
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,600
Is your business booming?

670
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,560
Sit down.

671
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,240
I brought the inheritance documents
you need to sort out.

672
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,600
Have you found your dad's account book?

673
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,840
I need to check
what he might've left for you.

674
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,600
Not yet.

675
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,560
I've been so caught up with this store.

676
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,680
I'll find it soon.

677
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,800
It's fine.

678
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,360
I work fast anyway.

679
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,440
Thanks, Noey.

680
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,160
Having you makes me feel so relieved.

681
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,360
I'm so lucky to always have someone
around when I'm in trouble.

682
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Like with this store,
if it weren't for Maewnam,

683
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,720
no customer would've come back.

684
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,640
So how exactly did that girl
Maewnam help you?

685
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,680
Share some new-gen ideas with me.

686
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,440
No. She isn't a girl.

687
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,840
At first, I thought she was a uni student.
It turns out she's a professor.

688
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,720
The moment I found out, ugh,
I was so embarrassed.

689
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,920
But it makes sense.
She always sounds so smart when she talks.

690
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,560
Besides, she works
part-time jobs in the morning.

691
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,360
<i>She teaches in the evening. She's amazing.</i>
<i>I don't know when she ever rests.</i>

692
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,240
<i>As for her ideas,</i>

693
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,560
<i>she shared with me the stories behind</i>
<i>the people in this neighborhood.</i>

694
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,640
- Could I get just three more days?
- Which filling would you like?

695
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,880
- Please?
- Sweet filling, please.

696
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,600
<i>Once I understood everyone's situation…</i>

697
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,000
I felt so much more empathy for them.

698
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,680
What?

699
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,000
Do I have something in my teeth?

700
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,240
Oh yeah… this look says it all.

701
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,400
Admit it.

702
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,720
What?

703
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,400
You like that girl Maewnam now, don't you?

704
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,040
Are you crazy?
I just admire her, that's all!

705
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,160
Yeah right.

706
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,240
Since I sat down here,
you haven't stopped talking about her.

707
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,600
You haven't dated anyone in so long,

708
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,960
so you might have forgotten how it feels
when you fall for someone without knowing.

709
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,960
There you go.

710
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,360
Hit a nerve, huh?

711
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,440
If you're not sure whether you like her,
there's a way to test it.

712
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,960
How?

713
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,720
I read this theory.

714
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,200
If you're unsure whether
you like someone, just try hugging them.

715
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,160
But for some people,
it might go as far as a kiss.

716
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,400
A kiss?

717
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,680
If your heart races,

718
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,880
you're into them.

719
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,560
All right then. It's settled.

720
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,200
But I have one request.

721
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,200
For the construction company,
please use mine.

722
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,160
We've worked with them for every branch.

723
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
This will help to maintain
the same store quality.

724
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,480
Absolutely.

725
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,800
How is it, honey?

726
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,200
Try a bite.

727
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,200
I've been searching forever

728
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,600
for a place that sells
quality kunafa noodles like this.

729
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,800
It's good.

730
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,160
I'm planning to launch in Bangkok
and nearby areas first.

731
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,000
If there's buzz, we'll discuss it later.

732
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,240
That sounds great.

733
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,080
If you need marketing support,
let me know.

734
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Sure. Thank you so much.

735
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,160
Anytime, for you.

736
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Praewa.

737
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,880
Don't forget to turn in your assignment
this time, or you'll get an F.

738
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,840
Will do.

739
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,840
What's going on, Professor Sudteerak?

740
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,920
I could see you smiling from a mile away.

741
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,600
Well, it's because I'm beautiful.

742
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,400
Whoa. This is weird.

743
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,240
I'm beautiful and awesome.

744
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,640
What?

745
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,680
All right, spill. Who said what?

746
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,400
Someone said I'm awesome.

747
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,160
Who?

748
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,160
That grocery sister.

749
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,640
I was right.

750
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,880
You're into older ones again, huh?

751
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,600
Not "again."

752
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,920
Just… once more.

753
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,200
She's the one I told you about before.

754
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,840
I didn't feel anything much at first,

755
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,480
but when she said I was awesome…

756
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,560
You're awesome, Maewnam.

757
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,760
That's such a powerful impact.

758
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,120
You know how much that word means to me.

759
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,600
I'm thinking of seriously trying
to win her over this time.

760
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,880
You're really romantic, which is fitting
with "Sudteerak" meaning "darling".

761
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,080
Enough about me.

762
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,840
How was your date?

763
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,800
Was it as romantic as you hoped?

764
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,000
Well, it was good.

765
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,400
I have to quickly win Wan over.

766
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,520
I'll make her fall for me,
and ask her to be my girlfriend.

767
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,120
Oh, it's getting wet for sure.

768
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,600
It's here! I'm too late!

769
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,320
Maewnam.

770
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,280
It's just like that day.

771
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,320
That day?

772
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,920
What day?

773
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,440
The night it rained

774
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,720
and there was a student crying right here.

775
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,280
You came and held the umbrella
for me just like this.

776
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,200
Do you remember, Wan?

777
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,680
I don't know what you're going through,

778
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,040
but don't stay out in the rain like this,

779
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,040
or you'll get sick.

780
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,360
Today might feel heavy,

781
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,280
but problems are like the rain.

782
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,440
Sometimes it pours hard.

783
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,920
Sometimes, there's a storm,

784
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,040
or sometimes it floods.

785
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,520
But trust me,

786
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,760
there will be a day when the rain stops.

787
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,480
That student was you?

788
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,600
Every time it rains,

789
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,920
I remember that night.

790
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,120
My beautiful grocery sister.

791
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,640
<i>Chom, when are you going to</i>
<i>tell your mom about us?</i>

792
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,040
We've been together
for almost three years now.

793
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,480
Ugh! It's getting wet!

794
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,880
<i>You told me to dry my hair,</i>
<i>but you're still soaking wet yourself.</i>

795
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,760
<i>No wonder you've been looking</i>
<i>so in love lately.</i>

796
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,760
<i>Look!</i>

797
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,320
<i>Wan made two of these</i>

798
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,760
<i>so I can wear one and match Som.</i>

799
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,240
<i>I really like you, Wan.</i>

800
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,480
<i>How about you?</i>

801
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,040
Do you feel the same way about me?
