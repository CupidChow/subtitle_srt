It's despicable of you to have an affair.

In the past, she was all about love, and always put her boyfriend first.

167
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,040
She used to depend on others,

168

and didn't... couldn't, do anything by herself.

Like I said over the phone, I have something to tell you.

181
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,020
I'm all ears.

182
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,240
I have called off my engagement with Haruhisa.

183
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,100
I've also hired a lawyer,

184
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,790
who will help me with the negotiations moving forward.

185
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,140
A lawyer?

186
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,260
Miku,

187
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,160
so you were having an affair after all.

188
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,130
No, I wasn't.

189
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,750
- In that case...
- Dear, hang on.

190
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,480
Miku.

191
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:52,080
You and Haruhisa appeared to be getting along well.

192
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,440
Was there a severe issue that occurred between you both?

193
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,350
Like abuse, or something of that nature?

194
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,990
Of course he wouldn't do that.

195
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,760
Haruhisa would never resort to abuse...

196
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,940
Miku?

197
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,040
There were instances where Haru had been abusive.

198
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,820
When I had put on slightly thicker make up,

199
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,850
he poured cleansing oil over my head.

200
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,120
When I wouldn't listen to him,

201
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,100
he chased me out of his house in the middle of the night.

202
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,350
He seriously did that?

203
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,020
When I didn't do what he wanted,

204
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,550
he would give me unspoken pressure.

205
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,620
But I...

206
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,890
I couldn't express my own opinions.

207
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,390
I had to do whatever Haru wanted,

208
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,050
so that he wouldn't hate me.

209
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,380
I felt suffocated by my own predicament.

210
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,950
So for a time, I stayed away from him.

211
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,850
As a result,

212
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:31,780
he misunderstood, and thought I had an affair.

213
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:38,400
Which was why he sent a letter, demanding a compensation of three million yen.

214
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,950
No way...

215
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,570
After that,

216
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,810
I moved back in with him.

217
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,270
But by then...

218
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,130
my feelings for him had already died.

219
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,100
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

220
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,800
Do you seriously think she ever could?

221
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,750
I was embarrassed.

222
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,990
I...

223
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,800
I didn't want you all to know the truth.

224
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,300
That I wasn't being treated as an equal.

225
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,770
But...

226
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,250
If he hurts you, you should be angry and tell him to stop.

227
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,930
If you don't do that to protect yourself,

228
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,950
you'll end up battered and unable to move.

229
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,610
I...

230
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,470
I wanted to love myself.

231
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,260
Dear.

232
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:11,160
Let's leave this matter to Miku to sort it out.

233
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,450
You're okay with that, right?

234
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,030
Yes.

235
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,700
Wait, Souta.

236
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,670
Can you stay for a bit longer?

237
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,610
I'm dim-witted,

238
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,630
so it took me several detours before coming to this realization.

239
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,030
But Souta is different.

240
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,840
He has found a path that is his own,

241
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,030
and is already moving forward.

242
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,830
Miku...

243
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,030
So...

244
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,340
Mom, Dad.

245
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,790
I hope you both support him in what he wants to do.

246
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,870
What are you talking about?

247
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:30,370
He changed his career path on a whim because he didn't want to deal with entrance exams, no?

248
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,860
- Actually...
- It wasn't on a whim.

249
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,990
Souta has always loved to draw.

250
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,420
Ever since he was in junior high.

251
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,430
So please...

252
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,140
let Souta choose the path he wants to walk on.

253
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,680
He is still a child.

254
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,740
We adults have to guide him.

255
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,580
Souta.

256
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,330
You see,

257
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,010
I grew up following the wishes of others.

258
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,570
I thought the path that Mom and those around me would accept,

259
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,830
was the correct path.

260
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,140
But I finally realize the truth.

261
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,400
I have to find my own path myself.

262
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,230
I won't survive if I keep depending on others.

263
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,170
With his academic abilities,

264
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,690
he could go to any good university.

265
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,560
But with an art school, who knows if he'll succeed.

266
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,530
Does everything have to go perfectly?

267
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,370
Even if he doesn't succeed,

268
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,360
and has to give up halfway,

269
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,400
I don't see that as a failure.

270
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,140
You drew all these?

271
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,210
Impressive.

272
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,030
You see?

273
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,850
Souta has found a path that he can shine in.

274
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,030
That isn't something just anyone can do.

275
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,610
If he doesn't take up the challenge now...

276
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,600
I'm sure he'll regret it later on.

277
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,530
Souta, are you serious about this?

278
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,950
Yes.

279
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,190
Got it.

280
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,030
If you want to attend art prep school,

281
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,870
you can go ahead.

282
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,190
Dear...

283
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,510
But I won't allow you to attend it indefinitely, understand?

284
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,250
Thanks, Dad.

285
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,800
Miku.

286
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,980
You've become quite the adult since I last saw you. I'm proud.

287
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,760
Sorry to keep disturbing you.

288
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,180
Could you negotiate a meeting between us,

289
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,980
where we can talk face to face?

290
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,000
Meet him face to face?

291
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,930
You see,

292
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,580
I figured that I shouldn't keep running away like this.

293
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,970
See you.
[3rd Floor - Employees' Lounge]

294
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,810
Long time no see.

295
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,840
Where's Kitake?

296
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,770
I wanted to talk to you. Just the two of us.

297
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,200
I see.

298
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,990
Thank you for coming today.

299
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,020
Sorry.

300
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,610
I'll withdraw my lawsuit.

301
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,230
Okay.

302
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,210
It wasn't fair of me to use the law

303
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,440
as a means to an end.

304
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,410
I won't do anything to you anymore,

305
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,220
so rest assured.

306
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,820
Haru.

307
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,050
You see...

308
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,800
I came here today to talk to you as your equal.

309
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,220
Because we were certainly never equals

310
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,690
when we were in a relationship.

311
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,860
You're right.

312
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:21,170
You're giving such a mean expression.

313
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,960
Feels like I'm seeing it for the first time.

314
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,020
All this time,

315
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,000
I've only been playing the role of an ideal boyfriend.

316
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,390
Role?

317
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,180
Likewise for you, no?

318
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,080
That was why you were being obedient to me.

319
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,540
In order to be my ideal girlfriend.

320
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,390
You're wrong.

321
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,950
I mean, yes.

322
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,030
I was trying to be the perfect girlfriend for you.

323
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,970
But that was because...

324
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,980
I wanted to be loved by you.

325
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,010
I just wanted to be loved,

326
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,390
so I did all I could.

327
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,000
Haru.

328
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,010
What exactly...

329
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,780
was I to you?

330
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,400
You were someone important to me.

331
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,920
But...

332
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,220
That was because...

333
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,970
you were a convenient existence to me.

334
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,650
If you ask me whether I loved you,

335
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,200
I did.

336
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,940
But...

337
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,160
if you tell me that wasn't love,

338
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,440
then I guess it wasn't.

339
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:56,180
If you had been the Miku now

340
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,190
when we first met,

341
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,530
I probably wouldn't have even liked you.

342
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,800
I'm sorry.

343
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,830
For wasting six years of your time.

344
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,050
I see.

345
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,800
If I had been like this back then,

346
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,240
you wouldn't have even liked me, huh?

347
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,670
But you know what?

348
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,830
The reason I've become the person I am today,

349
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,790
is thanks to the six years that I had been deeply in love with you.

350
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,850
Thank you.

351
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,590
Those six years

352
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,230
weren't a waste at all.

353
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,510
Hello?

354
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,410
I'm Mary. I'm right behind you now.
[T/N: referencing a Japanese ghost story, involving a Ms. Mary]

355
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,200
Why did you come here?

356
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,690
Well, you see, my brother is suffering.

357
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,980
And I know he'll obsess over this mess.

358
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,360
- I will not.
- Oh, really?

359
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,560
I know that even if I turn back,

360
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,620
Miku will no longer be there.

361
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:13,110
Then let's have a meeting to reflect your actions.

362
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,070
With you? No way.

363
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,250
- Come on, let's.
- Don't wanna.

364
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,340
- Let's do it.
- Not gonna.

365
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,600
Then let's grab a meal sometime with Mom. All three of us.

366
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,300
Is that a yes?

367
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,060
No.

368
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,510
- Come on, let's go.
- I said no.

369
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,720
Let's go, let's go.

370
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,880
So I'll let Mom know, yeah?

371
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,670

That's not how you say "Hello".

377

It's not?

378
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,600
Eve's here. Great.

379
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,580
- You're looking for me?
- Yeah.

380
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,000
I bring news regarding the lawsuit.

381
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,340
The case has officially been withdrawn.

382
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,520
Really?

383
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,530
I'm so glad to hear that.

384
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,270
Miku really did her best.

385
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,620
I don't think it'll cause you any more trouble, so don't worry.

386
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,160
I only came here to tell you this. So, adieu.

387
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,000
What's with that sprightly goodbye?

388
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,350
Miku is amazing.

389
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,920
She's moving forward all on her own.

390
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,150
Hey, come on.

391
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:04,640
I don't think Miku is moving forward on her own.

392
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,390
She has gained a lot from you.

393
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,200
I couldn't do anything at all,

394
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,790
especially when she was in trouble.

395
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:24,430
The other day, I finally plucked up the courage to show my drawings to my mom.

396
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,030
The reason for that

397
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,950
was because I gained strength from your words.

398
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:37,010
I'm sure the same goes for Miku.

399
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,410
You know yourself best, Takakura.

400
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:49,310
And that includes what you want for yourself, right?

401
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,580
Souta, thank you.

402
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,630
Ms. Mochizuki, I wish to leave early today.

403
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,970
Sure. Go ahead!

404
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,420
I'll be back.

405
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,910
I know a fishing boat restaurant in Sakurai

406
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,830
that serves really good sashimi.

407
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,330
I've never been there before.

408
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,250
Nor have I ever gone fishing on a boat.

409
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,610
In that case, I'll bring you there next time.

410
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,240
- Yes, please!
- Miku!

411
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,960
Eve?

412
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,640
This weekend,

413
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,700
our store is organizing a handmade lipstick workshop.

414
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,530
If you are free,

415
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,220
do join us.

417
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,420
Sure.

418
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:58,210
I'd love to join.

419
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,900
Glad to hear that.

420
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,460
I'll see you this weekend.

421
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,670
Guess we'll leave fishing for next time.

422
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,400
Sorry about that.

423
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,390
- Please come in.
- Welcome!

424
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,590
Hello, Miku!

425
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:21,220
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello!

426
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:26,120
Welcome to our handmade cosmetics workshop!

427
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,860
Thank you all for coming.

428
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,110
First off, let's all choose a color

429
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,580
to make your lipstick.

430
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,940
I'll choose this one!

431
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,660
What color would be good?

432
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,420
Let's mix it in.

433
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,830
It's done.

434
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,200
That's nice. I think it'd suit you.

435
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,410
Thanks.

436
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,170
That looks good.

437
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,770
You look much more lively.

438
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,160
It's important to have a healthy complexion.

439
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,800
Today, I'll go home in this make up.

440
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,840
And I'll try to draw a self-portait.

441
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:03,120
I feel like I'll be able to draw myself this time.

442
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,530
Sounds good.

443
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,530
Draw it. Hurry and get to work!

444
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,990
Yes ma'am.

445
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,430
Finally done cleaning up!

446
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,700
Eve.

447
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,990
Will you accept this gift?

448
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,580
I made this based on my image of you.

449
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:35,390
It's handmade, so it can't compare to those high-end, store-bought lipsticks.

450
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,590
But...

451
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,460
it's a token of my sincerity.

452
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,510
Thank you so much.

453
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:47,970
I'll make sure to find a make up look that compliments it.

454
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,030
- Erm...
- Erm...

455
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,460
- You go first.
- No, you first.

456
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,820
Okay, then.

457
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,800
There are two things I wish to tell you.

458
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,770
Okay.

459
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,410
First things first.

460
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,650
Haru...

461
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:19,650
has officially withdrawn the lawsuit.

462
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,300
I've properly broken up with him.

463
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,600
I see.

464
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
That must have been hard on you.

465
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,990
Well done.

466
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,960
Second of all,

467
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:45,770
I've found a job that I want to do.

468
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:50,220
I'll be going in for an interview in the coming days.

469
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,730
So you're leaving your job at the department store?

470
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,010
That's right.

471
00:39:55,010 --> 00:40:01,060
Which reminds me. I want to look strong and confident for this interview.

472
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,120
Could you help me check and see

473
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,410
if my make up will give off that impression?

474
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,420
Of course.

475
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,600
Thank you for waiting.

So, Ms. Miku Yuzuhara.

482
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,750
Could you tell us your work experience?

483
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,480
Yes, sir.

484
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,190
I worked as a receptionist in a department store for three years.

485
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:17,330
During that time, did you pursue any certifications or anything to upskill yourself?

486
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,260
No, sir.

487
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,610
Then may I ask, why did you apply to our company?

488
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,580
Well...

489
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,140
The make up plays the supporting role. You play the main role.

490
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,210
The one who's pretty, is you.

491
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,540
There were many times

492
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,610
when I had gained courage from make up.

493
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,370
Wearing make up is like smearing mud on your face.

494
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:00,210
It is something you wear to hide your flaws.

495
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,150
That was what I had once thought.

496
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:09,750
However, make up instead became a turning point.

497
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,740
It changed my life.

498
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,330
When I saw my face wearing N-SELF's lipstick,

499
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,550
it gave me confidence.

500
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,440
And also...

501
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,400
From now on,

502
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,730
I want to love myself.

503
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,610
It has taught me to cherish my own feelings.

504
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,790
Make up

505
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,990
is not something you wear to hide yourself.

506
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,060
It is something that liberates your soul,

507
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,020
and pushes you to be who you want to be.

508
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:01,410
That is the message... I hope to convey.

509
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,700
Hello, Miku?

510
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,700
Eve.

511
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,320
Erm...

512
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,990
Are you free to meet up?

513
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,620
Yeah, sure.

514
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,550
Hey, Miku!

515
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,360
Thanks for coming to meet me.

516
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,180
I wanted to personally update you on the results.

517
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,790
And the verdict?

518
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,990
I passed!

519
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,260
I'll officially start working at N-SELF come October.

520
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,900
N-SELF?

521
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,550
For real?

522
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:05,100
Wow, congrats!

523
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,930
Thank you.

524
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,970
Moving forward,

525
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,100
I want people to know make up can inspire courage.

526
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:17,120
I want them to see how it become a catalyst for change,

527
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,050
even within oneself.

528
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,550
That sounds amazing.

529
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,610
You can do it, Miku.

530
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,380
All this happened because I had met you.

531
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,250
You have saved me time and time again.

532
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:48,450
In the past, I was always depending on the people around me.

533
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:55,450
But I managed to change that.

534
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:01,120
Still, I feel uneasy.

535
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,380
So...

536
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,400
Will you...

537
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,870
still continue to be by my side?

538
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,440
Not as a friend, or someone I admire.

539
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,650
Eve.

540
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,790
Will you... go out with me?

541
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,850
Of course.

542
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:54,820
I want to continue watching over you.

543
00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:00,030
And I hope you can always watch over me, too.
