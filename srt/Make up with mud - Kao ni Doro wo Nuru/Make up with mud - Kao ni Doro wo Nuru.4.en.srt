00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,780
Well, Haruhisa-san must be troubled since you've been gone for three days.

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,640
You still have to sort things out with him.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,040
You can't move on if you don't have a talk with him.

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,530
You're right.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,390
What happens if Haruhisa-san gets tired of you?

6
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,860
I hope you will also come to love the part of me I love about myself...

7
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,100
Can you wipe off that filthy lipstick first before talking to me?

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,390
I don't want to share a home with a girl who can't listen to her boyfriend.

9
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,120
What should I do from now on?

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,590
Do you have skin problems?

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,250
It's best to have a proper skincare routine.

12
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,960
Do you have any toner?

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,100
Of course not.

14
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,450
Want to try using mine?

15
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,660
I don't need it.

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:19,120
I'm plain-looking anyway. It's weird if I try to groom myself.

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,820
But I think it's wonderful

18
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,500
when guys do proper skin care and makeup.

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,960
That's easy for you to say.

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,700
I'm not the sort of guy who's allowed to do that.

21
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,690
Isn't it suffocating to you tie yourself down

22
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,320
with such perceptions?

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,950
What?

24
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,320
You don't sound convincing when you say that, Nee-chan*.

Miku-san, you look good in curls.

You think so?

38
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,770
I have a curling iron at my parents' place,

39
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,950
so I thought I'd give it a try.

I've curled my hair once before, for a date with my boyfriend.

Back then, I wasn't shocked by his answer at all.

If he likes my hair straight, so be it, I thought.

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,000
It was time-consuming to curl anyway.

She's not afraid to show her vulnerable side either.

155
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,420

It's a small gift, for always taking care of me.

181
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,730
May I open it?

182
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,930
Go ahead.

183
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,510
It's so cute!

184
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,050
I thought it looked like you, Eve-kun.

185
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,920
You think so?

186
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,800
Eve-kun, are you wearing glitter on your eyelids today?

187
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,950
You noticed? It's the eye shadow I just bought.

188
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,110
It's really pretty.

189
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:32,220
Eve-kun, seeing you with your makeup always makes my day.

190
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,720
I wish I could be like you

191
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,260
and be free to wear whatever makeup I like, Eve-kun.

192
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,160
But...

193
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,360
when I think about it alone,

194
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,090
I tend to falter.

195
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,060
I guess...

196
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,490
maybe I should have kept quiet

197
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,280
and done what my boyfriend likes.

198
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,490
Or I should've at least avoided flashy colors or something.

199
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,660
But then...

200
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,260
whenever I see the makeup you wear...

201
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,720
I tend to forget everything he says.

202
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,820
And I recall how I felt when I decided on that lipstick color,

203
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,180
the one I liked.

204
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,160
Miku-san, if your boyfriend still doesn't accept your choices,

205
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,260
will you break up with him?

206
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,500
Sorry if my question comes off as rude.

207
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,010
It's just that

208
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,930
I think this a rather difficult topic to discuss.

209
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,710
After all, when people are faced with something that strays from their ideals,

210
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:13,910
they become disillusioned and try pushing things back into their acceptable limits.

211
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,530
I suppose so.

212
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,600
I've actually experienced that sort of resistance myself.

213
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,870
You have, Eve-kun?

214
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,820
When I was little, I would borrow my mom's makeup

215
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,790
and experiment with it.

216
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,370
My mom never frowned upon my interest in it.

217
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,210
I was also living overseas until my junior high school years,

218
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:55,320
so I didn't think anyone would take issue with the things I liked.

219
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,660
However...

220
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,400
after moving to Japan...

221
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,640
Are these your mom's?

222
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,390
No, they're mine.

223
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,800
Want to try them on together?

224
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,600
No way.

225
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,140
Eve-kun, I didn't know you were that kind of guy.

226
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:26,330
The next day, rumors that I was not normal were circulating the whole school.

227
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,160
What?

228
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,040
From that day on, until graduation after three years,

229
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,680
I was the target of bullying.

230
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,210
But I came to a realization

231
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,780
that not everyone in the world would accept the way I am.

232
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,400
I see.

233
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,250
Eve-kun!

234
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,910
Well,

235
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,260
I'm glad to have chatted with you today.

236
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,390
It was nice hearing about your childhood,

237
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:25,630
and I'm grateful you were willing to share your story with me.

238
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,950
So thank you.

239
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,520
But...

240
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,900
I'm sorry.

241
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,410
I couldn't think of anything helpful to say.

242
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,260
Miku-san, you may be awkward about such things,

243
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,720
but I really like that you're honest about your feelings.

244
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,510
Thank you.

245
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,470
So...

246
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,760
I, well...

247
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,450
Miku-san, I hope you can ignore any limits your boyfriend puts on you

248
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,240
and never compromise on things you feel passionate about.

249
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,430
I get that you love your boyfriend

250
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:18,310
and that you see me only as a girlfriend.

251
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,600
I get it all.

252
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,760
That's why I just want to tell you this.

253
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,760
I like you. I like you the way you are, bright and dazzling.

254
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,400
So break up with him

255
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,860
and choose me instead.

256
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,710
Well...

257
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,160
I...

258
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,050
You don't have to give me a reply.

259
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,800
I...

260
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,750
I didn't expect you would see me in that way.

261
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,370
This came as a surprise.

262
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,800
Because I admired you as a...

263
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,660
Miku-san!

264
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,850
Eve-kun?

265
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,710
If he hurts you, you should be angry and tell him to stop.

266
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,670
I'll always be on your side, Miku-san.

267
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:37,810
He was always the one coming to my rescue.

268
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:42,900
But I've never even considered Eve-kun's feelings.

269
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,870
I've never seen this person

270
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,180
as a young man.

271
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,490

Hey, Onee-san. Do you want to go to lunch with me?

I'll give Haru-kun a call.
