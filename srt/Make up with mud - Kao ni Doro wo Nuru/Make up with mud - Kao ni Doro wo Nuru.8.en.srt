Please break up with me.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,120
This can be considered a threat.

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,950
- A threat?
- He may also send a letter or something to you.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,440
I want to make Miku happy, for as long as I can.

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,130
What can you do?

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,160
This is the first time I'm taking the courage to face my life properly.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,220
You're going back.

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,950
I don't think it's right to chase Miku back to his place.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,210
I'm the only one who can make Miku happy!

11

Why can't you understand?

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,770
Yeah.

What is it?

00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,250
That's good.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,850
What's good?

17
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,760
I mean...

18
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,800
Thanks for your help earlier.

19
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,940
I'm glad that you're siding with me.

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,340
I'm not exactly siding with you, per se.

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,420
Still, I owe it all to your support.

22
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,820
So...

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,920
about Haruhisa.

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,420
Has he come to terms with calling off the engagement?

25
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,770
Why ask?

26
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,560
He came to our house.

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,880
It's a once-in-a-lifetime occasion, so I want to make Miku happy.

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,920
He said he was preparing for the wedding, as a surprise to you.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,530
He was asking Mom for advice.

30
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,430
When you came back home the other day,

31
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,630
he demanded compensation from you, didn't he?

32
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,550
What's going on?

33
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,280
How did you know?

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,880
I was looking for something,

35
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,960
and happened to see the letter.

36
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,780
Sorry for making you worry.

37
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,640
But...

38
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,290
please keep this from Mom.

39
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,440
I'm fine with that.

40
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,900
But Haruhisa is a lawyer, right?

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,750
Will you be okay?

42
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,120
Yup.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,670
I'll solve this problem on my own.

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,640

Sorry, I'm on the early shift today. I have to go.

Miku.

48
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,670
Why don't you talk it over once more with Haruhisa?

49
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,020
I've already said what I wanted to say to him.

50
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,420
There's no need for me to talk to him again.

Miku.

62
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,670
You may think you lead a carefree life, but don't be mistaken.

Your freedom rides on the protection from your parents.

I'm sure you know it.

Between you and me, who can realistically make Miku happy?

66
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,480
Takakura, did something happen?

67
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,700
You're sighing so much that it's obvious.

68
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,130
I'm still very much a kid, huh?

69
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,460
What happened to the confident Takakura?

70
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,960
It's hard to be that right now.

71
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,620
Hey there.

72
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,120
Hello, Mr. Kitake.

73
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,510
Kazumi, I need to speak with Takakura. Could I borrow him for a moment?

74
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,430
You can't enter the kitchen as you wish.

75
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,240
Sorry about that.

76
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm officially representing Miku in her case against her ex-fiance.

77
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,980
She previously approached you for advice, right?

78
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,140
Well, I am a lawyer after all - though I may not look the part.

79
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,350
In any case, did you know that your name appeared in the written notice?

80
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,530
Yes, I heard.

81
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,420
To make sure the matter doesn't blow up, let me handle this from my end.

82
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,220
I hope you can just observe patiently.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,920
In a lawsuit, the one who's correct doesn't necessarily win.

84
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,690
The one who holds the evidence does.

85

So when injustice happens,

86
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,210
the more socially vulnerable you are, the more likely you'll accept it without protest.

87
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,010
But in my opinion,

88
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,240
lawyers are meant to help those people fight on equal footing.

89
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,370
That's why I'll give it my all for Miku.

90
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,950
Mr. Kitake, can you understand how the socially vulnerable feel?

91

Trust me, I've got my circumstances.

92
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,310
Anyway, I hope you can leave this case to me.

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,760
is to stay away from her.

183
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,000
That's the most I can do.

184
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,910
[Investigation Report]

185
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,510
I'm home.

186
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,040
Miku, come over here.

187
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,560
Mom, if this is about Haru ー

188
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,970
Just come over.

189
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,800
This is my own problem!

190
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,330
It's despicable of you to have an affair.

191
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,630
Don't you understand?

192
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,490
You have been deceived!

193
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,180
Mom, what are you talking about?

194
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,040
The man you're having an affair with dresses up as a woman,

195
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,750
and plays around with others before dumping them afterwards.

196
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,670
Who told you that?

197
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,250
Don't you get it?

198
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:41,150
This man can't even compare to Haruhisa.

199
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,250
You met up with Haru?

200
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,400
I'll go with you to apologize to him.

201
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,620
Go back to Haruhisa.

202
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,990
I'm sure he will forgive you.

203
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,800
He said he'll wait for you until you come around.

204
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,490
Mom, wait...

205
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,680
He gave me this as proof.

206
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,380
You don't know how much Haruhisa loves you.

[Name of Applicant: Haruhisa Yuuki]

208
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,670
[Name of Witness: Michiko Yuzuhara]

209
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,600
Mom, I ー

210
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,480
You can't find another man who's as generous as Haruhisa.

211
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,150
Get this in your head!

212
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,460
Miku, are you alright?

213
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,100
Yup.

214
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,000
Are you going back to him?

215
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,410
Miku.

216
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,470
That portrait you drew was really good.

217
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,940
- What?
- I happened to see it at the store.

218
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:32,000
I didn't know you were such an artist.

219
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,010
Ms. Mochizuki also said you have talent.

220
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,600
She said you'd go a long way.

221
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,610
Oh...

222
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,670
She said that?

223
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,960
You're amazing, Souta.

224
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,050
You've found...

225
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,560
your own way to shine.

226
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,930
Hello?

227
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,080
It's Souta.

228
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,070
Today,

229
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,740
Miku's ex met up with our mom,

230
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,370
and handed her what looked like a marriage registration form.

231
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,540
Miku started acting strange since then.

232
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,620
I'm worried that she may go back to him.

233
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,270
He also did a background check on you.

234
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,760
Are you okay with that?

235
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,010
I'm fine with it.

236
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,790
If you say so.

237
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,640
I don't know why Haruhisa is doing all this.

238
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,900
I think I can understand how he feels.

239
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,320
Huh?

240
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,810
I think he's frustrated.

241
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,370
He can't do anything about the situation.

242
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,830
All the more so, now that Miku is totally different from the old Miku.

243
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,160
He's trying to make Miku come back to him,

244
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,440
no matter the cost.

245
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,250
He's serious about this.

246
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,620
I guess so.

247
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,870
Thanks for informing me about the situation.

248
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,820
Please take care of Miku for me, okay?

249
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,370
Got it.

250
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,860
Bye.

251
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,260
I told you, didn't I?

252
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,970
This is what's considered an proper crush.

253
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,490
- This?
- Yes.

254
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,900
Does it hurt?

255
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,640
Yes.

256
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,860
Can we talk for a bit?

257
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,520
I'll be waiting at the traffic junction in front of the station.

258
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,180
I'll wait for you until you come.

259
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,030
She's not coming.

260
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,230
I'll speak with you on her behalf.

261
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,640
Big bro.
