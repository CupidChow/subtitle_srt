That was the first time in my life

00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,070
I felt pretty wearing makeup.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,300
We'll talk after you properly clean off that filthy face.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,630
Throw this away.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,830
If this goes on, you'll no longer be the Miku I love.

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,040
Got it.

00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,740
We're setting up a stall there. Come visit if you're free.

00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,950
- Haru-kun?
- Who is he?

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,880
He's the one who invited me to the flea market.

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,760
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,050
I'm Miku's boyfriend.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,250
Hi there.

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,380
My name is Takakura Eve. Nice to meet you.

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,010
Haru-kun, Eve-kun is...

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,210
Miku, was he the one who helped you put that makeup on?

17
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,110
The other day, you mentioned a boy in drag put it on for you,

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,120
so I figured it was him.

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,970
Miku-san, there's a place I want to take you. Are you free?

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,210
Sure. Let's go.

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,430
Sorry, Eve-kun.

22
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,490
Thanks for showing me around today.

23

Miku-san!

24
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,650
I'll text you again.

25
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,060
Okay.

26
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,020
Haru-kun, I thought you were on a work trip?

27
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,820
It was postponed at the last minute.

28
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,830
- I see.
- That's why I thought I'd give you a surprise.

29
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,640
"A surprise"?

30
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,970
But you surprised me instead.

31
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,690
You weren't home. I didn't expect you'd go to the flea market, Miku.

32
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,100
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:19,100
I was concerned about calling and possibly disturbing you at work.

34
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,990
Don't be.

35
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,400
But I'd appreciate you reporting your actions to me moving forward.

36
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,680
Okay, got it.

37
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,810
I'm off to make the rounds and greet the other booths.

There are all kinds of people in this world, aren't there?

40
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,960
Of course.

41

If everyone were the same, your self-worth would decline, wouldn't it?

42

That's true, but...

43

Sorry, most of our stuff is already sold out.

Is that so?

I... I mean your complexion.

54
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,700
Thank you, but this is partly thanks to makeup.

55

You're wearing makeup?

56
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,980
Yes. Makeup is the most familiar form of art to me.

00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,690

60

I made reservations for dinner there.

I thought it would delight you, Miku.

62
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,060
Please watch your step.

63
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,170

64
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,970
Well, I'm a little nervous.

65

I... I feel so underdressed.

66
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,430
That can't be helped.

67
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,760
We would've been late if you'd gone home to change.

68
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,170
It's fine. I don't mind the attire.

69
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,170
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

70
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,590
I'm really sorry about what I did the other night.

When that guy helped you put on your makeup.

73
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,770
Miku, I got upset when I heard a man had put makeup on for you.

74
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,260
What?

75
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,700
Just the thought of another guy touching your skin

76
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,350
made me want to clean it off immediately.

77
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,270
I'm really sorry.

78
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,650
No, I'm sorry as well.

Eve-kun is basically like a girl to me.

80
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,510
I befriended him because I thought we could get along as girlfriends.

81
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,240
But... Haru-kun, you didn't like that, did you?

82
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,590
You don't need to apologize, Miku.

83

You're really cute, Miku.

91

They feel quite a bit of pressure as the family's breadwinner.

That's why, as women, we must support them.

What's the point of asking advice from someone who has devoted her life to her boyfriend?

181
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,830
I heard the news, Yuzuhara-san!

182
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,620
You're engaged?

183
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,770
Yes, I am.

184
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,370
Will you be quitting your job then?

185
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,530
How nice. I wish I could quit my job soon, too.

186
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,630
You want to quit, Tani-san?

187
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,680
I thought this was a calling for you.

188
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,740
Well, I don't hate the job.

189
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,990
But even if I continue doing this, I'm only a temporary receptionist with no career progression.

190
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,980
Yuzuhara-san, you've also been a temporary employee since graduation, right?

191
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,020
Then again, you had plans to start a family. I guess temp work was better for you.

192
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,750
That's not it. I just couldn't get a full-time job anywhere else.

193
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,640
What? Really?

194
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,220
Yes.

195
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:30,560
I feel you'd be better off devoting yourself to the family, rather than building a career, Miku.

196
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,540
But then...

197
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,040
I've also been planning for our future together.

198
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,740
Haru-kun...

199
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,120
And it's easier to quit your job if you're a temporary worker.

200
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,230
You don't have to work so hard, Miku.

201
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,960
If Haru-kun hadn't proposed to me,

202
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,500
what would I be doing with my life?

203
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,340
Yuzuhara-san, aren't you clocking out?

204
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,700
Sorry, I was spacing out a bit.

205
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,150
- You must be tired.
- Not at all.

206
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,860
I'll get going first.

207
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,840
See you.

208
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,710
Be it my job, my future,

209
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,770
or my makeup, he's been the one making the decisions.

210
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:37,460
There's not one thing in my life that I've ever decided for myself.

211
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,610
Not ever.

212
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,200
No, wait.

213
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,110
I made that choice myself.

214
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,540
Even then...

215
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,200
[I'm sorry, Eve-kun... I can't keep in touch with you anymore. Miku]

216
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,810
[Make Up with Mud]

217
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,930
I'm done for the day. You may go in.

218
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,980
Wait!

219
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,600
I came because I wanted to speak with you, Eve-kun.

220
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,180
I am really sorry.

221
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,200
It was very rude of me

222
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,540
to part ways with you like that, Eve-kun.

223
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,290
Thank you.

224
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,570
Anyone would have done what you did, Miku-san.

225
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,320
You chose to respect your boyfriend's feelings.

226
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,420
That's all right.

227
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,190
You see...

228
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,680
I don't think I've made any choices at all.

229
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,440
I was afraid... of being disliked.

230
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,450
So I was doing only what my boyfriend wanted.

231
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,080
I thought that

232
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,890
he would make me happy if I did.

233
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,320
However...

234
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,960
when you helped me put on that makeup...

235
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,640
This may sound like an exaggeration,

236
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,360
but I felt I was seeing a whole new world.

237
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,840
♫ Unable to affirm myself ♫

238
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,940
♫ I'm always looking for the right color ♫

239
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,770
♫ Days passed by without me realizing ♫

240
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,250
For the first time in my life,

241
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,230
I found something that I liked.

242
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,450
That's why I don't want to so readily discard something...

243
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,370
I chose for myself.

244
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,060
I hope...

245
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,190
to let my boyfriend know exactly how I feel.

246
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,670
And also...

247
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,520
♫ You might not understand if I stay silent ♫

248
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,480
I hope that...

249
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,300
we can still remain friends, Eve-kun.

250
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,490
♫ We'll be the best couple ♫

251
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,780
So...

252
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,620
when I get home, I plan to talk to him about all this.

253
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,660
Sorry for that long monologue.

254
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,140
It's okay.

255
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,010
I also want us to remain friends, Miku-san.

256
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,800
Besides, it doesn't matter whether something suits you or not.

257
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,860
At the end of the day, everyone has their own standards.

258
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,090
So be free to choose what you really like.

259
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,840
Come on,

260
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,980
let's put on that red lipstick,

261
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,510
to commemorate your resolve.

262
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,150
♫ Those pure eyes that genuinely see what's inside ♫

263
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,190
Okay.

264
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,080
♫ Just be yourself; always lean on me ♫

265
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,370
♫ Don't forget... ♫

266
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,480
Don't you think you're being a bit too selfish?

267
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,740
You promised you wouldn't meet or contact him anymore,

268
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,700
and now you're asking me to let you both remain friends.

269
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,050
I...

270
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,750
On top of that,

271
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,710
I told you to discard this, didn't I?

272
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,910
You've been lying to me all this time, Miku.

273
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,610
I'm not exactly lying...

274
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,130
Then why do you still have this lipstick you supposedly threw away?

275
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,880
You see...

276
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,760
I actually quite enjoy wearing makeup.

277
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:05,810
When I see my reflection in the mirror, it's slightly different from my usual self.

278
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,720
Well,

279
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,850
I like that brief moment of glamour.

280
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,310
Go on.

281
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:20,890
Of course, I want to be the kind of girlfriend you would love, Haru-kun.

282
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,610
However,

283
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,780
I hope you will also come to love the part of me I love about myself...

284
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,250
Then can you wipe off that filthy lipstick first before talking to me?

285
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:47,660
That red lipstick not only doesn't suit you; it also makes you look indecent.

286
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,040
You look like you've been fooling around with other men.

287
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,420
Why the harsh words?

288
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,410
I'm telling you this for your sake, Miku.

289
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,570
Do you really want to keep wearing something you like even though it doesn't suit you?

290
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,250
Miku, I love you as you are now.

291
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,040
I hope you will remain the pure Miku that I love.

292
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,220
I...

293
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,000
don't want to stay like this.

294
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,300
I don't want to belittle myself

295
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,340
and avoid doing things I want to try. I'm sick of that part of me.

296
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,190
So...

297
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,040
Haru-kun, I'm not done talking.

298
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,730
Haru-kun?

299
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,530
I don't want to share a home with a girl who can't listen to her boyfriend.

300
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,770
So go sleep on your own tonight.
