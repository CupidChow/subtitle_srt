Hope you weren't waiting long.

[Please give me some time to think about our future. Miku]

80
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,790
I assumed you wanted to call off our engagement one-sidedly

81
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,430
and that you were cheating on me with your "friend."

82
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,100
That's not true!

83
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,300
If I had wanted to call off the engagement,

84
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,240
I would have left the engagement ring with the note.

85
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,960
It's just...

86
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,890
If we left things as they were, I couldn't see a life for me here with you.

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,340
I expressed that in my note.

90
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,950

But not only were you uncertain about marriage; you slyly took off with the ring, too.

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,560
And if you're not planning to break up with me, at least decide on a date to return.

Besides, the reason you're now like this

100
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,360
is because you've hooked up with another guy, right?

101
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,120
You're clearly cheating on me, as I see it.

105

109
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,300
Maybe I started liking them

110

afraid you'd leave me one day, Miku.

115
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,700

117

Miku, how do you view lawyers?

119
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,380

Well, I mean,

174
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,280
Nee-chan is really slow and a bit self-centered.

175
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,660
Won't she unconsciously hurt you at times?

176
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,280
I've never regarded Miku-san in that way.

Like you said, she may have unknowingly hurt me at times, Souta-kun.

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:35,140
But I feel that Miku-san is the kind of person who openly accepts her weaknesses.

180
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,770
And I think she is strong.

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,440
Is that so?

184
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,480
If it was Miku-san's decision to return,

185
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,060
that's probably best for her.

[Yuuki]

187
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,220
Miku?

188
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,630
Haru-kun.

189
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,140
Thank you

190
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,480
for coming home.

191

About Yuzuhara-chan,

192
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,820
she moved back in with her boyfriend, right?

193
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,050
What's wrong? You feel hurt?

194
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,370
I'm frustrated that she moved back,

195
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,010
but I can kind of understand how her boyfriend felt.

196
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,470
What? In what way?

197
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,750
I admit that Miku-san may be vulnerable,

198
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,490
but she never shies away from it.

199
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,370
She's carefree when you let her be herself.

200
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,240
It seems easy to control her, but it's not.

201
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,880
Her boyfriend must've felt that and panicked,

202
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,740
which led him to hurt her.

203
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,290
What?

204
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,140
Jeez.

205
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,200
Love... is such a troublesome thing, isn't it?

206
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,550
Aren't you having too much fun, Manager?

207
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,010
Of course, I am. Plenty!

208

- Excuse me, may I take a look inside this?

209
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,220
Sure, coming.

210
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,360
I'm not lying. It hurts.

Haru-kun, you still haven't finished your work?

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,600
Not yet. But I'm almost done.

232

In the past, whenever anything happened to me,

233
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,830
Haru-kun would drop everything and rush to me.

Back then, I felt so fortunate

240
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,600
to have a boyfriend like him.

241
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,450

Your hair is really pretty, Miku.

246

You've always been fond of my hair, haven't you?

247
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,650
Yeah.

I like it. It's so you, Miku.

when we had just started dating,

252
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,200
you curled your hair for me once, remember?

253

I tried curling my hair today.

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,910
I prefer the usual you.

255
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,890
At the time,

256
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,870
you made the effort to doll yourself up for me.

257
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,250
But I said those words to put you down.

258
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,320
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,090
I just didn't want you to damage your pretty hair,

260
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,440
especially with things like dyes or curls.

261
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,830
When that guy put on makeup for you...

262
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,890
I thought, "Miku looks prettiest without makeup."

263
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,970
"Why would she do such an unnecessary thing?"

264
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,550
And again the night we fought.

265
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,060
The old you had been so gentle, Miku.

266
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,620
I wondered why you'd become so stubborn, and I got angry.

267
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,950
I was afraid.

268
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,150
I thought you'd turn into a Miku I didn't recognize.

269
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,050
So I wanted to tie you to me,

270
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,970
even at the cost of hurting you.

271
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,910
But...

if I refuse to accept these changes of yours,

273
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,740
you'll no longer want to be with me.

I'm sorry.

I won't hurt you ever again...

278
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,060
or tie you down for any reason.

I'm sure he's just...
