is filthy.

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,860
Because makeup is akin to mud.

00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,680
You're only making yourself pretty

Miku,

11
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,610
your makeup looks different today.

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,140
- You noticed?
- Yes.

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,950
It's the first time I've seen you in red lipstick.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,710
My senior at work commented on it.

Do I look weird?

You look like a junior high student with thick makeup who's trying too hard.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,870
Hey. "A junior high student"? But I'm already 25.

19
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,290
Sorry.

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,690
But if I were a customer,

21
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,810
I'd prefer to be served by a naturally cute girl than one who looks gaudy.

A junior high student with thick makeup?

24
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,620
I admit I do look childish and plain,

25
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,790
but don't you think that's harsh?

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,920
It doesn't matter, as long as your boyfriend likes your face.

I don't like him because he's a lawyer.

I'd appreciate it.

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,660

Rather than whether I like a certain color,

I'm more concerned about how my partner feels about the color I choose.

116

I understand.

117

You can't help but worry about how others will judge your look.

Yes.

123
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,150
Even the same lipstick color can change the way you look, depending on its texture and how you apply it.

I made friends with a girl today...

155

181
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,170
They're forcing ideals on their employees.

182
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,160
That's an abuse of authority.

183
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,940
But...

184
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,570
Miku, it must be hard on you to work for such a company.

185
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,260
But you see, I'm seriously thinking about us getting married.

186
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,500
Haru-kun.

187
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,340
Come sit with me.

188
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,760
Sure.

189
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,100
So, Miku...

190
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,750
throw this away.

191
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,710
I'm scared

192
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,630
that if this goes on, you'll no longer be the Miku I love.

193
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,150
So throw this away and promise me

194
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,280
you'll remain the clean and pure Miku I love.

195
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,140
Got it.

[Gallery Cafe Slow Glow]

197
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,030
Onee-san, it's you!

198
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,980
I didn't think we'd meet again.

199
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,280
You are...

200
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,490
It's me, Eve.

201
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,370
You're... that Eve-kun?

202
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,440
I am.

203
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,740
I'm wearing a man's outfit today.

204
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,840
Here, come on in.

205
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,310
So this store is where you work?

206
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,230
As a part-timer, though.

207
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,710
So what did your boyfriend say about your makeup yesterday?

208
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,330
He was okay with it, I guess.

209
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,790
I see.

210
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,820
Perhaps my makeup skills weren't good enough.

211
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,190
No, that's not true at all.

212
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,340
In that case, should we have another go with that lipstick?

213
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,420
I keep a few of that same model.

214
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,230
Though it's a budget item, its color is vibrant, right?

215
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,690
Yes.

216
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,340
But...

217
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,010
I'll have to give this up.

218
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,350
You're throwing it away?

219
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,790
Did it irritate your lips?

220
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:09,060
My boyfriend wants me to remain pure-looking.

221
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:18,780
I also felt that this color didn't suit me anyway.

222
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,040
I figure I'll go along with whatever he likes.

223
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,670
What do you mean?

224
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,880
Are you giving up on makeup because your boyfriend doesn't like it

225
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,840
or because you don't like it?

226
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,560
When I saw you looking in the mirror yesterday, you were glowing with happiness.

227
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,230
But you see, he's thinking about marrying me...

228
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,860
It's not right.

229
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,570
You shouldn't sacrifice yourself for him.

230
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,080
I'm sorry.

231
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,230
I got a little carried away.

232
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,320
Anyway, even if you get married, you should live your own life.

233
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,690
Oh, right.

234
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,860

Yes.

We're setting up a stall there. Come visit if you're free.

- Welcome back.

Yes, I have.

I got your suit from the dry cleaners too.

243
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,960
You left the collection slip at the entrance today, didn't you?

00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,470
Thanks.

245
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,590
I figured you'd help pick it up even if I didn't tell you to, Miku.

What's wrong?

247

Nothing.

248

Say, Haru-kun.

249
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,930
Are you free this Sunday?

250
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,720
I have a work trip, if I remember correctly.

251
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,270
Is that so.

A flea market?

253
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,120
Yes.

254
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,150
I was hoping we could go there together.

255
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,710
I thought you didn't like going to flea markets.

256
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,790
I never said that.

257
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,090
Flea markets are usually crowded with people.

258
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,070
You'll only get tired out if you go.

Oh, sorry.

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,990
But a friend will be setting up a stall there, so...

262
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,660
I'm telling you this for your sake.

263
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,940
It's your day off, so take the time to rest.

264

You're right.

265
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,980
I won't go then.

266

That's the right thing to do.

277
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,820
So sorry. Our products are all one-of-a-kind.

Jeez, Takakura.

289
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,900
Does all that praise mean you want a break?

290
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,430
- Yes, ma'am.
- How cunning!

291
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,850
But fine, you'll have it. Go enjoy the break, you two.

292
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,250
- Sorry to disturb.
- No worries.

293
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,950
Onee-san, can I call you by your name?

294
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,810
Sure.

295
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,330
Yes!

296
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,170
Can we also exchange contacts?

297
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,930
Yes, of course.

298
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Hey, want to try on some hair extensions?

299
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,880
They're easy to wear and remove. You can dress up on your days off.

300
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,060
Oh, no way.

301
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,780
I do agree they are rather stylish,

302
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,390
but my boyfriend doesn't like such flashy stuff.

303
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,850
Besides, this sort of thing really doesn't suit my personality.

304
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,190
They don't match my clothes or hair either.

305
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,060
That's not true.

306
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,830
Being stylish is when you're free to have fun.

307
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,680
Don't worry about it not matching your personality or appearance.

308
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,390
You shouldn't put yourself down and restrict yourself like that.

309
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,220
If anything, I think you're rather charming, Miku-san.

310
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,370
So you should have fun just being yourself.

311
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,330
Come, try it on.

312
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,100
- What are you doing?
- Now's the chance.

313
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,600
Stop taking pictures. I'm serious.

314
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,540
That stall looks interesting.

315
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,160
I'm starting to develop this habit of being self-deprecating.

316
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,360
By doing so, I can avoid causing any trouble

317
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,310
and protect myself.

318
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,940
But Eve-kun is different.

319
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,030

00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,830
Haru-kun?

322
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,030
Why are you here?

323
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,020
I couldn't find you at home.

324
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,390
So I figured you'd be here.

325
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,500
I'm sorry.

326
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,670
So...

00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,660
who is he?

328
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,340
He's the one who invited me to the flea market.

329
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,220
Nice to meet you.

00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,570
