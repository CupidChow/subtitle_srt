00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,750
I like you. I like you the way you are, bright and dazzling.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,580
I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,910
If you're willing to move back in with me,

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,700
I'll go along with whatever you want.

Nee-chan has moved back to live with her boyfriend.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,200
If it was Miku-san's decision to return,

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,710
then that's probably what's best for her.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,330
Miku, if you're going to change, then I'll try my best to make myself change for you.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,470
So don't leave me.

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,850
Haru-kun is...

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,400
as vulnerable as I am.

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,330
Here. Take it.

13
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,780
I thought this lipstick color would suit you.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,580
Miku, if you're going to change,

15
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,070
then I'll try my best to make myself change for you.

16
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,840
So...

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,530
don't leave me.

[Make Up with Mud: Episode 6]

19
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,690
I think I can come home early today.

20
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,890
That's great to hear.

21
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,590
To be honest, I've already prepped for dinner tonight.

22
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,490
Let me guess. Roast beef?

23
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,630
Bingo!

24
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,460
I figured you'd be craving it since it's been a while, Haru-kun.

25
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,620
No wonder you woke up so early.

26
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,680
Thanks.

27
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,290
Yuzuhara-san, I noticed you haven't been wearing that red lipstick.

28
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,560
It's like you're back to wearing your old make up.

29
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,840
I am. For a change, that's all.

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,940
I see.

31
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,710
I thought your boyfriend had stopped you from wearing it again.

32
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,350
No, not at all.

33
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,910
Lately, he's starting to accept the things I like.

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,250
I'm glad to hear that.

35
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,680
I was honestly scared for you when I first heard about the compensation and stuff.

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,540
Anyway, it's great that you both talked it out.

37
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,590
Thanks for your concern.

38
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,990
Sorry to make you worry.

Haru-kun hasn't objected to anything.

41
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,380
- See you.
- See you.

42
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,250
See you. Bye.

43
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,800
It'll be okay.

Our relationship is on the mend.

45
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,530
The make up plays the supporting role.

46

You play the main role.

the very thing I'm passionate about,

51
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,450
so that I can patch things up with Haru-kun, again?

52
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,590
Hey, Takakura-kun!

53
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,830
Sorry to keep you waiting.

54
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,610

Misaki caught a cold, Nana made plans with her boyfriend,

Goto got called into work,

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,600
and Madoka had to take care of her sick goldfish.

59
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,090
In other words, the rest can't come?

That's how it is.

61
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,210
Okay then. Let's go.

62
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,130
What shall we buy?

63
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,460
- Lipstick. Yup.
- Lipstick? Good idea.

64
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,580
What color should I get?

65
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,710
- Pink, maybe.
- Pink? Will it suit me?

66
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,520
The color is like this. It looks quite sheer.

I'm looking for lipstick.

71
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,370
What colors are you looking at?

72
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,830
I'm looking for something on the reddish side.

73
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,670
- Red?
- Yes.

74
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,310
Right this way then.

75
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,020
Thank you.

76
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,980
This is the sheer matte series.

77
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:16,460
It has a smooth and moist texture, and the color can last for a long time.

78
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,610
They're so pretty.

79
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,020
For this orange-red one, it's the only one that...

80
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,910
I didn't know there were so many kinds of red lipstick.

81
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:35,220
There's a deep red, a brownish-red, and even an orange-red.

82
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,350
They're all red, yet a little different from one another.

83
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,460
What kind of red do I like?

84
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,020
Well...

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,910
May I try on this one?

86
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,710
Of course.

87
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,320
- Let me put it on for you.
- Okay.

88
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,750
What do you do in your free time, Takakura-kun?

89
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,560
I'm kind of busy with my part-time job lately.

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,730
Oh? What kind of part-time job?

91
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,340
I'm a store assistant at a gallery cafe.

92
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,020
Can I visit you there some time?

93
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,090
Sure.

94
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,490
It's a really nice shop, so come and visit with the rest.

95
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,050
- With the rest? Thanks.
- Yes.

96
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,120
Takakura-kun?

97
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,940
Shall we take a look over there?

98
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,480
Thank you, Takakura-kun.

No problem. Glad that I could be of help.

You see... I had a lot of fun today.

102
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,700
Could we go out again sometime?

103
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,310
Sorry.

104
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,490
Thought so too. I'm a nuisance, aren't I?

105
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,080
No, you're not a nuisance.

106
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,420
It's just that...

107
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,690
there's someone that I like.

108
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,250
So I can't go out with you anymore.

109
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,710
Not someone you're interested in?

110
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,090
No. Someone I like.

111
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,310
Then I guess this won't work out, huh?

112
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,020
Good luck, Takakura-kun.

He barely takes care of our daughter,

117
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,060
and now he says he wants custody over her?

118
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,670
Ridiculous.

You have not engaged in any acts of infidelity, have you?

123
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,870
Excuse me?

124
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,750
We need to be informed in advance of any circumstances

125
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,210
that may be disadvantageous to your case in court.

126
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,860

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,610
No, I have not.

- Yes.
-  Haru, your mom is super cool.

131
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,940
Nah, that's normal.

132
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,180
Wow! Did you cook this by yourself, Haruhisa?

133
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,860
Yes. Because you said you'll be home late and I'm sick of takeout.

Thank you, sweetie!

It's a sign of gratitude.

137
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,200
After all, red lipstick is a mighty weapon used to fight in a male-dominated world.

Hello, this is the Yuuki residence.

141
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,680
Got it.

142
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,840
Wanna speak to Mom?

143
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,350
No need?

146
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,360

You use work as an excuse to avoid coming home!

151
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,540
Haruhisa and I would have been happier

152

if you had quit your job, and became a housewife.

153
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,810
How nice it must be, to know you can rely on the husband's income if things came down to it.

154

Are you going to take the loss like that?

159
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,660
Why did you reject that lady's request?

160
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,050
She lied about not cheating on her husband.

161
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,160
How did you know that she was lying?

162
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,410
Well...

163
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,010
One look at her face, and I could tell.

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,730
- Thank you.
- No problem.

- Which floor?
- First floor.

- I'm 27.
- For real? Then we're peers.

- Excuse me?
- I was born in March. A Pisces.

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,710
Stop it!

181
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,430
Don't talk to me ever again. It's disgusting.

182
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,480
I bought it.

183
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,020
It's so pretty.

184
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,980
If I use this lipstick,

185
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,390
I may want to wear heavier eye make up.

186
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,300
Guess I'll get some eye shadow next time.

187
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,560
I can't stop admiring it.

188
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,460
[Yuki Law Office]

189
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,630
Hello? What's up?

190
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,700
What were you up to just now?

191
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,940
I bought a new tube of lipstick.

192
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,400
It's my first time getting a high-end brand.

193
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,690
It looked pretty,

194
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,180
I couldn't help but stop to admire it.

195
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,250
Say, can you come over to my office now?

196
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,980
Why?

197
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,920
I feel like going out to eat today.

198
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,340
I found a nice restaurant.

199
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,090
Miku, if you can come over now, we can eat out together.

200
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:11,710
In that case, I'll have the roast beef for lunch tomorrow.

201
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,440
It's my day off anyway.

202
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,220
Sounds good. You do that.

203
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,300
Let me know when you arrive.

204
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,130
"You do that"?

205
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,360
Haru-kun...

206
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,280
This...

207
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,740
is the me now.

208
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,220
Sorry to keep you waiting.

209
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,850
Shall we go?

210
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,780
Haru-kun? Are you listening?

211
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,890
Yeah, I am.

212
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,600
Tani-san is getting married, right?

213
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,350
No. The one getting married is my chief, Watanabe-san.

214
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,690
I heard the news from Tani-san.

215
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,300
Is that so? Sorry.

216
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,190
Say, Haru-kun...

217
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,640
Yes?

218
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,820
What do you think of my makeup today?

219
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,400
You're asking me?

220
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,680
You didn't look like that when I left this morning.

221
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,300
Did you wear it on purpose?

222
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,460
That's right.

223
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,440
Haru-kun, I wanted you...

224
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,970
to accept me.

225
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,990
To see me, the way I really am.

226
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,020
So I changed my make up on purpose.

227
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,750
Please excuse me.

228
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,330
Here is your vegetable salad.

229
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,810
What's with that tone of speech?

230
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,390
I am accepting you the way you are.

231
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,120
Don't make it sound like I object to it.

232
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,410
But...

233
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,730
you don't like it, do you?

234
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,480
Even if you don't say it out loud,

235
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:31,720
it hurts to see that look of disgust whenever you see my face.

236
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,430
It feels lonely,

237
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,570
even though we've been together all this time.

238
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,350
It makes me feel empty.

239
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,240
This doesn't feel like you've whole-heartedly accepted me at all.

240
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,870
I'm sorry, Haruhisa.

241
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,320
I feel so lonely with this kind of life.

242
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,290
I feel so empty.

243
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,310
I can't stand it anymore.

244
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,510
I hate it.

245
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,290
That red lipstick...

246
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,400
I don't want you to wear such a vile color, Miku.

247
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,320
Cosmetics are used to hide your unfavorable true nature, right?

248
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Lipstick...

249
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,050
easily gets smeared everywhere.

250
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,030
It's a nuisance.

251
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,770
When you eat, it gets onto the tableware and dirties it.

252
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,420
It makes me uncomfortable.

253
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,220
You put a lot of makeup on...

254
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,110
It's only a plaster of lies, to make yourself pretty on the outside.

255
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,950
In other words...

256
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,190
Haru-kun, you've been feeling uncomfortable...

257
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,490
this whole dinner.

258
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,600
- That's not it.
- Haru-kun.

259
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,170
You're quite self-centered, you know that?

260
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,200
You didn't care if I felt hurt.

261
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,030
You were more concerned for your own comfort.

262
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,300
You're always putting yourself above others, after all.

263
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,460
- Like I said, it's not what I meant ー
- Forget it.

264
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,220
I'm leaving.

265
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,280
I don't want to make you any more uncomfortable than you already are.

266
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,890
Wait, Miku!

267
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,120
Miku!

268
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,250
Wait, Miku.

269
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,220
I'm sorry.

270
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,650
I didn't intend to hurt you, Miku.

271
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,360
Haru-kun...

272
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,570
You see,

273
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,100
today, when I bought the lipstick color that I liked,

274
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,780
I was really happy.

275
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:42,140
To be honest, I don't care whether it suits me or not.

276
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,300
It's just...

277
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,900
when I see myself in the mirror,

278
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,520
my mood lightens up.

279
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,780
I feel happy.

280
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,310
But then...

281
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,770
we met up for dinner.

282
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,940
And those feelings of happiness...

283
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,490
all disappeared.

284
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,970
♫ Unable to affirm myself ♫

285
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,620
It happens all the time.

286
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,250
Haru-kun, every time I'm with you,

287
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,990
my excitement...

288
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,870
my happiness...

289
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,010
They always get trampled on.

290
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,500
♫ Sorry that I never talk much ♫

291
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,410
♫ My frustration is proportional to my feelings for you ♫

292
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,330
Haru-kun.

293
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,020
Please break up with me.

294
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,620
♫ You might not understand if I stay silent ♫

295
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,490
Please...

296
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,630
don't smear my heart with mud any further.

297
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,240
♫ No matter how many times I try, I'll never make a mistake ♫
