00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,660
If you want to marry me, cut off all ties with him now.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,180
I'm sorry, Eve-kun.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,900
I don't want to let him down, so I can't keep in touch with you anymore.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,260
There's not one thing in my life that I've ever decided for myself.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,870
I don't want to so readily discard something I chose for myself.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,990
Let's put on that red lipstick, to commemorate your resolve.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:26,640
I hope you will also come to love the part of me I love about myself...

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,350
Can you wipe off that filthy lipstick first before talking to me?

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,310
I don't want to avoid doing things I want to try. I'm sick of that part of me.

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,030
Haru-kun?

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,380
I don't want to share a home with a girl who can't listen to her boyfriend.

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,030
So go sleep on your own tonight.

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,980
Haru-kun, wait!

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,940
[Yuuki]

15
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,640
I'm such an idiot.

16
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,840
Oh, it's the girl from the flea market.

17
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,700
What happened? There's blood on your lips!

18
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,060
Wait, it's just lipstick?

19
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,810
You scared me!

20
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,960
What did you do to smudge it like that?

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,290
Well, I...

22
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,240
I had a fight with my boyfriend.

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,280
- What?
- So I figured I'd look for a hotel for the night.

24
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,380
Hang on a second.

25
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,330
Your boyfriend chased you out? At this hour?

26
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,750
He didn't exactly chase me out.

27
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,950
Anyway, let's go to my place for now.

28
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,080
It's fine. Let's go.

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,960

- No "buts."

30
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,510
Here you go.

31
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,640
Thank you.

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,130
Have you calmed down somewhat?

33
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,640
Yes.

34
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,540
So sorry to trouble you at such a late hour.

35
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,060
Don't be.

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,620
I live upstairs.

37
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,890
You can stay for the night.

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,640
I'll call you up once I've prepped your bed.

39
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,260
No, I've caused you enough trouble.

40
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,280
It's dangerous to be out looking for a hotel this late at night.

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,360
Well, but...

42
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,160
Miku-san!

43
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,230
Eve-kun?

44
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,220
Takakura, I'm going upstairs to tidy up.

45
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,980
You stay here and keep her company.

46
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,030
Are you okay?

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,470
I...

48
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,390
I told him how I felt.

49
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,550
I told him everything.

50
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,320
Honestly...

51
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,800
I was hoping he would...

52
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,910
accept me the way I am.

53
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,580
I thought if I explained myself to him...

54
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,900
he would understand.

55
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,300
But I was too naive.

56
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,510
He...

57
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,110
He got really angry.

58
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,480
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:11,540
Eve-kun, you helped me apply that lipstick so vibrantly,

60
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,930
but I ruined it in the end.

61
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,100
Miku-san.

62
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,520
Maybe...

63
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,820
I shouldn't have told him, after all.

64
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,570
I'm so foolish.

65
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,620
I didn't think ahead.

66
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,340
Why?

67
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,890
Why would it be foolish to want the person you love

68
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,040
to accept you as you are?

69
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,300
It takes courage to accept yourself for who you are.

70
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,300
It takes even more courage to tell someone else.

71
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,330
You should be proud of being able to do all that, Miku-san!

72
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,460
So why are you blaming yourself?

73
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,890
When someone you live with chases you out of the house,

74
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,970
that's no longer a fight; it's abuse.

75
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,690
You should be angry at him for your own sake!

76
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,160
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,100
You're always quick to apologize, Miku-san.

78
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,470
But has there been anything you really need to apologize for?

79
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,250
You may think that by stepping back,

80
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,950
you're able to avoid any conflict.

81
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,440
But to me, that's just running from the problem.

82
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,730
Don't run away from standing up for yourself.

Go and take a shower.

86
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,870
Well...

87
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,860
Sorry that I shouted at you.

88
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,860
I'll be heading out.

89
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,780
Rest well.

Good morning.

95
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,200
Did you rest well?

96
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,720
I did.

97
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,710
I'm really sorry for all the trouble I've caused.

98
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,570
Hang on. I wouldn't have brought you here if it was too much trouble. All right?

and have a talk with my boyfriend again.

Will everything be all right?

105

He was just upset.

124
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,790
I don't think he really meant what he said.

125
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,640
So, any word from him since then?

126
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,190
He should have apologized by now, right?

127
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,120
Well, not yet.

128
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,750
He probably is also feeling confused right now.

So you have an interest in art, Souta-kun?

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,600
There are many ways to express ourselves.

168
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,580
And I believe there's a world out there

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,580
beyond our own logic...

"Feel sorry"?

182
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,370
Does he mean that I am entirely at fault?

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
You should be angry at him for your own sake!

184
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,730
Don't run away from standing up for yourself.

[Eve-kun]

186
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,530
Miku-san, what's wrong?

187
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,190
I...

188
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,700
I think I'm going to get angry.

189
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,110
Can you help me, Eve-kun?

190
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,270
[Make Up with Mud]

191
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,180
Miku-san!

192
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Sorry to keep you waiting.

193
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,640
I'm sorry for suddenly asking you to meet me.

194
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,810
Did something happen between you and your boyfriend?

195
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,500
Take a look at this.

196
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,140
[Do you feel sorry now? I've left the key in the mailbox.]

197
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,090
That's all?

198
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,270
He didn't even apologize for chasing you out.

199
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,300
Why did he make it seem like it's all my fault?

200
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,310
The thought of it just irritates me.

201
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,780
I really don't know what to do.

202
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,380
Sorry.

203
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,450
I didn't mean to call you out to listen to me complain.

204
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,980
I guess I shouldn't get angry over something as trivial as this.

205
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,350
Of course you should!

206
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:02,920
In fact, I've been angry at your boyfriend since yesterday,

207
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,240
but I figured my personal feelings on the matter were pointless.

208
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,210
You were angry at him?

209
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,280
Come with me.

210
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,600
I'll take you somewhere you can be angry, Miku-san.

211
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,900
Let's go.

212
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,680
Place your right hand at the bottom and left hand on top.

213
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,890
Then get ready.

214
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,060
And just hit the ball that's flying toward you.

215
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,960
That's it?

216
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,390
Yes. Being angry and baseball batting are similar.

217
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,970
You must practice to master them.

218
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,570
The ball is coming.

219
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,840
W-Wait a minute.

220
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,270
The ball is like your anger toward your boyfriend.

221
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,660
Come on, hit it back!

222
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,900
This is all too sudden.

223
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,000
That's unfair!

224
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,340
You think so?

225
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,900
Isn't it also unfair of your boyfriend to chase you out of the house in the middle of the night?

226
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,850
All right, the next one is coming.

227
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,840
- No way!
- Don't take your eyes off the ball!

228
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,370
But...

229
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,970
Don't run away from the ball.

230
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,920
Onee-san, you're too nice to your boyfriend.

231
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,640
Let go of that weakness called love.

232
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,700
I can't focus properly.

233
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,450
But it's true.

234
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,920
You shouldn't give in to everything just because you love him.

235
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,130
Hasn't he ever done something you'd consider unforgivable if he were a stranger?

236
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,550
We'll talk after you properly clean off that filthy face.

237
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,950
The other day...

238
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,160
Haru-kun treated me like a filthy thing.

239
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,920
I was really afraid...

240
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,340
and hurt.

241
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,570
Why are you so obsessed with how I wear my makeup?

242
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,320
That red lipstick not only doesn't suit you; it also makes you look indecent.

243
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,680
"Indecent"? That's only what you think!

244
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,150
You hit it!

245
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,300
That's awesome, Miku-san!

246
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,110
"Feel sorry"? Are you trying to discipline me?

247
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,100
Throwing money at me? That's crazy!

248
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,730
Who do you think I am?

249
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,850
I'm also human, standing on equal ground with you!

250
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,760
You keep telling me it's for my sake,

251
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,500
but really you do it for yourself.

252
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,600
Feel better?

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,850

254

it's painful.

256
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,430
I finally realize...

257
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,200
what I don't like about Haru-kun.

258
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,010

260
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:05,550
Turning a blind eye to it all must have hurt.

261
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,780
But you have to speak up if it's painful.

262
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,600
If he hurts you, you should be angry and tell him to stop.

263
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,480
If you don't do that to protect yourself,

264
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,530
