57
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,360
thank you for the trouble.

58
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,430
What's with the courtesy?

59
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,630
Oh yeah, wait here.

60
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,160
Here, try this.

61
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,040
I made this for you.

62
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,120
It must've cost a lot.

63
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
It's nothing.

64
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,360
I haven't been with you
for these two years.

65
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,800
And you didn't get yourself

66
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,310
any new outfits at all.

67
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,720
It breaks my heart.

68
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,160
Turn two rounds and let me take a look.

69
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,270
Are you sure you want me
to turn two rounds?

70
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,800
One.

71
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,510
Two.

72
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,480
Not bad.

73
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,000
Xiuyun,

74
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,160
I know what's on your mind.

75
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,430
Ruoqian,

76
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,680
there's something
I wish to discuss with you.

77
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:35,870
Tell me.

78
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,920
But I don't know

79
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,560
if you're willing to listen to me or not.

80
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,120
We've been married for so long.

81
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,750
Of course I'm willing.

82
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,920
Say, you were a straightforward person.

83
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,190
Why are you hesitating now?

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,600
Say,

85
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,040
it's been almost three years
since we last met.

86
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,120
We were only reunited for two days.

87
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,360
And now, you're leaving tomorrow.

88
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,480
I will return immediately

89
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,750
after winning the war.

90
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,240
But you're heading
to somewhere so far away.

91
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
And you're heading to a battlefield.

92
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,750
I'm worried about you.

93
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,480
I've been doing this for
as long as I can remember.

94
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,830
There's no need to worry about me.

95
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Even so, I'm worried about you!

96
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,160
Tell me then.

97
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,600
What are you up to?

98
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,950
Why don't you bring me with you?

99
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,870
That won't do.

100
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,800
But why?

101
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,680
You're just bringing
one more person with you.

102
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,750
Why can't you do so?

103
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,680
It's a long trip.

104
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,920
And the environment in the military camp
is extremely harsh.

105
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,430
I'm afraid you might suffer there.

106
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,120
I'm not afraid of that.

107
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,270
General Yuan

108
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,070
also announced another military rule.

109
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,070
No women are allowed in the military camp.

110
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,720
They will be killed on sight.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,430
Isn't your disciple also a woman?

112
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,870
Didn't I tell you before?

113
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,360
She's putting on a man's disguise.

114
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,120
I can put on a man's disguise too.

115
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,750
That won't do.

116
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,120
Anyway,

117
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,040
no means no.

118
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,240
There's already a woman there.

119
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,560
You'll be complicating the situation
if you head there.

120
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,310
I!

121
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,390
Xiuyun.

122
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,600
Xiuyun.

123
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,120
Actually,

124
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,480
I'm already content

125
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,600
that I got to see you again.

126
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,430
If so, why are you
running around without me?

127
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,830
I'm not running around.

128
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,090
I'm heading to the border town.

129
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,020
I need to head there
to finish an important task.

130
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,340
Just wait at home

131
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,980
for my return,

132
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,770
okay?

133
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,690
Father. Mother.

134
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,460
Qi...

135
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,690
Great timing.

136
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,650
Speak up. What's the matter?

137
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,380
Third Young Master is here.

138
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,260
All right. We got it.

139
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,650
Master, I heard
that you were departing tomorrow.

140
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,570
That's why I'm here
to seek your teachings.

141
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,980
Actually, it's nothing special.

142
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,020
However, that man is cunning and devious.

143
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,340
Although you and Yuhu

144
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,530
have foiled his plots time and time again,

145
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,220
you two can't just let him
have his way all the time

146
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,530
and deal with his shenanigans

147
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,530
passively.

148
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,500
You should make your grandmother

149
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,460
realize his cunning nature
as soon as possible.

150
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,170
Master, you have a point.

151
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,650
However, he has already

152
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,740
put the Qi Residence
under his spell long ago.

153
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,500
Grandmother has complete trust in him.

154
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,620
I'm afraid she won't listen

155
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,930
to the bitter truth.

156
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,980
Master,

157
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,260
an idea suddenly sparked into my mind.

158
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,890
I want Grandmother to know
as soon as possible

159
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,170
what Ke Shizhao did

160
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,100
to Ji Jingtang's parents.

161
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,930
What do you think?

162
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,050
It's a great plan.

163
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,460
Tianlei,

164
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,570
you may execute the plan
after my departure.

165
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,620
Tianlei, thank you for

166
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,220
coming up with such a plan.

167
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,410
Third Young Master, I implore you

168
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,770
to avenge my deceased parents

169
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,260
and seek justice for them.

170
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:45,980
Jingtang,

171
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,740
the mills of Heaven grind slowly.

172
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,340
However, that day will definitely arrive.

173
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,930
Thank you, Third Young Master!

174
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,690
Please get up.

175
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,290
Spare the formalities.

176
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,770
Master,

177
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,770
please practice caution

178
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,170
when you depart tomorrow.

179
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,770
Yuhu and I shall take our leaves now.

180
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,570
Master,

181
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,290
please take care.

182
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,460
All right.

183
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,340
Take care.

184
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,340
You two should head back early.

185
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,980
Adoptive Father, Adoptive Mother, Please rest early.

186
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,890
I shall take my leave.

187
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,220
You should rest early too.

188
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,050
You think I don't know who you are?

189
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,690
How did you recognize me?

190
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,890
I'll recognize you

191
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,690
even if you were reduced to ashes.

192
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,220
This is no fun.

193
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,810
Initially, I wanted you to see

194
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,770
if I've got better at martial arts.

195
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,460
But you recognized me at first glance.

196
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:53,570
This is no fun at all.

197
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,170
I knew you were tailing me from the start.

198
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:57,980
What?

199
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,890
Do you truly intend to head to
the border town together with me?

200
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,650
Of course.

201
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,890
I never go back on my word.

202
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,140
But there are rules we must follow
in the military camp.

203
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,530
No women are allowed inside.

204
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,530
If so, I'll stay somewhere else.

205
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,690
Let's find a house
near the military camp and stay there.

206
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,650
Mind you, that's a military camp.

207
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,890
There are no houses nearby.

208
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,220
I don't care.

209
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,690
I'll follow you wherever you go.

210
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,690
I truly don't know what to do with you.

211
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,620
So, is it a yes?

212
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,180
[Qi Residence]

213
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,410
Tianlei,

214
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,050
you look distracted.

215
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,860
What's on your mind?

216
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,570
Master has agreed

217
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,100
with this plan of ours.

218
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,620
Not only can this plan

219
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,140
let Grandmother

220
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,020
know about the fact
that Ji Jingtang's family was harmed,

221
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,290
but it can also

222
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,770
make her realize Ke Shizhao's true nature.

223
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,500
If so, you shouldn't hesitate at all.

224
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,170
However, it's not an easy feat

225
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,890
to expose him.

226
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,020
Are you afraid
that Grandmother won't believe in you?

227
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,260
Grandmother believes in him more than me.

228
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,690
But why?

229
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,140
Grandmother was fond of rearing rabbits
when she was young.

230
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,050
Her favorite rabbit

231
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,020
had a patch of red fur
in front of its neck.

232
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,980
After that, it died of illness.

233
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,460
Grandmother was heartbroken.

234
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,100
Coincidentally,

235
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,890
my aunt, who was in Jiangzhe,
gave birth to a boy

236
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,220
at the same time.

237
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,140
There was a red birthmark

238
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,220
on the boy's neck.

239
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,380
When Grandmother heard about it,

240
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,810
she thought the boy was
the rabbit's incarnation.

241
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,620
She headed to Jiangzhou
to visit the boy personally.

242
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,260
After that, she showered him
with all her love and care.

243
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,690
That boy was Ke Shizhao,

244
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,650
who was born on the same day
as my eldest brother.

245
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,290
That's a freaky coincidence.

246
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,930
Ke Shizhao excels
at winning people's hearts.

247
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,980
Everyone in the Qi Residence
thinks that he's a kind person

248
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,690
except for me,

249
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,770
my mother,

250
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,380
and my mute sister.

251
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,620
In your opinion,

252
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,770
do you think Grandmother
will believe our words

253
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,930
if we don't show her
ironclad evidence of his crimes?

254
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,890
You do have a point.

255
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
So, we should be discreet

256
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,860
with our plan.

257
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,620
It's best if we can send Ke Shizhao away

258
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,220
and report his crimes to Grandmother alone

259
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,740
to prevent additional trouble.

260
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,290
If only he wasn't in the residence.

261
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,620
You're right!

262
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,170
Grandmother always wanted

263
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,290
to take back one of her shops
from another state.

264
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,890
I can persuade Grandmother

265
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,890
and tell her to send Ke Shizhao
to take back the shop.

266
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,100
It's decided then.

267
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,290
Young Master Ke,

268
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,530
I heard you're going out.

269
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,570
I received a task from Grandmother.
I have to accomplish it.

270
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,930
However, judging from the way she spoke,

271
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,460
it seems that this matter was brought up
by the Third Young Master,

272
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,140
allowing me to take over the business.

273
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,740
The Third Young Master

274
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,810
has never been involved
in business matters.

275
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,050
What's wrong with him this time?

276
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,100
And, Third Young Mistress

277
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,260
isn't someone to be trifled with either.

278
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,220
Perhaps this time

279
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,740
it's their scheme.

280
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,530
Xiaoqiao,

281
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,740
now that I'm leaving the residence,

282
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,460
you have to keep an eye

283
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,810
on the residence.

284
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,530
Old Madam is here.

285
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,530
Xiaoqiao,

286
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,570
you serve Grandmother.

287
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,410
Even I could remember that.

288
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,340
How could you forget that?

289
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,530
Grandmother always said

290
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,170
people argue about right and wrong
on the surface

291
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,770
while gossiping about others
behind their backs.

292
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,260
If you encounter anything upsetting,

293
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,410
you should only tell Grandmother alone.

294
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,460
Do not tell everyone you see about it.

295
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,570
Do you remember that?

296
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,050
Yes, Young Master Ke.

297
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,100
I understand.

298
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,130
And,

299
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,900
-you...
-She's leaving.

300
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,610
And,

301
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,980
you must make sure

302
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,530
you and your men
keep a close eye on the residence

303
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,130
while I'm not around.

304
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,530
You must keep an eye

305
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,700
on Third Young Master too.

306
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:20,900
Look.

307
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,770
The carriage is ready.

308
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,940
[Qi Residence]

309
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,940
Young Master, here's your sack.

310
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,570
Raise the carriage.

311
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,050
Leave now.

312
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,810
[Tianlei,]

313
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,700
do you need anything from me?

314
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:25,740
Grandmother,

315
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,050
a troupe just came to our town recently.

316
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,260
It's called the Joyous Troupe.

317
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,500
We've never even heard

318
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,290
of the plays they're performing.

319
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,740
But now, they're already well-known
in the entire Linzhou.

320
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,610
All right then.

321
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,180
You can invite the troupe

322
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,660
to Qi Residence.

323
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,660
They can perform

324
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,370
for everyone here.

325
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,770
What do you think?

326
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:48,700
All right.

327
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,770
Father, Mother, please rest here.

328
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,570
I will get some water.

329
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,570
All right.

330
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,420
The Emperor is far away as the sky.

331
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,260
There is nowhere
to seek justice for grievances.

332
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,980
You guys may be able
to escape from Jiangzhou,

333
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,260
but you can never escape
from the palm of my hand.

334
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,180
Master Zhou,

335
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,460
why can't you spare us?

336
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,330
You may complain to the Hell King
in the afterlife!

337
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,020
Kill them!

338
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:41,530
Father! Mother!

339
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:55,330
What a tragic scene.

340
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,850
Poor souls.

341
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:09,330
Farewell, Father, Mother.

342
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,020
Grandmother, all right now.

343
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,020
Stop crying.

344
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,570
Crying too much is bad for your health.

345
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,180
Grandmother,

346
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,850
what do you think about the play?

347
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,020
This play is quite good,

348
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,700
though it's a bit torture.

349
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,220
What's the name of the play?

350
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,420
Tale of Mr. Ding's Enmity.

351
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,770
The actor who played Ding,

352
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,180
he was good at singing.

353
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,220
He was good at acting too.

354
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,900
Grandmother,

355
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,420
you are unaware

356
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,180
that this character, Mr. Ding actually exists.

357
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,500
This play is based on true events.

358
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,020
How did you know?

359
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,260
Ding is a relative of my friend.

360
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,770
He's living
in my friend's house right now.

361
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,500
Poor guy.

362
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,180
Grandmother,

363
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,770
do you wish to see Ding?

364
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,610
Why not?

365
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,850
Bring him to the Qi Residence next time.

366
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,180
We can provide him with some consolation.

367
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,260
All right. I'll invite him
to our residence tomorrow.

368
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,740
Grandmother,

369
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,460
you should stop being sad then.

370
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,130
All right.

371
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,500
Grandmother,

372
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,020
I found a new brand of excellent tea.

373
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,420
I'll tell Xiaoqiao to follow Xiaoxi
to bring the tea here later.

374
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,420
You're most satisfied

375
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,460
with the tea Xiaoqiao brew.

376
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,420
You can try it once she's done brewing it.

377
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,610
All right.

378
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,700
Xiaoqiao,

379
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,850
follow me.

380
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,770
That tea is superbly fragrant.

381
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,500
Is that so?

382
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,740
You'll definitely like it.

383
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,460
Grandmother.

384
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,940
Greetings, Old Madam.

385
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,260
Get up. Spare the formalities.

386
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,420
Hurry and get up.

387
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,610
So, you're Ding,
the character from the play?

388
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,900
Old Madam,

389
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,740
Ding is the name of the character
within the play.

390
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,980
My name is Ji Jingtang.

391
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,770
Judging from your accent,

392
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,980
I assume you're not a local.

393
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,330
I'm from Jiangzhou.

394
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,900
Jiangzhou?

395
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,660
You're pretty good-looking.

396
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,420
You have a great name too.

397
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,220
However, your fate is quite bitter.

398
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,020
I shed tears

399
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,020
after watching the play yesterday.

400
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,500
Your parents suffered a tragic fate.

401
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,330
Old Madam,

402
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,660
the way they murdered my parents

403
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,770
was much crueler than
what you saw in the play.

404
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,810
Don't be upset.

405
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,660
Since that's the case,

406
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,980
let me ask you this.

407
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,130
Why didn't you

408
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,460
include the real story in the play

409
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,130
so that everyone could hear about it?

410
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,850
The troupe leader was afraid
that he might get into trouble because of it.

411
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,460
That's why he could only make up the parts
based on the story.

412
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,020
Moreover, the grievances
my father had suffered

413
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,770
couldn't be explained entirely
with the play alone.

414
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,500
If the play can't
explain the story entirely,

415
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,810
I'm sure you can.

416
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,370
Old Madam,

417
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,180
In the play,
Zhou Shibiao uses someone else to commit murder,

418
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,940
while the Zhou Shibiao from Jiangzhou

419
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,570
uses poisonous schemes to harm others.

420
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,290
He's ruthless and cruel.

421
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,460
Why are they pestering your family?

422
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,370
There's a bully in east town, Jiangzhou.

423
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,220
He has committed all kinds of evil deeds.

424
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,290
And his son, Zhou Shibiao,

425
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,050
is worse

426
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,610
than him.

427
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,980
People refer to him as Young Dandy.

428
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,130
My family owns an apothecary
in the western side of the city.

429
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,130
Our family had nothing to do
with the Zhou family.

430
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,980
But we never expected the crook

431
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,660
to target us eventually.

432
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,940
What was their motive then?

433
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,530
They had their eyes
on the Ji family's apothecary.

434
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,940
It was a fertile land
blessed with an abundance of business.

435
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,810
Initially, they just sent someone
to purchase it by offering a price.

436
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,610
My father rejected him outright.

437
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,810
After that, he was upset with it.

438
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,370
Thus, he came up with a devious plot

439
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,740
that was utterly devoid of conscience.

440
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,530
A devious ploy?

441
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,500
What kind of devious plot?

442
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,770
Grandmother, calm down.

443
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,260
Let him finish his story.

444
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,570
All right. Take your time.

445
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,770
The crook, Zhou Shibiao,

446
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,460
had his eyes on our land.

447
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,090
However, he couldn't

448
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,850
make it his own by force.

449
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,180
Thus, he came up
with all kinds of evil ideas

450
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,900
to harm my family.

451
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,980
[Until one day...]

452
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,700
What are you doing?

453
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,570
[He was walking around
on the streets of Jiangzhou.]

454
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,420
[He saw a pauper and her son]

455
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,570
[begging for food
in the middle of the street.]

456
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,050
[A vicious idea suddenly
sparked into his mind.]

457
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,420
[He went to the pauper and her son]

458
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,020
[with an ulterior motive.]

459
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,020
[He said they looked like]

460
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,850
[his distant relatives.]

461
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:49,260
Get up.

462
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,740
Thank you.

463
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,700
Mother.

464
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,530
Let's go.

465
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,420
[Using honeyed words,]

466
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,220
[Zhou Shibiao told his men
to deceive the paupers]

467
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,090
[and bring them back home.]

468
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,700
[They enjoyed all the food
they were offered.]

469
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,020
[They fed them and dressed them well.]

470
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,700
[All of a sudden,
they were no longer paupers.]

471
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,130
Here, my son.

472
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:10,940
Eat up.

473
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,570
[Delightful Scenery]

474
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,260
[Thus,]

475
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,260
[the pauper followed Zhou Shibiao
around happily]

476
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,090
[and collected debts
as he borrowed his power to do evil.]

477
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,370
[He became a carefree pauper prince]

478
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,090
[who had his every request fulfilled.]

479
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,900
[The pauper prince lived
in Zhou Shibiao's residence]

480
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,290
[for half a year.]

481
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,850
[One day, the pauper prince]

482
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,020
[fell sick.]

483
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,980
[Zhou Shibiao hired a physician]

484
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,370
[to give the pauper prince a diagnosis.]

485
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,260
[He gave him a prescription.]

486
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,660
[The pauper prince came to our apothecary]

487
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,220
[with his prescription
to purchase the necessary herbs.]

488
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,740
All right.

489
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,020
[Prescription]
[My father was an honest man.]

490
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,260
[He never doubted the prescription
the pauper prince gave him.]

491
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,460
[He got the required herbs
following the prescription]

492
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,180
[and sold them to the pauper prince.]

493
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,810
Mister, here you go.

494
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,530
Thank you, Young Master.

495
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,050
[After that, Zhou Shibiao
instructed his men]

496
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,770
[to swap the prescription for poison.]

497
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,220
[Blood was oozing
from the pauper prince's eyes, nose, and mouth]

498
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,570
[after he consumed the poison.]

499
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,330
[He died immediately.]

500
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,330
Ji family's apothecary sold fake medicine

501
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,130
and killed someone due to their greed!

502
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:08,700
Follow me to the authorities!

503
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,610
That's impossible!

504
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,610
Our apothecary

505
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,610
never sold any fake medicine!

506
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,050
Come with us!

507
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,260
[Zhou Shibiao told his men]

508
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,900
[to carry the pauper prince's body
to our apothecary]

509
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,740
[and caused a huge commotion
in front of the apothecary.]

[Jiangzhou Government Office]

511
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,810
[Father tried to reason with them.]

512
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,020
Ji family's apothecary was
selling fake medicine.

513
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,940
[However, those crooks were unreasonable.]

514
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,530
[They insisted
that father gave the pauper prince]

515
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,850
[the wrong prescription and killed him.]

516
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,900
[They dragged my father]

517
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,180
[into the government office by force.]

518
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,980
[Jiangzhou Government Office]
[The county magistrate, who was bribed by Zhou Shibiao,]

519

[forced my father to confess
by torturing him.]

520

[He suffered grievances]

[and died in prison.]

523
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,980
That crook

524
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,700
is truly heartless.

525
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,330
He sacrificed the life
of an innocent pauper

526
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,090
to frame your family's apothecary
for a crime they didn't commit.

527
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,900
Where did you hear

528
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,980
about the story you told me?

529
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,500
Back then, I wanted to report this case
to the local authorities.

530
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,090
However, the corrupt official,
who was bribed by Zhou Shibiao,

531
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,020
kicked me out.

532
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,370
Coincidentally,

533
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,090
I met the pauper prince's mother
at the entrance.

534
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,900
She also thought

535
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,460
that there was more to her son's death
than meets the eye.

536
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,460
Thus, she confronted Zhou Shibiao.

537
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,940
Zhou Shibiao instructed his men

538
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,850
to poison her food.

539
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,740
Luckily, a kind maidservant

540
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,610
tipped her off.

541
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,130
The old lady escaped overnight
after realizing

542
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,290
that Zhou Shibiao wanted to silence her.

543
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,660
However, Zhou Shibiao was
ruthless and relentless.

544
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,050
He actually sent his men
to hunt the old lady down.

545
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,130
The old lady was seriously wounded.

546
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,900
She became blind too.

547
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,530
She wanted to report the case
to the local authorities.

548
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,810
I met her on my way there.

549
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,810
I brought her with me
as we escaped from Jiangzhou.

550
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,570
But we never expected

551
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,050
Zhou Shibiao to send his men
to hunt us down overnight.

552
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,290
The old lady and I were separated

553
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,020
amid the chaos.

554
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,020
Good and evil will always be rewarded.
It is only a question of time.

555
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,420
Jingtang,

556
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,980
since you're here today,

557
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,220
that means you have an affinity with us.

558
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,370
What about this?

559
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,770
I'll give you some money

560
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,290
to assist you

561
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,090
in finding the blind lady

562
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,810
so that you two can file a suit
against Zhou Shibiao again.

563
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,220
What if

564
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,290
I tell you the real name
of the Zhou Shibiao I mentioned?

565
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:27,940
Grandmother,

566
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,050
The Mr. Ding in this play

567
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,900
is actually Ji Jingtang.

568
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,940
But Zhou Shibiao in the play...

569
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,570
Who is he?

570
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,980
Old Madam,

571
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,370
The Zhou Shibiao in the play

572
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,130
is none other than Ke Shizhao

573
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,330
from Jiangzhou.

574
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,740
Who exactly are you?

575
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,530
I'm Ji Jingtang, the son of the owner
of Ji family's apothecary

576
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,330
in Jiangzhou.

577
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,810
My family was shattered
because of Ke Shizhao.

578
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,940
Old Madam, please uphold justice for me.

579
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,740
Every single word I uttered was true.

580
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,370
This is the blood letter my father wrote

581
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,020
before he passed away.

582
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,610
Even the prison guard
sympathized with him.

583
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,700
That's why he gave it to me.

584
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,810
I had no way to report him
to the local authorities,

585
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,420
and I was separated from the old lady,

586
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,420
who was the only witness in the case.

587
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,090
Old Madam, I heard

588
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,570
that you were compassionate,
charitable, and fair.

589
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,020
You mustn't let Ke Shizhao

590
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,530
ruin the Qi family's reputation.

591
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,420
That's why I gathered my courage
and came to see you.

592
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,180
Please uphold justice for my family.

593
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:08,900
[Blood letter written
by Ji Jingtang's father]

594
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,090
[So he's here to expose Shizhao's crimes.]

595
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,370
You see,

596
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,260
the government office

597
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,570
cannot even handle the case.

598
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,530
And, there's no witness.

599
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,220
I'm just an old businesswoman.

600
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,570
It's inappropriate for me to intervene.

601
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,330
Besides,

602
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,260
everything you said just now

603
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,260
was just your side of the story.

604
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,090
Tianlei.

605
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:01,980
Yes, Old Madam.

606
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,220
Give him some money

607
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,900
so that he can go home.

608
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,460
Yes, Old Madam.

609
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,660
Old Madam, thank you for your kindness.

610
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,700
However, money doesn't matter to me.

611
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,940
I just hope
that I can seek justice for my parents.

612
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,220
Old Madam, I wish you
happiness and longevity.

613
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,290
I shall take my leave.

614
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,940
I'll see him off.

615
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,380
Tianlei,

616
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,570
how did you meet that child?

617
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,650
One day,

618
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,860
he made a ruckus
in front of Qi Residence.

619
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,210
He said he wanted to see you.

620
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,500
He wanted you to uphold justice for him.

621
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,460
In the end, he attracted the attention
of Wang Huzi and his gang.

622
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,650
They gave him a sound beating.

623
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,130
Bingyan and I were passing by.

624
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,380
Thus, we saved him.

625
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,900
Is Shizhao around?

626
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,780
No, he's not.

627
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,050
If so, why didn't you
tell me about it earlier?

628
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,460
I was thinking

629
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,570
that this case was related
to three lives after all.

630
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,820
And it's related to Shizhao too.

631
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,650
We cannot afford
to believe the story blindly

632
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,730
after listening to his side of the story.

633
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,050
I was thinking

634
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,530
that we could discuss the issue

635
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,860
once the facts have been verified.

636
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,420
Tianlei,

637
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,500
it's Ji Jingtang's business.

638
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,460
Stay out of it.

639
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,020
Shizhao is working for us right now.

640
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,090
He's managing the Qi family's business.

641
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,210
The Qi family will suffer losses

642
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,530
if he gets involved

643
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,570
in a lawsuit.

644
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,340
Grandmother,

645
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,300
the truth of Ji Jingtang's case

646
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,820
will be revealed sooner or later.

647
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,380
However, regarding
the Qi Residence's business,

648
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,380
it's better for you

649
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,090
to seize back its control.

650
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:30,690
Grandmother,

651
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,090
I'm sure there's a reason
a play like this was produced.

652
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,020
Jiangzhou

653
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,460
is a hotbed of rumors as well.

654
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,780
Could it be that Shizhao was influenced
by the unhealthy habits of Jiangzhou

655
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,610
since he lived there for a long time?

656
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,530
What if he was the reason
the Qi family was plagued by bad luck?

657
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,500
Don't spout such nonsense.

658
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,940
I'm not spouting nonsense.

659
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,050
If the Qi Residence
wasn't plagued by bad luck,

660
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,210
why would my eldest brother

661
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,820
die in his sleep for no reason?

662
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,690
Why would my second brother

663
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,340
die from a venomous snake bite
for no reason?

664
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
If so, why did Yansheng

665
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,980
become a mute overnight?

666
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,090
Why would everyone in the Qi Residence

667
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:58,980
say that I could not live past

668
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,860
the age of 25?

669
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,690
Tianlei!

670
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,170
Stop it.

671
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,340
Grandmother,

672
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,170
I'm not trying to intimidate you here.

673
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,780
However, the Qi Residence is truly cursed.

674
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,570
Stop that immediately.

675
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,250
Come.

676
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,130
Hurry up.

677
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,090
Young Master, good job.

678
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,170
Come.

679
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,300
[Qi Residence]

680
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:47,820
Hurry.

681
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:48,860
Young Master, please.

682
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,420
Bring these herbs to the kitchen.

683
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,300
[Young Master, be careful.]

684
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,780
Young Master Ke?

685
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,250
Young Master Ke, you've finally returned.

686
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,020
Yes.

687
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,170
Bring all those things inside.

688
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,340
Hurry!

689
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,570
Hurry!

690
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,340
Make haste!

691
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,300
Hurry up!

692
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,130
Xiaoqiao.

693
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,050
Tell me.

694
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,860
Tell me what happened here

695
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,860
when I wasn't around.

696
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,780
Third Young Master
and Third Young Mistress

697
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,980
invited a troupe here
to perform a play for Old Madam.

698
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,940
And?

699
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,460
On the second day,

700
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,530
I was serving Old Madam

701
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,020
when Third Young Mistress sent me away
by asking me to brew tea for her.

702
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,300
When I went back,

703
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,860
Third Young Master was
having a conversation with Old Madam

704
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,210
with another young man beside him.

705
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,980
Old Madam had a reluctant look
on her face.

706
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,170
Xiaoqiao,

707
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,300
did you see clearly

708
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,170
what the young man looked like?

709
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,340
Third Young Mistress
brought him away in a hurry.

710
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,690
I was standing too far away
to see his face clearly.

711
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,090
Anyway, he looked like
he was around 17 or 18 years old.

712
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,460
He looked keen-witted.

713
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,780
He had a standard figure.
He looked neat and clean.

714
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,020
Judging from his apparel,

715
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,530
I don't think he's a local.

716
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,530
Xiaoqiao,

717
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,980
why didn't you keep a close eye on them?

718
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,860
I was afraid
that Third Young Mistress might see me.

719
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,250
She's very tricky.

720
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,730
Kill him!

721
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,690
Oh yeah.

722
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,860
It's the guy who was beaten up
in front of our residence.

723
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,690
It's him again?

724
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,340
Xiaoqiao,

725
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,650
tell me.

726
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,820
Did you know what he told Grandmother?

727
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:09,860
Grandmother.

728
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,820
Greetings, Grandmother.

729
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,530
Shizhao.

730
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,820
You've returned.

731
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,650
Yes.

732
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,210
Put them over there.

733
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,500
Grandmother.

734
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,820
Grandmother, take a look.

735
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,860
These were the gifts

736
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,500
I picked especially for you.

737
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,460
You bought me so many things again.

738
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,090
Grandmother, be careful.

739
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,380
You always bring me

740
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,020
plenty of souvenirs when you come back.

741
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,250
I'm an old woman.

742
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,050
I don't eat or use much.

743
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,020
In the future,

744
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,130
you should stop buying such gifts for me.

745
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,340
Grandmother,

746
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,820
please don't mind them.

747
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,820
I'll obey your will

748
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,650
in the future.

749
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,020
And,

750
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,780
stop sending local specialties

751
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,340
to our relatives.

752
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Today,

753
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,050
I will accept these two cans of tea leaves
you bought for me.

754
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,380
As for the rest,

755
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,340
deliver them to Jiangzhou for me.
