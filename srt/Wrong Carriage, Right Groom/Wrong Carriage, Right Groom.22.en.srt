18
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:42,620
[Episode 22]

19
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,680
The gold hairpin is actually a key.

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,000
The device to release the lock
of the secret door

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,840
is installed in a corner
beneath the Buddha statue.

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,040
I saw it with my own eyes.

23
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,120
That old thing is long in the tooth.

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,070
She has a mind like a sieve.

25
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,350
Always leaving her stuff behind.

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,950
She must have left the hairpin in the lock

27
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,350
after putting the silver ingots in there

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
last night.

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,710
And

30
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,070
that makes it easy for us.

31
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,230
This is great, Xiaoqiao.

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Job well done.

33
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,430
Find the hairpin,

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,080
and our plan will undoubtedly bear fruit.

35
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,190
But Old Madam wears
the hairpin all the time.

36
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,000
I can't exactly remove it from her hair.

37
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,840
I'm not asking you
to do it in broad daylight.

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,360
You can wait

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,750
until she falls asleep at night.

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,870
But I won't be able to get in

41
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,030
when she sleeps.

42
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,030
Well, you could get her to sleep

43
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,630
in your presence.

44
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,240
Are you telling me

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
to give her something that puts her to sleep?

46
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,520
To be precise,

47
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,590
I want her to go to sleep
and never wake up.

48
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,680
You mean... you want me to kill her

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,750
by poisoning her?

50
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,870
That isn't really
the right way of putting it.

51
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,910
See, every elderly person's greatest fear

52
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,840
is being in severe pain when they die.

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,680
Her drifting off

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,800
to sleep

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,800
is merely a means
to eliminate needless suffering.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,960
A gentle and quiet death,

57
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,800
it would be a mercy killing.

58
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,710
What,

59
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,280
you don't want to do it?

60
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,750
She's your grandmother!

61
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,190
Well,

62
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,960
fortune favors the brave.

63
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,470
I'm just a housemaid.

64
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,710
I don't understand

65
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,520
the word you just said.

66
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,190
Kindness in leadership

67
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,840
equates to weakness.

68
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,030
Don't you get it?

69
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,680
You can never tell

70
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,750
someone's true intentions.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,710
Do you understand?

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,910
No, I don't.

73
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,910
Being ruthless is the key

74
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,470
to success.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,310
Know what I mean?

76
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,120
He who strikes first

77
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,120
gains the upper hand.

78
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,080
Indecision

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,840
can be the downfall.

80
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,870
Xiaoqiao,

81
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,480
as you know,

82
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,270
I am much more educated than you are.

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,750
You will do

84
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,040
as you're ordered.

85
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,510
Am I understood?

86
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,390
The way I see it,

87
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,630
scholars

88
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,390
either don't cross the line

89
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,120
or do extraordinary evil

90
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,750
that no one else is capable of.

91
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,920
I couldn't agree more.

92
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,750
What are you laughing at?

93
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,630
You teach me

94
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,630
to read every day.

95
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,800
Aren't you afraid
I might use that against you?

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,630
Nope.

97
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,040
Let me tell you.

98
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,390
There are

99
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,040
two types of knowledge.

100
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,360
One enables you to understand

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,270
the power of kindness.

102
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,830
The other one

103
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,680
motivates you to do bad things.

104
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,040
But don't you worry.

105
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,070
You won't find

106
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,920
any evil books under this roof.

107
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,190
I've gotten rid of them all.

108
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,120
Are you saying

109
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,240
that Ke Shizhao looks good outside

110
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,270
but is rotten inside

111
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,680
because he's been reading evil books?

112
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,430
That's right.

113
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,830
What's so funny?

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,120
Promise you won't get mad

115
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,680
if I tell you.

116
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,800
You said so yourself.

117
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,240
You said...

118
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,560
you and your brothers

119
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,000
aren't exactly brainy.

120
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,600
Not to mention

121
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,600
how much of a pleasure seeker they are.

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,360
You, on the other hand, are an okay guy.

123
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,680
I wonder

124
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,270
if it was those evil books

125
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,560
that made them that way.

126
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,870
And did you get so smart

127
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,430
because you read books
on positive thinking?

128
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,680
I thought we discussed this
at the Sightseeing Pavilion.

129
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
Geez,

130
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,120
how are you so forgetful?

131
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,560
Fine.

132
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,120
I'll say it again.

133
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,360
Our time on earth

134
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,000
is brief.

135
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,240
It won't be too long

136
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,120
before you go gray.

137
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,360
It takes great courage

138
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,680
to be a good person

139
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
and stay true to yourself.

140
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,000
Things are easier for people

141
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,240
who were born poor because there's hardly

142
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,600
any temptation to fight against.

143
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,070
But for those

144
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
born with a silver spoon,

145
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,240
they are continually surrounded
by temptations.

146
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,120
The weak-minded ones

147
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,120
often make excuses
to justify their actions.

148
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,830
They indulge in evil pleasures.

149
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,240
Live in the moment, as they say.

150
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,630
But really,

151
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,310
they have low moral standards.

152
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,160
I practice martial arts.

153
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,430
I don't understand

154
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,430
what you're saying.

155
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
You don't?

156
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,680
I already spelled it out for you.

157
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,040
No, I don't.

158
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,800
Fine.

159
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,750
What I'm trying to say is

160
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,560
overindulgence is bad for rich kids.

161
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,750
Does that make sense?

162
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,390
Nope.

163
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,510
It means...

164
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,120
we should always
carry ourselves with integrity.

165
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,720
And we must not yield to temptation.

166
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,160
Did I explain that well?

167
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,560
No, no, no.

168
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,950
Are you playing dumb with me?

169
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,870
I've really thought hard
about what you said.

170
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,480
But

171
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,310
it's completely beyond me.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,830
Well, that's okay.

173
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,190
Know what?

174
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,240
Let me knock some sense into you.

175
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,120
Ow, ow, ow!

176
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,790
That hurts!

177
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,750
You wanted to get physical, huh?

178
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,270
Ow...

179
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,150
Focus on the matter at hand.

180
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,480
What's our next move?

181
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,270
It's...it's your call.

182
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,120
Know what I think?

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,790
We should play defense.

184
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,910
Right,

185
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,550
right.

186
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,150
My grandmother will lure him into a trap,

187
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,150
giving him a taste of his own medicine.

188
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,600
And you will be on standby.

189
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,270
With you two working together,

190
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,320
he's cornered.

191
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,060
[Qi Residence]

192
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,320
[It goes without saying]

193
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,960
that there can't be two kings

194
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,120
in one kingdom.

195
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,150
If you people

196
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,200
disobey me,

197
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,200
don't take me seriously,

198
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,960
or pay lip service to what I say,

199
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,550
trust me when I say

200
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,200
you will be dealt with.

201
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,000
I've said it before and I'll say it again.

202
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,240
No egotism

203
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,790
and feuds

204
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,240
under my roof.

205
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,200
I may be old,

206
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,240
but...

207
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,670
I can see

208
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,480
perfectly well.

209
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,150
Some of you have been doing good deeds.

210
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,870
Others are up to no good.

211
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
Those who have an overwhelming desire

212
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,600
to get their good deeds noticed,

213
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,240
they are nothing but fake nice people.

214
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
And those

215
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
who desperately try

216
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,960
to cover their bad behaviors,

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,720
they are, in my eyes,

218
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,200
evil people.

219
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,960
What I've just said...

220
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,790
I...

221
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,790
-Old Madam!
-Old Madam!

222
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,840
-Grandmother!
-Grandmother!

223
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,150
Grandmother! Grandmother!

224
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,000
I... I can't breathe...

225
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,960
Grandmother.

226
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Have a seat over here.

227
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,030
Take it easy.

228
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,600
Grandmother.

229
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,620
Calm down. Relax.

230
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,380
Xiaoxi,

231
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,570
go get Mr. Liu.

232
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,170
-Yeah.
-What do we do?

233
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,770
The family business.

234
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,570
Oh, where does it leave us?

235
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,260
Beats me.

236
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,140
Mr. Liu,

237
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,220
Old Madam is over here.

238
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,570
Master.

239
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,100
Mr. Liu.

240
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,460
Let's go over there.

241
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,020
I think Old Madam has had a stroke.

242
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,410
What are we supposed to do now?

243
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,410
There is nothing to concern about.

244
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,530
It's treatable.

245
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,410
I'm going

246
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,570
to write you a recipe.

247
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,260
Have Xiaoxi gather the ingredients listed

248
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,810
and give the potion to Old Madam.

249
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,980
It'll relieve the symptoms.

250
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,380
Thank you, Master.

251
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,620
Miss Yansheng,

252
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,170
Old Madam has taken the potion.

253
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,100
Wonderful. This batch is almost ready.

254
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,410
Oh, take your time.

255
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,380
There's no rush.

256
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,860
Mr. Liu said

257
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,930
we could brew another batch
for Old Madam tomorrow.

258
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,100
It'll speed up the healing process.

259
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:05,690
Perfect.

260
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,570
Second Madam, allow me.

261
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,340
We can manage.

262
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,050
Let me do it, please.

263
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,980
You go about your day.

264
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,770
We've got this.

265
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,530
Just go.

266
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:46,980
All right.

267
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,140
How did it go?

268
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,020
Both the madams

269
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,100
are watching over Old Madam.

270
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,140
They wouldn't let me lend a hand.

271
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,170
And the gold hairpin?

272
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,410
It's still under Old Madam's pillow.

273
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,740
Xiaoqiao,

274
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,460
now that my grandmother had a stroke,

275
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,260
we've got a golden opportunity.

276
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,740
We have to get our hands

277
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,170
on the hairpin.

278
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,740
But I can't go near her bed.

279
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,460
How am I supposed to get the hairpin

280
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,290
with both the madams around?

281
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,140
Come on. It's not like

282
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
the hairpin can move on its own.

283
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,410
Just think of something.

284
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,770
I'm at my wit's end.

285
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,460
If you've come up with a plan,
then please enlighten me.

286
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,740
Aw, Xiaoqiao,

287
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,290
don't be mad.

288
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,340
Perhaps you could start with Second Madam.

289
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,410
She's always been timid as a mouse.

290
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,620
When she's on duty,

291
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,810
whip out an excuse to get rid of her.

292
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,770
You could tell her
I want to speak with her.

293
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,020
That should freak her out.

294
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,460
When you see an opening,

295
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,100
sneak the hairpin out of the room.

296
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,260
Old Madam

297
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,410
may not be able to talk,

298
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,020
but her mind is sharp.

299
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,980
If she sees through my trick,

300
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,810
then I'll...

301
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,220
Relax.

302
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,890
She's dying anyway.

303
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,410
Slip this into her potion

304
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,860
when no one's looking.

305
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,740
And after she takes it

306
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,020
and closes her eyes,

307
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,740
you can

308
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,530
pull out the hairpin

309
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,770
from under her pillow.

310
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,170
I'll split the money with you.

311
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,650
You'll never have

312
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,570
to serve or attend anymore.

313
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,620
You can be the Young Mistress

314
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,530
and become the Old Madam someday.

315
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,900
Miss Xiaoqiao...

316
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,740
Young Master Ke,

317
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,900
is Miss Xiaoqiao

318
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,530
angry or something?

319
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,370
Instead of worrying about her,

320
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,460
you should worry about yourself.

321
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,290
The snake, the drug,
and the poisoned needles,

322
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,370
each offense

323
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,700
is punishable by death!

324
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,370
Y-Young Master Ke,

325
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,740
you have my absolute loyalty!

326
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,370
I want you

327
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,090
to take out Liu Ruoqian

328
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,370
and come back as soon as you can.

329
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,330
Am I understood?

330
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:06,850
Yes.

331
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,530
I'll get right on it.

332
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,500
Xiaoqiao.

333
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,900
Xiaoxi,

334
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,460
it's you.

335
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,330
Oh, you scared me.

336
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,530
Xiaoqiao,

337
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,460
you seem

338
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,530
a little distracted today.

339
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,420
I was just thinking about Old Madam.

340
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:55,980
I mean,

341
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,090
how could someone so healthy

342
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,500
and energetic

343
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,770
have had a stroke?

344
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,660
Didn't you hear Mr. Liu?

345
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,610
It's no big deal.

346
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,810
Old Madam will be back
to her usual self in no time.

347
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,940
In fact, I was just on my way
to the kitchen to brew the potion.

348
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,610
I used to brew potions

349
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,770
for Old Madam all the time.

350
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,770
Why not leave this one to me?

351
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,460
No,

352
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,810
I'm good.

353
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,420
Yansheng,

354
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,460
I'm an old hand at this.

355
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,570
Let me do it.

356
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,530
Xiaoqiao,

357
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,460
Miss Yansheng doesn't even need my help.

358
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,050
I'm literally sitting on my hands here.

359
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,700
Just go back to what you were doing.

360
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:43,570
Go.

361
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,570
But...

362
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,570
Third Young Master. Third Young Mistress.

363
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,090
She didn't touch the potion, did she?

364
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:18,940
No, she did not.

365
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,090
We did not let her come near the pot.

366
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,940
Master was right.

367
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,090
They're looking
to spike Grandmother's potion.

368
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,330
Tianlei,

369
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,500
You need to get word to Mr. Liu.

370
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,810
He takes the outside.
I'll cover the inside.

371
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,810
There are people coming for Grandmother.

372
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:32,940
Talk to you later.

373
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,330
Be careful, Your Ladyship.

374
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,260
Keep your eyes open, Sister-in-law.

375
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,180
Make sure you have your sword with you.

376
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,330
Be on guard.

377
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,260
Old Madam.

378
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,090
Quick. They're coming.

379
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,180
Quick, move.

380
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,050
Get ready.

381
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,180
Easy.

382
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,460
All right.

383
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,020
Second Madam,

384
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,290
Old Madam fell asleep?

385
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,330
All right, okay.

386
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,260
Leave us, will you?

387
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,570
Hmm.

388
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,500
I'm right here.

389
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,090
Just go.

390
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:50,660
Be a good girl.

391
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,090
Second Madam,

392
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,570
I've just remembered.

393
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,020
Young Master Ke

394
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,460
wants to see you.

395
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,850
What could he possibly want with me?

396
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,770
I have to look after Old Madam.

397
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,050
Tell him I'm tied up.

398
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,020
Second Madam,

399
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,850
Third Young Master wants you
over there as soon as possible.

400
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,770
Third Young Master?

401
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,420
Right, it was Third Young Master.

402
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,020
I got their names mixed up.

403
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,660
I could cool down the potion for you.

404
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
You can give it
to Old Madam when you return.

405
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,050
Second Madam,

406
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,050
we need to go.

407
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,260
Ugh.

408
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,850
Keep a close eye on Old Madam.

409
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,050
Third Young Master is such a darling.

410
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,090
He brought these pastries for Old Madam.

411
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:29,850
Second Madam,

412
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,050
the potion is at the right temperature.

413
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,020
You might want to give it
to Old Madam while it's warm.

414
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,900
All right, I'll take it from here.

415
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,090
Goodness gracious!

416
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,530
I've forgotten
to put out the charcoal grill

417
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,530
in the kitchen.

418
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,610
Xiaoqiao,

419
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,130
extinguish it for me, won't you?

420
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,740
You can never be too careful.

421
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,220
We wouldn't want the coals to ignite

422
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,570
anything that can burn, now would we?

423
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:54,770
Go, quickly.

424
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,530
Certainly.

425
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,290
Young Master Ke!

426
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,610
Xiaoqiao.

427
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,570
We did it.

428
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,220
I saw her drain the bowl

429
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,460
with my own eyes.

430
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,090
Did you add the drug into the potion?

431
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,260
I did.

432
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,050
The money, the jewelry,

433
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,290
they will all be ours.

434
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,740
Wang Huzi,

435
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,050
do it now.

436
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,500
Absolutely.

437
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,020
Quick.

438
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,500
Second Madam,

439
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,370
you should take a break.

440
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,260
Rest assured, Grandmother will be fine

441
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,260
on my watch.

442
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,980
Grandmother.

443
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,770
Oh, Grandmother.

444
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,850
Look what has become

445
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,900
of the Qi Residence.

446
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,940
All because you placed your trust
in the wrong people.

447
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,130
You were the one who took me in.

448
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,290
So it was you all along.

449
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:08,770
Grandmother,

450
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,570
you...

451
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,740
I can't believe
you were trying to kill me.

452
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,290
No, Grandmother.

453
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,290
That's not true.

454
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,660
Shizhao,

455
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,810
I brought you here

456
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,660
because I took pity on you.

457
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,370
Yet you said

458
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,130
I made a mistake.

459
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,370
Aren't you an ungrateful b*st*rd?

460
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,130
I have been

461
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,900
good to you.

462
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,700
I did nothing to deserve this.

463
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,460
Grandmother,

464
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,420
your potion was poisoned.

465
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,330
You won't make it.

466
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,980
It won't be long

467
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,180
before you kick the bucket!

468
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,330
I did not drink the potion

469
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,980
Fang Xiaoqiao had tampered with.

470
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,740
It has already been

471
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,260
dumped out.

472
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,460
What?

473
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,290
You took me for a ride,

474
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,460
you stupid old fool!

475
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,130
You are too young

476
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,700
to outsmart me.

477
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,740
Too young?

478
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,290
Am I?

479
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,810
You're an old bat.

480
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,530
I'm capable of things you aren't,

481
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,020
old thing.

482
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,810
What, you want to get physical?

483
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,220
Oh, Shizhao,

484
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,700
when did you become

485
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,900
such a wicked, ruthless man?

486
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,420
So what if I am?

487
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,530
I'm willing to do whatever it takes
to get what I want!

488
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,050
Get off me! Get off me!

489
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,810
How could you

490
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,740
do this to me?

491
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,460
Relax,

492
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,500
Grandmother.

493
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:27,900
I've sent my men

494
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,130
to kill your youngest grandson
and granddaughter-in-law.

495
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:31,810
You will soon

496
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,770
see each other

497
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,940
in hell.

498
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,050
You monster!

499
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,810
Untie me! Untie me!

500
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,220
Grandmother, are you okay?

501
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,370
I'm all right.

502
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,050
What are you doing here?

503
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,180
Go hide, quick.

504
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,940
I'm done hiding.

505
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,260
I'm going to kill that prick.

506
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,050
Hang on.

507
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,980
It's not time yet.

508
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,370
His men are outside looking for you.

509
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,660
It's too dangerous for you now.

510
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,370
We're going to wait

511
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,900
till he puts all his cards on the table

512
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,050
and gets caught red-handed

513
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,370
when the government officials arrive.

514
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,180
But what if he...

515
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,020
Just do as I say.

516
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,090
Stay hidden.

517
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,420
Don't worry.

518
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,770
I'm under your protection.

519
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,980
Listen to me.

520
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,850
Go back into hiding, quick.

521
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,460
I want both of them found.

522
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,020
Now!

523
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,770
At once!

524
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:29,660
Move.

525
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,290
Halt.

526
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,460
Split.

527
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,130
Wang Huzi.

528
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,570
I've been expecting you.

529
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,610
You've mistaken me for someone else.

530
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,260
Get them!

531
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,020
What do you want?

532
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,370
My men

533
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,420
are off hunting Tianlei and Bingyan.

534
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,290
How could you?

535
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,660
Is there any humanity left within you?

536
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,660
Humanity?

537
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,660
You have a huge business empire.

538
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,290
Yet you made me a butler!

539
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:14,660
What I really want

540
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,530
is to be the leader of Qi Residence!

541
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,850
The eldest heir is terribly incompetent.

542
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,220
The second

543
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,130
is pathetically unambitious.

544
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,050
His life is all play and no work.

545
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,570
The third is invalid.

546
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,460
I'm destined to step
into the role of a leader.

547
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,020
It's called the law of the jungle.

548
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,500
The one most adaptable to change
is the one that survives.

549
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,130
You are an evildoer driven by greed.

550
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,220
Shut the hell up.

551
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,420
You have built massive wealth
throughout your life.

552
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,700
It'll get passed on
to the next generation anyway.

553
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,050
Why not leave it all
to your daughter's son, hmm?

554
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:04,940
Stay back.

555
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,610
I said stay back!

556
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,570
Grandmother!

557
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,500
No.

558
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,130
No! No!

559
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,420
Let go of me!

560
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,780
Shizhao,

561
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,420
you brought this on yourself.

562
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,610
You have nobody to blame

563
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,250
but yourself.

564
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,130
I was so close.

565
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,650
People in desperate situations

566
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,340
will do anything to survive.

567
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,900
I didn't do anything wrong!

568
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,170
That's enough. Move along!

569
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,340
Move!

570
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,250
Pick up the pace!

571
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,650
Old Madam...

572
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,610
Xiaoqiao...

573
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:33,940
Old Madam!

574
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,500
I'm sorry! Please!

575
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,730
Spare my life, Old Madam!

576
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,650
He is remorseless.

577
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,380
He doesn't feel any guilt.

578
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,420
Grandmother.

579
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,170
Tianlei.

580
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,170
Tianlei,

581
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,210
are you all right?

582
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,300
Grandmother, is everything okay?

583
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,650
Yes. Yes. it is.

584
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,940
Good to see you guys.

585
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,730
Have a seat, Grandmother.

586
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:08,900
Old Madam,

587
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:10,940
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

588
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,250
My sweet Yansheng and Tianlei,

589
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,340
they've put up with a lot over the years.

590
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,420
I must say I'm surprised.

591
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,730
Family feuds of the rich

592
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,380
are even more bitter than wars.

593
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,940
Mr. and Mrs. Liu,

594
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,130
I greatly appreciate your help.

595
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,940
I owe you big time.

596
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,050
My pleasure.

597
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,250
As the old saying goes, the older you are,

598
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,130
the wiser you are.

599
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,020
Bingyan,

600
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,820
I appreciate what you did.

601
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,210
She was quick to defend me.

602
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,170
I would've been dead

603
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,170
if it weren't for her.

604
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,860
Thank you, Bingyan.

605
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,940
Grandmother...

606
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,730
Actually...

607
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,940
I'm not Du Bingyan.

608
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,340
I'm Li Yuhu.

609
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,090
Hu?

610
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,090
My name is Li Yuhu.

611
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:26,690
That's right.

612
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,420
You're not Du Bingyan?

613
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,300
Old Madam,

614
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,300
she's telling the truth.

615
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,090
I'm sorry, Grandmother.

616
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,940
I lied to you.

617
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,940
On that rainy day at the Fairy Temple,

618
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,860
I got into the wrong bridal sedan.

619
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,020
But you married the right person.

620
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,570
So...

621
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,900
everyone here

622
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,020
knew

623
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,980
what really happened

624
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,860
except me?

625
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,610
This is absurd!

626
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,170
Old Madam,

627
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,420
the real Du Bingyan
has moved up north to Jingzhou.

628
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,340
Now

629
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,940
she's happily married to General Yuan.

630
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,730
She very much is.

631
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,730
As I see it,

632
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,940
it's a happy ending for everyone.

633
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,300
Are you expecting?

634
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:39,940
Grandmother,

635
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,300
please don't be upset with me.

636
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,940
Oh, why would I be?

637
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,340
In fact,

638
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,380
I am overjoyed.

639
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,380
You rooted out the bad apple

640
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,210
in the family for us.

641
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,610
Not to mention

642
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,900
you have brought us hope.

643
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,380
That's right.

644
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,090
Your Highness!

645
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,900
Your Highness, I come bearing good news!

646
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,340
Yeah?

647
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,340
What is it?

648
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,690
By order of His Majesty,

649
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,210
you'll be getting married.

650
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:27,860
I have come

651
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,690
to drop off

652
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,420
the wedding dress for you.

653
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,090
And I was hoping
you would grant me a cup of tea

654
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,210
for good luck.

655
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,780
Here you go.

656
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

657
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,420
You are His Majesty's darling child.

658
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,780
For that reason,

659
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,900
he approves of the man of your choice.

660
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,730
Their Majesties are making arrangements

661
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,690
for your wedding.

662
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,250
Her Majesty is in high spirits.

663
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,860
She urged me

664
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,570
to bring the wedding dress to you.

665
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,940
Heartfelt congratulations, Your Highness.

666
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,570
You are now

667
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,340
a bride-to-be.

668
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,420
I wish you a lifetime

669
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,730
full of happiness

670
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,650
with the one you love.

671
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,170
I'm rewarding

672
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,380
all of you.

673
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,940
Thank you, Your Highness.

674
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,170
Please,

675
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,050
get up.

676
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,210
Your Highness,

677
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,820
I was just leaving

678
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,420
when I heard Their Majesties

679
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,210
talking about your wedding.

680
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,570
They intend on inviting

681
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,380
General Yuan and Lieutenant Sha.

682
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,090
And

683
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,130
they need you over there
to talk over the arrangements.

684
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,170
Pingwei's there?

685
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,650
I'll be right over.

686
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,820
Try this on.

687
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,250
I had it specially tailored for you.

688
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:44,860
From now on,

689
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,820
you will host peace talks
as the Marquis of the North,

690
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,380
so you need to dress up nicely.

691
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,130
Why are you looking at me

692
00:41:59,130 --> 00:41:59,900
like that?

693
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,570
What? Surely a husband

694
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,130
can look at his wife?

695
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,340
And I'd love to do that every day.

696
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,820
What if...

697
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,090
I want to go back home in Yangzhou

698
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,250
while you're out there
leading your troops into battle?

699
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,940
Are you going to take me

700
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,170
everywhere you go?

701
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,860

702
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,500
they're going to think

703
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,940
that you are

704
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,530

when I went to Yangzhou to see you,

710
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,820
and then found out your father
took you to Linzhou instead,

711
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,130
I thought my plan had gone horribly wrong.

712

And that you would still have
to marry Qi Tianlei.

I shouldn't have let you return
