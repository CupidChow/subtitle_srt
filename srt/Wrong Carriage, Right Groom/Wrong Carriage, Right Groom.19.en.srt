00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,080
But I was worried

189
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,510
that cousin Ke might

190
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,240
have brought his bad habits from Jiangzhou

191
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,870
to our Qi Residence.

192
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,510
Didn't I tell you

193
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,390
not to guess or speculate randomly?

194
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,670
I'm just concerned

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
for the good of our Qi Residence.

196
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,510
I also hope that everyone
in our Qi Residence

197
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,390
will be safe,

198
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,960
and that Grandmother will live a long life.

199
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,150
Tianlei,

200
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,870
I've noticed that you've been

201
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,510
quite strong and healthy lately.

202
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,510
Of course,

203
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,150
part of it is thanks to Bingyan.

204
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,670
But the biggest credit

205
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,080
should go to cousin Ke.

206
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,270
What do you mean by that?

207
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,870
Cousin Ke

208
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,030
has gone through great efforts

209
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,480
and found a secret recipe
from a famous doctor.

210
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,910
He even managed to get 18 precious herbs

211
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,150
and had Fang Xiaoqiao

212
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,360
send them to my room every day.

213
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,270
Cousin Ke really did his best

214
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,270
for our Qi family’s only child.

215
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,790
Perhaps.

216
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,000
However,

217
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,910
there's something strange

218
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,600
about the flavour

219
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,720
of those precious herbs.

220
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,360
It's hard for me

221
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
to swallow each time I drink it.

222
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,870
But if I don't drink it,

223
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,510
I feel like I'm not doing justice
to cousin Ke's gesture.

224
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,510
So

225
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,670
I could only

226
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,270
pour it away slowly.

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,720
Pour it away?

228
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,000
Why did you pour it away?

229
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,480
Not all of it.

230
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,910
In fact, I kept a little bit of it

231
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,360
for a friend of mine
to drink on my behalf.

232
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,000
Day after day, until today.

233
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,750
Sure enough.

234
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,120
It's working wonders.

235
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,790
What friend?

236
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,870
This is it.

237
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,390
This is...

238
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,960
Grandmother,

239
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,150
with just a small sip
of the precious medicine,

240
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,030
this little mouse met its demise.

241
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,630
If I hadn't quietly

242
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,360
poured away a large pot of it every day,

243
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,910
would I have ended up

244
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,240
like this little mouse?

245
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,120
Those mice took the medicine

246
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,120
and became weak,

247
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,870
lethargic,

248
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,390
and eventually died.

249
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,550
Isn't this similar to what happened
to my elder brother in the past?

250
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,150
His health weakened day by day,

251
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
his spirit became more and more listless,

252
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,200
and he died at a young age.

253
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,630
Grandmother,

254
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,840
why

255
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,240
was my second brother bitten
to death by a poisonous snake

256
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,000
less than a year
after my elder brother's death?

257
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,510
Why did my original lively
and lovely sister,

258
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,320
Yansheng,

259
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,910
suddenly become mute overnight?

260
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,790
It seems that our Qi Residence is not

261
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,960
afflicted by any bad luck from Jiangzhou,

262
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,720
but rather, it's the presence

263
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,000
of an evil man with a fair face.

264
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,440
Grandmother,

265
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,750
there's an old friend
who wants to see you.

266
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,630
Old friend?

267
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,120
The blind abbess

268
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,550
who died of a sudden illness
when she last visited our home.

269
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,360
The abbess?

270
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,030
But

271
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,790
didn't she die that night?

272
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,600
Under the circumstances back then,

273
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
she was poisoned.

274
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,910
In order to find out who was behind it,

275
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,270
I used a trick to fake her death

276
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,000
and saved her as a witness.

277
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,120
I had no choice.

278
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,270
Please forgive me, Grandmother.

279
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,840
Come in, both of you.

280
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,840
Old Madam Qi,

281
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,200
please do me justice.

282
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,670
My son...

283
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,960
my son died unjustly.

284
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,440
Abbess,

285
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,670
please rise.

286
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,840
Tell me!

287
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,000
Tell me everything!

288
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,150
Young Master Ke.

289
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,600
Grandmother.

290
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,550
Grandmother.

291
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,200
Grandmother.

292
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,390
Tianlei?

293
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,790
Greetings, Grandmother.

294
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,000
You're here too, sister-in-law?

295
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,870
That's great.

296
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,240
Grandmother,

297
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,550
people from Yangzhou are here.

298
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,480
Who are they?

299
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,870
The in-laws,

300
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,510
Mr. Du and Young Master Du,

301
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,120
have arrived in Linzhou.

302
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,080
Why are my father and brother here?

303
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,030
Where are they now?

304
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
I've sent someone

305
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,960
to settle them in the living room.

306
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,910
Tianlei,

307
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,510
your father-in-law

308
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,440
really misses his daughter so much.

309
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,030
As soon as he enters,
he wants to see Bingyan.

310
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,150
Bingyan,

311
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,270
I haven't even seen my father-in-law yet.

312
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,440
Let's go back and change.

313
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,030
Shizhao,

314
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,750
I need to change as well.

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,150
Go to the living room
and keep the guests company.

316
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,440
Don't neglect them.

317
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,320
I'll be right back.

318
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,440
Yes, Grandmother.

319
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,840
Then I'll take care of them first.

320
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,510
You two take good care of the abbess.

321
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,750
Don't let anyone know.

322
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,600
Don't worry, Grandmother.

323
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,030
Let's go.

324
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,310
Ke Shizhao

325
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,270
is truly wicked.

326
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,550
He must have managed

327
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,270
to get the Du family here from Yangzhou.

328
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,270
What should we do?

329
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,400
Even if I dress up as Li Yuhu,

330
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,270
I won't become Du Bingyan.

331
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Don't be anxious.

332
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,750
How can I not be anxious?

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,880
The situation is getting urgent.
How can I not worry?

334
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,920
Listen,

335
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,590
call Xiaoxi here first.

336
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,480
Xiaoxi?

337
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,160
Yes.

338
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,440
Yeah!

339
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,160
She's a true member of the Du family.

340
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,830
Your Honour, I wonder if you know about...

341
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,590
Go on.

342
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,000
The Third Young Mistress
of the Qi Residence

343
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,640
was supposed to be Miss Du Bingyan,

344
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,880
the daughter of Mr. Du Zhixiang
from the Du family in Yangzhou.

345
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,030
But unexpectedly,

346
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,310
someone named Li Yuhu,

347
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,830
a notorious female thief,

348
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,240
actually impersonated Miss Du
and deceived everyone,

349
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,510
managing to infiltrate the Qi Residence.

350
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,240
According to my speculation,

351
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,030
the real Miss Du

352
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,720
might have been killed by her

353
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,790
or kidnapped and taken elsewhere.

354
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,920
Then why didn't you report her
to the authorities earlier,

355
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,680
instead of waiting
until today to invite us?

356
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,550
Your Honour,

357
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,160
we were also kept in the dark

358
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,880
and only discovered the slightest flaws

359
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,640
after spending a few days

360
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,200
with the fake Third Young Mistress.

361
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,440
So

362
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,790
you have evidence now?

363
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,880
Yes, the evidence

364
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,440
will come to light today.

365
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,270
It will expose the imposter.

366
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:51,960
Really?

367
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,920
Of course.

368
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,830
Your Honor,

369
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,880
our Young Master Ke has instructed us

370
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,960
that you only need to send four men

371
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,830
and bring some weapons.

372
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,640
Look.

373
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,640
What are you doing?

374
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,920
Am I the kind of person
who would do such a thing?

375
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,070
Your Honor, I'm sure you're not.

376
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,510
It's just a token of appreciation
from Young Master Ke.

377
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,030
A token.

378
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,790
Then let's consider it
a donation to the yamen

379
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,200
as a favour from Young Master Ke.

380
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,640
Yes, My lord.

381
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,680
But...

382
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,550
this is the last time.

383
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,400
Yes.

384
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,310
Mr. Du and Young Master Du.

385
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,440
You've had a long journey.

386
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,350
I'm sorry to have missed you.

387
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,680
No need to be so polite.

388
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,400
You must be Young Master Ke, right?

389
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,590
Yes, I'm Shizhao.

390
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,790
Mr. Du,

391
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,510
please have a seat.

392
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,960
Young Master Du, please have a seat.

393
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,550
Young Master Ke,

394
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
during these days,

395
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,550
our Du Residence has been busy
with business matters.

396
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,790
It can be described as

397
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,440
we've been rushed off our feet.

398
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,350
If you hadn't sent word

399
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,550
that my daughter is seriously ill
in Linzhou,

400
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
we wouldn't have been able

401
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,720
to leave Yangzhou.

402
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,720
Mr. Du,

403
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,790
we really appreciate you

404
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,070
making such a long trip to Linzhou.

405
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,220
I offer my sincere apologies.

406
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,610
But the good news is

407
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,980
that Bingyan has been treated
by a renowned doctor

408
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,460
and has recovered now.

409
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,570
Please rest assured,
Mr. Du and Young Master Du.

410
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,220
Good!

411
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,220
Young Master Ke,

412
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,570
where is Bingyan now?

413
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,530
I've sent someone to get her.

414
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,610
She'll be here soon.

415
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,940
Please wait for a moment.

416
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,980
Welcome!

417
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,980
Grandmother.

418
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,570
Welcome to our home, Mr. Du.

419
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,460
Greetings, Old Madam.

420
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,940
Greetings, Old Madam.

421
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,090
Young Master Du
is truly remarkable in appearance

422
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,050
as graceful as jade.

423
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,420
Brother-in-law,

424
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,460
you're blessed!

425
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,090
Old Madam, you're flattering me.

426
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,330
Thank you.

427
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,130
Please.

428
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,460
Please sit down.

429
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,130
Alright.

430
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,570
There you go.

431
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,290
Finally, we meet face to face.

432
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,290
Yeah.

433
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,460
I think we can do it this way.

434
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,610
I'm from the Du family.

435
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:53,980
Whatever I say,

436
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,660
Mr. Du will not doubt it.

437
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,050
I'll tell Mr. Du

438
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,660
that Your Ladyship

439
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,660
has been overjoyed

440
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,610
to hear of her father's visit

441
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,290
and fainted all of a sudden,

442
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,940
and that you need to rest.

443
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,460
I'll ask Mr. Du to come

444
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,220
and visit you at the Garden of Harmony.

445
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,740
No way!

446
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,460
If they come, I'll be exposed.

447
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,740
Xiaoxi,

448
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,290
let's do it your way.

449
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,260
Yuhu,

450
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,660
you go back and lie down first.

451
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,740
When Mr. Du arrives,

452
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,980
cover your head with a blanket.

453
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,220
Xiaoxi and I will act on the spot

454
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
to provide cover for you.

455
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,220
Let's try to get by first.

456
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,180
Third Young Master is right.

457
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,610
Your Ladyship, I'll go now.

458
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,980
Go ahead.

459
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,980
Yuhu, let's go too.

460
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,570
[Brother-in-law,]

461
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,740
[please have some tea.]

462
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,050
[Okay.]

463
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,530
Mr. Du!

464
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,420
Xiaoxi!

465
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,900
Xiaoxi,

466
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,900
your master and young master
are here to visit Bingyan.

467
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,050
Where is she?

468
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,090
Young master?

469
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,810
Old Madam

470
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,610
is with the guests from Yangzhou.

471
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,020
The fake Third Young Mistress
will be here soon.

472
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,770
Officials, please refrain
from making a scene.

473
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,090
Once she reveals her true identity

474
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,370
to the Du family,

475
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,530
you can take action then.

476
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,370
Alright.

477
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,260
Let's clap our hands as a signal.

478
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,570
Then you'll go in and shackle her.

479
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,460
Don't worry.

480
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:13,660
Xiaoxi,

481
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,770
I haven't seen you for days.

482
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,740
Have you served my sister Bingyan

483
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,370
well?

484
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,420
Xiao...

485
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,770
Xiaoxi pays respects to you, Young Master.

486
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:34,940
No need.

487
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,090
Xiaoxi.

488
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,530
Well,

489
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,570
where is your miss?

490
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,500
Her Ladyship...

491
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,610
Her Ladyship...

492
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,090
Mr. Du,

493
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,090
Her Ladyship was overjoyed

494
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,740
upon hearing you're here.

495
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,460
First, she burst into laughter.

496
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,090
Then she started crying while laughing.

497
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,460
Ever since Her Ladyship arrived in Linzhou,

498
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,090
She has been greatly concerned
about you and Madam.

499
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,980
Her Ladyship...

500
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,420
Her Ladyship...

501
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,810
What happened to her?

502
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,180
Her Ladyship got emotional

503
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,500
and fainted.

504
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:23,770
Quick!

505
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,940
Take me to see her.

506
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,500
Mr. Du! Young Master!

507
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,370
Watch your step.

508
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,570
Come.

509
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,610
Slow down.

510
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,370
You don't know the way.

511
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,220
Come with me.

512
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,370
Here.

513
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,900
Bingyan!

514
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,500
Bingyan!

515
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,570
Old Madam, take it easy.

516
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,660
Cover yourself with the blanket. Hurry up!

517
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,570
Bingyan.

518
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,660
Grandmother!

519
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,660
Tianlei,

520
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,370
what happened to Bingyan?

521
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,020
She...

522
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,260
Sister.

523
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:06,740
Sister!

524
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:10,770
Who are you?

525
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,330
How dare you trespass
in the Third Young Master's yard?

526
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,500
Get lost!

527
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,290
You blind dog!

528
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:17,980
Sister!

529
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,770
Sister!

530
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,570
It's me!

531
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,660
Sister!

532
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:48,810
Sister!

533
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:50,610
Sister!

534
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,220
I'm your brother.

535
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,570
Brother!

536
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,500
Good sister!

537
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,370
What's wrong?

538
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,020
We haven't seen each other for so long,

539
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,570
have you even forgotten your father?

540
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,420
Father!

541
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,700
Where did you come from?

542
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,290
I fell from the sky.

543
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,810
Brother! Father!

544
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,530
I miss you so much.

545
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,330
I want to go back to Yangzhou.

546
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,700
I want to go home.

547
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,180
Don't cry.

548
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,610
Father and I are here to see you.

549
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,370
Good girl. Don't cry.

550
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,370
Don't cry anymore.

551
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,050
A notorious female thief?

552
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,370
A fake Du Bingyan?

553
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,330
Look!

554
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,660
They're father and daughter,
brother and sister.

555
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,180
They're very close to each other.

556
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,020
No, sir.

557
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,610
It's a misunderstanding.

558
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,700
You're teasing us.

559
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,050
How dare you!

560
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:14,740
Sir!

561
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,700
I wouldn't dare to deceive you.

562
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,220
Luckily you paid us in advance.

563
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,370
Guys, let's go!

564
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,050
Sir!

565
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,420
Sir!

566
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,740
Tianlei,

567
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,330
come and pay your respects
to your father-in-law.

568
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,330
Greetings, father-in-law.

569
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,770
Good son-in-law.

570
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,940
No need to be so formal.

571
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,130
No need.

572
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,810
Brother-in-law,

573
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,900
you've come from afar,
it must have been a tough journey.

574
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,180
I'll prepare a feast in the evening

575
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,420
to welcome you and help you relax.

576
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,570
Old Madam, you're too kind.

577
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,020
Thank you!

578
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,370
Shizhao.

579
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:14,660
Grandmother.

580
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,260
Since Bingyan is in good health.

581
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,610
I'm relieved.

582
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,980
Go and inform the kitchen
to prepare the feast.

583
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,260
In the evening, both of our families

584
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,570
should gather together
and have a good time.

585
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,090
Yes.

586
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,660
Then I'll go prepare.

587
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,260
Go ahead.

588
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,290
Xiaoxi.

589
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,130
Take your Master and Young Master

590
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,980
to get some rest.

591
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,500
Yes, Old Madam.

592
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,460
Mr. Du, Young Master.

593
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,290
Please.

594
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,770
Stop laughing!

595
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,090
Tell me what's going on.

596
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,810
Well... I'm so confused by all this.

597
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,610
Don't you always

598
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,330
say you've got piercing eyes?

599
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,570
You can't even see through this?

600
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,570
Let me tell you something.

601
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,330
That person, my brother,

602
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,460
is actually a girl.

603
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,020
She

604
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,130
is the real Du Bingyan.

605
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,810
I see.

606
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
No wonder.

607
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,770
Thank goodness.

608
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,290
The real Du Bingyan has appeared,

609
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,460
and the fake one is safe now.

610
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,220
But shouldn't Du Bingyan

611
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,290
be in Jingzhou with General Yuan?

612
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,660
Why did she come from Yangzhou?

613
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,130
Exactly.

614
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,700
Why is that?

615
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,180
Could something

616
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,370
have happened in Jingzhou?

617
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,980
I'll have to ask her later.

618
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,130
Yuhu,

619
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,850
during dinner tonight,

620
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,770
you still have

621
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,370
to pretend to be Du Bingyan.

622
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,610
Don't worry.

623
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,810
I'll play the role

624
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,810
of the fake Du Bingyan well.

625
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,180
Come on.

626
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,050
The dishes are so abundant.

627
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,500
Tianlei's mother and second mother

628
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
have gone out to pray to the Buddha.

629
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,220
That's why

630
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,290
I'm here on their behalf

631
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,290
to welcome you.

632
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,130
Old Madam,

633
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,660
I wish you health,
happiness and a long life.

634
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,020
Good.

635
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,050
Let's drink together.

636
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:29,940
Okay.

637
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,570
Cheers!

638
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,260
Come on!

639
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,420
Come on!

640
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,570
Good wine!

641
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,940
Please sit.

642
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,370
Okay.

643
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,500
Brother-in-law,

644
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,900
your son is a man
of great talent and elegance.

645
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,130
You're truly blessed

646
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,500
to have such outstanding children.

647
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,130
Old Madam,

648
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,500
I'm flattered.

649
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,370
Frankly speaking,

650
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,500
I'm a latecomer in having children.

651
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,460
It took me a long time to have a...

652
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,660
to have a son

653
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,460
and a daughter.

654
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,740
It's truly a blessing from the heavens.

655
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,740
Come, let's eat.

656
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,420
Okay.

657
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,660
-Everyone, enjoy while it's hot.
-Let's eat.

658
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:46,700
Come.

659
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,850
Come on.

660
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,090
Old Madam,

661
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,940
my sister Bingyan

662
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,020
is the apple of my parents' eyes.

663
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,420
Since she married to Linzhou,

664
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,370
they have missed her every day.

665
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,570
A few days ago, a message came
from your residence

666
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,530
that my sister
suddenly fell seriously ill,

667
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,980
causing my mother to faint on the spot.

668
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,570
Mother?

669
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,050
Don't worry, sister.

670
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:14,940
Mother is fine.

671
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,940
Today, father and I are here

672
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,860
to see that you've recovered well.

673
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,650
We're relieved.

674
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,250
When we go back
and tell mother how you are doing,

675
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,380
she'll be very happy.

676
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,050
Come,

677
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,130
little sister,

678
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,170
let me toast you.

679
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,250
It's been a long time since we last met.

680
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,860
I miss you all the time.

681
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:38,940
Brother,

682
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,730
I miss you too.

683
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,860
Me... and me!

684
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:45,940
To toast with you.

685
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,380
By the way, brother,

686
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,610
who told you

687
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,650
that I was sick?

688
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,380
Didn't you get sick?

689
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,090
l've been in good health

690
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,690
since I came to Linzhou.

691
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,650
Then

692
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,460
that's strange.

693
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,340
The messenger to Yangzhou
must have been lying.

694
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,420
I'll look into this matter.

695
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,530
Who went to Yangzhou
to visit the brother-in-law?

696
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,900
It was the accountant, Wang Huzi.

697
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,500
Wang Huzi?

698
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,300
Grandmother, here's the thing.

699
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,530
I heard that there were two merchant ships
for sale in Yangzhou.

700
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,530
So l ordered him

701
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,900
to get the business

702
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,130
and send a safety message to Mr. Du.

703
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,570
But I didn't expect

704
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,530
that Wang Huzi was so full of shit.

705
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,500
Darn it.

706
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,460
Forget it.

707
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,610
If it weren't for the servant coming
to deliver the message,

708
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,300
it would have been rare for us

709
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,980
to visit and pay respects to Old Madam.

710
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,250
Come.

711
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,420
Let's raise a toast to Old Madam,

712
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,780
wishing her

713
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,780
good health,

714
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,300
happiness,

715
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,940
and eternal radiance.

716
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,820
Good! Cheers!

717
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,460
Cheers!

718
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,610
Is my father-in-law drunk?

719
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,020
No worries.

720
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,420
I can drink a lot.

721
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,250
Come on, son-in-law,

722
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,610
let's have...

723
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,210
another drink.

724
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,300
I'm a big drinker.

725
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,090
I won't drink anymore. I've had too much.

726
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,530
Father, are you choking on your drink?

727
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,420
Didn't you say we'd have a good show?

728
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,420
Didn't you say

729
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,020
the Third Young Mistress isn't Du Bingyan?

730
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,210
But now,

731
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,130
they're father and daughter,
brother and sister.

732
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:02,980
They're very close to each other.

733
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
What about us?
We've made a fuss for nothing.

734
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,530
You urged Old Madam

735
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,650
to arrange a warding-off wedding
for the Third Young Master.

736
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,500
But you got him a good wife

737
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,090
and brought yourself a nemesis instead.

738
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,130
That's enough.

739
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,250
Shut your mouth!

740
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,690
Go get Wang Huzi for me.

741
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,780
That loser

742
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,780
can't do anything right.

743
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,530
Do as I say!

744
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,780
Why are you talking so much?

745
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,980
I want to find out
what happened to Li Yuhu.

746
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,690
Your Ladyship!

747
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:51,980
Xiaoxi.

748
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,610
Your Ladyship!

749
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,780
Let me take a look. Are you okay?

750
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,250
Your Ladyship!

751
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,170
I've missed you so much.

752
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,820
Good Xiaoxi.

753
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,090
Look, I'm fine.

754
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,090
That's good.

755
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,210
Your Ladyship,

756
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,130
I was so happy to see you dressed as a man

757
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,050
in Old Madam's Hall that day.

758
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,300
Luckily, you're smart, Xiaoxi.

759
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
You didn't ruin our plan.

760
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,300
Our Xiaoxi is quick-witted.

761
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,940
If it weren't for her

762
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,530
reminding me to be dignified

763
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,210
and gentle every day,

764
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,300
I would have been exposed long ago.

765
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,130
Xiaoxi, you can go back to work.

766
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,300
I have something to say to Bingyan.

767
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,300
Are you laughing at my costume?

768
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,050
How dare I laugh at you?

769
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,820
I'm actually laughing at myself.

770
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,170
For what?

771
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,980
You know that?

772
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,570
When I first arrived in this courtyard,

773
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,730
I made a fool of myself,

774
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,690
mispronouncing the Garden of Harmony

775
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,460
as Kick the New Flower.

776
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,610
Did anyone hear it?

777
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,460
Qi Tianlei did.

778
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,690
He's a very astute man.

779
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,820
He immediately realised

780
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,610
l'm not the better-educated Du Bingyan.

781
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,460
He also set up some traps

782
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,300
to get my name out

783
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,250
and exposed me as Li Yuhu.

784
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,420
What happened after that?

785
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,730
I admitted it.

786
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,730
I said I'm Li Yuhu.

787
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,020
What can you do to me?

788
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,300
I'm here to suffer in your Qi family

789
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,650
on behalf of sister Bingyan.

790
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,730
Once you're dead,

791
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,780
I'll go back to Yangzhou.

792
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,300
Isn't Qi Tianlei angry

793
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,530
with what you said?

794
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,820
He

795
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,820
loves playing pranks on me

796
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,500
and is obedient to me.

797
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,250
There's nothing he can do about it.

798
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,170
How is

799
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,980
Qi Tianlei's health?

800
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,940
Although in front of outsiders,

801
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,690
He may seem

802
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,980
frail

803
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,500
and thin.

804
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,820
In fact,

805
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:24,820
he's very strong.

806
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,650
This is the good job you've done?

807
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,730
You said Du Bingyan is Li Yuhu?

808
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,020
I've made such a big joke out of it!

809
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,570
No.

810
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,570
Young Master.

811
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,820
At that time,
the Third Young Mistress did say

812
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,940
that her name is Li Yuhu.

813
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,170
I risked my life

814
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,500
to get you this information.

815
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,420
If I hadn't come up
with a clever idea at the last moment

816
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,820
and scattered a handful of dust to her,

817
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,940
I would have been caught.

818
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,500
Useless!

819
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,300
How could she reveal her real name

820
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,300
to you?

821
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,050
If she reveals that she's Sun Yuhu

822
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,170
or Zhao Yuhu.

823
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,210
Do you believe it too?

824
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:08,820
But

825
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,610
how could the precious daughter

826
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,300
of the Du family

827
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,820
have martial arts skills?

828
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,130
Who knows?

829
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,210
Young Master,

830
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,730
do you think it's possible

831
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,300
that Mr. Du secretly had his daughter
and son

832
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,300
learn martial arts
for the sake of their family's property,

833
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,610
and then kept it a secret from the public?

834
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,820
Do you think it's possible?

835
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,250
Is it possible?

836
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,570
It's definitely possible.

837
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,530
If that's really the case,

838
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,050
I'm afraid

839
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,130
there will be a lot of trouble.

840
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,820
Young Master, you're right.

841
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,020
Get lost!

842
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,130
Sister Bingyan,

843
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,130
I heard from Master Ruoqian

844
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,650
that you suffered a lot for me

845
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,300
in the border.

846
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,420
I really feel guilty.

847
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,530
I feel sorry for you.

848
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,090
Don't say that.

849
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,730
Yuhu,

850
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,300
even though you're
living a life of luxury here,

851
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,500
the Qi Residence is filled
with hidden dangers,

852
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,650
and crises abound.

853
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:21,820
Besides,

854
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,420
even though life was tough

855
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,050
in the border,

856
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,020
my heart was at peace.

857
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,730
Then who made your heart

858
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,820
so peaceful?

859
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,610
I know even if you don't tell me.

860
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,980
It's General Yuan.

861
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,170
You're shy!

862
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,500
In fact, you asked Master Ruokian

863
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,690
to give me the crystal goose,

864
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,610
I could have guessed

865
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,980
you and General Yuan were in love.

866
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,170
At that time,

867
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,780
Tianlei even said something stupid.

868
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,820
What did he say?

869
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,610
He said

870
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,820
that it was a perfect match.

871
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,090
Fish matches fish, shrimp matches shrimp.

872
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,420
Turtle matches turtle.

873
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,650
The last line is really silly,

874
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,300
so I made some changes.

875
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,300
Hero matches talented woman.

876
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,860
Frog matches toad.
