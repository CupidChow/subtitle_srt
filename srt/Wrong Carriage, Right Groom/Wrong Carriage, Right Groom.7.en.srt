[Qi Residence]

20
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,000
[Recently,]

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,430
the Qi Residence has been afflicted with

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,350
many unsettling events.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,480
What do you mean?

24
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,430
My reserved and honest eldest brother,

25
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,430
Qi Tianxiang,

26
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,400
grew weaker by the day.

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,710
He was once a robust and healthy guy,

28
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,910
but he suddenly became unconscious

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,870
and passed away just like that.

30
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,590
Less than a year after
my eldest brother's passing,

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,750
misfortune also befell my second brother.

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,910
My second brother, Qi Tianfang,
was carefree by nature

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,630
but not spoiled.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,960
He had a much stronger physique than me.

35
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,470
If he could have overcome
his frivolous habits,

36
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,630
he could have been a

37
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,960
valuable asset to the Qi family.

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,840
But on that

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,520
hot summer night,

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,470
Tianfang

41
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,840
slept on a cool mat with the windows ajar.

42
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,750
Late into the silent night,

43
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,710
he was struck by snake venom

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,030
and didn't survive.

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,590
That's odd.

46
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,560
Why would such poison

47
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,960
appear in the manor?

48
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,030
Following the

49
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,080
consecutive deaths of my brothers,

50
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,590
a rumor has spread
through the Qi Residence,

51
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,750
claiming that the third son of the
Qi Mansion will not live past the age of 25.

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,750
Back then,

53
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,280
I was scared out of my wits
and couldn't sleep properly.

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,960
My health went downhill.

55
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,080

56
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,240

57
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,520
I was utterly defeated.

58
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,590
I felt like

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,520

60
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,030

61
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,800
So, I spent a whole day

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,150
ditching all the maids and servants,

63
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,310
and I ran off to

64
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,960

70

that there was still hope for me.

71
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,390
My grandmother then kept him at our place,

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,120
and he ended up becoming my master.

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,870
He even taught me
some martial arts skills.

74
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,000
Seems like

75

83

and got a grasp
of the Qi family's situation.

84
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,950

86
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,630

has turned into a cunning
wolf with murderous intent.

92
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,160
He even advised me

93
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,920
to keep a low profile

94
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,830

You've been training
in martial arts since you were young

127

and are a true martial artist.

128

139
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,600
The day when you returned
after gaining victory,

140
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,150
you were on your horse,
and I was beside you.

141
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,030
No.

142
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,670
Let me get your bandage changed.

143
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,200
I'll do it.

144
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,240
This is...

145
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,870
I was injured in a battle
against a different tribe.

146
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,670
We fought for a week straight,

147
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,600
but it was worth it.

148
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,320
This wound

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,550
seems over three inches deep.

150
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,750
They're all old wounds.

151
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,320
This was caused
by the betrayal of a former comrade.

152
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,030
I couldn't fend off the hidden arrows
from behind.

153
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,790
Your dedication to the country
and its people

154
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,720
and your willingness to sacrifice yourself

155
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,320
are truly inspiring.

156
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,030
I'm surprised a young apothecary like you

157
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,750
would understand such profound principles.

158
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,320
I've had a bit of schooling before this.

159
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,550
I should change your medicine now.

160
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,670
It might sting a little.

161
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,870
Hang in there.

162
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,480
Master has repeatedly emphasized

163
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,080
that arrow wounds are hard to heal,

164
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,000
especially poisoned arrow wounds

165
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,200

General,

167
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,270

Alright.

169
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,240
I'll help you get dressed.

170
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,360
General,

171
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,320
your place seems disorganized.

172
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,720
How about I help you tidy up a bit?

173
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,670
Okay.

174
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,360
Pingwei.

175
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,510
You mentioned

176
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,030
that the General had lost two wives.

177
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,270
What's the story behind that?

178
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,240
His first wife died
from childbirth complications.

179
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,600
Neither the mother nor the child made it.

180
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,080
What about his second wife?

181
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,440
It seems like she

182
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,790
accompanied the General
on a distant expedition

183
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,150
to the southwestern border

184
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,870
but fell seriously ill
and couldn't recover.

185
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,240
Don't you know
how to serve your uncle some water?

186
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,720
Sorry about that.

187
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,360
I have a question.

188
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,320
Didn't General Yuan

189
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,080
send someone

190
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,270
to chase after that woman who fled?

191
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,600
The General is swamped with battles.

192
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,910
He wouldn't have time for this.

193
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,360
He said he'd

194
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,440
respect the lady's wishes.

195
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,550
Pingwei,

196
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,750
you should look up to General Yuan
in the future.

197
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,360
I got it, Uncle.

198
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,320
You've said it like a broken record.

199
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,480
This helps strengthen your body.

200
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,670
Make sure to take care of yourself.

201
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,670
Thank you, Uncle.

202
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,670
You're always so clueless.

203
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,480
I'm not.

204
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,510
[What's going on?]

205
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,000
[These two...]

206
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,870
[Wait.]

207
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,600
[She's obviously a girl.]

208
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,480
[Du Bin.]

209
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,550
[Du Bin?]

210
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,440
[She's not Du Bingyan.]

211
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,030
But she is indeed a bride.

212
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,240
[His name is Du Bingyan]

213
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,360
[with a character short.]

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,600
General,

215
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,240
it's time for lunch.

216
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,550
This seems like a feast.

217
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,270
You've been poisoned by an arrow,

218
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,750
so you need to watch what you eat.

219
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,440
I've picked out some ingredients

220
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,390
that can help with recovery.

221
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,390
Give it a taste.

222
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,910
Oh, I almost forgot

223
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,150
you're still injured.

224
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,390
I should feed you.

225
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:21,960
It's fine.

226
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,320
I'm a dignified general.

227
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,200
I can't allow that.

228
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,270
You may be the general,

229
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,670
but you're my patient now.

230
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,720
We follow your lead on the battlefield,

231
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
but by the sickbed,

232
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,270
you'll have to listen to me.

233
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,080
Let me feed you.

234
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,240
How does it taste?

235
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,870
Being a seasoned warrior,

236
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,320
I've rarely had warm meals.

237
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,600
Having something warm to drink
is a real treat.

238
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Have some more, then.

239
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,780
[Qi Residence]

240
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,910
Xiaoqiao,

241
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,030
what brings you here?

242
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,240
I'm here to deliver
Third Young Master his medicine.

243
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,390
Hold on.

244
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,390
Young Mistress,

245
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,720
Xiaoqiao is here to give
Third Young Master his medicine.

246
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,960
Third Young Mistress,

247
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,690
the medicine is ready.

248
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,940
Third Young Master has to drink it

249
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,460
so that Old Madam can be at ease.

250
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,850
He's already asleep.

251
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,700
Leave it to me.

252
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,570
You can go rest.

253
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,290
Xiaoqiao,

254
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,740
Third Young Master is already asleep,

255
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,420
and he isn't feeling well.

256
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,610
I'll thank you on his behalf.

257
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,900
You should head back now.

258
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,050
You need to wake up early tomorrow.

259
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,850
Goodbye.

260
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,020
Third...

261
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,770
They're dying because

262
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,900
they drink this every day.

263
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,850
I finally understand

264
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,810
why you've been raising these mice.

265
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,610
Remember to take one dose per day.

266
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,220
Here, Du Bin.

267
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,090
Follow me.

268
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,330
Next.

269
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:31,980
Thank you.

270
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,090
You're almost back in shape.

271
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,570
Du Bin,

272
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,090
get him some more Type B Pills.

273
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,610
Okay.

274
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,740
Type B.

275
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,940
Du Bin, how's work?

276
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,460
Thanks.

277
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,260
Why are you here?

278
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,460
Uncle,

279
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,700
could you prescribe me
the pills from last time?

280
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,740
Du Bin,

281
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,610
get him a Type B Pill.

282
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,220
Du Bin,

283
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,740
this pill work wonders.

284
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,180
Uncle, why don't you
prescribe Du Bin some?

285
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,850
Do you have nothing to do?

286
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:08,980
Should I ask

287
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,660
the general
to give you some extra training?

288
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,500
Forget it. I'm fine.

289
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:16,940
Thanks.

290
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,660
Get moving now.

291
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,220
Du Bin,

292
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,900
take a seat.

293
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,180
Let me check your pulse.

294
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:47,700
Me?

295
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,460
Give me your right hand.

296
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,850
Master, I...

297
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,330
[Just as I expected.]

298
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,570
I'll write you a prescription later.

299
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,700
Check it out when you're alone.

300
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,570
[Come to Linzhou with a carriage.]

301
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,980
[Hard journey
to make it to the border town.]

302
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,940
[A lady disguised to get in the barrack.]

303
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,130
[Prescription]
[Put on a good show in the General's tent.]

304
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,460
[Don't forget there are strict rules.]

305
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,290
[Be careful not to risk your life.]

306
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,700
[If you need my help,]

307
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,460
[we'll meet tomorrow
to discuss the details.]

308
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,570
Du Bin.

309
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:58,900
Master.

310
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,050
This medicine I prescribed you

311
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,220
isn't too unpleasant, is it?

312
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,980
No, not at all.

313
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,460
I've roamed the world
and saved many lives.

314
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,290
Du Bin, I'm confident in curing

315
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,460
your ailment.

316
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,460
General,

317
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,700
as per your instructions,

318
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,420
I've checked our military records.

319
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,810
There's no one named Du Kui

320
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,050
serving currently.

321
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,610
We had people from Yangzhou

322
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,700
among the cavalry from two years ago,

323
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,530
but they were redeployed
to the south last year.

324
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,770
[General, are you inside?]

325
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,050
You may leave.

326
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:50,850
Yes, General.

327
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,900
General.

328
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,530
Du Bin.

329
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:04,900
General,

330
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,660
I'm here to examine your wounds.

331
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,130
Master,

332
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,420
the General's wounds are all healed.

333
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,050
Alright.

334
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,130
General,

335
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,420
let me check your pulse again.

336
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,700
Go ahead, Mr. Liu.

337
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,500
Don't worry, General.

338
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,050
Two more days, and you'll
be ready to join the battle.

339
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,980
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

340
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:01,980
Du Bin,

341
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,500
I had someone check the military records.

342
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,700
We don't have anybody named Du Kui here.

343
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,570
My brother is not here?

344
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,130
But...

345
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,460
But back then...

346
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,260
What brings you to the military camp?

347
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:22,900
I...

348
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:23,770
-I...
-General,

349
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,260
my disciple was

350
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,330
still a kid

351
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,810
when he started following me.

352
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,530
He couldn't fathom the
intricacies of military affiliations.

353
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,180
All he remembered was his
brother enlisting in the army.

354
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,330
That's why he

355
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,260
traveled with me
across various military camps.

356
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,500
I see.

357
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,130
[Buqu.]

358
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:47,570
[Buqu,]

359
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,090
the enemy
is challenging us to battle again.

360
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,330
Not again.

361
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,220
They even bought cavalries this time.

362
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,900
They might charge our camp.

363
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,180
Get my battle armor ready.

364
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,420
Wait.

365
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,180
You can't join the fight today.

366
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,900
Aggravating the wound
could impede its healing.

367
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,220
Mr. Liu, we can't afford to wait.

368
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:05,770
Pingwei,

369
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,050
gather a hundred archers

370
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:07,900
to confront the enemy.

371
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,850
I'll monitor their movements.

372
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:09,610
Yes.

373
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,740
General.

374
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,090
Du Bin and I will go with you

375
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:13,940
to be on the safe side.

376
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:24,980
[Jincheng Town]

377
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,180
General,

378
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,260
the enemy has been challenging us
for two days.

379
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,290
They have cavalry in the front
and infantry in the rear.

380
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,180
It seems they're planning a camp assault.

381
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,130
They're emphasizing their cavalry
this time,

382
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,570
trying to exploit our weaknesses.

383
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,460
Our archers and long spearmen

384
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,660
are ready for action.

385
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,260
It's unlikely the enemy
will attempt a direct attack.

386
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,370
We should split into units,

387
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,020
maneuver around, engage the enemy,

388
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,940
or feign defeat

389
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,770
to lure them into our trap.

390
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,460
What if they attempt a direct attack?

391
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,740
Well...

392
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,940
We'll have to face them head-on then.

393
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,810
-He's right.
-What if it's a direct attack?

394
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,370
Yeah.

395
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:46,810
Anything else?

396
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,900
General,

397
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,900
although I've never fought in battles,

398
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,330
I've studied some military literature

399
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,180
and have a strategy to propose.

400
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,130
Would you be open to hearing it?

401
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,770
Of course. Please go ahead.

402
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,940
While Master and I were
working in the military camp,

403
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,700
we noticed that the enemy forces
had been persistently disrupted by our army

404
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,460
and were low on supplies
due to distance from support.

405
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,610
Their troops and horses

406
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,850
appear exhausted and fatigued.

407
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,130
While I was on the lookout from the tower,

408
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,130
I noticed the same indicators.

409
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,220
What supports your claim?

410
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,460
Lately,

411
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,460
I've been observing from the tower

412
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,420
while the enemies are cooking.

413
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,770
I noticed that they use large iron pots

414
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,330
for cooking in their camp.

415
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,460
Using our own camp as a reference,

416
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,180
I deduced
that approximately thirty soldiers

417
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,900
share a single pot and stove.

418
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,810
This plan simplifies mobility and combat.

419
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,660
They arrange themselves in thirties.

420
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,330
I guess

421
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,220
the enemy has a similar approach.

422
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,460
Moreover, I realized

423
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,330
that recently,

424
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,050
the enemy's cooking frequency

425
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,090
has visibly decreased.

426
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,660
How do you know that?

427
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,740
Jincheng Town is dry.

428
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,940
To start a fire,

429
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,810
a specific type of dry twig is needed.

430
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,330
While these twigs burn easily,

431
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,770
they also produce dense smoke.

432
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,940
Lately, I noticed

433
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,850
a significant reduction
in the enemy's smoke.

434
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,660
In such circumstances,

435
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,660
there's only one likely explanation.

436
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,020
They're running low on food.

437
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,850
Looks like you've figured it out too.

438
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,330
You are meticulous

439
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,130
and keen.

440
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,940
Well done.

441
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Given this military situation,

442
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,610
do you have any strategies in mind?

443
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,020
Well,

444
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,020
considering the enemy's soldiers
are starving,

445
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,300
their horses

446
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,570
must be starving too.

447
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,170
In that case,

448
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,300
why not

449
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,890
distribute some freshly cooked black beans

450
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,610
to our front-line soldiers

451
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,740
and scatter them on the ground

452
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,740
when the enemy cavalry approaches?

453
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,650
Wait, Du Bin.

454
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,090
The enemy is about to attack our city,

455
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,540
and you want to feed them?

456
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,810
That doesn't seem like a wise plan.

457
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,300
Continue.

458
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:58,740
The aroma

459
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,780
of black beans will waft through the air,

460
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,370
and once the starving horses

461
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,020
catch the scent of black beans,

462
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,890
they're likely to scatter
in all directions

463
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,610
and disregard the enemy's commands.

464
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,700
We can use this chance

465
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,540
to launch a surprise attack.

466
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,850
Take my orders.

467
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,890
Yes.

468
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,410
Do as Du Bin said.

469
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,700
Get ready now.

470
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,460
Roger.

471
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,180
[Jincheng Town]

472
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:00,170
Retreat.

473
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:00,890
Let's go.

474
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,300
-Quick.
-Hurry up.

475
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,220
Master,

476
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,570
this question has been bugging me.

477
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,700
How do you know both my name, Du Bingyan,

478
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,570
and the name of that girl?

479
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,060
In fact, I know everything.

480
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,700
Miss Du from the Du family in Yangzhou

481
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,570
was supposed to marry

482
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,700
Qi Tianlei
from the Qi Residence in Linzhou.

483
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,130
Meanwhile, Yuan Buqu from Jingzhou

484
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,500
was set to marry

485
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,170
Li Yuhu from the Li Residence in Yangzhou.

486
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,370
You two ladies wed on the same day,

487
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,700
rode in bridal sedans together,

488
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,060
and entered the Fairy Temple
at the same time.

489
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,540
You mistakenly took the wrong veils

490
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,300
and ended up in the wrong carriages.

491
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,980
Master,

492
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,020
how do you know everything?

493
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,980
Well, I have a knack for fortune-telling.

494
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,940
People call me

495
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,370
Fortuneteller Liu.

496
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:38,850
Master,

497
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,850
it's truly an honor for me

498
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,980
to become your disciple in this lifetime.

499
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,740
From now on,

500
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,890
I want to learn medicine, swordsmanship,

501
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,300
martial arts,

502
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,610
and foreseeing the future from you.

503
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,500
Sounds like you're planning to learn

504
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,780
all of my lifelong skills.

505
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,060
Even if you're my daughter,

506
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,780
I might not teach you everything.

507
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,130
Well, Master,

508
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,540
what about...

509
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,020
What?

510
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,610
Please take me in as your adopted daughter.

511
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,500
I'll be glad
to have a smart adopted daughter like you.

512
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:17,940
Adoptive Father,

513
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,060
please accept a bow from me.

514
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,460
Come on up.

515
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,500
Bingyan,

516
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,250
I'm not

517
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,570
some kind of prodigy.

518
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,290
I came from Linzhou.

519
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,570
The Third Young Master of the Qi family

520
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,980
is also my disciple.

521
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,210
Tianlei is pretending to be sick

522
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,650
to deal with those wicked people
in the mansion.

523
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:41,690
Right,

524
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,420
Yuhu is incredibly skilled
in martial arts.

525
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,860
Both of them seem to be

526
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,290
a match made in heaven.

527
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,900
Fate is inexplicable.

528
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,730
Things took an unexpected turn in Linzhou,

529
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,020
and a fortuitous match was made.

530
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,500
If the two of you could

531
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,210
hit it off in Jingzhou,

532
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,540
then you married the right person,

533
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,980
although you got into
the wrong bridal sedan.

534
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:07,980
Master.

535
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,980
Stop calling me Master.

536
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,570
Adoptive Father.

537
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,540
Stop making me blush.

538
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:16,860
Du Bin,

539
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,020
I've been looking for you.

540
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,290
Your strategy was truly brilliant.

541
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,540
We managed to defeat

542
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,690
the enemy's cavalry.

543
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,250
Really?

544
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:26,940
Lieutenant Sha,

545
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,380
tell us about it.

546
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,900
What do you want to know?

547
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,090
The story about the black beans?

548
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,380
Yes. What exactly happened?

549
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,570
Well,

550
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,250
scattering black beans

551
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,090
might sound like a small move.

552
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,980
But it's actually a brilliant strategy.

553
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,460
When the enemy's warhorses

554
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,690
catch a whiff of that black bean aroma,

555
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,980
they all lower their heads

556
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,340
and start searching for beans to munch on.

557
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,570
That's when we strike.

558
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,060
Our war drums sounded like thunder

559
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,290
as we charged ahead.

560
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,500
The enemy was taken aback,

561
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,570
and their leadership crumbled.

562
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,900
We charge straight into their main camp

563
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,730
like slicing through vegetables
with a knife,

564
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,980
and we emerge victorious.

565
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,380
Take a guess.

566
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,020
Who do you think proposed the idea?

567
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:08,770
Who is it?

568
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,460
Lieu-Lieutenant Sha,

569
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,860
we have no idea.

570
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,570
Just spill the beans!

571
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,090
Yea.

572
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:14,980
Let me tell you.

573
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,060
It's none other than

574
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,690
my clever brother,

575
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,090
Du Bin.

576
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,860
-Du Bin?
-Who is Du Bin?

577
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,380
Buqu, you're here.

578
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,540
General.

579
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,060
I asked you to train them,

580
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,770
and you're goofing around.

581
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,540
The guys are worn out.

582
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,730
Give them a break.

583
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,090
I wonder who criticized

584
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,060
the idea at first.

585
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,690
Well, Buqu...

586
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,900
How are your injuries recovering?

587
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,090
It's nothing serious.

588
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:58,980
That's good to hear.

589
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,340
I'm here today

590
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,860
to let everyone know

591
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:04,900
that we're

592
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:05,980
throwing

593
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,290
a celebration feast tonight right here.

594
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,860
Everyone's

595
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,690
expected to be there.

596
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,570
No excuses.

597
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,420
Buqu,

598
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,690
do we have enough meat and alcohol?

599
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,500
All you think about

600
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,060
is eating and drinking.

601
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,210
I...

602
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,090
Of course.

603
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,460
Have a hearty drink tonight.

604
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,570
-Great!
-Amazing!

605
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:36,730
-Thank you, General.
-Thank you, General.

606
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,380
Thank you, Buqu.

607
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,340
Thank you, General.

608
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,210
Go on with your story.

609
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,130
After you're done,
make sure they get some rest.

610
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:43,860
Okay.

611
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:56,860
Adoptive Father,

612
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,540
we're running out of medicinal herbs.

613
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,770
The medicine chest is almost empty.

614
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,650
What should we do?

615
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,900
I'll go back to Linzhou
to fetch some herbs.

616
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,020
And I can also check on

617
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,380
Yuhu and Tianlei.

618
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,540
By the way, Adoptive Father.

619
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,940
Give me a second.

620
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,570
Adoptive Father,

621
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,940
I found this today.

622
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,130
Adoptive Father,

623
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,730
what is this?

624
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
These are tokens of two infatuated souls.

625
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,420
I have a senior named Feng Che.

626
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,610
He was a brilliant medical practitioner.

627
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,340
He saved countless patients back then,

628
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,020
but sadly,

629
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,570
he couldn't save himself.

630
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,170
Why does this lotus

631
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,820
only have half its petals?

632
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,380
Where's the other half?

633
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,060
Also,

634
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,020
what happened to

635
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,420
Mr. Feng

636
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,940
you mentioned earlier?

637
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,380
This half-golden lotus

638
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,980
is a token of affection

639
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,860
between my senior and the woman he loved.
