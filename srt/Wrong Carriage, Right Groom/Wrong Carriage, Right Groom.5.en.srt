131
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,630
that a gentleman
should not covet what belongs to others.

132
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,830

134
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,190
I shouldn't covet you either.

Don't be so hard on yourself.

143
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,830
The affairs of love between men and women

144
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360

145

147
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,510

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,030
[We've won the war!]

186
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,390
[The General is back.]

187
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,000
[We've won the war!]

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
The General is back.

189
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,910
Where's the General?

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,480
Didn't he return to the camp in victory?

191
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,790
Didn't they all just pass by a while ago?

192
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,510
The Grand General has returned victorious.

193
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
He's finally back!

194
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,360
Big brother,

195
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,390
what are you looking at?

196
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,960
I see that the lake water flows out

197
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,840
from those rocks.

198
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,720
[Lake]

199
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,750
Why isn't it marked?

200
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,270
It's a small hill.

201
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,260
We also have our sentries stationed there.

202
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,340
Have you explored it?

203
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,770
In the water?

204
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,170
No, we haven't.

205
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,290
If the enemy comes through the waterway,

206
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,340
they could bypass our sentries

207
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,500
and head straight to our main camp.

208
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,770
The lake is surrounded by cliffs.

209
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,100
There's no way anyone could get up there.

210
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,980
You haven't explored it,

211
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,930
and how do you know it's impossible?

212
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:12,930
Doctor Du.

213
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,220
You're still up so late?

214
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:57,810
Big brother.

215
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,410
I'm going to the lake to check it out.

216
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,020
Do you want me to accompany you?

217
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,860
Enjoy your tea.

218
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:09,460
♪A skiff slides along amid the spring breeze♪

219
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:16,300
♪Your voice by my ear is more pleasant than
the sound of raindrops against plantain leaves♪

220
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,420

221
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,100

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,260
♪A saunter in Yangzhou in the rain♪

224
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,620

♪I pledged undying love to you♪

227
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,690
This is an important part of the barracks.

228
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,650
No women allowed.

229
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
How did you get in here?

230
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,340
Who are you? Where are you from?

231
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,460
Tell me now!

232
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,930
Or I'lll make a move.

233
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,890
Let me put my clothes back on
before you ask.

234
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,340
Okay?

235
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,740
Trying to run away, huh?

236
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,500
Who are you? Speak up!

237
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:40,410
I...

238
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,530
I...

239
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,020
I'm

240
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,220
the General's wife.

241
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,020
What did you say?

242
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,650
[Phew, that was close.]

243
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,410
[Scared the hell out of me.]

244
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,860
[Is this a dream?]

245
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,980
No, this is not a dream.

246
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,620
[Who are you? Speak up!]

247
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,380
I'm the General's wife.

248
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,260
Lieutenant Sha.

249
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,260
Lieutenant Sha.

250
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,620
Say it.

251
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,890
The General seems
to have something on his mind.

252
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,100
Well, leading troops into battle
naturally brings worries.

253
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,620
No.

254
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,100
I saw the General sitting
in a daze early this morning.

255
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,500
He didn't even eat breakfast.

256
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,460
[Who is this woman exactly?]

257
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,460
Big brother!

258
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,220
Big brother,

259
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,500
you really have something on your mind.

260
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,850
What's on my mind?

261
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,940
Did you forget

262
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,370
about the promise you made to me earlier?

263
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,850
What promise?

264
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,570
My little brother, Du,

265
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,570
wants to see you.

266
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,290
Who?

267
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,290
Du, my little brother.

268
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:29,390
Oh, yes!
Du, my little brother.

269
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:29,850
Oh, yes!

270
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,940
He's my Uncle's apprentice.

271
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,700
Tell him I don't have time.

272
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:37,980
Big brother,

273
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,900
he's been waiting for you for days.

274
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,090
Don't you know?

275
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,020
This Du Bin is as pretty as

276
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,220
a porcelain doll.

277
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,900
And he's got a good head on his shoulders.

278
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,130
Not only is he intelligent and clever,

279
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,460
but he is also very kind,

280
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,460
taking good care of our wounded soldiers.

281
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,020
Just take it as a favor to me.

282
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,770
Help out. Meet him, please.

283
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,050
Big brother.

284
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,260
Alright. Bring him to meet me.

285
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:10,900
Yeah!

286
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,900
Thank you, brother.

287
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,850
Du Bin.

288
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,420
Haven't you always wanted
to meet Brother Yuan?

289
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,770
I've arranged it for you.

290
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,020
Let's go now.

291
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:29,770
Now?

292
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,260
Right.

293
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,420
But I'm not ready yet.

294
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,700
What do you need to prepare?

295
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,980
My brother doesn't eat people.

296
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,130
Come on, let's go.

297
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,260
Hurry up.

298
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,290
No, you...

299
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,570
This is an important place
in the military camp.

300
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,610
No close contact is allowed.

301
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,180
What's with all the fuss?

302
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,370
Why are you acting like my brother?

303
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,220
Lieutenant Sha!

304
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,130
Enemy attack!

305
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,370
Du Bin, you go back first.

306
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,330
Gather round! Hurry up!

307
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:52,660
Report!

308
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,050
There are four enemy forces.

309
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,700
The left, centre, and right
are surrounded by three units.

310
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,370
And one with unknown whereabouts.

311
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,050
Kill them!

312
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,900
Kill!

313
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,460
Big brother.

314
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,700
Are you alright?

315
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,700
I'm fine.

316
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:02,980
Be careful.

317
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,130
Big brother!

318
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,500
Go!

319
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,610
-Go!
-Go, now!

320
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,460
Big brother!

321
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,700
Big brother!

322
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,130
Big brother!

323
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,980
Big brother!

324
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,570
Du Bin!

325
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,570
Take off his clothes

326
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,410
and clean the wound.

327
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,810
Get ready to pull out the arrow
and heal the poison.

328
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,700
What are you waiting for?
Take off his clothes!

329
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,220
Quickly!

330
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,170
Use scissors.

331
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,650
Pingwei!

332
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,610
Run!

333
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,220
Run!

334
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:41,980
Du Bin.

335
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,300
Alright.

336
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,500
Use the Anaesthesia Powder.

337
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:44,780
Give me the scissors.

338
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,500
Run!

339
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,090
Pingwei!

340
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:51,980
Ping...

341
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,220
Trying to run away, huh?

342
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,090
Who are you? Speak up!

343
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
[It's him!]

344
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,540
Don't cover it up.

345
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,460
Get up! Get up!

346
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:21,890
Make way!

347
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,460
Don't talk rubbish.

348
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,740
It's gonna be okay.

349
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,410
There won't be any problem for sure.

350
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,850
What exactly happened?

351
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,780
It's all because of him.

352
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,330
The General is a kind man.

353
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,330
He would've saved whoever it was.

354
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:13,940
That's right.

355
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,810
He got our General into this.

356
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:25,650
[Qi Residence]

357
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,610
Okay.

358
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,650
Young Master,

359
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,130
you're back.

360
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:34,980
Come.

361
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:35,940
This way, please.

362
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,810
You're finally back!

363
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,260
I have something to tell you.

364
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,650
A few days ago,

365
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,850
a wild boy showed up
at Qi Residence out of nowhere

366
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,220
and requested to see the Old Madam.

367
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,540
From his accent,

368
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,570
I could tell he was from Jiangzhou.

369
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,170
I wondered if it had something to do

370
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,850
with what happened to you in Jiangzhou.

371
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,940
So I didn't dare let him see the Old Madam

372
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,060
and stopped him
at the gate of our Qi Residence.

373
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,330
Unexpectedly,

374
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,610
that boy started causing a ruckus
and cursing at our Qi Residence.

375
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,410
Jiangzhou?

376
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,330
He's nothing

377
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,060
but a little rascal from Jiangzhou.

378
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,060
What did you do with him?

379
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,370
How can I let him go?

380
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,570
I beat him so badly
that he cried for help.

381
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,890
But then,

382
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,700
the Third Young Master happened to pass by

383
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,940
and let him go.

384
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,780
The Third Young Master?

385
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,940
Did he hear

386
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,220
what that little rascal said?

387
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,060
No, he didn't.

388
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,220
He just asked
what nonsense he was spouting.

389
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,740
You told him?

390
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,540
How... how could I?

391
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,740
It involves you, Young Master.

392
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,260
So the Third Young Master only scolded him

393
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,650
and let him go

394
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,650
in front of all of you?

395
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,610
No.

396
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,570
He called him inside the Qi Residence,

397
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,610
scolded him,

398
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,460
and then sent him away.

399
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,700
It's medding!

400
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,650
You're right.

401
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,410
Let me tell you,

402
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,060
if this were up to me, Wang Huzi,

403
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,260
I...

404
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,020
Yes.

405
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,460
If this were up to me, Wang Huzi,

406
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,330
I absolutely wouldn't let him
set foot in Qi Residence.

407
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,370
Am I right, Young Master?

408
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,220
Alright.

409
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,650
If something like this happens again,

410
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,610
don't let anyone else interfere.

411
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,260
Especially the Third Young Master.

412
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,060
Do you remember?

413
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:11,980
Yes, I do.

414
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,330
Young master,
I have something else to tell you.

415
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,570
I think

416
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,650
the Third Young Mistress
has martial arts skills.

417
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,370
Why do you think so?

418
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,540
Young Master, have you forgotten?

419
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,570
I know how to read people.

420
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,220
No matter
if they're men or women, old or young,

421
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,410
whether
they have martial arts skills or not,

422
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:28,940
I...

423
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,060
When he goes that way,

424
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,330
I can tell as soon as I take a look.

425
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:31,980
Alright.

426
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,890
Let's stop here.

427
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,780
Your Ladyship.

428
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,300
Your Ladyship, slow down.

429
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,410
Slow down, Your Ladyship.

430
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,370
Your Ladyship!

431
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:01,610
Your Ladyship!

432
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,980
Young Master Ke, you're back!

433
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,700
Cousin-in-law,

434
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,410
how's your health?

435
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,610
I'm fine.

436
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:17,810
How about you?

437
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,700
Not bad.

438
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,220
I...

439
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,500
Xiaoxi.

440
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,850
Are we still
stewing the tonic on the stove?

441
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,820
We have to go back now.

442
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,610
Or else it will spoil.

443
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,380
Cousin,

444
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,340
I still have something to take care of,
so I'll leave first.

445
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,550
What's the use of apologising?

446
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,580
The General is badly hurt.

447
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,510
It's all his fault!

448
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,100
Uncle,

449
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,510
it's all because I was too impulsive

450
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,070
that I fell into the trap

451
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,580
and caused trouble for my big brother.

452
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,900
The General was injured
by the enemy's cold arrow.

453
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,990
You fought bravely.

454
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,030
How can we blame you?

455
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,030
Uncle,

456
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,270
how is my big brother now?

457
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,550
The General is fine now.

458
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,820
Everyone, let's disperse.

459
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,620
-The General is fine!
-The General is fine!

460
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,380
Thank you, Uncle.

461
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,180
That's great.

462
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,310
Thanks to your excellent medical skills,

463
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,820
my big brother was saved.

464
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,820
Pingwei,

465
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,310
get up first.

466
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,510
Let me take a look.

467
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,470
Where are you hurt?

468
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,550
Uncle,

469
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,340
from now on,

470
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,180
I'll improve my martial arts

471
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,180
to protect my big brother fully.

472
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,100
Pingwei,

473
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,510
listen to me.

474
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,710
The battlefield is ever-changing,

475
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,860
and the enemy is very unpredictable.

476
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,950
It's not your fault.

477
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,470
Alright.

478
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,550
Let me apply medicine for you.

479
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,580
Let's go.

480
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,180
Let's go.

481
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,990
You're new here.

482
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,340
l haven't seen you before.

483
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,660
I...

484
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:04,710
I...

485
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,340
I'm Du Bin, a medical disciple.

486
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,830
You're the Du Bin

487
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,550
that Sha Pingwei always told me about?

488
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,740
Exactly.

489
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,860
[Why does he look like a girl?]

490
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,100
General!

491
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,180
You're still wounded.

492
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,870
Come on, sit down.

493
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,140
Please sit down.

494
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,550
Lift your head up.

495
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,550
Have I seen you before?

496
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:52,870
Really?

497
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,550
Yes.

498
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:57,510
Where?

499
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,950
It was that day.

500
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,070
You've forgotten.

501
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,580
You came back to camp victorious.

502
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,830
I went to the square
with the men of the battalion

503
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,300
to welcome you.

504
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,990
At that time, you were on horseback

505
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,870
and I was on foot.

506
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,550
You even nodded at me.

507
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,100
General,

508
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,910
you should take your medicine.

509
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,990
Well,

510
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,100
General.

511
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,430
I think you still need to rest.

512
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,300
My Master will be here soon.

513
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,740
I have to go back to make medicine.

514
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,780
I'll leave first.

515
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,470
Du Bin,

516
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,470
don't rush to leave.

517
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,700
Come and sit down for a while.

518
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:03,950
Have a seat.

519
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,510
General.

520
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,300
I'll just stand.

521
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,220
From your accent,

522
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,830
you're from Yangzhou, right?

523
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,220
Yes.

524
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,990
I'm from Yangzhou.

525
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,100
Do you know
the Mighty Martial Arts Center in Yangzhou?

526
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,700
Yes, I do.

527
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,870
Have you heard
about the wedding of the daughter

528
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,220
of the Mighty Martial Arts Center?

529
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,580
No, I haven't.

530
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,470
Well,

531
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,100
I live in the eastern of the city,

532
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,550
quite far from

533
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,700
the Mighty Martial Arts Center.

534
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,220
I see.

535
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,180
According to Pingwei,

536
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,260
you came with your Master

537
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,950
to the barracks to practice medicine

538
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,990
and also wanted
to look for your elder brother.

539
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,300
My... my elder brother

540
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,260
is Du Kui.

541
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,140
When our troop was recruited,

542
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,350
it was mainly in the north,

543
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,550
and most of the recruits
were local soldiers.

544
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,180
lt's not easy to join the army

545
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,700
because it's far from the south.

546
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,550
Therefore,

547
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,550
there are very few soldiers from Yangzhou.

548
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,510
However, I will have someone
check the military records

549
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,830
to see if there are any soldiers
from Yangzhou.

550
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,580
Thank you, General.

551
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,430
Du Bin.

552
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,740
Who told you

553
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,700
to come to Jingzhou
to look for your elder brother?

554
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,580
I...

555
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,950
Here's the thing, General.

556
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,740
My elder brother and a few neighbors

557
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,070
went north to join the army.

558
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,030
But they haven't returned
for several years.

559
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,260
Just a few days ago,

560
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
my neighbors came back

561
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,260
and brought news

562
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,350
that my brother might have made his way

563
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,620
to Jingzhou.

564
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,700
So

565
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,780
that's why I...

566
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,580
I came to the barracks.

567
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,100
Sir.

568
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,430
General.

569
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,550
Master, you're back.

570
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:20,910
General!

571
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,780
How do you feel?

572
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,470
Much better.

573
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,870
That's good.

574
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,260
But this arrow is highly poisoned.

575
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,580
It'll take some time and proper care

576
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,390
to completely remove the toxins
from your body.

577
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,300
General.

578
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,100
You must take good care
of yourself during this time.

579
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,140
Okay.

580
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,430
Du Bin,

581
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,350
I have selected ten herbs.

582
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,870
Hurry up to dry them
and grind them into powder.

583
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:43,580
I'll do it right away.

584
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,430
Okay.

585
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,030
Wait a moment.

586
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,300
Come back first.

587
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,580
General.

588
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,910
The matter of caring for your injury

589
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,070
cannot be taken lightly.

590
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,350
I see that you don't even

591
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,100
have a soldier in your tent.

592
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,100
How about this?

593
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,070
I'll leave Du Bin here
to take care of you.

594
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,030
What do you think?

595
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,100
I...

596
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,390
That's fine.

597
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,100
Thank you for taking care of me, Du Bin.

598
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,510
Master!

599
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,620
I haven't finished my ten herbs yet.

600
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,470
Should I come back tomorrow?

601
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,100
No need.

602
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,390
Just take care of the General.

603
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,580
Goodbye, General.

604
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,300
The medicine is going to be burnt.

605
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,140
[Qi Residence]

606
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,700
I didn't notice

607
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,580
that the Third Young Mistress
has martial arts skills.

608
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,990
But ever since she came here,

609
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,030
the Third Young Master
started to have good luck.

610
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,430
He looks much better.

611
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,350
A joyful wedding

612
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,780
may bring good luck

613
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,300
or death.

614
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,740
It all depends on their destiny

615
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,950
and compatibility.

616
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,430
Are you suggesting

617
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,550
that Du Bingyan and the Third Young Master
are fated to be together?

618
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,950
Maybe.

619
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,910
Well, in that case,

620
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,430
don't make eyes at Du Bingyan anymore.

621
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,870
My dear Xiaoqiao,

622
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,550
where did this come from?

623
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,580
From the water pavilion,

624
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,910
the corridor,

625
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:08,950
the garden,

626
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,070
and the first time you met Du Bingyan.

627
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,990
Xiaoqiao.

628
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,260
You...

629
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,470
You really have eyes

630
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,950
and ears everywhere.

631
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,910
But you're so petty!

632
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,990
If you don't change this habit,

633
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,300
how will you become the mistress

634
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,580
of Qi Residence in the future?

635
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,740
Actually,

636
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,470
I don't want to be the mistress.

637
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,100
I only want you

638
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,510
to genuinely love

639
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,300
and cherish me as a confidante.

640
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,220
That's all I need.

641
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,260
You're digressing.

642
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,300
You've been going upstairs every day
to deliver medicine.

643
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,740
Have you noticed

644
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,620
if the Third Young Master
and the Third Young Mistress

645
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,700
get along?

646
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,580
How could they not get along?

647
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,950
They flirt with each other all day long.

648
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,140
They're happy as can be.

649
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,580
Let me tell you the truth,

650
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,780
I engage in conversations
with the Third Young Mistress,

651
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,180
in fact,

652
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,580
to test her.

653
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,220
Why did you test her?

654
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,990
I've been thinking,

655
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,780
what can this Du Bingyan

656
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,700
bring to the Qi Residence?

657
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,350
A few days ago, Wang Huzi told me

658
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,580
that Du Bingyan had saved that guy
from Jiangzhou.

659
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,100
It seems like she knows some martial arts.

660
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,550
I've been wondering

661
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,260
how could Miss Du from the Du family

662
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,780
know martial arts?

663
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,510
It really puzzles me.

664
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,260
Dear Xiaoqiao,

665
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,950
at this moment,

666
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,950
I have a very important task

667
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,620
for you.

668
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,260
What is it?

669
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,350
I want you

670
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,780
to find out what they're up to.

671
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,100
Investigate and verify everything.

672
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:37,100
Let me know immediately
if there's any news.
