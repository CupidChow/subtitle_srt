[Episode 16]

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,150
I heard Third Young Master

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,920
arguing with his wife
when I was outside their chamber.

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,870
He even smashed things.

22
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,230
They had a huge argument.

23
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,000
This is great.

24
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,400
Since that's the case,

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,510
I'm sure they're estranged
from each other now.

26
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,000
Now, we can use our tricks

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,310
to separate them.

28
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,280
This way, we can reap the benefit

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,640
as the third party.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,950
What's our next step?

31
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,280
For our next step,

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,070
we'll proceed with our plan.

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,680
Xiubo, congratulations.

34
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,030
Why are you congratulating me?

35
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,240
Xiubo, due to your actions,

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,590
that side of the residence

37
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,560
is in complete anarchy now.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,400
Tianlei and Third Young Mistress

39
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,840
shut themselves
in the chamber all day long.

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,080
They kept arguing with each other.

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,750
I pity them.

42
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,960
Have I

43
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,560
gone overboard?

44
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,430
Xiubo,

45
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,120
you mustn't

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
be kind to them at this moment.

47
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,870
The deed will be completed soon.

48
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,400
You mustn't back down now.

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,800
Moreover,

50
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,360
you and Tianlei

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,800
were childhood sweethearts.

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,080
Du Bingyan

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,910
was the one who went overboard.

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
She took over your position

55
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,630
and stole your beloved from you.

56
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,560
Xiubo,

57
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,430
since it has come to this,

58
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,400
why don't we

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,870
follow up your victory with hot pursuit?

60
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,150
Ke,

61
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,910
what do you mean by that?

62
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,800
Du Bingyan is shrewish.

63
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,630
If she kicks a huge fuss over it

64
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,190
and complains to Grandmother,

65
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm afraid

66
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,710
the situation might change.

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,120
Xiubo, why don't you

68
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,150
go straight to the point

69
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,910
and win Tianlei's heart

70
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,840
while they're in disagreement?

71
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,150
How can I achieve that?

72
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,150
As the saying goes,

73
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,080
what has been cannot be undone.

74
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,520
That won't do.

75
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,400
Although I have admired Tianlei
since young,

76
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,000
a woman's reputation
is most important to me.

77
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,240
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,840
To achieve that, you just need
to send the others away.

79
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,400
Only you and Tianlei will know about this.

80
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,280
Once it happens,

81
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,120
once Tianlei has
an extramarital affair with you,

82
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,680
he'll surely give you a title.

83
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,630
Your reputation will be protected.

84
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,240
Xiubo,

85
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,750
there's no turning back now.

86
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,310
Moreover, you've already driven a wedge

87
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,560
between them.

88
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,360
And, you're all alone.

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,120
Instead of making all three of you suffer,

90
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,470
why don't you grant yourself your own wish

91
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,680
and win Tianlei's heart?

92
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,390
I've already planned
everything out for you.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's a flawless plan.

94
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,430
Nothing will go wrong.

95
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,920
[Dear,]

96
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,070
[tell me.]

97
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,270
Did you devise strategies

98
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,310
for Miss Xiubo

99
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,870
and help her to become
the female head of the Qi family

100
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,510
because of her immaculate beauty?

101
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,870
Why are you worried about

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,160
her reputation?

103
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,310
Look at you.

104
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,310
That little lass,

105
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,630
how could she compare with you?

106
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,390
Don't deceive me.

107
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm not deceiving you.

108
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,560
Think about it.

109
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,310
What do you think would happen

110
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,360
if Grandmother and the public
saw them committing such

111
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,390
indecent acts?

112
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,630
So, you planned for this long ago.

113
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,240
Of course.

114
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
The managers of all the shops

115
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,680
belonging to the Qi family
will come here to report to Grandmother

116
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,360
about their business plan
for the upcoming year

117
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,240
in a few more days.

118
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,510
By then,

119
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
I will lead them

120
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
to the pavilion and show them a good show.

121
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,430
I'll have Grandmother and the managers

122
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,680
catch them red-handed.

123
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,430
By then,

124
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,360
Qi Tianlei and Du Bingyan

125
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,000
will definitely sever their ties.

126
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,190
Xiubo's reputation will be ruined too.

127
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,190
She wants to be
the female head of the family?

128
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,950
She should be grateful
that if we're taking her in

129
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,510
as a mistress.

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,870
If that's the case,

131
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
no one else can stop us

132
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,000
when Third Young Mistress is gone.

133
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,480
What a great plan.

134
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,830
You're killing two birds with one stone.

135
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,600
Wrong.

136
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,560
I'm killing three birds with one stone.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,920
After this incident,

138
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,630
Grandmother will surely
be disappointed with Qi Tianlei.

139
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,680
Qi Tianlei will definitely
lose his position

140
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
within the Qi family.

141
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,360
By then, Qi Residence

142
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,680
will be ours.

143
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,360
If so, you better don't forget

144
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,120
that I've contributed to your success too.

145
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,430
You have to give me

146
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,560
my share of profit.

147
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,310
Naturally.

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,040
Third Young Master Qi,

149
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,000
Her Ladyship said

150
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,920
the dye we're using to create

151
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,000
Old Madam's Longevity Calligraphy

152
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,750
must be vibrant.

153
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,480
Her Ladyship is inviting you to the backyard

154
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,480
to harvest lotus flowers together

155
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,160
to create the dye

156
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,310
for backup purposes.

157
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,360
Her Ladyship is waiting for you
at the waterside pavilion.

158
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,870
All right.

159
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,160
I'll meet her after I get changed.

160
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,750
It's done.

161
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,430
Dear managers,

162
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
you all did a great job.

163
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,750
I've read the business directory
for the upcoming year

164
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,240
for all of our shops.

165
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,870
I hope you guys can keep up the good work

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,240
and work hard.

167
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,870
Let's do our best to help the shops
to make more profit next year.

168
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,680
By then, I will reward all of you

169
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,430
handsomely.

170
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,870
Thank you, Old Madam.

171
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,790
Shizhao,

172
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,270
how's the preparation

173
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,720
for the banquet tonight?

174
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,910
I must reward all of my managers

175
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,440
with a great feast.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,960
Grandmother, don't worry.

177
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,870
I invited the famous cook

178
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,670
of Prosperity Restaurant

179
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,840
to prepare delicious food
for all the managers here.

180
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,840
The famous cook of Prosperity Restaurant

181
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,720
excels at making
West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy.

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,080
However, this is
a complex dish to prepare.

183
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,150
I hope you guys

184
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,390
can be patient.

185
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,510
Good job.

186
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,030
What about this?

187
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,750
Grandmother,

188
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,320
since the weather is great,

189
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,910
you and the managers

190
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,510
should take a walk around our backyard.

191
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,510
The lotus flowers have bloomed.

192
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,320
The view is impeccable.

193
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,600
I've heard

194
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,320
that the garden of our boss's residence
was designed by a master designer.

195
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,480
I heard about how exquisite it was.

196
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,440
However, none of us
have seen it for ourselves yet.

197
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,080
That's right.

198
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,790
That's easy.

199
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,790
Come.

200
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,720
Follow me to the backyard.

201
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,200
-Sure.
-Sure.

202
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,550
Please, Old Madam.

203
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,840
-Old Madam, please.
-Old Madam, please.

204
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,720
Please.

205
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,000
All right.

206
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,030
Everyone, follow me.

207
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,150
Grandmother, be careful.

208
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,550
All right.

209
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,790
It wasn't like this

210
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,960
when we came here last time.

211
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,840
[The view is amazing.]

212
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,440
[Look at the bridge.]

213
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,200
[It leads to a quiet place]

214
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,510
[with exquisite scenery.]

215
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,790
Your Ladyship, Third Young Master,

216
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,320
we're in trouble. Someone is coming.

217
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,240
Every step in this garden

218
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
feels exquisite.

219
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,440
I often take walks around here.

220
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,750
It clears my heart and mind of trouble.

221
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,550
Everyone, take a look
at the waterside pavilion.

222
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,200
It feels delicate when you admire

223
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,510
the lotus flowers while being inside.

224
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,440
That's right.

225
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,630
You can bring the managers there

226
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,320
for them to check it out.

227
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,670
All right.

228
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,670
Old Madam,

229
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,320
look at how beautiful
the waterside pavilion is.

230
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,150
It looks like someone is inside.

231
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,750
Isn't that Xiubo's nanny?

232
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,790
What is Xiubo doing here

233
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,510
at this time of the day?

234
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,670
I saw Third Young Master

235
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,080
entering the pavilion too.

236
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,670
Third Young Master is actually inside?

237
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,120
Congratulations, Old Madam.

238
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,910
Seems like Third Young Master
is a lucky man.

239
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,360
That's right.

240
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,440
I've heard about Xiubo's name long ago.

241
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,750
She was a dignified lady

242
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,000
from a wealthy household in Suzhou.

243
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,670
Seems like the shops under the Qi family

244
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,150
will prosper again.

245
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,200
We're going to prosper again.

246
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,440
-That's right.
-We're going to prosper.

247
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,670
That's right.

248
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
Stop spouting such nonsense.

249
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,270
Grandmother,

250
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,200
Xiubo is a noble lady of the Yu family.

251
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,510
However, she actually
cast her reputation away

252
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,440
in order to win Tianlei's heart.

253
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,030
I assume she's deeply in love with him.

254
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,120
Grandmother,

255
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,390
why don't we help them
to get together then?

256
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,840
That will never do!

257
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Young Master Ke,

258
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,870
you mustn't do so.

259
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,720
Third Young Master

260
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,080
is the only son of the family now.

261
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,270
How could he marry a woman

262
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,440
who doesn't cherish her chastity?

263
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,480
Tianlei, huh?

264
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,270
Since he's here,

265
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,440
that surely means
he also has feelings for her.

266
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,870
Grandmother,

267
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,240
seems like all those years
you spent to nurture him were in vain.

268
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,870
How could he be so brazen

269
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,360
as to indulge in lust?

270
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,000
This Tianlei!

271
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,960
Grandmother.

272
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,000
Grandmother,

273
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,150
were you looking for me?

274
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,720
Isn't that Third Young Master?

275
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,270
That's right.

276
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,790
If so, who's inside the pavilion?

277
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,670
The pavilion...

278
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,720
You!

279
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,510
What are you doing here?

280
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,390
Ke, are you implying

281
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,960
that I should be somewhere else

282
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,670
by asking me that question?

283
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,790
That's right.

284
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,080
Didn't he say
Third Young Master was inside?

285
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:56,910
Grandmother,

286
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,080
this is the Longevity Calligraphy
I wrote for you.

287
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,200
I just finished framing it.

288
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,080
I'm here to deliver it to you.

289
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,790
Good boy.

290
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,360
But I saw Third Young Master

291
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,320
entering the pavilion just now.

292
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,550
If so, who's inside the pavilion?

293
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,120

It's me.

What are you doing here?

299
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,240
I was together with Xiubo just now.

300
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,670
Have you heard everything

301
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,750
Ke Shizhao said just now?

302
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,480
Bingyan, thank you for rescuing me
from the dark abyss.

303
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,150
Tianlei...

304
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,440
What are you doing here?

305
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,030
Xiubo,

306
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,840
I need to speak with you.

307
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,630
Xiubo,

308
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,360
we're both women.

309
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,270
I understand your feelings for Tianlei.

310
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,750
However, I'm in no way inferior

311
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,960
to you.

312
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,550
For us women,

313
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,080
it's a fortunate thing for us

314
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,810
to find a good husband
and spend our lives happily

315
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,860
with them.

316
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,890
However,

317
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,380
the world is a vast place.

318
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,460
Love and relationships

319
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,460
shouldn't be the only things
a woman seeks in life.

320
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,380
You should have your own goals in life.

321
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,290
This way,

322
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,260
you'll definitely find a man

323
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,290
who suits you perfectly.

324
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,980
He will dote on you and protect you.

325
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,740
Don't do such

326
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,170
silly things again.

Why is Third Young Mistress
inside instead?

330

And, why is she wearing
Third Young Master's outfit?

I exhibited an air of heroism

I don't know if he's a good guy for me

373
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,260
or not.

374
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,980
Eunuch,

375
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,130
I have to see him for myself
to assess him.

376
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,530
All those portraits you showed me before

377
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,610
were fake.

378
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,980
Your Highness,

379
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
I know not many men

380
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,330
had caught your eye.

381
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,570
However, Consort Yuan is...

382
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,330
I haven't agreed to it yet.

383
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,900
I have to see him for myself.

384
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,180
I need to see

385
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,500
if he's deformed

386
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,900
or ugly.

387
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,700
I thought the best scholar
of the Ministry of Personnel

388
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,220
was bent on marrying me?

389
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,220
That's right.

390
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,090
I've read the poems and verses

391
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,370
he wrote for me to you guys before.

392
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,330
It was so touching.

393
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,700
Touching?

394
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,900
He was just stringing together
ornate phrases

395
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,570
to express his fake feelings for me.

396
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,050
What a terrible guy.

397
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,290
He even said

398
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,330
that he could go through dangers

399
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,130
and do anything for my sake.

400
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,370
Would you guys even believe that?

401
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,260
We would.

402
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,260
You too?

403
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,570
Yes.

404
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,020
Anyway, I don't believe him.

405
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:31,770
Your Highness.

406
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,500
Your Highness,
the arrow you requested is ready.

407
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,530
Eunuch,

408
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,050
why don't we play a new game?

409
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,610
Your Majesty,

410
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,570
Consort Yuan Buqu has sent his men here

411
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,420
to deliver a memorial to His Majesty.

412
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,700
His Majesty requests you to read it.

413
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:00,700
Read it.

414
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:01,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

415
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,460
Your Majesty, thank you for your grace.

416
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,460
I, Yuan Buqu, was rushing to the capital
after receiving the imperial edict.

417
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,810
I was passing the land of Qilu.

418
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,980
I have to pay respect to my ancestors
in my hometown.

419
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,980
Your Majesty, please allow me

420
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,050
to pay respect to my ancestors
before returning to the capital

421
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,850
so that I can fulfill my filial duties.

422
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,770
Spiritual Mountain is a place endowed with

423
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,500
the fine spirits of the universe.

424
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,220
Your Majesty, please allow Her Highness

425
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,700
to join me in visiting Spiritual Mountain.

426
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,900
[Fifth year of Xianqing, early August.]

427
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,020
Yuan Buqu

428
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,050
is quite a filial child.

429
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,740
Prioritizing filial piety

430
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,260
and one's relationships, huh?

431
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,020
Not bad at all.

432
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,220
Your Majesty,

433
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,850
your discerning eyes could
truly tell greatness from mediocrity.

434
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,130
You've found an excellent consort
for Her Highness.

435
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,900
Changping is proud and aloof.

436
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,850
We still don't know
what kind of trouble she'll stir up.

437
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,500
Although I'm the empress

438
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,290
and the female head of the nation,

439
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,020
I cannot select
a consort for the princess.

440
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,610
Is this what they meant by

441
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,770
"Do not do others what you would not

442
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,900
have them do to you?"

443
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,020
Greetings, Your Highness.

444
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,700
Spare the formalities. Have a seat.

445
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:28,980
Your Highness, I prefer

446
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,610
standing up.

447
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,700
By the way, top scorer,

448
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,940
do you remember

449
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,900
the poems and verses you wrote for me?

450
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,130
They're imprinted in my heart.

451
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,810
Your Highness,
I've admired you for a long time.

452
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,980
Your Highness is
the most beautiful lady in the world.

453
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,260
Many people

454
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,460
have fallen to your charm.

455
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,570
Is there anything else?

456
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,610
Your Highness,

457
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,850
I think about you day and night.

458
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,370
I'm willing to go through dangers
and do anything for your sake.

459
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,220
If that's the case,

460
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,850
does that mean you'll do anything

461
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,130
I tell you to do?

462
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,610
Yes, Your Highness.

463
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,610
I will even go through

464
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,020
fire and flames for you
as long as you say the word,

465
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,290
Your Highness.

466
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,130
Good.

467
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,220
Your Highness,

468
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,370
even if you order me
to acquire the moon for you,

469
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,090
I shall search
the entire world for a ladder

470
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,530
that can reach the heavens itself
to acquire it for you.

471
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,530
Great.

472
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,610
If that's the case,

473
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,530
I'll give you another chance today.

474
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,050
I'll draw a small circle here.

475
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,740
And,

476
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,610
you have to stay inside the circle.

477
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,610
Can you do that?

478
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,260
That's easy.

479
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,570
I will never move,

480
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,740
even if lightning strikes me down.

481
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:03,770
It's a deal, then.

482
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,770
I'm a man of my word.

483
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:05,900
All right.

484
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,130
Eunuch.

485
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,850
Put this apple on your head.

486
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,610
Your Highness,

487
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,460
please don't do this.

488
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,700
Arrows cannot discern
human beings from apples!

489
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,330
Your Highness!

490
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,460
Can you stop moving around?

491
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,500
You already left the circle.

492
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,530
I won't move.

493
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,850
Can we change the rule of the game then?

494
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,500
Oh yeah.

495
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,700
I forgot to tell you

496
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,130
that I was bad at archery.

497
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:49,980
However,

498
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,850
I will do my best.

499
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,370
Don't do this!

500
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:54,980
Your Highness!

501
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,220
You mustn't do this!

502
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,370
Eunuch, can you shut up?

503
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,500
What if I hurt you by accident?

504
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,370
Your Highness,

505
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,180
you mustn't joke around with this!

506
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,290
Get out of my way.

507
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,900
Your Highness!

508
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:08,940
Please don't do this!

509
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,530
Your Highness!

510
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,090
Your Highness! Please don't do this!

511
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,570
Your Highness!

512
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,810
Please don't do this!

513
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,700
Please don't do this!

514
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,260
Your Highness, thank you for sparing me.

515
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,370
Your Highness, you...

516
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,980
Stop pretending.

517
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,050
The tip of the arrow was made from wax.

518
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,290
What a coward.

519
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,050
Look at you.

520
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,290
You have no courage whatsoever.

521
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,740
You want to go through
fire and flames for me?

522
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,290
As if.

523
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:08,940
Leave immediately.

524
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,500
Yes, Your Highness.

525
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,810
[Her Majesty has arrived.]

526
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,570
Eunuch!

527
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,130
No outsiders are supposed to be here!

528
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,260
We'll be in trouble
if Her Majesty finds out!

529
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,610
Hurry! Follow me out of the palace!

530
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,220
The apple!

531
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,980
Hurry!

532
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,740
[Her Majesty has arrived.]

533
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,530
Greetings, Mother.

534
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,420
You may rise.

535
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,570
What were you laughing at?

536
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,220
I could hear you all the way back there.

537
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,130
Mother, please have a seat.

538
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,660
Just now,

539
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,700
we were practicing archery

540
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,660
and

541
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,420
skipping ropes together.

542
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,090
You will be married soon, you know?

543
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,610
Having fun shouldn't be
the only thing on your mind now.

544
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,420
Your consort has written to us.

545
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,290
Mother,

546
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,810
I don't even know
what Yuan Buqu looks like.

547
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,020
How could I get married to him?

548
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,290
In his letter, he wrote

549
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,130
that he wished to invite you
to Spiritual Mountain

550
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,980
to enjoy the sunrise

551
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,980
and the excellent view there.

552
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,050
I didn't know

553
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,500
if you wanted to go there or not.

554
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,980
Mother, I want to go there.

555
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,050
It's boring to stay in the imperial garden

556
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,130
every day.

557
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,130
When are we leaving?

558
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,370
Look at how impatient you are.

559
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,660
Let's forget about
when you'll depart for now.

560
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,980
I have three conditions.

561
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,460
You have to agree to it before you can go.

562
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,770
Mother, go ahead.

563
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,130
First,

564
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,850
you need to remove your imperial clothing.

565
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,260
You have to dress yourself up
as a commoner.

566
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,260
Do not allow anyone to know
that you're the princess.

567
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,260
Dress myself up as a commoner?

568
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,260
I'm sure it'll be fun.

569
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,020
I agree.

570
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,570
For the second condition,

571
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,130
Eunuch Zhang

572
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,020
will pretend to be your father

573
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,700
and join you on your journey.

574
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:02,850
Mother,

575
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,220
he doesn't even have a mustache.

576
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,700
How can he pretend to be my father?

577
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,980
Your Highness,

578
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,900
it isn't difficult to grow a mustache.

579
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,220
I can just put on a fake one.

580
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,180
All right. I agree.

581
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,900
You're not allowed to throw a tantrum

582
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,530
on your way there.

583
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,330
For the third condition,

584
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,530
you must discuss everything with
Eunuch Zhang before you proceed with it.

585
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,940
Do not be willful.

586
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,610
Okay.

587
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,700
Mother, don't worry about me.

588
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,180
Your Majesty,

589
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,770
I watched over Her Highness
as she grew up.

590
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,370
I will definitely

591
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,260
do everything I can

592
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,020
to take care of her.

593
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,810
Please don't worry.

594
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,660
Mother,

595
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,740
since I've already agreed
to all three of your conditions,

596
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,940
I have three conditions for you, too.

597
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,900
You have three conditions, too?

598
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,610
What are the conditions? Tell me about it.

599
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,500
Firstly,

600
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,610
I will select my consort

601
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,900
myself.

602
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,330
You still wish to
select your own consort, huh?

603
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,660
I will select a good man for me.

604
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,660
But His Majesty has already
arranged the marriage for you.

605
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,530
The emperor's words
are to be taken seriously.

606
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,570
If that's the case,
I'll jump down from Spiritual Mountain!

607
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,220
You!

608
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,530
Your Highness,

609
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,020
please be patient.

610
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,330
Please calm down.

611
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,220
What about this?

612
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,370
You can head to Spiritual Mountain and see

613
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,370
the kind of person Yuan Buqu is for now.

614
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,900
We can discuss

615
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,530
the details after your return.

616
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,420
All right. Mother, you're the best.

617
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,260
Here's the second condition.

618
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,500
Secondly, they can only

619
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,220
follow me around

620
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,290
when I tell them to.

621
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,700
They cannot follow me around

622
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,940
without my permission.

623
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,980
I'm no longer a kid.

624
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,610
I've already grown up.

625
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,850
If so, you need to promise me

626
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,700
that you'll ensure your own safety.

627
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,700
Last condition.

628
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,500
Mother,

629
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,850
can you tell Father

630
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,570
to give me a gold token

631
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,130
so that I won't be bullied by them?

632
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,740
About that...

633
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Your plan is pretty thorough.

634
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,020
All right then.

635
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,220
It's fine as long as
you don't cause trouble for me.

636
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,620
[Qi Residence]

637
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,460
I'm here to bid farewell.

638
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,980
Bingyan, thank you for making me
realize my foolishness.

639
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,370
That's how I was able to see through
Ke Shizhao's devious plans

640
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,980
and avoid committing a huge mistake.

641
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,660
Xiubo,

642
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,370
you must love yourself

643
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,980
and find a man who loves you.

644
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,180
I grew up together

645
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,530
with Tianlei since young.

646
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,530
Back then, I thought

647
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,370
marriage was the most important thing

648
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,740
for a girl.

649
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,740
I thought

650
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,900
Tianlei was my best choice.

651
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,850
But Bingyan,

652
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,090
you told me

653
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,330
that the world was a vast place.

654
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,940
Love and relationships

655
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,290
shouldn't be the only things
a woman seeks in life.

656
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,660
After that, I came to my realization.

657
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,220
Ever since

658
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,220
I saw the deep feelings you two
harbored for each other,

659
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,570
I understood

660
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,420
that I was only being insistent on

661
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,850
reliving the past.

662
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,330
From now on,

663
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,570
Tianlei, I shall treat you
as my elder brother.

664
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,020
What's your plan after this?

665
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,700
I plan to return to Suzhou

666
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,130
and manage the business
left behind by Grandmother.

667
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,660
Xiubo, your heart and spirit are pure.

668
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,180
I'm sure you can manage
the business successfully.

669
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,850
Tianlei, you flatter me.

670
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,610
However,

671
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,370
Ke Shizhao is bent on
getting rid of you guys.

672
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
I'm sure he'll come up with
more devious plots in the future.

673
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,850
Tianlei, Bingyan,

674
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,260
what will you two do about him?

675
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,290
Don't worry.

676
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,090
You can return to Suzhou
with peace of mind.

677
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,810
My husband and I

678
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,130
have plenty of ways to deal with him.

679
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,050
This pair of gold Kylin locks

680
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,740
were meant for a loving couple.

681
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,180
They can only form a pair
when you put them together.

682
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,850
Bingyan, I shall give this to you.

683
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,660
I hope that you two

684
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,460
can grow old together.

685
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:36,900
Thank you, Xiubo.

686
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,740
I shall take my leave.

687
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:45,740
Take care.

688
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,370
Young Master,

689
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,180
Miss Xiubo has returned to her hometown.

690
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,940
She bade farewell to Third Young Master

691
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,050
and Third Young Mistress before departing.

692
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,130
It seemed like Miss Xiubo

693
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,610
was very close to Third Young Mistress.

694
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,500
They were reluctant
to part with each other.

695
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,050
Useless fool.

696
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,740
Seems like this move
didn't work out as intended.

697
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,980
Third Young Master and his wife

698
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,740
have a solid relationship indeed.

699
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,740
Even I couldn't separate them.

700
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,810
If that's the case,

701
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,850
I'll do them a favor

702
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,770
and send both of them to the afterlife.

703
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,130
Dear,

704
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,260
you're pretty good at martial arts.

705
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,020
I'll leave the rest

706
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,770
to you.

707
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,300
I'll break your legs

708
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,250
if you try to run again.

709
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,250
Who exactly are you?

710
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,050
I'm in pain!

711
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,090
Heroine, please spare me!

712
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,650
I...

713
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,050
I don't even know who I am now!

714
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Please forget about me!

715
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,500
I can't fight well!

716
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,610
I was never your match to begin with!

717
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,090
At least you know what's good for you.

718
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,530
Heroine,

719
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,650
may I know your name?

720
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,170
At least I won't die in ignorance.

721
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,780
I have nothing to hide.

722
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,210
I'm Li Yuhu from Yangzhou.

723
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,420
Young Master,

724
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,690
we're in trouble.

725
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,650
Third Young Mistress
is an expert martial artist.

726
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,860
She's extraordinary.

727
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,860
My men

728
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,090
were no match for her.

729
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,500
Third Young Master wasn't sick at all.

730
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,820
He was swinging his sword with ease.

731
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
He punched me in the face

732
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,460
just when I was about to strike him down.

733
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,610
Look.

734
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,420
I can't even see things clearly now.

735
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,380
Their lives were on the line.

736
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,210
Naturally, they did everything they could.

737
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,690
That's not it, Young Master.

738
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,020
I fought with them.

739
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,900
Both of them are adept at martial arts.

740
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,460
Are you serious?

741
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:58,690
Yes.

742
00:35:59,210 --> 00:35:59,690
Young Master,

743
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,900
I'm afraid it's no easy feat

744
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,380
to deal with them now.

745
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,690
My men

746
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,900
were no match for them.

747
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:07,860
Moreover,

748
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,130
we failed to get them this time.

749
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,500
I'm afraid it'll be more difficult

750
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,210
for us to do the same thing again.

751
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,170
Useless fool.

752
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,170
Wait.

753
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,460
Why would the daughter of the Du family

754
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,380
know martial arts?

755
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,130
Young Master,

756
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,130
although I failed my task this time,

757
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,530
I did help you uncover

758
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,020
a shocking secret during crucial moments.

759
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,460
What is it? Tell me.

760
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,980
Back then,

761
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,210
Third Young Mistress

762
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,020
gave me a kick

763
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,050
to the chest.

764
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,210
I was in pain.

765
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,460
Back then, I thought

766
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,210
that I was going to die there.

767
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,690
After that, I knelt and begged her.

768
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,460
I told her

769
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,940
to tell me her name.

770
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,690
Did you know what she said?

771
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,570
She let down

772
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,690
her guard back then.

773
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,610
She said this without any shame:

774
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,820
"I have nothing to hide.

775
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,210
I'm Li Yuhu from Yangzhou."

776
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
Li Yuhu?

777
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,020
Are you sure you heard that?

778
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,090
Of course.

779
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,380
I was wondering about this all along.

780
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,610
No wonder I thought

781
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,210
that there was something off about her.

782
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,050
So, she's a fake.

783
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,210
That's right.

784
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,210
Even the heavens are helping me now.

785
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,170
We have to make use of this opportunity.

786
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,210
Since we can't get rid of them by force,

787
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,860
we need to use something else.

788
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,420
We can let the local authorities

789
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,210
remove this thorn in the flesh for us.

790
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:41,690
Young Master,

791
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:42,820
that's a great idea.

792
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,610
Head to Du Residence in Yangzhou.

793
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,210
Bring Mr. Du here

794
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,570
at all costs.

795
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,570
Let him expose Li Yuhu
in front of everyone.

796
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,570
Understood.

797
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,090
I will depart immediately.

798
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:53,610
Go ahead.

799
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,690
Xiaoqiao,

800
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:33,900
you shouldn't head

801
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
to the Garden of Harmony often

802
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,130
in the next few days

803
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,690
besides delivering medicine to him.

804
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,570
Didn't you tell me
to keep a close eye on them?

805
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,210
It's called relaxed on the outside
but tense on the inside.

806
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,130
You shouldn't let them feel

807
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,570
that you're always keeping an eye on them.

808
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,980
Yeah, yeah, you change your mind

809
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,820
all the time.

810
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,050
Have you

811
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,610
gotten hold of their secrets?

812
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,530
That's not true.

813
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,820
I'm just loosening the fishing line
just to reel them back in.

814
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,130
Loosening the fishing line?

815
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,050
A new show will be airing

816
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,170
in Qi Residence soon.

817
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:34,690
You're always full of

818
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,210
devious ideas, huh?

819
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,050
What's wrong?

820
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,130
Are you in the mood today?

821
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,210
Naturally.

822
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,690
Lieutenant Sha!

823
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:10,690
Lieutenant Sha!

824
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,130
General Yuan wrote to you.

825
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,980
A letter from Buqu?

826
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,210
Show it to me.

827
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,700
[I need your help on Spiritual Mountain.
Please make it in three days. Yuan Buqu.]

828
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,340
Buqu,

829
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,610
seems like you still
can't live without me.

830
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,090
Lieutenant Sha,

831
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,210
what did General say in his letter?
What's with the happy expression?

832
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,530
He wants me to head to Spiritual Mountain.

833
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,980
He says
that there are pressing matters to handle.

834
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,420
Hurry.

835
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,420
Prepare a horse for me.

836
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,530
I will depart immediately.

837
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,050
Yes, sir.

838
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,340
You guys can't catch up to me!

839
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,210
This is so tiring.

840
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,210
Miss, what are you doing?

841
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:09,940
Move out of the way.

842
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,500
Bride,

843
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,690
why are you crying?

844
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,020
Come outside with me.

845
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,980
Miss, please let go of me.

846
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,210
Why are you so upset?

847
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,610
You can only be happy

848
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,690
depending on the man
you're going to get married to.

849
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,050
What's wrong? Did you
get yourself a lousy husband?

850
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:37,690
I heard

851
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,020
that he's a fierce devil
that jinxes his wife.

852
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,050
He already abused

853
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,210
two of his previous wives to death.

854
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,570
What?

855
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,380
If you're getting married to him,
that means...

856
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,820
My father is in huge debt.

857
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,940
I have no choice.

858
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,860
What a scum.

859
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,050
I'll uphold justice for you.

860
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,340
Don't be upset.

861
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,210
You?

862
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,420
How can a young girl like you

863
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,210
help me out?

864
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:05,690
I...

865
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,210
But...

866
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:07,980
Miss,

867
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,500
sorry about this.

868
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,690
We need to be on our way now.

869
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,530
Raise the carriage.

870
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:14,820
No way!

871
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:16,610
Get out of the way!

872
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:18,420
Didn't you see that the bride was crying?

873
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,530
She doesn't want
to get married to that jinx.

874
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,650
I order you guys

875
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,820
to send her back to her hometown

876
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,900
right now!

877
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,530
You're just a little lass.

878
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,570
Who do you think you are?

879
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,050
What gives you the right
to interfere with our business?

880
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,570
Who do I think I am?

881
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,340
I'm the...

882
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,210
Forget it. I won't hold it against you.
