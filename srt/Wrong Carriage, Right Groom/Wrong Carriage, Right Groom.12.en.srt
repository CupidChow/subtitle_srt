00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,720
You two,

186
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,390
please try it out.

187
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,240
Okay.

188
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,270
Here.

189
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,240
Here, have this.

190
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,910
I never expected wild vegetables

191
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,910
to be this delicious.

192
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,890
No cooks in Linzhou

193
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,460
can achieve this feat.

194
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,980
Here, have some more.

195
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
Have this too.

196
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,570
Here you go.

197
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,810
Abbess, you two seemed close.

198
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,100
The head abbess is benevolent.

199
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,290
She saved Abbess Luxuan's life.

200
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,860
Go outside

201
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,340
and see if the meal
we prepared for the pilgrims

202
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,220
is ready.

203
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,220
Yes, Abbess.

204
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,930
That young nun said

205
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,860
you saved her life.

206
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,500
Abbess Luxuan, did something happen to you

207
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,930
before this?

208
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,050
It's all in the past.

209
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,980
It no longer matters.

210
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,740
What a coincidence.

211
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,860
One of our friends

212
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,740
came from Jiangzhou.

213
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,980
His family encountered
something unfortunate last year.

214
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,380
He had no choice
but to leave his hometown.

215
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,220
But before he left Jiangzhou,

216
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,740
he once provided aid

217
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,650
to a blind female pauper.

218
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,220
He told us to visit her

219
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,380
after hearing

220
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,500
that we were coming to Jiangzhou.

221
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,980
He wanted to know
if his friend was doing well.

222
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,220
This friend of mine

223
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,930
is called Ji Jingtang.

224
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,170
Amitabha.

225
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,570
There are too many people
suffering in the world.

226
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,620
May Buddha bless and protect all of them.

227
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,650
You two don't look like locals.

228
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,810
My surname is Qi, and I come from Linzhou.

229
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm the third son in the family.

230
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,460
His surname is Qi?

231
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,140
Abbess!

232
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,220
We know

233
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,930
that you're the blind old lady.

234
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,740
My husband is
the third son of the Qi family.

235
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,500
We came to Jiangzhou

236
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,980
in order to look for you.

237
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,980
The person who killed your son

238
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,290
has been terrorizing Jiangzhou.

239
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,980
He committed all kinds of evil deeds
in the Qi family too.

240
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,380
We wanted to denounce him,

241
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,500
but we didn't have
any evidence of his crimes.

242
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,890
Please return to Linzhou with us

243
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,220
and become our witness.

244
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,220
Expose him
by revealing the evil deeds he did.

245
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,980
Let's deal with him together.

246
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,980
You guys got the wrong person.

247
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,170
I've been living here
for as long as I can remember.

248
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,980
I have no idea
what you two are talking about.

249
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,170
Abbess!

250
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,890
Is this over?

251
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,500
Not yet.

252
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,100
I'm sure Abbess Luxuan rejected us

253
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,690
because she didn't trust us.

254
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,570
After all, I do belong

255
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,290
to the same family as Ke Shizhao,

256
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,290
the murderer of his son.

257
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,140
What should we do then?

258
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,860
We should try to acquire
Abbess Luxuan's trust first.

259
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,620
After that, we'll think of something
and bring her back to Linzhou.

260
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,740
Let's just pester her

261
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,690
until she agrees to it.

262
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,930
It's called "to move with emotion
and to understand with reason".

263
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,410
Let's look for her.

264
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,890
Young nun.

265
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,810
Amitabha.

266
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,170
Have you seen Abbess Luxuan around?

267
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,410
She's at the back of the hill.

268
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,140
Thank you.

269
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,170
Abbess,

270
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,620
we come from the Qi family.

271
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,570
You two, please head back.

272
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,650
You guys got the wrong person.

273
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,740
I'm not the person you're looking for.

274
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,740
Abbess,

275
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,500
I know that you're still
not willing to believe in us.

276
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,740
We also feel sorry

277
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,340
about what happened to you and your son.

278
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,740
But Ji Jingtang told us

279
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,140
that Ke Shizhao toppled

280
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,380
Ji family's Apothecary
after your son's passing.

281
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,860
Amitabha.

282
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,140
He has sinned.

283
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,050
I shall

284
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,410
chant sutras for him every day

285
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,810
and release the poor soul from purgatory.

286
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,050
May he get incarnated
into a better family.

287
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,690
Mr. Guan,

288
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,980
I was tailing the couple from the start.

289
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,020
They went to Deity of Info

290
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,620
and found out
where the blind old lady was.

291
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,690
If I'm not mistaken,

292
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,340
this old nun

293
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,860
should be the blind old lady.

294
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,860
Deity of Info never
gives out the wrong info.

295
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,050
Young Master Ke
had been seeking her for a long time.

296
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,100
I never expected that old wretch

297
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,170
to be hiding here.

298
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,020
We have to thank them

299
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,930
for doing us a huge favor.

300
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,340
Follow Young Master Ke's instructions.

301
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,530
Get rid of her.

302
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,170
Who are you all?

303
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,690
We're here to send you to the afterlife
so that you can reunite with your son!

304
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,380
I'll send you to the afterlife first.

305
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,020
Attack!

306
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,980
Abbess, are you okay?

307
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,050
Mr. Guan, are you okay?

308
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,850
Tell our brothers
to surround the downhill road.

309
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,090
Pursue them.

310
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:23,460
All right.

311
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:40,850
No one followed us.

312
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,940
Show it to me.

You're just pretending to be tough.

322
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,770
I'm fine. It's just a minor cut.
It doesn't hurt.

323
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,530
Qi Tianlei!

324
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,090
It didn't hurt when people bullied you!

325
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,090
It didn't hurt
when people cut you too, huh?

326
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,810
How could this not hurt?

327
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,260
Stop pretending in front of me!

328
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,050
It's all because I failed to protect you.

329
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,610
Dear, I would've been chopped into pieces

330
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,810
if it weren't for your excellent skills.

331
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,020
Stop crying.

332
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,420
Teasing me is all you know.

Mister,

335
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,330
you were hurt
because you tried to save me.

336
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,500
Thank you

337
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,330
for saving me.

338
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,130
Abbess, don't do this.

339
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:16,980
Abbess,

340
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,220
this is what we're supposed to do.

341
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,180
Abbess,

342
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,180
although you already became a nun
in White Dove Temple,

343
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,900
it didn't stop them
from trying to kill you.

344
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,850
Your whereabouts have been exposed.

345
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,740
They definitely won't let you off.

346
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,530
That's right, Abbess.

347
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,180
You can't just keep hiding from them.

348
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,220
Why don't you

349
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,090
follow us back to Linzhou?

350
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,980
You can expose Ke Shizhao
for the evil deeds he committed

351
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,050
and avenge your son.

352
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,460
All right.

353
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,020
I would have no way of finding out

354
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,660
if you two were sincere and trustworthy

355
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,330
if you guys didn't save me just now.

356
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,330
You two are kind souls.

357
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,770
I'll stop pretending then.

358
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,810
Ke Shizhao is a heinous crook.

359
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,810
In order to get his hand
on Ji family's Apothecary,

360
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,740
he tricked my son into following him

361
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,180
and poisoned him to his death.

362
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,260
And now,

363
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,330
he wants to take my life too.

364
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,090
Abbess,

365
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,260
to be honest,

366
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,330
I suspect that Ke Shizhao

367
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,220
was also behind the deaths
of my two elder brothers.

368
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,770
I've been trying

369
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,180
to search for evidence of his crime
for many years

370
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,130
so that I can avenge my loved ones.

371
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,220
The crook who killed your son

372
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,850
is my enemy as well.

373
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,500
That's right, Abbess.

374
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,130
Let us avenge those
who had suffered wrongful deaths.

375
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,810
I stayed alive until now

376
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,180
just so I could

377
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,460
seek justice for my son one day.

378
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,420
If not,

379
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,660
I would've died together
with him back then.

380
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,770
However, there was no way
I could seek justice for him.

381
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,900
We can help you out.

382
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,500
However, I need you to be our witness.

383
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,460
Please tell Grandmother

384
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,940
what you've seen

385
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,180
and how your son was killed.

386
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,130
Let Grandmother

387
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,530
realize Ke Shizhao's devious nature,

388
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,330
and she will uphold justice for you

389
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,980
and avenge your son.

390
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,570
All right.

391
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,700
I'll do anything as long as

392
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,220
I can uphold justice for my son.

393
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,420
If so, our current priority

394
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,530
is to return to Linzhou
as soon as possible.

395
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,660
But I went to take a look just now.

396
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,740
They've already
blocked off the downhill path.

397
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,020
And, you're hurt too.

398
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,290
We can't force our way out.

399
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,130
We have to think of something.

400
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,460
Abbess,

401
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,290
what's inside

402
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,940
the smelly cart?

403
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,130
The young nuns kept
our night soil in there.

404
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,610
Once the cart is filled,

405
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,810
the night soil dumper

406
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,940
will send it
to White Dove Temple's vegetable patch.

407
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,130
I have an idea.

408
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,460
Tianlei,

409
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,460
you'll be the night soil dumper.

410
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,370
Abbess,

411
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,770
we need to put on a show later.

412
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,330
I wonder if you can still see?

413
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,980
Although I'm blind,

414
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,370
my hearing and touch are perfectly fine.

415
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
I have no problem walking around.

416
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,260
Good.

417
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,770
Right now,

418
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,420
we just lack a nun's robe.

419
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,260
That's simple.

420
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,570
Travel half a li eastward
from this straw shed

421
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,660
and you'll find an ancient well.

422
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,700
We often wash our robes there.

423
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,940
The young nuns dry their robes there.

424
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,130
I'll go and borrow it then.

425
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,980
I'll join you.

426
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,530
You're hurt.

427
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,610
Stay here.

428
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,660
I'll be back in a second.

429
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,500
Even if I can't defeat them,
I can run away.

430
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,420
Get up.

431
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,660
We'd been here the entire night,

432
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,810
yet they were nowhere to be found.

433
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,570
How dare you sleep?

434
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,610
Is it possible that our brothers

435
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,090
have captured her somewhere else?

436
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,220
Is that possible?

437
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,370
That stinks.

438
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,500
Did you fart?

439
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,290
It's not me.

440
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,370
Stop right there.

441
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,740
Who are you guys?

442
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,370
Amitabha.

443
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,370
Mister,

444
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,420
we're here

445
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,810
to deliver the night soil
to the vegetable patch.

446
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,050
That stinks.

447
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,180
It's even hurting my eye.

448
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,740
Leave immediately.

449
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,050
Wait.

450
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,460
You guys...

451
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,290
Are you guys night soil dumpers?

452
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,610
Indeed, we are.

453
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,260
-That stinks!
-It's so disgusting.

454
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,940
That's disgusting!

455
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,850
Cover it!

456
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,500
Just leave!

457
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,660
-Scram!
-Just leave!

458
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:02,900
-Scram!
-Hurry!

459
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,220
That stench is unbearable.

460
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,700
We encountered them this early
in the morning. Just our luck.

461
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,330
-So disgusting.
-What the heck?

462
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:27,820
[White Dove Temple]

463
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,700
[Virtue and Kindness]

464
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,260
Mr. Guan,

465
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,940
we've searched the entire temple.

466
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,330
The three of them

467
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,330
have vanished.

468
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,530
Vanished?

469
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,500
Don't tell me they flew away!

470
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,500
What about this?

471
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,180
Leave the mountain immediately.

472
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,330
That man is hurt.
He won't be able to travel far.

473
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,500
I'm sure he's still in the city.

474
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,180
Find him

475
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,850
at all costs.

476
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:06,660
Yes, Mr. Guan.

477
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,260
I'll bring my men to search for them.

478
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,810
Wait.

479
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,940
Deliver a letter to Young Master Ke first.

480
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,370
Tell him

481
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,770
that the blind old lady is on the run.

482
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,660
Tell him to make preparations in Linzhou

483
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,500
in advance just in case
we can't catch up to her.

484
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,850
Once they step into Linzhou,

485
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,740
we can wait for them
to fall into our trap.

486
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,180
That way, we'll capture them.

487
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,050
Yes, Mr. Guan.

488
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:28,850
Let's go!

489
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,180
Dr. Liu?

490
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,180
Come.

491
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,290
Dear.

492
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,460
[We won!]

493
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,810
Look. Did we win?

494
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,700
We won!

495
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,050
Yeah.

496
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,570
-We won!
-We won!

497
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
Let's go and take a look.

498
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,090
Women aren't allowed
to enter without permission.

499
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,050
Let's wait for Pingwei.

500
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,940
We won!

501
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,370
We won!

502
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,330
There's no sign saying

503
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,260
that women aren't allowed to enter.

504
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,570
Pingwei!

505
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,050
Aunt!

506
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,050
Aunt!

507
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,330
Aunt!

508
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:48,940
-Baby nephew!
-Aunt!

509
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,220
Aunt, I missed you so much.

510
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,570
It's been so many years
since I last saw you.

511
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,900
You've grown taller again.

512
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,050
Aunt.

513
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,290
Your uncle deceived me.

514
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,180
He said there was a sign
that forbade women for entering the city.

515
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,370
It was here before this.

516
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,700
But we removed it yesterday.

517
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,290
Aunt, you came at the right time.

518
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,290
What a coincidence, huh?

519
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:08,500
Pingwei,

520
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
were you guys victorious?

521
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,370
That's right.

522
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,700
Come. Let's go and take a look.

523
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,420
Let's go.

524
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,740
This is the main camp.

525
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,290
Buqu!

526
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,220
The General is here.

527
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,260
Be careful.

528
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:27,980
Buqu.

529
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,220
-General.
-Mr. Liu.

530
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,850
General.

531
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,220
Let me introduce her to you guys.

532
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,700
This is my wife.

533
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,850
Adoptive Mother,

534
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,420
please accept my bow.

535
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,500
That won't do.

536
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,900
Miss Du, you're too courteous.

537
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,290
Let's have a seat inside.

538
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,260
All right. Let's go.

539
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,940
Come.

540
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:53,700
Come.

541
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,770
Did everything go well lately?

542
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:01,900
Yes, it did.

543
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,180
So, this is the General's tent.

544
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,500
It looks imposing.

545
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,570
Of course, Aunt.

546
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,900
Our tent is very cool.

547
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:26,570
Adoptive Father,

548
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,050
Adoptive Mother,

549
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,570
please accept my bow.

550
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,460
A teacher for a day is a father for life.

551
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,700
Moreover, Master saved me

552
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,850
from the bandits.

553
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,740
Please accept my bow too.

554
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,570
General,

555
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,530
you two

556
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,460
will diminish our merit by doing so.

557
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,740
Please get up.

558
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,810
My life was in danger

559
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,180
when I was struck by the poison arrow.

560
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,420
Master saved my life.

561
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,810
He's my second parent.

562
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,260
Moreover,

563
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,530
I'm also his adopted son-in-law.

564
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,530
I understand now.

565
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,290
Say,

566
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,700
seems like your long trip
was worth the effort after all.

567
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,260
Not only are you his teacher
and adoptive father,

568
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:18,700
but you're also

569
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,850
his matchmaker, huh?

570
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,260
Adoptive Father, you came from Linzhou.

571
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,660
I wonder how Yuhu

572
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,260
is doing in Qi Residence?

573
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,570
I think it must be fate.

574
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,570
Third Young Master of the Qi family

575
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,460
got along well with Miss Yuhu.

576
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,940
They're like-minded.

577
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,770
However,

578
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,260
a villain has been getting his way

579
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,220
in the Qi Residence for many years.

580
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,500
Miss Yuhu despises evil.

581
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,050
She's brave and bold,

582
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,220
and possesses excellent martial arts.

583
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,980
She provided Third Young Master Qi
with the boon he needed

584
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,530
after marrying
into the Qi Residence wrongly.

585
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,850
They developed feelings for each other

586
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,050
after sharing thick and thin
with each other.

587
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,570
I never expected

588
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,570
Yuhu to get along so well

589
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,940
with Third Young Master Qi.

590
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,770
This is what you call

591
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,900
a lucky hit.

592
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,810
Here.

593
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,050
To your success.

594
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:10,900
Bottoms up.

595
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,530
To your success.

596
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:20,980
General,

597
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,940
since we've achieved victory
in the frontline,

598
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,460
as they're still

599
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,370
engaging the villain back in Linzhou,

600
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,570
I wish to deal with the military affairs
as soon as possible

601
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,570
so that I can rush back to Linzhou

602
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,050
and lend them a hand.

603
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,770
Uncle, Aunt,

604
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,220
you two are saving the world
with your medicine

605
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,500
and practicing chivalry at the same time.

606
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,570
You two look like heroes now.

607
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,420
What are you saying?

608
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,570
We just love to interfere
with other people's business.

609
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,570
Great timing.

610
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,500
I will be holding a banquet
in the camp tonight.

611
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,260
Firstly,

612
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,370
it's to celebrate our success.

613
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,370
Secondly,

614
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,570
it can serve as your welcome feast.

615
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,050
Come.

616
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,260
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

617
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,850
Cheers.

618
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,700
Over here!

619
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,290
Medic!

620
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,180
Hurry! Come here!

621
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,500
Coming.

622
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,370
Here, do this.

623
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:12,740
Be gentle.

624
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,850
Apply pressure on it with both hands.

625
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:14,330
Okay.

626
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,850
Medic Li.

627
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,810
Go there.

628
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,850
Slowly.

629
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,940
Come, over here.

630
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,020
Medic Cheng,

631
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,050
their wounds

632
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,220
have become inflamed.

633
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,050
Check on them.

634
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:23,570
Okay.

635
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,700
Use these gauzes

636
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,050
to dress their wounds.

637
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,050
Adoptive Mother,

638
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,050
is the medicinal powder ready?

639
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,810
It'll be done in a second.

640
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,660
[Your Highness.]

641
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,220
The first candidate today is Scholar Wen.

642
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,460
He's the vice minister
of the Ministry of Personnel.

643
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,220
He's an extraordinary individual.

644
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,420
The second candidate is
a top-tier martial artist.

645
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,570
His name is Liu Dali.

646
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,050
He has a strong constitution,

647
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,740
and he possesses enormous strength.

648
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,020
This is the third candidate.

649
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,050
It's Academician Wu.

650
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,050
He's from Taiyuan, Shanxi Province.

651
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,700
I don't like any of them.

652
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,460
Take their portraits away.

653
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,050
Your Highness,

654
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,740
this is already the third round.

655
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,020
If you're still unable to pick one,

656
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,260
Her Majesty said she will...

657
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,180
What will she do?

658
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,810
Firstly, I don't recruit
a husband by examination.

659
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,460
Secondly, I don't intend to persuade one
to give up on martial arts.

660
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,460
Thirdly, I don't like to be jealous.

661
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,370
All these candidates are annoying to me.

662
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,020
Your Highness, please be appeased!

663
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,850
You still dare to say that?

664
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,900
You infuriate me to no end.

665
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,020
All of you may leave.

666
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,570
Your Highness, please be appeased.

667
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,050
[Her Majesty has arrived.]

668
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,700
Greetings, Mother.

669
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,980
Your Highness, what's the matter?

670
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,290
Get up.

671
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,740
Thank you, Mother.

672
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,570
Mother,

673
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,020
I don't want to get married

674
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,180
to any of them.

675
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,770
I just wish to stay by your side

676
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,570
and serve you forever.

677
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,900
Such nonsense.

678
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,900
Girls should be married
upon reaching adulthood.

679
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,420
You can't just choose to remain single.

680
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,460
I heard

681
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,020
that you've already viewed

682
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,570
more than 20 candidates.

683
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,730
Were you bewildered by all the choices?

684
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,570
Mother,

685
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,780
I'm willing to get married for your sake.

686
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,530
However, I hate those

687
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,250
pretentious men

688
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,900
who all want to be the royal consort.

689
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,250
I'm only willing to get married

690
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,420
to someone I like.

691
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,460
Selecting the royal consort
is an important matter.

692
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,820
It's fine as long as I give the nod.

693
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,780
That won't do!

694
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,050
It concerns my happiness.

695
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,340
If that's the case,

696
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,570
I have no choice

697
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,420
but to run away from my wedding.

698
00:34:59,420 --> 00:34:59,980
You!

699
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,730
We have joyous news!

700
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,570
We have joyous news!

701
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:04,780
We have joyous news.

702
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,730
Her Majesty,

703
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,780
we have joyous news!

704
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,860
General Yuan won all four of his battles
against the foreign country.

705
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,570
His Majesty is delighted.

706
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,460
His Majesty is inviting you
to Heart Rejuvenating Hall to join him for a drink.

707
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,940
[Yuan Buqu]

708
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,900
[is pretty capable.]

709
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,980
[He's definitely good enough]

710
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,980
[to be the royal consort.]

711
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,460
Do you want to give it a try?

712
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,610
It only skipped one time.

713
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,210
Let me teach you.

714
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:54,730
Reporting in!

715
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,170
General,

716
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,210
the messenger eunuch is here.

717
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,650
Got it. I'll return immediately.

718
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,460
Yes, General.

719
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,690
I'll be back in a second.

720
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,500
By the mandate of heaven,
this Emperor decree hereby.

721
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,250
General Yuan Buqu has succeeded
in repelling the invaders.

722
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,860
He shall receive the title
of Marquis of the North.

723
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,900
And, he shall be granted

724
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,780
with a marriage with Princess Changping.

725
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,900
That is all.

726
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,500
General Yuan.

727
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,860
General Yuan?

728
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,690
Receive the edict.

729
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,460
Your Excellency,

730
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,090
I cannot

731
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,570
accept this edict.

732
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:49,650
But...

733
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,170
I just got married
at the start of the month.

734
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,500
We love each other deeply.

735
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,860
I will not let her down.

736
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,500
Your Excellency,
please return to the palace

737
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,210
and tell His Majesty about this.

738
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,460
General, why are you saying so?

739
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,090
I'm just a messenger.

740
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,650
This imperial edict

741
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,610
was conferred by both His Majesty
and Her Majesty

742
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,610
themselves.

743
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,780
General, if you insist on refusing it,

744
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,860
that means you're
not following imperial orders.

745
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,300
General, do you wish to be punished?

746
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,020
Besides,

747
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,610
it's common

748
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,170
for a man

749
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,420
to get three or four wives.

750
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,250
General,

751
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,500
if you can't bear to part with your wife,

752
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,500
you can make her your concubine.

753
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,340
This way,

754
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,690
she can serve the same husband
as the princess.

755
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,940
She should be honored

756
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,020
that she has the privilege to do so.

757
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,500
General,

758
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,340
you should hurry and receive the edict.

759
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,300
How could I make my wife a concubine?

760
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,250
I can never do that.

761
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,130
Yuan Buqu,

762
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,650
refusing to accept the imperial edict

763
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,780
can cause you to be executed!

764
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,530
If worse comes to worst,

765
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,690
your family

766
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,210
and clan will be executed as well!

767
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,090
General, haven't you considered

768
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,610
the feelings of your fellow soldiers?

769
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,730
General, if you fall now,

770
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,730
all these soldiers

771
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,610
will definitely be assigned
to the auxiliary forces.

772
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,650
General,

773
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,940
can you bear to do so?

774
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,650
Buqu,

775
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,650
for the sake of our brothers,

776
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,940
we should plan this out.

777
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,780
General Yuan,

778
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,500
you must think twice.

779
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,420
I will receive the edict.
