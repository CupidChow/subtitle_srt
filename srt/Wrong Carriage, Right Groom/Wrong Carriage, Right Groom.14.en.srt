[Wrong Carriage Right Groom]

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,620
[Episode 14]

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,400
I had a son before I took the tonsure.

20
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,480
One day, my son caught a cold.

21
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,400
We went to an apothecary
to buy some medicine.

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,350
However,

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,000
that crook poisoned my son's medicine

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,560
in order to take over that apothecary.

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,280
My son suffered a terrible death.

26
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,070
And that crook

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,280
used the death of my son

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,710
to frame that apothecary

29
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,400
by saying that they gave him
the wrong prescription.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,310
At that moment,

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,400
our family and the family
of the apothecary's owner

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,120
were shattered.

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,840
However, the crook
is still at large even now.

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,630
He even wanted to silence me.

35
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,590
For some reason, the abbess's story

36
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,240
sounds very familiar.

37
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,960
Grandmother,

38
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,190
do you still remember?

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,630
Before this, I brought a young man

40
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,190
called Ji Jingtang here.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,430
He told you
about the pitiful case in Jiangzhou.

42
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,360
Abbess Luxuan,

43
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,150
the crook

44
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,150
who shattered your family,

45
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,310
what's his name?

46
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,000
Where does he come from?

47
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,280
Abbess!

48
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,560
Abbess!

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,560
Abbess!

50
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,280
Abbess!

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Abbess is poisoned!

52
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,710
It was you! You made the tea!

53
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,680
You wanted her dead!

54
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
Third Young Mistress, I'm innocent.

55
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,560
I brewed this tea for Old Madam too.

56
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,240
I was making tea in this very hall.

57
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,720
Everyone is fine after drinking it.

58
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
Why is she the only one poisoned?

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,680
Who knows what trick you used?

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,750
Forget it.

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
If you don't believe me,

62
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,270
I'll drink it in front of you.

63
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,510
Look.

64
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,630
I'm not poisoned.

65
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,310
Tianlei,

66
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,600
it's hard to say if the tea is poisoned.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,510
Maybe she was poisoned
in some other places.

68
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,870
It's just that the poison is acting up

69
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,270
in our residence.

70
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,310
Wait.

71
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,480
Grandmother,

72
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,950
maybe our business rival did this

73
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,560
in order to frame us

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,750
and steal our business.

75
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,950
That's possible.

76
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,750
All is cut-throat
in the realm of business.

77
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,160
Forget about that.

78
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
The abbess's life is more important.

79
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,750
-Hurry, hire a physician.
-Abbess.

80
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,360
Send abbess back to the Garden of Harmony.

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,920
Hurry.

82
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,680
Old Madam, I should follow them.

83
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,950
Go ahead.

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,430
How is she?

85
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,750
Luckily, I kept the elixir Master gave me.

86
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,950
The poison in her body

87
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,240
has been suppressed for now.

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,480
Her life is not in danger.

89
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,240
However,

90
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm afraid she's lost her voice
due to the poison.

91
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,830
We're so close.

92
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,160
What should we do now?

93
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
Abbess can't speak, and she's illiterate.

94
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,920
There's no way she can

95
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,160
express her grievances now.

96
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,560
Jingtang,

97
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,950
did you guys encounter anything bizarre

98
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,680
on your way to the Qi Residence?

99
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,870
No.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,310
We came here in a carriage.

101
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,720
We were safe throughout the journey.

102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,040
Try thinking carefully.

103
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,240
Oh yeah.

104
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,430
There was a trivial event.

105
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,000
Back then, the abbess was
getting in the carriage.

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,800
Suddenly, a young pauper
came out of nowhere.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,430
[He was grabbing
onto the abbot's hands tightly.]

108
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,240
Abbess!

109
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,800
Please take pity on me!

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,160
Please spare me some money.

111
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,070
He looked pitiful.

112
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,390
That's why I gave him some money.

113
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,630
After that, the abbess felt

114
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,190
that her arms were itchy
after getting into the carriage.

115
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,480
She kept scratching it

116
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,560
until her arms turned red.

117
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:30,920
So, the young pauper

118
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,480
was the one who poisoned her.

119
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,920
It's no wonder Ke Shizhao
could sit in the main hall

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,040
without any fear.

121
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,920
So, he poisoned abbess

122
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,680
on her way here.

123
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,120
He can also dispel Old Madam's doubt
toward him with this move.

124
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,240
We were careless.

125
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,720
He's too wicked.

126
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,830
Not only did he kill abbess's son,

127
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,750
but now, he's also trying to kill her.

128
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,630
For now,

129
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,510
we can only wait for the Master's return.

130
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,750
We'll see if he can

131
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,950
neutralize the poison.

132
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,480
However, Ke Shizhao

133
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,720
will never let abbess off if he knows

134
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,040
that she didn't die from the poison.

135
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,630
We have

136
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,750
to trick him.

137
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,920
Mister,

138
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,950
can't you give it another try?

139
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,720
Miss,

140
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,510
the abbess is dead.

141
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,270
Even the Heaven of Medicine

142
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,920
can't bring her back from the dead.

143
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,680
I think you guys
should prepare for her funeral.

144
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,920
Mister!

145
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,150
What should we do now?

146
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,270
Abbess,

147
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,080
how could you just die like that?

148
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,270
She's dead?

149
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,120
[Someone!]

Coming!

155
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,790
What's the matter?

156
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,150
What's the matter?

157
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,910
What happened?

158
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,270
Abbess, she...

159
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,790
Blood was oozing out of her orifices.

160
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,510
She's dead.

161
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,480
Third Young Mistress, Third Young Master,

162
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,910
we should find someone
to bring her body outside.

163
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,750
It's unlucky
to keep a corpse in the residence.

164
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,510
Xiaoqiao,

165
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,790
can you handle that for us?

166
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,910
No way!

167
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,630
Third Young Master,

168
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,480
I've never done this before.

169
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,150
Please seek someone else.

170
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,790
I still need to serve Old Madam.

171
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,910
I shall take my leave first.

172
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,360
That was scary.

173
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,270
That was so terrifying.

174
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,670
Xiaoqiao,

175
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,510
how did it go?

176
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,840
Her death was confirmed.

177
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,360
You can rest at ease now.

178
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,720
Are you sure?

179
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,390
I checked her breathing myself.

180
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,080
Blood was oozing from her orifices.

181
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,080
It was so terrifying.

182
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,910
I'm sure she's dead.

183
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,840
Xiaoqiao,

184
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,670
everything is fine now.

185
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,510
From now on,

186
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,720
We'll have nothing to worry about.

187
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,150
Old Madam,

188
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,480
have some tea.

189
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,720
How's the abbess's funeral going?

190
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,790
Old Madam,

191
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,480
Third Young Master
bought a top-grade coffin for her.

192
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,360
He has already sent her body
outside of the city.

193
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,150
He said he wanted to stop
in the temple outside of the city

194
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,270
for three days.

195
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,630
He'd hire eminent monks
to chant three days for her.

196
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,870
After that, he'll bury her.

197
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,840
Old Madam,

198
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,270
please don't worry.

199
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,550
Although that's the case,

200
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,960
the abbess did die
in Qi Residence after all.

201
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,200
How can I rest at ease?

202
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,670
Xiaoqiao,

203
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,550
you can return to your work.

204
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,910
I will chant sutras
and pray for the abbess today.

205
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,600
Yes, Old Madam.

206
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,200
Third Young Master
and Third Young Mistress

207
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,510
are hard to deal with indeed.

208
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,240
Master Guan wrote to me a few days ago.

209
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,630
He told me everything

210
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,200
the Third Young Master
and Third Young Mistress

211
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,360
had done in Jiangzhou.

212
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,270
They are

213
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,750
very capable indeed.

214
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,360
They almost got their hands

215
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,750
on the biggest gambling den in Jiangzhou.

216
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,120
But I never knew

217
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,030
that Third Young Master
knew how to gamble.

218
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,910
I assume

219
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,630
it's most likely
Third Young Mistress's doings.

220
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,910
I gave you a reminder long ago.

221
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,240
Third Young Mistress
isn't someone to be trifled with.

222
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,480
She may look like
a straightforward person,

223
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,080
but she's actually scheming and devious.

224
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,000
They must be harboring other devious plots

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,080
while living in the Garden of Harmony.

226
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,120
I never expected

227
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,120
a wedding that was supposed
to bring good luck

228
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,000
to turn out to be Qi Tianlei's way out.

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,670
He got himself such a capable assistant.

230
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
If that's the case,

231
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,270
our priority now

232
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,870
is to do away with his assistant.

233
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,030
What do you plan to do?

234
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,360
What do you think about the relationship

235
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,910
between Third Young Master
and Third Young Mistress?

236
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,870
Isn't it obvious?

237
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,390
They're very sweet to each other.

238
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,670
They have a close relationship.

239
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,840
Sweet to each other, huh?

240
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,480
I'll see how long

241
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,480
they can keep this up.

242
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,510
No couple

243
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,200
can stay sweet forever.

244
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,030
Are you saying

245
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,960
that you want
to drive a wedge between them?

246
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,600
That's right.

247
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,120
But they're newlyweds.

248
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,750
They're still in their honeymoon period.

249
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,030
There's a person I know.

250
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,630
Our goal will definitely be achieved

251
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,750
as long as she's here.

252
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,120
We just need to provide her
with some assistance

253
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,270
and devise our plots in secret.

254
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,670
By then,

255
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,390
we can reap profit as the third party.

256
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,390
Who is it?

257
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,390
Young Master Ke,

258
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,200
I've invited Miss Yu

259
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,270
as per your instruction.

260
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,000
Tell her to come inside.

261
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,790
Xiubo,

262
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,870
long time no see.

263
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,440
Mr. Ke.

264
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,600
Xiubo, you're too courteous.

265
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,600
I still remember the days

266
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,630
when Grandmother first
brought me to Qi Residence.

267
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,320
You followed Tianlei around

268
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,080
and called me cousin together with him.

269
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:37,910
What's the matter?

270
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,240
It's been some years since we met.

271
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,510
You feel somewhat distant now.

272
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,630
Why don't you address me
like how you address me in the past?

273
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,200
You can address me as Ke.

274
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,080
Ke.

275
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,630
Many years have passed since then.

276
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,550
Xiubo, you've grown up

277
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,360
to be an excellent beauty.

278
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,360
This time,

279
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,670
I came to Suzhou on a business trip.

280
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,840
I was passing by your house.

281
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,750
And, I figured that you've fulfilled

282
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,120
three years of mourning.

283
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,670
You should be able to greet visitors now.

284
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,840
That's why I came here to take a look.

285
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,000
And Xiubo, that has led to our encounter.

286
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,510
Time does fly.

287
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,120
It's been three years
since Grandmother passed away.

288
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,200
Now,

289
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,200
I'm all alone

290
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,600
in the world.

291
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,030
Xiubo,

292
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,000
please have a seat.

293
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,120
Have a seat.

294
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,390
Xiubo, don't be sad.

295
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,120
It breaks my heart

296
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,750
to see you

297
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,080
in such a state.

298
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,120
Xiubo,

299
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,600
although your paternal grandmother
has passed away,

300
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,000
your maternal grandmother is still alive.

301
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,790
Grandmother

302
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,510
has been friends with your grandmother
for a long time.

303
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,630
They're very close to each other.

304
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,910
I still remember

305
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,120
that you used to play around
in Qi Residence.

306
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,790
You were home for the past three years
to fulfill the mourning process.

307
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,480
Grandmother did instruct our servants

308
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,600
to clean the garden

309
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,200
you stayed in often

310
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,000
so that you could stay with us in Linzhou

311
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,870
once the mourning period was over.

312
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,670
Xiubo, if you're willing,

313
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,480
you can stay there
for as long as you like.

314
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,750
Tianlei

315
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,000
already got himself a wife.

316
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,600
There's a new female head
in that garden now.

317
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,480
How could a lone girl like me
stay there for a long time?

318
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,150
Xiubo, you're virtuous and dignified.

319
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,790
I'm impressed.

320
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,080
You should find a worthy man yourself.

321
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,150
It's a shame
that Tianlei is already married.

322
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,670
If not,

323
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,000
you two would've been

324
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,910
a match made in heaven.

325
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,120
It's a shame
that I was fulfilling my filial duties

326
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,360
when Tianlei was seeking a wife
to turn his luck around.

327
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,150
I couldn't be his wife.

328
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,510
That's how I missed out on it.

329
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,030
Xiubo,

330
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,240
there are plenty
of other fishes in the sea.

331
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,240
I'm sure you'll definitely

332
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,630
find a suitable man if you're willing to.

333
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,400
Young Master Ke,

334
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,680
I'm Xiubo's nanny.

335
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,640
Please pardon my interruption.

336
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I know there are plenty
of other fishes in the sea.

337
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,590
However, no one is as important to him

338
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,000
as Third Young Master Qi.

339
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,160
Nanny, stop that.

340
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,070
Xiubo,

341
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,310
you actually

342
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,160
fancy Tianlei?

343
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,550
Ke,

344
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,110
I wonder who Third Young Mistress is?

345
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,480
Although Du Bingyan is the daughter
of a rich merchant in Yangzhou,

346
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,920
she can't compare to you in terms

347
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,590
of family background or beauty.

348
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,400
It's a shame that Tianlei got himself

349
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,640
such a wife.

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,830
That woman has

351
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,310
a stubborn personality.

352
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,160
It's a shame that Tianlei
still has to compromise with her

353
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,400
even though he's already weak enough.

354
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,310
What's wrong?

355
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,110
Did she treat Tianlei badly?

356
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,590
Of course, she and Tianlei aren't as close

357
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,790
as you and Tianlei.

358
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,920
She never understood
Tianlei's personality.

359
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,550
Therefore, she was negligent

360
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,680
when it came to taking care of Tianlei.

361
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,680
Poor Tianlei.

362
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,790
If I could still visit Qi Residence

363
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,640
whenever I liked,
just like in the old days,

364
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,000
I would be willing
to watch over him forever.

365
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,640
Xiubo,

366
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,110
are you sure about that?

367
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,680
Sorry for my rudeness.

368
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,830
Ke, please don't mind me.

369
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,400
I...

370
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,350
I'm just telling you what's on my mind

371
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
since I have no one else to confide with.

372
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,680
It's fine.

373
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,590
Xiubo, I'm heartbroken

374
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
to hear about that.

375
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,720
Why don't I

376
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,640
lend you a hand?

377
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,400
You can snatch Tianlei

378
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,030
from her.

379
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,680
Ke, please don't spout such nonsense.

380
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,920
I don't understand what you mean.

381
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,680
Xiubo, you're wise and perceptive.

382
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,030
I'm sure you understand what I mean.

383
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,110
Since you have such intentions,

384
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,790
I will help

385
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,880
the two childhood sweethearts

386
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,440
to get back together again.

387
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
I don't

388
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,440
desire anything else.

389
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,680
I just hope

390
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,350
that I can see Tianlei every day

391
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,270
and stay by his side,
just like the old days.

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,680
I'll be content by then.

393
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,550
All right.

394
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,440
I'll make sure Grandmother

395
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,440
brings you back to Linzhou.

396
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,440
When it comes to pitch pot,

397
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,200
it depends on how perceptive

398
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,480
and daring you are.

399
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,200
Grandmother,

400
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,750
seems like
your Gold-Thread Peach Blossom Fan

401
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,030
will be mine now.

402
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,160
Who said so?

403
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,510
Enough.

404
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,070
You're talking big

405
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,920
when you haven't even won yet.

406
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,720
Just do it already.

407
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,400
I'll make you guys admit defeat.

408
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,160
Count the score.

409
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,310
Third Young Master, seven points.

410
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,270
Old Madam, five points.

411
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,550
Time is almost up.

412
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,070
Don't celebrate yet.

413
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,550
I'll win the game on Old Madam's behalf.

414
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,440
All right.

415
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,400
Bingyan will represent me.

416
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,440
Dear, please go ahead.

417
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,440
Double shot.

418
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,720
A double shot is worth four points.

419
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,550
Time's up.

420
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,070
It's Old Madam's win.

421
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Did you see that?

422
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,640
This is what you call turning the tides.

423
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,240
I never expected my wife
to get a double shot.

424
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,070
You two are bullying me together.

425
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,830
I can't win, but I'm upset that I lost.

426
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,030
Listen.

427
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,350
I made the right choice
by forming a partnership with Bingyan.

428
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,830
She's my lucky star.

429
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,240
She exhibits a sort of heroic air too.

430
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,510
I like it.

431
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,310
Hurry.

432
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,720
Give Third Young Mistress the fan.

433
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,240
Thank you, Grandmother.

434
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,440
You deserved it.

435
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,310

00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,070
She's here to lend me a hand.

456
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,110

Yes, Young Master.

460
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,510
Grandmother,

461
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,440
Miss Xiubo, granddaughter of the Yu family

462
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,720
in Suzhou, has arrived.

463
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,880
She brought plenty of gifts here.

464
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,830
That's why I helped her to settle down

465
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,960
in the residence first.

466
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,830
She'll come and greet you later.

467
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,310
Good.

468
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,790
Xiaoqiao,

469
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,240
take out

470
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,830
the Lushan Cloud Tea
that Shizhao bought for me.

471
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,550
That lass loves tea.

472
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,030
Old Madam,

473
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,160
you can't even bear
to drink it yourself usually.

474
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,240
I was quite late in joining the residence.

475
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,680
However, Old Madam,
you did mention her name often.

476
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,240
Seems like you do dote on her a lot.

477
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,240
Go now.

478
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,310
Who is she?

479
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,640
Bingyan,

480
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,400
you may not know,

481
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,720
but this lady

482
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,030
is the lone daughter
of a famous merchant named Yu in Suzhou.

483
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,680
She's a dignified lady.

484
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,350
I remember that she was already
a distinguished guest here

485
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,480
when I first came to the residence.

486
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,510
Speaking of which,

487
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,510
Xiubo and Tianlei have known each other
since they were children.

488
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,510
I think they're considered

489
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,440
childhood sweethearts.

490
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,680
Indeed.

491
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,480
Her grandmother is a close friend of mine.

492
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,480
We were great friends

493
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,790
before we got married.

494
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,440
Our families were friends for generations.

495
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,590
She lived in our residence

496
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,680
since my family hired
a private tutor for me.

497
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,510
We ate, lived,

498
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,030
and studied
under the private tutor together.

499
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,590
We practiced needlework together

500
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,590
when we were free.

501
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,960
Although

502
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,750
we weren't biological sisters,

503
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,680
we were just like sisters.

504
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,030
After that, she often brought Xiubo here

505
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,350
and lived in our residence.

506
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,270
So,

507
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,590
she grew up together with Tianlei.

508
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,770
Grandmother,

509
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:04,980
please be patient.

510
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,980
Xiubo will arrive at any second now.

511
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,180
Old Madam,

512
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,610
Miss Xiubo is here to greet you.

513
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,570
All right.

514
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,810
Tell her to come inside.

515
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:22,850
Please.

516
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,370
Old Madam,

517
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,290
I'm here to greet you.

518
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,770
I'm glad that you're here.

519
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,420
I'm so glad that you're here.

520
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,260
I'm so glad to see you.

521
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,020
Your parents passed away

522
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,810
when you were still very young.

523
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,810
Your grandmother raised you.

524
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,700
Now, she's gone.

525
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,940
I know you're heartbroken.

526
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,770
Grandmother had passed away.

527
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,500
Now, I'm all alone

528
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,980
without anyone to depend on.

529
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,740
I fulfilled my filial duties
for three years.

530
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,530
I often dreamt about her

531
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,330
and cried at night.

532
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,460
Poor girl.

533
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,330
Poor girl.

534
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,530
I know you're a filial child.

535
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,420
But that's fine.

536
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,130
Although your grandmother has passed away,

537
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,940
you still have me.

538
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,050
Am I right?

539
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,850
The Qi family

540
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,020
can be considered half of your family.

541
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,570
We will take care of you

542
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,090
and dote on you in the future.

543
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,020
Thank you, Grandmother.

544
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,660
Grandmother,

545
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,850
we should be delighted

546
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,220
that Xiubo is here.

547
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,700
You should stop being sad.

548
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,370
Look at me.

549
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,090
I guess I'm getting senile.

550
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,130
I'm making her upset too.

551
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,180
Xiubo,

552
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,810
it must've been a long trip.

553
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,420
Tianlei, the trip was worth it,

554
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,420
as I got to see you.

555
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,020
Tianlei, I missed you.

556
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,460
I was thinking of visiting you

557
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,220
and Old Madam

558
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,700
once the mourning period was over.

559
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,770
By the way,

560
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,980
Tianlei, I also brought
a relic of the past here.

561
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,460
I remember

562
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,530
that Grandmother and Old Madam

563
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,420
would bring us to a temple
and pray for the family when they met.

564
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,090
Tianlei, the head monk once said

565
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,290
that you were very talented.

566
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,370
Therefore, Grandmother hired
a goldsmith to make this.

567
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,420
However, the order was delayed.

568
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,900
After that, Grandmother passed away.

569
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,810
I stayed in Suzhou alone.

570
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,610
I have always kept it with me

571
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,770
for the past three years,

572
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,460
thinking that I could hand it to you

573
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,420
personally someday.

574
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,940
As Grandmother doted on me,

575
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,810
she ordered one for me too.

576
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,420
Your Ladyship,

577
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,020
it's obvious
that those two gold tokens were a pair.

578
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,090
Tianlei,

579
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,940
do you like it?

580
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,770
Tianlei,

581
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,570
look.

582
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,940
Xiubo is sincere

583
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,530
in presenting this gift to you.

584
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,700
You should just take it.

585
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,740
He likes it.

586
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,900
Thank you, Xiubo.

587
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,770
Xiubo, thank you for the gift.

588
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,130
Let me introduce her.

589
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,020
This is my wife.

590
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,770
This token

591
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,090
is an amulet of safety.

592
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,290
By then, when my wife and I

593
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,050
give birth to a chubby kid,

594
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,610
we'll treat this
as your congratulatory gift for him.

595
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,740
I'll accept it
on my child's behalf for now.

596
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,770
I'm happy that I can present

597
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,460
this congratulatory gift
to your future child

598
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,900
with Bingyan.

599
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,050
Bingyan is a few years older than you.

600
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,610
Hello, Bingyan.

601
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,980
Before this, I had only heard
that Tianlei got married.

602
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,330
Now that I'm seeing you in person,

603
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,850
you're truly beautiful.

604
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,810
Bingyan, I'm happy

605
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,660
that a beautiful lady like you
was married to Tianlei.

606
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,020
Xiubo, thank you for the compliment.

607
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,130
You're beautiful too.

608
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,530
Enough.

609
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,770
Don't just stand and talk.

610
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,260
All of you, sit down.

611
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,130
Come.

612
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,460
It's been a few years since I saw you.

613
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,610
Have a seat.

614
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,850
Grandmother,

615
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,050
you might not know,

616
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,740
but Xiubo was an exceptional girl.

617
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,420
During the mourning period,
which lasted for three years,

618
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,460
she managed

619
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,130
all of her family's business
single-handedly.

620
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,740
And she also started
an embroidery workshop

621
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,090
that was renowned in Suzhou.

622
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,850
When I was doing business in Jiangzhou,

623
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,260
the merchants of Suzhou
often mentioned Xiubo's name.

624
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,740
That's how I heard of her achievements.

625
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,980
In order to maintain a living,

626
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,420
I have no choice but to learn how
to manage the family business.

627
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,330
I'm an amateur when it comes to business.

628
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,850
Old Madam, I need to learn from you.

629
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,740
Business is as fierce as war.

630
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,770
I never expected a lass like you

631
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,420
to be this capable.

632
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,980
However, it's tough for a lady like you

633
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,260
to show your face in public.

634
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,370
You'll be able

635
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,660
to lead a stable life if you get yourself

636
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,260
a reliable husband.

637
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,460
Xiubo,

638
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,420
are you engaged?

639
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,660
No, I'm not.

640
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,770
I just want

641
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,180
to find a soul mate who loves,

642
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,090
dotes on, and protects me.

643
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,050
It's a shame
that I was born into a bitter fate.

644
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,180
I haven't found a suitable man until now.

645
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,610
Take your time.

646
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,260
Xiubo,

647
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,330
you have a pure heart.

648
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,570
I'll surely find you
a good man in the future.

649
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,290
Thank you, Old Madam.

650
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,460
By the way,

651
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,420
I've also prepared gifts
for everyone here.

652
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,940
Old Madam,

653
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,740
your gift

654
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,460
was difficult to choose and procure.

655
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,900
I hope

656
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,050
you won't mind what I picked for you.

657
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,290
Old Madam,

658
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,770
let's go to your room.

659
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,050
My gift

660
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,180
needs to be displayed on a tea table.

661
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,660
All right. Let's go to my room.

662
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,700
Xiangyun,

663
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,900
prepare some snacks.

664
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,420
[This set of Guan ware]

665
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,180
[was made by a porcelain expert.]

666
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,700
[It's his last work.]

667
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,980
[It can only be made
under very specific weather]

668
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,940
[and heat.]

669
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,330
[There are only
three sets of it in the world.]

670
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,460
[It was difficult to procure it.]

671
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,090
[When Grandmother was still around,]

672
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,610
[she once taught me
how to create tea arts.]

673
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,700
[She kept telling]

674
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,660
[that Old Madam was an expert]

675
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,810
[when it came to making tea arts.]

676
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,420
[Old Madam, I shall
gift this tea set to you]

677
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,940
[and offer you a cup of tea
with tea arts in it.]

678
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,980
[Please tolerate my poor display.]

679
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,180
[Old Madam, please don't laugh at me.]

680
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,180
[I hope you can give me some guidance.]

681
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,050
She's grinding the tea leaves.

682
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,220
Warming the teacups
and extracting essence.

683
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,570
Her way of conducting it
is smooth, like flowing water.

684
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,370
Grandmother,

685
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,370
look.

686
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,900
Xiubo does resemble you
to a certain extent.

687
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,610
Old Madam, please try the tea.

688
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,420
Ke.

689
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,300
Such exquisiteness.

690
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,900
The fragrance of the tea
soothes my heart and soul.

691
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,500
Did you make this tea

692
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,820
with dew water?

693
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,090
That's right.

694
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,380
Old Madam, you're wise indeed.

695
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,610
I once heard from Grandmother

696
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,420
that she and Old Madam often
rode boats to lotus ponds

697
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,610
to gather the dew on top
of the lotus leaves

698
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,130
in order to make tea with them.

699
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,460
I imitated your ways.

700
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,860
I collected dew water
in order to make tea for you.

701
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,980
It represents my longing for Grandmother

702
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,900
and the bond between you and Grandmother.

703
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,900
Girl,

704
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,340
you remind me of your grandmother.

705
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,860
Good girl.

706
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,300
Tianlei, Bingyan,

707
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,130
please enjoy the tea.

708
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,340
Tianlei, you were very picky

709
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,020
when you were young.

710
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,300
You didn't drink any tea
unless it was made by me.

711
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,530
Tianlei, try it.

712
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,340
See if it tastes the same.

713
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,050
All right. I'll try it.

714
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,650
Xiubo,

715
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,780
the tea you made is excellent.

716
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,690
Bingyan, thank you for the compliment.

717
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,090
If you like it,

718
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,530
I'll make tea for you every day.

719
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:09,860
Xiubo,

720
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,130
you can stay here.

721
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,050
You can stay here for as long as you like.

722
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,980
Thank you, Old Madam.

723
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,380
I guess I'm home then.

724
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,860
Xiubo, may I have your permission

725
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,380
to live in the garden
I lived when I was young?

726
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,090
I've grown attached

727
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,300
to everything there.

728
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,860
No problem.

729
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,820
I always kept that place vacant for you.

730
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,210
However, now that Tianlei is married,

731
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,340
he and Bingyan are living in the garden.

732
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,730
Old Madam,

733
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,130
Miss Xiubo grew up together

734
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,050
with Third Young Master.

735
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,380
If so,

736
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,380
she's considered half his younger sister.

737
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,170
She's just living in the same garden.

738
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,570
It's not like she's staying
in Third Young Master's place.

739
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,170
I don't think that's an issue.

740
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,730
Bingyan, I felt a connection with you
when I first saw you.

741
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,650
I wish to be closer to you.

742
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,650
However, if you're unhappy with that,

743
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,860
I won't live in the same garden as you.

744
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,380
I'll find a random guest room.

745
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,690
It's fine.

746
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,380
Xiubo, you can live there

747
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,300
if you like.

748
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,730
Thank you, Bingyan.

749
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,380
Nanny,

750
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,210
have you delivered gifts
to everyone in Qi Residence?

751
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,500
Your Ladyship, I've delivered the gifts

752
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,500
to each member of the residence

753
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,860
respectively.

754
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,860
Since I'm already here,

755
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,380
I have to make preparations in advance

756
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,860
if I wish to get married to Tianlei.

757
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,780
Not only do I have to please Old Madam,

758
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,530
but I also need
to let the entire Qi Residence

759
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,980
know about my kindness.

760
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,570
Your Ladyship, you're right.

761
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,020
Xiubo.

762
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,380
-Ke.
-Xiubo.

763
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:28,860
Xiubo,

764
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,210
your performance was superb today.

765
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,380
Grandmother was very pleased.

766
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,250
Our first step

767
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,340
is considered a success.

768
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,340
Third Young Mistress

769
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,210
looked very close to Tianlei.

770
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,090
Will I truly be able

771
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,340
to get married to Tianlei?

772
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,130
Xiubo,

773
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,730
when there's a will, there's a way.

774
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,300
You just need to make Grandmother happy

775
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,820
so that she'll let you stay here.

776
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,860
As for Tianlei,

777
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,210
you need to stir his heart

778
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,650
with your fingers.

779
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,650
Try your best to flirt with him.

780
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,530
Only then will you achieve your goal.

781
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,340
Ke, I will reward you handsomely

782
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,570
if everything goes smoothly.

783
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,340
Thank you, Xiubo.

784
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,860
Xiubo,

785
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,340
I shall not interrupt you

786
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,860
if you have something to do.

787
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,500
Farewell.

788
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,130
You heartless guy.

789
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,210
You were drooling all over Miss Xiubo.

790
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,570
I treated you so well, you know?

791
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,690
Why are you being jealous?

792
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,460
Someone else

793
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,500
should be jealous instead of you.

794
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,460
Xiaoqiao,

795
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,730
listen.

796
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,820
No matter how close Du Bingyan
and Qi Tianlei are,

797
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,860
no matter how much time
they spend with each other,

798
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,860
it can never compare to Qi Tianlei's bond

799
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,090
with Xiubo as childhood sweethearts.

800
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,090
Yeah, yeah. You're the smartest.
