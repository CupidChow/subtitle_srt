00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,480
That Du Bingyan is an impostor,

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,200
but the bride is real.

21
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,310
It's also true
that she came to Qi Residence

22
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,350
to endure hardships for Du Bingyan,

23
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,000
and I did make some selfish decisions.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,510
I just wonder whether the real Du Bingyan

25
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,560
was sent to Jingzhou by mistake

26
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,150
or sent back to Yangzhou.

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,000
She's probably

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,640
been sent to Jingzhou.

29
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,680
If she had been sent to Yangzhou,

30
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,000
the Du family would've
long since brought her back here

31

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,750

71

188
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,460
I'm going home.

189
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,980
Hey, Miss.

190
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,290
You libertine.

191
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,340
What are you looking at?

192
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,100
Off you go. Off you go.

193
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,340
Next.

194
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,690
Why are you leaving the city?

195
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,340
I'm going out to buy medicine.

196
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,260
Buy medicine?

197
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:43,890
Go.

198
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,930
Sir, please be seated.

199
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,810
Here.

200
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,340
Thanks.

201
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,340
Enjoy.

202
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,100
Sir,

203
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,650
would you please tell me
how I can get to the border city?

204
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,650
Walk out and go west.
It'll be an easy journey.

205
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,020
But there's a war going on in that place.

206
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,140
Why do you want to go there?

207
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,570
I'm going there to visit my big brother.

208
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,220
He's in the army serving our country.

209
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,770
Judging from your accent,

210
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,380
you must be from Yangzhou.

211
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,980
You have an amazing sense of hearing, sir.

212
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,980
I'm indeed from Yangzhou.

213
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,050
You're young

214
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,460
and rather frail-looking.

215
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,890
You need to be extra careful

216
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,220
when traveling alone like this.

217
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,810
Thanks for your advice, sir.

218
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,650
Here we are.

219
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:00,860
[Teahouse]

220
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,540
[Wine]

221
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,410
My ankle…

222
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,290
Old lady,

223
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,890
it wasn't my fault.

224
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,460
Don't think you can blackmail me.

225
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,460
Madam,

226
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,340
I'm not trying to blackmail you.

227
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,460
I really sprained my ankle.

228
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,220
My home is only one kilometer away.

229
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,740
Would you please be so kind

230
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,410
as to give me a ride with your cart?

231
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,460
No, no.

232
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,810
You need to clear my name.

233
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,980
Otherwise the others

234
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,460
might mistake me as a bully.

235
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,380
I didn't even touch you.

236
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,530
I had nothing to do
with your sprained ankle.

237
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,050
My ankle…

238
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,220
She's such a poor old lady.

239
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,530
Just offer her some words of comfort

240
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,020
and give her a ride.

241
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,930
Don't be such a harridan.

242
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,500
Why should I do that?

243
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,020
Because you got unlucky.

244
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,020
She fell in front of you.

245
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,810
Just give her a ride.

246
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,410
Walk away and drink your tea.

247
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,810
What does this have to do with you?

248
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,410
If you're so kind,
give her a ride yourself.

249
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,220
What should I do?

250
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,620
Easy for you to say.

251
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,260
Sir,

252
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,220
I take my leave.

253
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,410
Alright.

254
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,220
I can't believe this.

255
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,930
It's not my fault, okay?

256
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,260
Old lady,

257
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,460
let me help you up.

258
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,410
Old lady,

259
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,770
I'll help you back home.

260
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,410
Thank you so much, young man.

261
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,690
Let's go.

262
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,530
Slowly.

263
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,220
Slowly.

264
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,460
Slowly.

265
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,890
The village a kilometer ahead…

266
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,380
I go there to purchase grain quite often.

267
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,220
How come I've never seen that old lady before?

268
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,530
Yeah. I've never seen her either.

269
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,620
[Oh, no!]

270
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,340
[Misfortune's going to
befall that girlish-looking scholar.]

271
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,380
Slowly, old lady.

272
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,340
Thank you so much for doing this.

273
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,980
You're welcome.

274
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,260
This is my house.

275
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,930
Young man,

276
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,410
please go inside and have some rest.

277
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,460
No, thanks, old lady.

278
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,650
I have a journey to make.

279
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,460
You should get inside.

280
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,340
You're my savior.

281
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,170
How can I let my savior leave

282
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,340
without even entering my house?

283
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,530
That's really unnecessary, old lady.

284
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,340
Come on.

285
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,380
There's really no need for that.

286
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,570
Thank you for your kindness.

287
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,410
I've got to go.

288
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,460
You walked into my yard

289
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,050
and set foot on my property.

290
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,220
There's no way
I'm letting you leave like this.

291
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,810
Young man,

292
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,650
your skin is as delicate

293
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,740
as a girl's.

294
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,810
Old lady…

295
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
please let me go.

296
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,140
Young man,

297
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,500
be smart

298
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,860
and give me all your money.

299
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:08,980
I…

300
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,650
all my money is here.

301
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,890
This is all you got?

302
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,220
Who are you kidding?

303
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,020
You hear that?

304
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,690
Where's your money?

305
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,500
Who are you?

306
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,530
A physician passing through.

307
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:32,980
Physician?

308
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,380
You must have a death wish.

309
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,460
Husband!

310
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,810
Swordsman!

311
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,860
Swordsman, mercy! Swordsman!

312
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:52,770
Swordsman,

313
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
please let them go.

314
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,220
You two,

315
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,620
do not commit evil again.

316
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,410
Get lost!

317
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:04,930
Come on.

318
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,260
Husband.

319
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,260
Hurry.

320
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,690
What's wrong?

321
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,170
You don't remember me?

322
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,570
Sir?

323
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,570
I cautioned you only moments ago.

324
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,860
How come you ended up

325
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,340
in a thugs' den so soon?

326
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,570
I feel so ashamed.

327
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,380
Actually, it's not your fault.

328
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,650
Who could've thought

329
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,340
that pitiable old woman

330
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,650
was actually an evildoer?

331
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,100
The fault

332
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,020
is your kind heart.

333
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,260
Thank you for saving my life, sir.

334
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,810
I'm forever indebted to you.

335
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,980
You don't have to thank me.

336
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,900
But you must remember

337
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,370
to be extra cautious

338
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,370
when making a journey.

339
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,570
Sir.

340
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,180
Sir.

341
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,940
I don't know

342
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,130
how far away the border city is.

343
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,500
The prospect of traveling alone

344
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,770
really scares me.

345
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,090
Relax, young man.

346
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,290
I'll be honest with you.

347
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,900
The border city is my destination as well.

348
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,810
Really?

349
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,530
Would you please

350
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,770
let me join you on your journey?

351
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,500
Okay.

352
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,460
Great!

353
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,370
You're going to the border city
to visit your big brother,

354
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,460
and I'm going to the barracks
to treat the wounded.

355
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,460
If we travel together,

356
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,740
we'll be able to watch each other's backs.

357
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,610
I have a nephew

358
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,980
serving as a lowly officer
under General Yuan.

359
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,530
He introduced me to General Yuan.

360
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,810
Every year,

361
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,020
I go to the barracks and stay there
for some days.

362
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,180
This year, I chanced upon you
during my journey.

363
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,260
It would seem
our paths were meant to cross.

364
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,770
May I have your name?

365
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,460
My surname is Du.

366
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,810
My given name is Bin,
the character meaning brawn and brains.

367
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,050
You may just call me Du Bin.

368
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,290
Childe Du,

369
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,220
I'm Liu Ruoqian.

370
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,330
Sir. Liu.

371
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,220
Sir. Liu,

372
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,850
I heard the barracks are heavily guarded.

373
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,050
Is that true?

374
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:36,740
It is.

375
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,740
Even the soldiers' relatives

376
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,940
cannot enter the barracks
without permission.

377
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,850
So even if I get there,

378
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,980
I won't be able to gain entry.

379
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
What should I do?

380
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,900
Sir. Liu.

381
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,370
How about this?

382
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:02,980
I can tell

383
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,700
you're a smart intellect.

384
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,500
Though you got tricked just now,

385
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,420
at the crucial juncture,

386
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,980
you did step out to help someone in need,

387
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,290
which means

388
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,810
you have the spirit of a physician.

389
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,740
I'll apprentice you.

390
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,940
You can enter the barracks as a physician.

391
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,130
You'll be able
to look for your big brother

392
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,130
and learn some medical skills,

393
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,090
killing two birds with one stone.

394
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,330
Really?

395
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,130
Master,

396
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,370
please accept a kowtow
from your apprentice.

397
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,500
Come on.

398
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,610
Get up.

399
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,330
Gather your things

400
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,090
and we'll depart right away.

401
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,610
Master.

402
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,540
[Women must not enter without permission.
Violators shall be executed on site.]

403
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,020
Pingwei.

404
00:19:59,130 --> 00:19:59,770
Uncle.

405
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,220
You finally came.

406
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,260
Uncle,

407
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,530
the waiting nearly killed me.

408
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,370
I missed you so much I almost sickened.

409
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,290
What kind of nonsense is that?

410
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,130
Who's this fella?

411
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,570
Let me introduce you guys.

412
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,370
This is my nephew Sha Pingwei.

413
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,810
This is my apprentice Du Bin.

414
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,900
Buddy, you have such

415
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,260
adorable looks.

416
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,130
Your delicate and white skin

417
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,740
is so likable.

418
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,700
By the way, Uncle,

419
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,130
yesterday we killed 300 enemies
in the fight,

420
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,850
but we also lost 30 men.

421
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,810
Our medics were short-handed,

422
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,370
and Yuan got angry.

423
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,050
He said he'd execute the medics

424
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,220
unless they cured
the heavily wounded soldiers.

425
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,500
So General Yuan is indeed brutal.

426
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,130
Wha–what did you just say?

427
00:20:59,290 --> 00:20:59,900
I said

428
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,810
the general's indeed a doughty fighter.

429
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,770
Of course he is.

430
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,700
Uncle,

431
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,740
I'm so glad you came.

432
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,610
Those severely wounded soldiers are saved.

433
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,460
Come on.

434
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,130
I'll take you guys
to see the wounded first.

435
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:11,810
Let's go.

436
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,220
Medic Qin? Medic Qin?

437
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,260
Go fill this prescription.

438
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,460
Alright.

439
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,610
Styptic cotton.

440
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,220
Over there.

441
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,220
Bandage cloth.

442
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,770
[Bring me some medicine.]

443
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,370
Bandage cloth!

444
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,260
Master.

445
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,220
Slowly.

446
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,770
Hurry. Bring me the styptic drug.

447
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,610
Styptic drug?

448
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,570
Over there!

449
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,290
Find it.

450
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,020
Styptic drug…

451
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,130
Master…

452
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,050
Come here.

453
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,090
Hold this for me,

454
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:56,740
with both hands.

455
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,500
Master, I…

456
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:57,900
Push hard.

457
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,260
I…

458
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,290
Hold it.

459
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,900
[Qi Residence]

460
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,020
Sister-in-law.

461
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,500
Brother-in-law.

462
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,130
I was being presumptuous.

463
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,460
Please forgive me.

464
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,940
Tianlei…

465
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,460
Is he not with you?

466
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,700
He's in the house.

467
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,500
How's Tianlei's health lately?

468
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,050
Fine, I think.

469
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,130
I happen to have something

470
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,610
to tell you about Tianlei.

471
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,130
Can we talk in private?

472
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,260
Sure.

473
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,370
Come on, sister-in-law.

474
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:10,850
Sit.

475
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,090
Sister-in-law,

476
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,770
Tianlei has been sickly
since his childhood.

477
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,220
A few years ago
he suffered from severe illness.

478
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,900
Fortunately, a physician
surnamed Liu showed up.

479
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,900
His medical techniques were kind of weird,

480
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,050
but

481
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,900
he did know his stuff.

482
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,660
Tianlei, after taking his medicine,

483
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,980
looked somewhat better.

484
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,570
However,

485
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,850
he'll still need you

486
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,980
to offer him much care.

487
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,330
My maternal grandmother

488
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,700
bade me help deal with domestic affairs
of Qi Residence,

489
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,420
but she did it
so that Tianlei could take over

490
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,260
after his recovery.

491
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,810
I'm just a scholar.

492
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,330
The affairs of Qi Residence,
big and small,

493
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,940
domestic and commercial,

494
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,700
are indeed

495
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,460
inundating me.

496
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,700
Old Madam is my maternal grandmother,

497
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,420
and Tianlei's paternal one.

498
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,770
Both of us are her grandchildren,

499
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,180
and Grandmother loves us equally,

500
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,660
but

501
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,220
the rightful heir
of the Qi family is Tianlei,

502
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,700
not me.

503
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,130
When Tianlei recovers well enough

504
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,460
to shoulder the responsibilities,

505
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,700
I

506
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,700
will return to Jiangzhou.

507
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,330
I wish you good health,
Young Master Ke and Third Young Mistress.

508
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,530
I'm here
to deliver Third Young Master's medicine.

509
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,050
He's not here?

510
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,460
He's inside.

511
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,570
In the past,

512
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,940
Third Young Master always liked
to stay indoors alone.

513
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,330
But now he has you.

514
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,900
I'm sure his temper

515
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,420
will gradually change.

516
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,090
Xiaoqiao,

517
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,020
Third Young Mistress is thoughtful.

518
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,570
She doesn't need your nagging.

519
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,020
Just deliver the medicine
to Third Young Master.

520
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,500
Young Master Ke,

521
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,980
you may not know,

522
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,610
but ever since Third Young Mistress marries
into Qi Residence,

523
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,370
they've been a very loving couple.

524
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,890
Third Young Mistress always

525
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,650
personally gives Third Young Master medicine.

526
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,170
Sister-in-law,

527
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,980
considering Tianlei's health condition,

528
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,700
you'll have to give him

529
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,940
some more care.

530
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:36,780
By the way,

531
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:37,980
tomorrow

532
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,890
I'll go to other places
to inspect a dozen stores.

533
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,410
If you need anything,

534
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,740
you may go to Xiaoqiao.

535
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,980
Me?

536
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,780
Yeah…

537
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,460
If Third Young Mistress needs anything,

538
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,540
just say the word.

539
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:14,850
Master.

540
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,570
Master,

541
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,610
you're amazing.

542
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,170
It's been hardly three days,

543
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,130
but you've cured all the wounded soldiers.

544
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,940
Well, you did a good job assisting me.

545
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,940
You're a smart kid.

546
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,850
I'm sure someday

547
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,980
you'll become an excellent physician.

548
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:29,980
By the way,

549
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,370
I have a word of caution for you.

550
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,700
This is Anaesthesia Powder.

551
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,170
It's very potent.

552
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,850
Its mere smell can knock people out.

553
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,260
You must keep it

554
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,610
somewhere safe.

555
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,460
I'll go check on the patients.

556
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:06,890
Du Bin.

557
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,020
You look so intent.

558
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,610
What are you doing?

559
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,130
I'm grinding herbs.

560
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,850
That sounds so tiring.

561
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,170
You deserve a reward.

562
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,300
Have a piece of fruit.

563
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,300
Come on.

564
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,810
Here. Take it.

565
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,700
Eat it.

566
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,940
I plucked these this morning.

567
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,540
Du Bin,

568
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,810
why are you so fussy about fruit?

569
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,020
You're acting like a girl.

570
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,220
I…

571
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,780
I checked the rosters of all barracks,

572
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,090
but your brother's name is not
on any of them.

573
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,740
Is it not?

574
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
How about this?

575
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,220
Please

576
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,540
take me to see General Yuan.

577
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,170
I'll ask him if he knows.

578
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:05,940
Recently,

579
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,780
you had better not to visit him.

580
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,700
What do you mean?

581
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,090
Firstly, there's been
a lot of warfare lately.

582
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,130
Secondly,

583
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,780
he got some family matters to deal with.

584
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,330
What kind of family matters?

585
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,330
Actually, I'm not supposed
to tell you this.

586
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,740
He married a woman in Yangzhou,

587
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,220
but that woman, presumably unable
to ensure the loneliness,

588
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,570
ran away from the General's Residence

589
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,060
before the general could even see her.

590
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,020
That is unbelievable.

591
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,890
It sure is,

592
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,220
which is why the general's

593
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,130
swamped, angry, and vexed right now.

594
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,700
You need to be smart in the next few days.

595
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,020
Do not mess with him on any account.

596
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,330
Du Bin,

597
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,980
you don't have to worry that much.

598
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,650
Here's the plan.

599
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,300
When everything's settled,

600
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,500
and the general's no longer busy,

601
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
I'll ask him again for you.

602
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,090
Also, we can make some inquiries

603
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,780
about your brother's whereabouts.

604
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,570
If finding him is really not an option,

605
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,370
we can become sworn brothers.

606
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,980
I'm willing to be your big brother.

607
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,570
I'm the fourth child in my family.

608
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,410
I have three big sisters

609
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,260
and a younger sister.

610
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,170
I'm dying to get a little brother.

611
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:17,850
Lieutenant Sha,

612
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,170
your uncle's waiting for me
to deliver the medicine to him.

613
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,170
I've got to go.

614
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,220
But

615
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,650
I haven't finished speaking yet.

616
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,540
Maybe another time.

617
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,330
I…

618
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,780
What are you thinking?

619
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,130
Nothing.

620
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,370
You're lying.

621
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,300
You've been having this faraway,

622
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,330
troubled look on your face lately.

623
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,020
Tell me.

624
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,060
What's bothering you?

625
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,500
I told you.

626
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,540
Nothing.

627
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,850
You're thinking
about your big brother again?

628
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,330
Like I said,

629
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,650
before you find him,

630
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,780
I'll be your big brother.

631
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,130
Come on.

632
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,810
Today I'll take you to a nice place.

633
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,090
What kind of nice place?

634
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,810
A wonderland.

635
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,260
I got work to do.

636
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,260
What's the rush?

637
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,980
You can always finish it afterwards.

638
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,890
I really need to finish it.

639
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,460
Wait.

640
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:26,890
Let me see.

641
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:28,890
I…

642
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,220
Don't move.

643
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,260
Why is your hand so soft?

644
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,220
It's like a girl's hand.

645
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,570
What are you talking about?

646
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,780
You… cut the nonsense.

647
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,130
I–I'll go…

648
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,370
I'll go with you, okay?

649
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,810
That's the spirit.

650
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,170
What do you think?

651
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,170
I discovered this place alone.

652
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,060
Nobody else knows.

653
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:09,850
Really?

654
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,370
It surprises me
there's such a beautiful place near the border.

655
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,940
It's virtually a wonderland.

656
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,780
I wasn't lying, was I?

657
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,020
In my spare time,

658
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,780
I come here quite often

659
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,540
to bathe, swim, or something like that.

660
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:20,890
Du Bin,

661
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,460
can you swim?

662
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,700
No.

663
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:25,540
No?

664
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,700
It's okay.

665
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,610
I'll teach you.

666
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,500
Pingwei,

667
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,500
what are you doing?

668
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,810
I need to undress to swim.

669
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,540
Don't undress.

670
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,460
Uh, what are you afraid of?

671
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,130
We're both men.

672
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,810
It's not like there're girls watching us.

673
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,330
I'm not going to watch.

674
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,220
Du Bin,

675
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,370
let me show you how to dive.

676
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,260
I'm not watching it.

677
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,980
Pingwei, listen.

678
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,570
Darn it.

679
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,780
That's the bugle.

680
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,020
It's an emergency signal.

681
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,300
Du Bin,

682
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,330
I've got to go.

683
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,260
Sorry.

684
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,500
You may retrace your steps back.

685
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,570
See you.

686
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,300
[Sightseeing Pavilion]
This thing's miraculous.

687
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,170
With this,

688
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,650
I can see things dozens of miles away.

689
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,650
This thing

690
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,170
is called western telescope.

691
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,650
It enables you to see faraway things

692
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,220
as if they were right in front of you.

693
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,130
It's a gift for Grandmother

694
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,170
from a Fujian traveling trader.

695
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,650
Grandmother gave it to me.

696
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,890
It's so fun.

697
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,170
There's plenty of fun stuff

698
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,740
in Qi Residence.

699
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,650
Fun stuff?

700
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,500
Show me.

701
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,850
Hold your horse.

702
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,410
Let me get this straight at the outset.

703
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,330
In Qi Residence,

704
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,980
there are things really fun,

705
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,540
things seemingly fun,

706
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,610
things that are not fun,

707
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,850
and things you mustn't toy with.

708
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,780
Things I mustn't toy with?

709
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,460
What are they?

710
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,780
About that,

711
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,130
I'll keep it secret for now.

712
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,610
I'll tell you when the time's right.

713
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,130
Don't give me the snort.

714
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,850
Distance tests a horse's stamina.

715
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,940
The passage of time tells the true
from the false.

716
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,610
Tianlei.

717
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,610
You need to see this.

718
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:31,850
What's wrong?

719
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,980
Something not fun has shown up.

720
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,500
Come here.

721
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,500
Over there.

722
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,700
Beat him.

723
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,540
Beat him as hard as you can.

724
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,300
[Beat him to death!]

725
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,300
[Beat him!]

726
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,570
[Beat him to death!]

727
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:58,980
Stop.

728
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,060
[Pull him up.]

729
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,090
You bastard.

730
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,220
Where else can you run to?

731
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,770
Why don't you show me?

732
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,250
You think someone like you is fit
to meet Old Madam?

733
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,690
I'll kill you.

734
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,610
Still want to play tough, huh?

735
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,210
Beat him…

736
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,420
Beat him to death!

737
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,170
Yan Sheng.

738
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:40,690
Let's go.

739
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,020
Stop!

740
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,060
Says who?

741
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,650
Third Young Master.

742
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,650
Wang Huzi,

743
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,770
why are you beating this young man up?

744
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,060
Third Young Master,

745
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,900
this unruly bastard came out of nowhere

746
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,860
and attempted
to intrude into Qi Residence.

747
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,340
He also demanded to see Old Madam.

748
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,130
I stopped him

749
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,210
and he started calling people names.

750
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,420
Calling people names?

751
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,290
Who did he call names?

752
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,650
This bastard's unbelievably ballsy.

753
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,690
He called Young Master Ke names.

754
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,900
Young Master Ke?

755
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,090
Then he's indeed one ballsy bastard.

756
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,090
What names did he call Young Master Ke?

757
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,540
He said Young Master Ke's…

758
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,940
I can't remember.

759
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,060
What names did you call him?

760
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,420
Third Young Master,

761
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,690
his words were dreadful to hear.

762
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,980
I see no reason to repeat them.

763
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,090
It's okay.

764
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,500
If that's the case,

765
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,650
let's just forget about those words.

766
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,460
Why are you working against the Qi family?

767
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,980
You're pretty stubborn.

768
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,500
Wang Huzi,

769
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,900
leave him to me.

770
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,210
I'll interrogate him.

771
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,060
Uh…

772
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,290
What's wrong?

773
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,900
I've given the order.

774
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,770
What are you guys standing there for?

775
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,540
Third Young Master,

776
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,940
You're in poor health.

777
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,690
You don't have to go to such trouble.

778
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,500
Just let me handle this matter.

779
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,770
Let's go!

780
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:55,980
Wait.

781
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,020
Wang Huzi,

782
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,730
do you feel you don't have
to follow my orders?

783
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,060
Third Young Master,

784
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,770
Young Master Ke has been the one

785
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,980
dealing with domestic affairs.

786
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,060
Today he went out to inspect the stores.

787
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,020
He's not in.

788
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,610
Young Master Ke is not in,

789
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,570
but I am, aren't I?

790
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,730
Third Young Master,

791
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,460
domestic affairs of this family

792
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,420
have always…

793
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,540
Let's just wait
until Young Master Ke returns.

794
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,570
We should hear his opinion.

795
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,730
You…

796
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,170
you're such a talky nuisance.

797
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,570
Young Mistress,

798
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,940
you're new here,

799
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,570
and unfamiliar with the situation
in this family.

800
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,170
I suggest you stay out of this.

801
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,170
As chance would have it,

802
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,460
I'm determined to get involved in this.

803
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,420
Young Mistress.

804
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,690
Heed my words,

805
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:44,980
and nothing will go wrong.

806
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,940
It's broken…

807
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,860
It hurts…

808
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,900
Heed my words,

809
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:56,820
and nothing will go wrong.

810
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,460
Let's go.

811
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,940
What is that?

812
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,570
This is a Healing Pill left by Mr. Liu.

813
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,900
It's very effective
against traumatic injury.

814
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,980
Yan Sheng.

815
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,250
Buddy,

816
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:49,690
what's your name?

817
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,650
No need to be afraid.

818
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,690
Tell me where you're from.

819
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,860
Why did you call Ke Shizhao names
at the front gates?

820
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,690
You have nothing to fear.

821
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
This is my study.

822
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,340
You can say whatever you want.

823
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,170
Yan Sheng,

824
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,340
you can stop gesticulating.

825
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,380
He can't understand.

826
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,250
My little sister means

827
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,690
she saw

828
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,460
you getting beaten up at the front gates.

829
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,170
Since you're here to see Grandmother,

830
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,570
you must have something important
to tell her.

831
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,020
Wang Huzi won't let you see her.

832
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,250
I'm Third Young Master Qi.

833
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,940
You can just tell me.

834
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,060
If there's more to the story,

835
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,020
I promise I'll tell her.

836
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,170
Actually, I…

837
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,420
I have my own reasons.

838
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,570
I heard

839
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,730
Old Madam's the one
in charge of Qi Residence,

840
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,770
so I came here as the victims' family,

841
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,540
in the hope
that Old Madam would help me get justice.

842
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,460
But before I could see Old Madam,

843
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,540
I encountered a group of vicious servants.

844
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,210
They stopped me at the gates

845
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,940
and started beating me.

846
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,290
I see.

847
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,420
Don't worry.

848
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,290
We're not on those bad people's side.

849
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,820
Otherwise we wouldn't have rescued you.

850
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,540
[If you have any grievances,]

851
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,420
[feel free to tell us.]

852
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,290
Father…

853
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,570
Mother…

854
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,820
You died such tragic deaths.

855
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,690
Buddy,

856
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,340
calm down.

857
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,090
Take your time.

858
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,540
My name is Ji Jingtang.

859
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,060
I'm from Jiangzhou.

860
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,250
When I was young,

861
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,820
my parents opened a drugstore.

862
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,420
This is where I live
with my adoptive mother.

863
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,460
Wait here for a moment.

864
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,220
[Tudi Temple, Qingrun Hall]

865
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,860
Mother? Mother?

866
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,290
Mother?

867
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,820
What happened to you?

868
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,940
You went to Qi Residence?

869
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,570
I'm fine, Mother.

870
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,570
Why are you so disobedient?

871
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,570
Who are these two?

872
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,730
This is Childe Qi.

873
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,210
This is Childe Qi's wife.

874
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,570
They're from Qi Residence?

875
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,500
Why did you bring two outsiders
to our house?

876
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,570
Mother…

877
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,250
Mother!

878
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,290
Third Young Master,

879
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,340
I'm so sorry.

880
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,420
My mother's always like this.

881
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,730
Her bark is worse than her bite,

882
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,060
but actually she's very kind-hearted.

883
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,900
She just mistook you guys
as Ke Shizhao's accomplices

884
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,500
after hearing you're from Qi Residence,

885
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,820
which was why she reacted that way.

886
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,210
I hope you don't mind.

887
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,540
It's okay.

888
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,340
I have a way.

889
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,860
Do you think you can go elsewhere
and wait for a moment?

890
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,420
Okay.

891
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,340

You listen to me!

893
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,900
There's no way I'm letting anybody
from the Qi family into my house!

894
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,940
Mother,

895
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,460
