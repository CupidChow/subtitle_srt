Xiaoqiao,

26
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,310
aren't you exhausted
from traveling back and forth

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,040
all day long?

28
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,760
Why don't you pass the medicine to Xiaoxi?

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,030
You can tell her to brew it.

30
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,240
Third Young Mistress, that's a great idea.

31

Third Young Mistress,
you're a noble lady as well.

we're considered rich

50
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,710
We hire embroiderers

51
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,190
to make all the embroideries at home.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,710
My mother said

53
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
that although we aren't that wealthy,

54
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,280
we don't lack the money
to hire embroiderers.

55
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,080
We're unlike poor families

56
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,870
that make the ladies at home
do their embroideries.

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,240
Poor families are quite petty.

If so, Third Young Mistress,
what have you learned

59
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,910
when you were home?

60
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,310
Of course I learned everything there was.

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,470
The Du family has a business.

62
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,630
I have to learn how to manage businesses.

63
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,870

65
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,280

It's not that difficult.

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,750

68
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,910

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,470
It's nothing noteworthy.

If so, did Mr. Du allow you
to manage the shops then?

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,840
Of course.

73
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,240

Now that I'm at this age,

89
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,750

91
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,630

Tianlei's body condition

93
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,190

94
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,160
I don't know

95
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,720
if he can stand up

96
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,950
and support the Qi family
on his shoulders.

97
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,510
But luckily,

98
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,720
I still have Shizhao with me.

99
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,120
If not,

100
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,270

Old Madam,
it's all thanks to your guidance.

103
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,830
However, the Ke family is also waiting
for him to inherit

104
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,750

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm afraid

106
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,270
he wouldn't stay here in the long run.

107
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,310
I also gave it some thought before.

108
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,120
However, Tianlei

109
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,680
isn't capable enough
to be the head of the family yet.

116
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,040
Old Madam, did you have no idea?

117
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,040
Third Young Madam was managing
her family business in Yangzhou

118
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,270
instead of learning needlework.

119
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Even her siblings were impressed
with her skills.

120
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,120
Who told you that?

121
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,360
Third Young Mistress told me that herself.

122
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,600
Your in-law, Mr. Du of Yangzhou,

123
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,270

Is that true?

125
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,360
That's great.

126
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,600
What do you think?

127
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,040

128
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,870

129
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,950

131
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,630

134
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:39,920

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,630
it's never a good thing.
It's also a huge deal.

that Bingyan and I will head there soon.

168
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,150
All right. I shall take my leave.

169
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,630
Grandmother.

170
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,150
Grandmother.

171
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,910
Mother.

172
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,480
Mother.

173
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,550
Come and have a seat.

174
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,720
Have a seat.

175
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,600
Sit down.

176
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,120
Bingyan,

177
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,080
I heard that you managed 18 shops

178
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,720
when you were still
living with your family.

179
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,200
Is that true?

180
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,510
Yes, it's true.

181
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,440
In the past,

182
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,360
I used to follow my father around.

183
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,150
I was observing him
when he was checking the accounts.

184
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,150
Due to that, my father

185
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
let me handle some of the shops.

186
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,000
And, since I was doing a good job at it,

187
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,240
he told me

188
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,910
that he would let me handle the business

189
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,320
when I turned 18.

190
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,720
How...

191
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,030
How many shops did you say just now?

192
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,480
18.

193
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,200
Yes, I managed 18 shops.

194
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,320
That's right, 18 shops.

195
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,000
But after that...

196
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,670
I was married off to Linzhou

197
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,120
before I turned 18.

198
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,510
So, in reality, I haven't managed
to handle 18 shops yet.

199
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,750
That's quite all right.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,510
You're a girl,

201
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,000
yet you follow your father around

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,150
and manage his business for him
at such a young age.

203
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,080
I only started

204
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,200
managing the family business
when I was 25.

205
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
Tianlei,

206
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,550
this bride of yours

207
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,080
is much more capable than me
when I was young.

208
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,270
Have a seat.

209
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,030
So, what kinds of goods

210
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,030
were you guys selling?

211
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,360
Timbers.

212
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,960
Grandmother, we sold timbers.

213
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,360
So, your family was

214
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,630
in the timber industry?

215
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,440
But I've never heard
of your family's name before.

216
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,360
Grandmother, you have never heard
of our name before?

217
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,480
Actually, we sell more than just timbers.

218
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,240
Two of the shops I managed

219
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,510
were...

220
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,670
They sell the leftover wooden material

221
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,200
left behind by building
and furniture constructions.

222
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,480
I thought it was a waste

223
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,790
to throw them away.

224
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,360
That's why I deliver them
to two of my shops

225
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,000
and sell them as firewood.

226
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,790
I never expected my staff
to be so adept at doing business.

227
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,120
The firewood sold like hotcakes.

228
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,080
After that, they bought
a huge piece of land in Yangzhou.

229
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,790
What are you laughing at?

230
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,480
They did buy a huge piece of land
in Yangzhou.

231
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,960
Not bad at all.

232
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,960
A young lass like you

233
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,240
is pretty good at doing business.

234
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,270
That's right. Business is all about
being smart and flexible.

235
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,790
Tianlei was born with a weak constitution.

236
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,670
In the future, I have to depend on you

237
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,030
for our family business.

238
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,750
By the way,

239
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,870
tomorrow

240
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,750
there'll be the financial audit
of all 14 of our shops in Linzhou.

241
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,790
You can be our host.

242
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,630
You can teach them how to do business.

243
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,750
Is that okay?

244
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,270
Grandmother,

245
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,000
Bingyan is new to Linzhou.

246
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,510
She's not used to the place yet.

247
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,840
I think

248
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,000
we should let Ke host the audit instead.

249
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,030
We have to start somewhere, right?

250
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,150
That's right.

251
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,030
Grandmother,

252
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,550
Bingyan just married
into the Qi Residence not long ago.

253
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,080
And, she's young.

254
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,480
I don't think it's appropriate for her
to bear such an important position.

255
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,870
There's nothing inappropriate about it.

256
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,030
I think it's perfectly appropriate.

257
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,200
It's decided then.

258
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,690
[Garden of Harmony]

259
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,170
[Figure something out for me.]

260
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,500
Your Ladyship,

261
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,260
what's with all the sweat on your face?

262
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,890
It's because she blew it.

263
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,170
She blew it?

264
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,690
Why is she sweating
when the wind is blowing her?

265
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,050
It's all because I bragged.

266
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,860
Miss Bingyan

267
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,290
is too much of a braggart.

268
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,380
She said she managed 18 shops in Yangzhou.

269
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,500
Old Madam was so happy
when she heard that.

270
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,810
She plans to test her tomorrow.

271
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,260
She wants her
to attend the financial audit

272
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,260
of all 14 of our shops tomorrow.

273
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,380
Your Ladyship, this isn't a joke.

274
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,650
You'll definitely fail the test.

275
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,410
Forget about the test then.

276
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,170
Let's go.

277
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,170
Where are we going?

278
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,260
We're going back to Yangzhou.

279
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
You guys mustn't leave now.

280
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,460
We'll be in huge trouble

281
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,380
if you slip away like this.

282
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,810
What kind of trouble do you mean?

283
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,460
Think about it.

284
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,930
If you leave right now,

285
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,770
that proves
you're not the real Du Bingyan.

286
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,140
They'll know that you're a fake.

287
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,260
Do you think they'll let you off?

288
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,570
And it's more than just you.

289
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,460
Your parents in Yangzhou
will be implicated too.

290
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,650
They will be sued

291
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,570
and be in trouble because of you.

292
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:04,980
Your Ladyship,

293
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,810
Third Young Master Qi is right.

294
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,420
We cannot leave.

295
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,700
What should I do then?

296
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,740
I can't pass the test,
and I can't leave either.

297
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,420
If I must say,

298
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:26,700
you should

299
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,500
take the test.

300
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,500
Take the test?

301
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,810
I know nothing about checking accounts.

302
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,850
That's fine. I'll back you up.

303
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,810
I grew up in a martial arts school.

304
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,610
I have no interest in business whatsoever.

305
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,610
I'm not a moneygrubber either.

306
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,900
Excellent words.

307
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,980
Miss Li Yuhu,

308
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,700
the heroine of Yangzhou,

309
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,020
you do know me the best.

310
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,090
However, you cannot say that tomorrow.

311
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,700
You have to put it
in another way tomorrow.

312
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,020
What do you mean?

313
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,420
Xiaoxi,

314
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,850
I assume you know

315
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,980
some rhymes and songs of Yangzhou.

316
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,130
Is there one that's related to business?

317
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,020
Let me think.

318
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:15,980
I got it.

319
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,610
If you do business
without checking accounts,

320
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,180
your business will go down.

321
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,980
That's right. We need
something like that. Continue.

322
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,770
Compared to profit,
goods are more important.

323
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:27,980
Continue.

324
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,260
Smile and greet your customers,
and they'll take up all your offers.

325
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,900
More.

326
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,570
If you calculate your costs well,
from a gown to a vest you'll sell.

327
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,570
A small business isn't as bad
as a small pool of customers.

328
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,180
Check your accounts three times in a row,
and you...

329
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,770
Hold it right there. You can stop here.

330
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,260
But I still have plenty of them left.

331
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,460
Xiaoxi,

332
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,220
you're an intelligent girl.

333
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,770
You memorize your rhymes well,
and your handwriting is impeccable.

334
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,770
Therefore, I have two tasks for you.

335
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,260
Firstly,

336
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,850
write everything you recited just now

337
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,220
on a paper.

338
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,610
Secondly,

339
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,570
prepare supper for me and Miss Bingyan.

340
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,180
We will pull an all-nighter tonight.

341
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,020
Yes, I shall go immediately.

342
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,020
Can't I even sleep tonight?

343
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,180
Who told you to be so lax

344
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,260
and carefree usually?

345
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,370
This is what happens

346
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,330
when you attempt a last-minute effort.

347
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,940
[Qi Residence]

348
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,020
Your Ladyship, hurry and memorize it.

349
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,330
If you do business
without checking accounts,

350
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,220
your business will go down.

351
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,500
Compared to profit,

352
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,900
goods...

353
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,130
Your Ladyship, you got it wrong again.

354
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,700
Let's start over.

355
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,940
If you do business
without checking accounts,

356
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,660
your business will go down.

357
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,940
Compared to profit,

358
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,500
goods are more important.

359
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,260
Smile and greet your customers,

360
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,740
and they'll take up all your offers.

361
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,770
From a stationary merchant
to a traveling one,

362
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,460
your wealth will pile up as you have fun.

363
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,980
That's right!

364
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,500
You got everything right this time.

365
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,700
All of them.

366
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:26,980

Grandmother,

553
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,700
most of these ledgers are fine.

554
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,330
However, one of them
resorted to dirty tricks.

555
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,130
They fabricated the accounts.

556
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,330
[This lass,]

557
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,460

559
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,090
the Chamber of Commerce's logo

560
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,780
is on every ledger.

561
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,570
You said one of them

562
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,260
fabricated their accounts.

563
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,260
Which shop is it?

564
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,700
It's...

565
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,060
[What's the name of the shop again?]

566
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,220

567
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,330
[What's its name again?]

568
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,260
It's fine.

569
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,300
Just say it out loud.

570
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,500
I have to find out somehow.

571
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,540
Grandmother,

572
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,300
you see, I have a special ability.

573
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,020
I can hear

574
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,940
the abacus in one's heart
when they calculate.

575
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,740
The culprit will have a different inner voice
when he calculates.

576
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,890
Why don't I show it to you?

577
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:25,980
Sure.

578
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,060

588
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,060

you have

598
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,610
to check your accounts thoroughly.

599
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,020

How did she find out?

601
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,650
How did you know it was him?

602
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,410
You're amazing.

603

605

just after taking a glance at our ledger.

606
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,500
You're an expert indeed.

607
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,890
It was just a lucky hit.

608

00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,690

All right.

00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,250
That move was super effective.

657
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,380
Grandmother told me to leave
right after I pretended to be nauseous.

658
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,210
What kind of symptom is this?

00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,690
I don't think

662
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,650
you should use it as an excuse often.

663
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,650
But why?

664
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,060
It's a sign of pregnancy.

665
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,900
Qi Tianlei, you're a bad egg!

666
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,380
You got yourself in trouble
after bragging too much.

667
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,250
I did everything I could
to help you pass the test.

668
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,500
And now, you're saying that I'm a bad egg?

669
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,820
Of course you're a bad egg.

670
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,540
You told me to pretend to be nauseous.

671
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,420
But you're not convincing
when it comes to feigning an illness.

672
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,170
Only a pregnant lady
will throw up like that.

673
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:18,900
So, you finally understand now?

674
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,060
Xiaoxi, you're a bad egg too.

675
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,980
You should've told me earlier.

676
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,380
Listen.

677
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,650
Xiaoxi and I aren't bad eggs.

678
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,130
It's not like I stuffed a baby

736
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,290
You don't need to swear
for such a trivial matter.

737
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,380
Xiaoqiao,

738
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,340
let's drop the matter.

739
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,500
However, you should still notify me
if you encounter

740
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,610
something like this in the future.

741
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,020
Understood?

742
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,820
Understood.

743
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,340
All right. You may leave.

744
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,820
I'll see if you dare to do it again!

745
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,210
Bingyan, that's enough.

746
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,380
Your Ladyship, I won't do it...

747
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,210
Will you do it again?

748
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,340
I won't!

749
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,500
Bingyan!

750
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,690
That was a close call.

751
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,900
Luckily, I was smart enough
to make preparations in advance.

752
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,690
If not, both of us would've been done for.

753
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,020
I'll give you a quiz.

754
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,380
Try and guess the answer.

755
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,570
What quiz?

756
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,250
Try and guess

757
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,610
who instigated Grandmother to test you.

758
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,380
Fang Xiaoqiao.

759
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,090
You're half correct.

760
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,090
Young Master Ke?

761
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,340
That's more like it.

762
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,210
But why is he picking on me?

763
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,130
This is a long story.

764
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,250
I'll tell you about his story

765
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,090
gradually.

766
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,500
You're making fun of me again.

767
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,900
Did you remember what you told me

768
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,500
when I asked you
whether you were truly an invalid

769
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,420
who needed me to change your luck?

770
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,610
Some things cannot be explained
in simple terms.

771
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,340
Since you're already here,

772
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,770
I'll tell you about it gradually.

773
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,130
But what have you told me?

774
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,610
You told me nothing.

775
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,730
You fish out all the information

776
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,730
I was trying to hide from you instead.

777
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,290
Third Young Master Qi,

778
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,130
if you don't explain yourself now,

779
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:51,690
I will...

780
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,170
What will you do?

781
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,130
I kept my guard up all along.

782
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,610
Why did you pretend to be an invalid
when you're not?

783
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,210
All right.

784
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,900
I'll tell you about it. Have a seat first.

785
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,020
All right.

786
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,090
Let me start

787
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:27,900
by telling you
how I recovered from my illness

788
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,380
and why I pretended to be sick.

789
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,130
Can you just cut to the chase?

790
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,060
Just tell me already.

791
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:34,820
All right.

792
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,020
I'll tell you.

793
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,570
The men of the Qi Residence,
the richest family in Linzhou,

794
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,500
led extravagant lives
for several generations.

795
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,380
Due to that, all of them fell sick
and died soon after.

796
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,730
Grandmother was in charge of the household.

797
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,820
My eldest brother, Qi Tianxiang,
was honest and straightforward.

798
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,860
However, he was born inept.

799
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,210
My second brother, Qi Tianfang,
was inherently lazy.

800
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:00,540
Thus,

801
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,380
she could only pin all of her hopes on me.

802
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,290
Grandmother pays extra attention to me.

803
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,060
She lets me stay in my room all day long.

804
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,210
I was well-fed, and I had plenty of rest.

805
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,210
I had more ginseng and bird's nest soup
than I could count.

806
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,170
However, due to her pampering,

807
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,130
I had plenty of vitality
yet insufficient physical and mental energy.

808
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,250
I ended up being an invalid.

809
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,650
It was a blessing in disguise for me

810
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,170
as I managed

811
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,770
to survive until adulthood.

812
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,380
However,

813
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,250
for some unknown reasons,

814
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,060
the Qi Residence has been plagued
by bad luck in recent years.

815
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:39,770
Strange occurrences keep happening here.

816
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,860
