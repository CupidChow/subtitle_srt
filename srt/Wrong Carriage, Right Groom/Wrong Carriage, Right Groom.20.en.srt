19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,610
It's been a long time
since I came to Linzhou.

20
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,320
I wonder how my parents

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,530
are doing now.

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,240
Although I hated them

23
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,010
when I first got into the bridal sedan,

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,250
I only understood

25
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,640
that they were out of choice
after some time.

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,170
Now that I've experienced all these things

27
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,040
in Qi Residence,

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,480
I finally realize

29
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,810
that I was too insensible back then.

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,840
Don't worry.

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,680

They wanted you

Mr. Du, please have some tea.

191

Mr. Du, it's been a long trip.
Please have some tea.

All right.

193
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Yesterday, Xiaoxi told me everything
that had happened

194
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,740
in Qi Residence.

195
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,110
Miss Li,

196
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,830
you took Bingyan's place to bring luck
to Qi Residence in Linzhou.

197
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,860
It must've been tough on you.

198
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,110
Not at all.

199
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,470
Mr. Du, you traveled a long distance

200
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,500
from Yangzhou
to Linzhou in order to help us out.

201
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,140
We're eternally grateful for your help.

202
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,350
Don't mention it.

203
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,500
This trip of mine

204
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,350
didn't bring me any losses too.

205
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,590
You see,

206
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,780
I married one daughter off

207
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,020
and got two back in return.

208
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,710
And I got myself two sons-in-law too.

209
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,470
I made twice

210
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,020
the profit.

211
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,190
Father, you're talking

212
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,380
about the way of the business.

213
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,500
Greetings, Father.

214
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,110
Please get up.

218
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,620
in a great show, huh?

219
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
I just wonder

220
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,710
how the general, my second son-in-law,

221
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,500
is doing right now.

222
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,620
Father-in-law, please don't worry.

223
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,540
Master and Madam relayed the news to us

224
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,470
after their return.

225
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,950
The crisis has been averted.

226
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,230
Now, they just need
to wait for the imperial edict.

227
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,350
The imperial edict has arrived.

228

[Imperial Edict]

229
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,860
By the mandate of heaven,
this Emperor decree hereby.

230
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,900
Yuan Buqu, Marquis of the North,

231
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,740
has resolved the turmoil
on the border.

232
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,190
His contributions are
to be made known to the world.

233
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
He is a pillar of the nation.

234
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,860
Initially, I intend to make him
the princess's consort.

235
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,660
However, Yuan Buqu is already married.

236
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,660
Now, I hereby rescind my previous edict.

237
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,140
Lieutenant Sha Pingwei
is young and mighty.

238
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,660
He saved the princess from danger.

239
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,830
He shall be promoted
to the rank of vice general.

240
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,990
You two are to prepare immediately

241

before the 10th of next month

242
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,500
to discuss the peace treaty
meant for foreign states.

243

This is an important task.
No delays are allowed.

244

That is all.

245
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,990
We will receive the edict.

250

I'll head to Yangzhou to pick up my wife.

being able to see you off all the way.

275
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,540

She's not around too.

290

Mr. Du left the residence
together with Miss Du.

291
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,990
If so, do you know

292
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,310
when they'll return?

I don't know about that.

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,500
Why did Miss Du head to Linzhou, then?

299
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,380
What else can she do over there?

300
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,140
She went to Qi Residence in Linzhou.

Something's not right.

305
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,260
I'm sure something huge
happened in Linzhou.

306
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,740
Bingyan got on the wrong bridal sedan
but found the right groom.

307
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,110
She won't go to Linzhou
without any valid reasons.

308
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,590
Could it be

309
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,990
that the Qi family found out

310
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,020
that the Du Bingyan
in their residence was a fake,

311
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,900
and they were not willing
to let the matter off?

312
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,620
Maybe they want the real Bingyan
to marry into their family.

313
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,500
General, what should we do now?

314
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,540
Let's head to Linzhou.

315
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,430
General, you mustn't do so.

316
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,070
According to His Majesty's imperial edict,

317
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,620
you have to be in the capital
before the 10th of next month.

and travel day and night,

321
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,020
we can arrive
at the capital in three days.

322
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,390
However, if we head to Linzhou now,

323
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,060
the peace treaty's discussion
might be delayed.

328
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,470

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,990
I won't spare you

369
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,910
if you don't bring him back.

370
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,500
Yes, Mr. Du.

371
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,470
Mr. Du,

372
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,540
this is the letter
General had left behind.

373
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,630
He said it was for Miss Du.

374
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,070
[I intended to pick you up in Yangzhou.
But I heard that you went to Linzhou.]

375
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,070
[His Majesty ordered me to head to the capital.
It's a long trip, and I have no time.]

376
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,590
[I had to rush to the capital.
Your husband, Yuan Buqu.]

377
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,410
Bingyan,

378
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,520
what did my son-in-law say in the letter?

379
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,610
General said

380
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,210
His Majesty ordered him to reach
the capital before the 10th of next month.

381
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,520
He couldn't meet me in time.

382
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,760
He's heading to the capital.

383
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,000
He left already?

384
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,720
And I thought I could
have a drink with him.

385
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,240
Father,

386
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,280
I want to go after him.

387
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,280
Your Highness?

388
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,800
You guys may leave first.

389
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,000
Yes, Your Highness.

390
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:18,970
What's wrong?

391
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,450
What's with the long face?

392
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,280
Are you angry?

393
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:32,800
Tell me.

394
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Why were you away for such a long time?

395
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,170
Where did you go?

396
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,280
I was feeding my horse in the stables.

397
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:40,970
You were feeding your horse?

398
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,240
Why did you feed it?

399
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,890
That's the work of a servant,

400
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,210
not the work of the royal consort.

401
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,170
I'm not the royal consort yet.

402
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,370
Besides,

403
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,610
horses understand our feelings.

404
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,520
It's my closest companion

405
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,520
when I'm on the battlefield.

406
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,210
It'll love you back if you love it.

407
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,650
I don't care.

408
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,930
You're not allowed to love your horse.

409
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,970
I'm the only one you can love.

410
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,280
I was just being honest.

411
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,410
I know you're a dignified lady.

412
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,760
But I'm a man.

413
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,650
At most, I'll...

414
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
What?

415
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
I'll return to the military camp.

416
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:16,970
How dare you do so?

417
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,240
If you do that,

418
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,040
I'll have you executed!

419
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,410
Have me executed?

420
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,280
I'm not afraid of that.

421
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,890
I've been following

422
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,760
General Yuan around
and fought in various battles

423
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,240
when I was in my teens.

424
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,970
I've been through
dozens of grave situations.

425
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,890
I could be killed at any time back then.

426
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,320
However,

427
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,720
to be honest with you,

428
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,000
if

429
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,520
I'm able to die by your hand,

430
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,370
I think it's much better
than dying by our enemies' hands.

431
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,520
Why weren't you afraid at all

432
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,240
when I said that I wanted to execute you?

433
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,280
It's because...

434
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,280
I can't say this out loud.

435
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,410
What is it?

436
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,000
Tell me.

437
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,480
It's because I...

438
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,040
I...

439
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,800
I...

440
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,760
How could I say
something like this casually?

441
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,210
I can't tell you.

442
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,170
No, you have to tell me.

443
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
You have to tell me by today.

444
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,410
It's because

445
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,170
I...

446
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,610
I like you.

447
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,800
I like you.

448
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,970
I like you so much
that I can't sleep at night.

449
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,280
You're the only one in my heart.

450
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,280
Now I...

451
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,240
I...

[Qi Residence]

462
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,450
Grandmother.

463
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:11,970
Were you looking for me?

464
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,520
Come, have a seat.

465
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,800
Xiaoqiao, you're not required here.

466
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
You may leave first.

467
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,800
Yes, Old Madam.

468
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,650
Remember.

469
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,890
Close the door when you leave.

470
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,930
Yes, Old Madam.

471
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,000
Grandmother,

472
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,610
do you have any instructions for me?

473
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:47,890
That's right.

474
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,240
Tianlei,

475
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,890
I wish to discuss something with you.

476
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,480
Please tell me.

477
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,890
I remember you once told me

478
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,760
that we should handle
the Qi family's business

479
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,720
ourselves.

480
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,480
I thought you had a point

481
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,480
after giving it some thought.

482
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,720
Say, what do you think
is the number one thing

483
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,240
we should take back

484
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,000
from his hand?

485
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,240
Grandmother,

486
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,280
in my opinion, I think
the number one thing we should take back

487
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,480
is the accounts of all 14 of our shops.

488
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,320
Tianlei,

489
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,130
from what I see,

490
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,040
you're getting healthier
and more vigorous.

491
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,410
And you look energetic too.

492
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,720
So, I wish to let you and Shizhao

493
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,850
manage our shops together.

494
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,080
What do you think?

495
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,930
Grandmother,

496
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,000
I think

497
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,210
this isn't the right time for me
to manage the shops together with Shizhao.

498
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,280
Why is that the case?

499
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,410
Shizhao is an intelligent man.

500
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,850
Grandmother, I'm sure
Shizhao will notice something

501
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,170
if you intend to manage the accounts.

502
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,210
I'm just afraid

503
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,450
that he might come up with something else.

504
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,410
What else can he come up with?

505
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:09,890
Grandmother,

506
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,850
all these years,

507
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,130
members of Qi Residence have died,

508
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,040
turned mute, and fallen sick.

509
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,280
Even the medicine I was taking

510
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,210
was poisoned.

511
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,130
I'm afraid of nothing

512
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,800
except for him.

513
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,280
That devious two-faced monster.

514
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,240
Grandmother, we have

515
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,520
to find the two-faced monster first

516
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,480
if you wish to take back the accounts

517
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,850
of all 14 of our shops.

518
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,450
Stop.

519
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,080
I know what you're going to say.

520
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,170
Give me some time.

521
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,130
Let me think about it.

522
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,170
Let me give it some thought.

523
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,850
Young Master, were you looking for me?

524
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,560
Sit down.

525
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,130
I prefer standing up.

526
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,690
Sit when I tell you to sit.

527
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,370
You're a man.

528
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,760
But look at what you're doing right now.

529
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,410
Young Master, I failed my task.

530
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,930
I'm too ashamed to face you.

531
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,650
Wang Huzi,

532
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,690
there's a chance for you

533
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,610
to atone for your mistake.

534
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,450
Open it.

535
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
You can take all of them

536
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,210
as long as you complete the next task.

537
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,890
Young Master,

538
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,930
are you serious?

539
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,130
Of course.

540
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,040
I will risk my life for you, Young Master.

541
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,130
You don't need to risk your life

542
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,370
to complete this task.

543
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,930
This is a simple task.

544
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:01,850
What kind of task is it?

545
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,890
I need you

546
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,650
to plant poison needles

547
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,930
on Qi Tianlei's bed.

548
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,130
Young Master,

549
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,320
the door to their chamber
is always locked.

550
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,240
There's no way I can go inside.

551
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,450
It'll be fine.

552
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,240
