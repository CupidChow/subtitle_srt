00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,810
Little did he know Mr. Li was a snob.

373
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,570
He got beat up

374
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,260
and kicked out.

375
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,050
I'm guessing Miss Li is going to have

376
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,810
to go through hell in her marriage.

377
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,900
I think so too.

378
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,850
After what her father did,

379
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,330
it's only a matter of time

380
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,770
before she lands in deep water.

381
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,940
Now that General Yuan
has positional power,

382
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,980
returning the favor should be
a walk in the park for him.

383
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,530
So why did he go to all that trouble to have

384
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,740
ten cases of bride tokens delivered
to marry you?

385
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,420
I would say

386
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,900
that he's not going to

387
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,220
take it out on you.

388
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:02,810
You have no idea, do you?

389
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,570
He's been married twice before.

390
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,330
And

391
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,810
he tortured both his wives to death.

392
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,180
Then when you arrive in Jingzhou,

393
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,020
find a way to get to the truth.

394
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,810
If he really did all that,

395
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,570
I'd suggest you make a plan.

396
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,290
Don't worry about me.

397
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,130
He wouldn't have the balls
to cause me any harm.

398
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,530
And if he ever lays a finger on me,

399
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,180
I'm going to...

400
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,530
You got some moves.

401
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,790
Miss Yuhu is a martial artist.

402
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,550
Never one to mince words.

403
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,760
Fiercely loyal.

404
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,960
Miss Bingyan is well-informed.

405
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,920
She has enjoyed reading
since she was a kid.

406
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,280
An intelligent

407
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,720
and resourceful problem-solver.

408
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
It's a shame

409
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,550
that someone so beautiful

410
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,760
inside and out

411
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
is getting married
to a man on his deathbed

412
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,680
with the aim of reversing his decline.

413
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,830
Honestly,

414
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,150
I feel bad

415
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,150
for Qi Tianlei.

416
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,350
After generations of one-boy-only births,

417
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,480
the Qi family finally

418
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,000
had three boys.

419
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,960
Two died before the age of 25.

420
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,550
He is the only child left.

421
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,480
For that reason,

422
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,040
his grandmother

423
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,720
spoils him rotten.

424
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,480
But...

425
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,480
he was constantly sick as a child.

426
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,870
They all said

427
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,960
he wouldn’t get older than 25.

428
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,680
Then one day...

429
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,110
they sent someone to find out

430
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,000
my date of birth and eight characters.

431
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,590
And they said
according to our eight characters,

432
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,960
we would be a great match.

433
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,720
And so they did everything in their power

434
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,590
to set us up

435
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,390
in hopes of curing his disease

436
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,680
and tasking me

437
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,790
with carrying on the family name.

438
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,720
Bingyan...

439
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,150
I can totally relate to that.

440
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,480
Hey, why don't we swear loyalty
to each other

441
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,830
in the presence of the fairy's statue?

442
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,550
Hopefully, we'll receive her blessings.

443
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,110
We are now sworn sisters.

444
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,630
This is part of the bride price
General Yuan gave me.

445
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,520
It's a sword-shaped jade pendant.

446
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,350
I want you

447
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,110
to have it.

448
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,870
Absolutely not.

449
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,350
It was a gift from General Yuan to you.

450
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,440
I couldn't possibly accept it.

451
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,240
Of course you can.

452
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,310
It was gifted to me,

453
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,150
so it's mine now.

454

468

there's a gang of bandits in the vicinity

00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,070
they've carved words

474

475
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,760
that we were to send two hundred tael of silver

476

a special token made by the Qi Residence.

It's called crystal wild goose.

482
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,830
Since you gave me
the sword-shaped jade pendant,

483
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,070

Take a look at them.

575
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,960
They're starving.

576

Sure, please.

577
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,240
Okay.

578
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,830
Distinguished guests are here.

579

[You got it!]

581
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,390
I'm exhausted and starving.

00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,960
Meixiang, mind getting some food for me?

583
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,000
Your Ladyship,

584
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,720
are you too hungry to remember things?

585
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,110
I'm Xiaoxi.

586
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,680
Who's Xiaoxi?

587
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,200
Your Ladyship,

588
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,440
how come you don't know me?

589
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,550
Who are you?

590
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
I'm Li Yuhu.

591
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,480
Miss Li?

592
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,590
I'm been a matchmaker

593
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,310
for over twenty years.

594
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,000
In Yangzhou,

595
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,590
who doesn't know Matchmaker Lin?

596
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,920
I made matches

597
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,070
for half of Yangzhou's couples.

598
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,550
They say Yangzhou is famous
for its beauties.

599
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,000
Ms. Lin,

600
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,440
please make a match for me.

601
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,790
Sure, I'll find you one.

602
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,830
What type do you fancy?

603
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,960
I'll find you a cook girl.

604
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,200
Ms. Lin.

605
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,310
Ms. Lin, bad news.

606
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,790
What is it?

607
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,630
Calm down before you tell me.

608
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,520
There's a mistake.

609
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,920
What mistake?

610
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,070
What should we do?

611
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,110
What should we do, Ms. Lin?

612
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Let's go now.

613
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,630
What went wrong?

614
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,200
That's her.

615
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,150
You're Miss Li?

616
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,110
From Mighty Martial Arts Center?

617
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,550
That's right.

618
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,870
I'm the daughter of the owner.

619
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,150
Li Yuhu.

620
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,000
How... how come she's here?

621
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,200
I'm wondering

622
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,720
why you are here.

623
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,280
I...

624
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,110
The bridal veil is correct.

625
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,150
The dragon and phoenix pattern.

626
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,390
Miss,
it's raining cats and dogs outside.

627
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,790
Let's wait it out here.

628
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,110
-Miss.
-Let's go.

629
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,520
Go now.

630
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,310
Bandits are coming.

631
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,480
We made a mistake.

632
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,480
What should we do now?

633
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,720
What should we do now?

634
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,150
We made a mistake?

635
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,390
What should we do now?

636
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,040
If word gets to Yangzhou,

637
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,480
what would happen to us?

638
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,720
Oh my goodness.

639
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,550
My goodness.

640
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,240
Madam Zhang,

641
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,680
let's catch up with them

642
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,200
and swap Her Ladyship back.

643
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,200
Easy for you to say.

644
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,960
We've gone north for a day.

645
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,520
They've gone south for a day.

646
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,110
This adds up to

647
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,310
a two-day journey.

648
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,280
How can we catch up?

649
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
By flying?

650
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,590
Go back.

651
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,480
What should we do?

652
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,280
Go back to Yangzhou.

653
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,070
No, we can't.

654
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,590
We can't go back to Yangzhou.

655
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,440
Why?

656
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,920
Before we set out,

657
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,590
Mr. Du told me multiple times

658
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,350
that we mustn't miss the day of the wedding.

659
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,150
If we're late

660
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,200
and Mr. Qi kicks the bucket,

661
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,760
who's gonna be responsible for that?

662
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,040
Then what should we do?

663
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,040
Are you gonna

664
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,310
keep going forward

665
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,790
and send me to Jingzhou?

666
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,830
How can we do that?

667
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,390
Miss, take a seat first.

668
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,760
Miss,

669
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,520
you've been on the road for a day.

670
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,350
Me and Meixiang will go get you some food.

671
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,920
As for what's coming, we'll discuss later.

672
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Oh my Miss Du.

673
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,790
Oh my Miss Du.

674
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,870
Why are you fake crying?

675
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,480
We just got on the wrong bridal sedan.

676
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,040
We're crying for Miss Du.

677
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,830
Why are you crying for sister Bingyan?

678
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,830
She's not dead.

679
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,520
Her Ladyship is a rare beauty.

680
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,070
She's like a fairy.

681
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,680
But she has to marry
that invalid Mr. Qi Tianlei

682
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,520
to counteract bad luck.

683
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
Her Ladyship

684
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,960
is so gentle and kind.

685
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,110
She would rather bear with it

686
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,110
and agree to marry to the Qi family,

687
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,830
so that our Du family's business
can be saved.

688
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
She's so poor.

689
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,830
The Qi Residence said,

690
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,720
when Qi Tianlei dies,

691
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,280
Her Ladyship will be released back.

692
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,200
But Her Ladyship is so weak.

693
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,280
How can she live to that day?

694
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,070
And nobody can help Her Ladyship.

695
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,040
Yeah.

696
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,520
We girls

697
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,720
are so poor.

698
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,520
We can't even decide our own fate.

699
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,520
Outrageous.

700
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,960
Miss Li,

701
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,680
I heard that you're a heroic person.

702
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,830
I'm begging you.

703
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,920
Please save Her Ladyship.

704
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,280
I wanna save her too.

705
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
But how?

706
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,110
Just get to Linzhou on time.

707
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,440
Once Mr. Qi is dead,

708
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,480
wouldn't Du Bingyan be saved?

709
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,000
You mean you're gonna

710
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,550
let me

711
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,400
claim to be Bingyan?

712
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,150
Then are you gonna let Miss Du come back

713
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,550
to counteract bad luck

714
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,190
and to jump into this fire pit?

715
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,480
That won't do.

716
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,230
Since we're already here.

717
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,960
Why not make the best of a mistake?

718
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,590
You go finish the task
pretending to be Miss Du.

719
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,040
You've entered
the wrong bridal sedan anyway.

720
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,440
Why don't you

721
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,400
just help Miss Du pass this hard time?

722
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,750
When Mr. Qi Tianlei

723
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,590
kicks the bucket,

724
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,400
you can leave without pressure.

725
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,480
By then,

726
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,750
Miss Du would have found the mistake

727
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,920
and is probably
waiting for you in Yangzhou.

728
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,630
This is a good idea.

729
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,710
Miss Li,

730
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,230
I'm begging you for Her Ladyship.

731
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,880
Okay.

732
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,590
Come what may in Qi Residence,

733
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,440
I'll go for the sake of Bingyan.

734
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,590
Miss Li,

735
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,110
you're such an angel.

736
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,360
I'm willing to serve you for life.

737
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,190
Stand up.

738
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,960
Our girls should be the masters

739
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,270
of our own fates.

740
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,440
This time,

741
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,960
I'll be Du Bingyan.

742
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,960
Are you gonna keep going forward

743
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,440
and send me to Jingzhou?

744
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,710
[How can we do that?]

745
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,550
