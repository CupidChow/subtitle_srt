[Episode 21]

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,840
Poison needles?

20
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,430
I've been perceptive my entire life.

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
I never expected this to happen.

22
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,040
I'm truly old and senile now.

23
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,560
I've brought disaster upon myself.

24
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,680
First, he harmed
Ji Jingtang and his family.

25
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,360
After that, he turned Abbess into a mute.

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,190
And now,

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,960
he's even trying to kill me and Tianlei.

28
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,360
Grandmother,

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,520
if we allow him to get his way

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
and continue his reign,

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,400
our family lineage

32
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,190
will end here.

I'm truly old and senile.

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,870
Grandmother,

35
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,280
but it's not too late for us
to do something about it.

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,360
What do you mean?

37
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,080
I wish to use his trick against him.

38
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
I will let Ke Shizhao commit
one more evil deed.

39
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,310
You want him to commit another evil deed?

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,960
We must make him

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,520
expose his true goals himself.

42
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,400
Let's talk about my medicine,
which was poisoned.

43
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,710
He never kept the dregs
of the medicine he brewed.

44
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,080
He will surely deny it.

45
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,240
Besides, we didn't see him

46
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,590
placing the poison needles personally.

47
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,150
Wang Huzi will surely deny it too.

48
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,360
He'd say that Yansheng was seeing things.

49
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,560
That's why we have to capture
Ke Shizhao red-handed

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,680
in order to expose him.

You...

54
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,240
Were you looking for me?

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,960
Mr. Liu.

56
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,280
You're back.

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,000
Long time no see.

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,400
Mr. Liu,

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,150
I have pressing matters to attend to.

60
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,400
I shall take my leave.

61
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,910
Yansheng.

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,710
Grandmother.

63
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
I've been pretending

64
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,470
to be a mute all these years.

65
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,830
Hurry and tell Old Madam why you did so.

66
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,120
It happened three years ago.

67
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,240
Back then, it was a rainy summer night.

68
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,270
I was passing by the courtyard.

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,310
Good girl.

70
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,160
Hurry. Get up and speak.

71
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,270
Yansheng,

72
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,360
if that's the case,

73
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,040
why didn't you
tell Grandmother what happened?

74
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,360
Why did you pretend to be mute, then?

75
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,190
Initially,

76
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,720
I wanted to tell Old Madam
about it the next day.

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,870
However,

78
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,560
Fang Xiaoqiao saw that I was panicking.

79
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,270
She told me to stay in the room.

80
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,560
After that, Ke Shizhao arrived.

81
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,600
He tried to fish information out of me.

82
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,160
I kept my composure

83
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,480
and didn't tell him a single thing.

84
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,920
Ke Shizhao was suspicious of me.

85
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,000
He threatened me

86
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,040
by saying that he was
already ruling the Qi family.

87
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,240
Big Brother and Second Brother

88
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
were already dead.

89
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,830
And, Tianlei's life was in danger too.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,600
He said I must obey him
if I want to survive in this residence

91
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,920
together with Mother.

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,830
He went overboard.

93
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,920
How could he threaten you like that?

94
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,190
After that,

95
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,480
although Ke Shizhao didn't know
what I saw that night,

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,830
he threatened me
both directly and indirectly

97
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,800
by saying
that my mother's health wasn't well.

98
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,310
He wanted me to take care of her

99
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
and stay out of the Qi family's affairs.

100
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,800
I was afraid.

101
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,040
I was afraid that he would
target my mother

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
if I told you the truth.

103
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,600
That's why I...

104
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,600
I remember that you had a high fever
for several days

105
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,310
after Second Brother's death.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,390
You turned into a mute when you woke up.

107
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,040
So, Yansheng,

108
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,560
you pretended to be mute

109
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,920
in order to dispel Ke Shizhao's doubt

110
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,800
and protect yourself

111
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,920
and your mother.

112
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,870
How could I be so muddle-headed?

113
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,120
I actually believed in the words
of a cunning fox!

114
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,950
I was the reason he was able
to kill my grandsons!

115
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,070
And my granddaughter
had to suffer so much

116
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,510
because of me!

117
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,360
I'm sorry, my child.

118
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,680
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,120
Tianlei, I'm sorry.

120
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,070
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,600
I've let down the ancestors
of the Qi family!

122
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,870
Grandmother,

123
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,310
you don't need to blame yourself for it.

124
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,680
Since you've understood the true nature of

125
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,000
that scheming man,

126
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,190
that means
it's not too late for us to turn back.

127
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,360
Grandmother,

128
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,240
you still have us with you.

129
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,190
All right.

130
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,560
I can hang in there

131
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,920
with you guys around.

132
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,310
In my opinion,

133
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,720
let's use his trick against him

134
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,950
and drive him into a corner.

135
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,870
Tianlei?

136
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,200

137
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,790
Finally.

138
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,150
Both of you are finally dead!

139
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,150
Someone!

140
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,030
Young Master.

141
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
Summon Wang Huzi.

142
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,150
Yes, Young Master.

143
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,030
Young Master,

144
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,320
were you looking for me?

145
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,080
Why isn't there any news of their passing

146
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,080
after so long?

147
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,550
I...

148
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,630
I did place the poison needles
on their bed.

149
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,870
Could it be

150
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,270
that they haven't
returned to their room yet?

151
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,030
Did something go wrong

152
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,390
because of your ineptitude again?

153
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,080
Young Master, don't worry.

154
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,200
Nothing ever goes wrong
when I complete a task.

155
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:53,790
Tell me.

156
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,440
Were you seen by anyone

157
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
when you placed the poison needles?

158
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,960
I swear! No one saw me!

159
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,390
Only you and I

160
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,270
know about this!

161
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,320
No one else saw me!

162
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,630
I swear.

163
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,630
Come here.

164
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,910
Shouldn't you head to their chamber
and observe them

165
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,630
to see if you completed the deed or not?

166
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,390
Yes, Young Master.

167
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,770
Over there!

168
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,410
Search that area thoroughly!

169
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,260
Okay.

170
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,140
You, search over there!

171
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,460
That's right. Over there.

172
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,690
Did you find it?

173
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,690
To the right!

174
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,890
That's right! That's the spot!

175
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,650
Look.

176
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,290
I told you Wang Huzi would come, right?

177
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,570
I'm sure he'll be scared to death

178
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,930
if we show ourselves right now.

179
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,340
He'd surely think that we came back to life.

180
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,930
Search that spot!

181
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,740
Did you find it?

182
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,340
You, search over there!

183
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,410
Search over there!

184
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,460
Do a thorough search!

185
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,570
You two, do a thorough search!

186
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,460
Did you find it?

187
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,050
It's here!

188
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,170
I found it!

189
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:13,930
Hurry!

190
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:14,930
Hurry!

191
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,460
Let's go.

192
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,340
I found it!

193
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,650
Third Young Master, I found it!

194
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,860
Help!

195
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,170
Help!

196
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,890
Wang Huzi,

197
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,770
what are you doing in the pond?

198
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,260
I'm trying to catch a fish.

199
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,380
He's truly a fool.

200
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,570
Wang Huzi is foolish yet ruthless.

201
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,290
You and I would've been dead

202
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,650
had Yansheng not given us

203
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,770
a reminder.

204
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:08,980
Yuhu, Tianlei,

205
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,740
the careless hare has finally

206
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,140
shown himself.

207
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,810
Maybe even Wang Huzi himself

208
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,100
didn't know that he was only exposed

209
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,570
when he showed himself.

210
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,380
Some time ago,

211
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,890
Bingyan told us

212
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,050
to be wary of Ke Shizhao

213
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,860
when she came here.

214
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,170
And now, he has given himself away.

215
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,570
Bingyan is our lucky star, indeed.

216
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,050
Bingyan was here before?

217
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,380
Tianlei,

218
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,100
why did she come to Qi Residence?

219
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,740
Master,

220
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,260
this is another amazing coincidence.

221
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,650
Ke Shizhao sent his men
to Yangzhou in secret

222
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,340
and invited Mr. Du to Qi Residence.

223
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,260
They wanted to use Mr. Du

224
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,690
to expose Yuhu's identity.

225
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,690
However,

226
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,740
at the same time, Du Bingyan

227
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,770
was returning to Yangzhou
from the border town.

228
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,100
She disguised herself as a man

229
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,290
and followed Mr. Du to Qi Residence.

230
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
The real Du Bingyan

231
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,740
called the fake Du Bingyan

232
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
her younger sister.

233
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,380
Ke Shizhao wasn't the only one confused.

234
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,170
I couldn't wrap my head

235
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,650
around the situation too.

236
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,860
Bingyan did offer you two

237
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,220
timely help, indeed.

238
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,170
Tianlei,

239
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,260
when did Bingyan arrive at Linzhou?

240
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,340
May 4th.

241
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,620
When did she return to Yangzhou, then?

242
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,020
She stayed here for two nights.

243
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,050
So, it's May 6th.

244
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,020
This is bad.

245
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,810
They helped you guys out

246
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,460
at the expense of their own matters.

247
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,690
What do you mean?

248
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,890
Yuan Buqu

249
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,500
was following
Du Bingyan's instructions initially.

250
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,530
He rushed back to Yangzhou

251
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,340
after completing the task.

252
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,980
He rushed there to pick Du Bingyan up.

253
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,380
Now that I think about it,

254
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,650
I assume he was there around May 4th.

255
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,690
Seems like he had to leave empty-handed.

256
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,930
I don't think so.

257
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,930
I think General Yuan Buqu

258
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,620
will wait for Bingyan's return.

259
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,410
I'm just afraid that he has no time
to stay in Yangzhou.

260
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,170
The consort selection issue
hasn't been completely resolved yet.

261
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,810
What if His Majesty
summons him back to the capital?

262
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,170
Even so, he'll leave a letter behind
for Bingyan.

263
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,380
Although the coincidence
worked in your favor,

264
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,650
I don't think it'd work in theirs.

265
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,650
Fatty.

266
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,380
Let's check it out.

267
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,410
Sir,

268
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,220
does General Yuan live here?

269
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,890
I don't know.

270
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,340
If so, do you know where he lives?

271
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:36,980
I don't.

272
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:39,890
All right then.

273
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,100
Thank you.

274
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:43,980
Thank you, sir.

275
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:01,650
Miss Bingyan,

276
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,140
we couldn't find him
even after a long search.

277
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,530
This place is huge.

278
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,930
We're finding a needle in a haystack here.

279
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,650
Fatty,

280
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,460
do you know

281
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,930
where the busiest place is
in the marketplace?

282
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,020
The bridge.

283
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,460
There are acrobats
and storytellers near the area.

284
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,380
It's a lively place.

285
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,290
People who come from the capital

286
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,530
love to visit that place.

287
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,140
That's right.

288
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,220
Go and find

289
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,170
the best storyteller you can find.

290
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,460
A storyteller?

291
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,690
I will depart then.

292
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,290
Go now.

293
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,690
Thank you for your support.

294
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,050
Thank you for your support.

295
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:56,690
Excellent.

296
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,650
Sirs and madams,

297
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,890
today, we shall continue

298
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,220
with the Legendary Tales in the Capital,
Volume Six,

299
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,810
Marquis of the North
And His Battles on the Border.

300
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,770
I will tell you guys how he managed to
defeat his enemy with his Black Bean Strategy.

301
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,530
Excellent!

302
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,130
Okay, thank you.

303
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,180
The stories
that this storyteller has been telling

304
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,370
are getting better and better.

305
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,130
Guys, don't you think so?

306
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,700
That's right!

307
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:19,260
All right.

308
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,940
Thank you for your support.

309
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,260
I listened to his stories for some time.

310
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,090
He was an excellent storyteller.

311
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,610
Yes.

312
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,570
It's just that he likes
to keep us in suspense.

313
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,050
That's right.

314
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,330
The story begins with Marquis of the North

315
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,130
-guarding the border...
-Lieutenant Sha.

316
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,370
This is the storyteller.

317
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,570
He's very good at telling the story
about our general

318
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,530
defending the borders.

319
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,940
It was as if

320
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,370
he experienced the incidents himself.

321
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,570
Plenty of people in the capital
came here just to listen to his stories.

322
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,370
Everyone is talking about it.

323
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,940
Are you serious?

324
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,530
A storyteller in the capital

325
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,050
actually knows about
the details of our war?

326
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:44,940
That's right.

327
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,610
Following the story,

328
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,940
Marquis of the North defended
the border for several months.

329
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,050
The town's defense was impeccable.

330
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,500
His enemy surrounded the border town
in a desperate attempt.

331
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,050
With his ingenious plan,
Marquis of the North used

332
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,180
black beans to lure
the steeds of his enemies.

333
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,770
With that, he achieved
another major victory.

334
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,220
Sirs and madams,

335
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,330
I will analyze

336
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,050
how he was able to win the war

337
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,500
by using black beans.

338
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,370
-Excellent!
-Excellent!

339
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,330
Thank you.

340
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,530
Thank you so much.

341
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,500
Sirs and madams,

342
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,500
that is all for my story today.

343
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,020
Please come again tomorrow.

344
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,700
Greetings, sir.

345
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,220
Mister,

346
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,770
how did you manage

347
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,570
to find out

348
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,770
the details of our war?

349
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,980
I made acquaintances with a young man

350
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,330
who participated in the war.

351
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,770
He told me what he had experienced.

352
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,500
Sir, if you don't believe me,

353
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,330
you may ask him personally.

354
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,330
Seems like that young man

355
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,980
is one of us.

356
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,220
I have to know who he is.

357
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,770
Mister, if so,

358
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,850
do you know where he is?

359
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
What a coincidence.

360
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,260
He's living in the inn
right in front of us.

361
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,700
You can ask the waiter there

362
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,220
once you reach the inn.

363
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:11,700
Thank you.

364
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,700
Mr. Du,

365
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,850
someone is looking for you.

366
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,770
[I'll get the door.]

367
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,500
Sir.

368
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,770
Pingwei.

369
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,220
Du Bin?

370
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,020
I finally found you.

371
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,770
I understand now.

372
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,740
You made the storyteller

373
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,420
tell our stories

374
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,660
so that I would come and find you.

375
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,260
You're so intelligent.

376
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,570
I...

377
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,460
I had no choice.

378
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,330
We shouldn't talk here.

379
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,700
We can talk back in the residence.

380
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,420
Let's return to the residence.

381
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,330
Fatty, let's go.

382
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,130
All right.

383
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,850
Du Bin.

384
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,180
Please.

385
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,500
Have a seat.

386
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,770
Vice General Sha, please have some tea.

387
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,980
Mister, please have some tea.

388
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
You guys may leave.

389
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,220
Yes, Vice General.

390
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,500
You're acting way differently

391
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,260
after becoming the princess's consort.

392
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,460
Your style has changed completely.

393
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,260
That's not true.

394
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,500
Bingyan, you should stop mocking me.

395
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,850
Maybe it's because
I've been in the capital for too long.

396
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,900
I can't just slack off

397
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,330
like I did
in the military camp all the time.

398
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,330
Am I right?

399
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,180
Bingyan,

400
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,770
it's all thanks to you.

401
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,460
Thanks to me?

402
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,220
Before this, I worked together
with my uncle and aunt

403
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,260
to help Buqu resolve his issue.

404
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,460
In the end, I ended up

405
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,770
in this situation.

406
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,660
What? Are you unhappy with it?

407
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,180
That's not it.

408
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,420
But you see, I don't think

409
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,810
I deserve

410
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,330
to marry the princess.

411
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,850
Look at you.
You're the princess's consort now.

412
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,740
Foolish people are often blessed.

413
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,020
The imperial edict hasn't been issued yet.

414
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,700
I can't say for sure

415
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,610
that I'll be the princess's consort yet.

416
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,770
But you should tell me

417
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,420
when you arrived at the capital

418
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,740
and the reason
you disguised yourself as a man.

419
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,330
It's a long story.

420
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,130
Not long ago,

421
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,130
Buqu suddenly...

422
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,660
[Her Highness has arrived.]

423
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,260
Pingwei,

424
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,130
when the princess comes,

425
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,180
tell her that I'm a medical disciple.

426
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,570
Don't tell her who I am.

427
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,220
All right.

428
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,610
Your Highness, this is Du Bin.

429
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,660
He's a medic in our military camp.

430
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,130
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Du Bin.

431
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,180
Spare the formalities.

432
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,180
Pingwei,

433
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,500
why didn't you tell me that you had such a

434
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,180
handsome friend?

435
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,940
I would've looked for him instead of you.

436
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,020
What did you say?

437
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,260
I was just joking with you.

438
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,700
Don't mind me. Please have a seat.

439
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,980
I love to joke around.

440
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,220
By the way,

441
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,260
what's with the scholarly getup

442
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,660
after returning to the capital?

443
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,260
I returned to my hometown
to visit my family

444
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,370
after the war.

445
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,330
That's why I dressed myself as such.

446
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,500
What else will you be doing

447
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,460
besides visiting your family?

448
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,740
I have official affairs
to handle in the capital this time around.

449
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,130
Actually, it's considered
my private matter.

450
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,850
Your private matter?

451
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,500
Is it interesting?

452
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
It's a long story.

453
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,980
Before this, General Yuan Buqu

454
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,130
was struck by a poison arrow

455
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,900
during the war.

456
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,980
His life was in danger.

457
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,260
Luckily, my master taught me

458
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,130
a secret technique
that could neutralize poison.

459
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,130
That's how he was able to survive.

460
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,700
However, he hasn't recovered completely.

461
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,740
And he didn't heed my advice.

462
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,260
He returned to the battlefield
and fought our enemies.

463
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,370
That's why it has left a mark on his body.

464
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,570
What will happen then?

465
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,130
He will suffer a relapse

466
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,090
after 100 days.

467
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,660
Pingwei, is that true?

468
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,500
That's right.

469
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,660
Buqu is a reckless person.

470
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,740
That's why he landed himself in trouble.

471
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,980
And, Your Highness,

472
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,900
once he suffers a relapse,

473
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,330
even Hua Tuo [*A legendary surgeon]

474
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,850
won't be able to save him.

475
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,370
I was suddenly reminded of this issue

476
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,660
when I was in my hometown.

477
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,740
That's why I came to the capital

478
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,090
in search of the general.

479
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,740
The general will be fine

480
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,700
as long as he consumes

481
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,810
my medicine within 100 days.

482
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,020
After doing some calculations,

483
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,500
I realize that I have to see him by today.

484
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,900
If the general is in the capital,

485
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,220
it won't be hard to find him.

486
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,090
What about this?

487
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,460
You can wait here.

488
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,660
I'll send someone

489
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,770
to find out where the general is.

490
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,020
I'll update you immediately
once I receive any news.

491
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

492
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,660
You're too courteous.

493
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,850
Silly,

494
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,740
I'll be leaving now.

495
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,810
Who are you calling silly?

496
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,370
You.

497
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,810
See you.

498
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,050
Let's go.

499
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,420
We're almost there.

500
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,180
Du Bin,

501
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,050
you guys can wait here.

502
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,810
I'll go and check it out first.

503
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,700
Buqu,

504
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,660
I've finally found you.

505
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,330
Pingwei?

506
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,570
How did you find me?

507
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,700
Why didn't you tell me

508
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,980
that you were coming to the capital?

509
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,700
It's because I'm sick.

510
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,940
Look at how sick you are.

511
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,090
Why didn't you hire a physician?

512
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,420
You have to get your body examined
when you're sick.

513
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,530
It's not a big deal.

514
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,050
I'll be fine after resting for a few days.

515
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,220
I hired a famous physician for you.

516
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,570
No need for that.

517
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,770
Tell him to leave.

518
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,940
You're the future princess's consort.

519
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,660
Here, have a seat.

520
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,220
Buqu.

521
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,020
You should sit down.

522
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,330
You should sit down first.

523
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,220
Please don't call me that again.

524
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,220
All right.

525
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:45,810
Do you know

526
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,770
which famous physician I've hired for you?

527
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,260
Who is it?

528
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,260
She's a famous physician from Yangzhou

529
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,570
that has made her name here.

530
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,290
A famous physician from Yangzhou?

531
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,050
Yangzhou has plenty of
talented individuals indeed.

532
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,130
Do you know how good she is at her job?

533
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,050
She just needs to use

534
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,130
one thread to read her patient's pulse.

535
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,220
She could give out an accurate diagnosis

536
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,330
without even needing to see the patient.

537
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,500
Why don't you give it a try?

538
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:18,980
How did it go?

539
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,130
Mister,

540
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,370
you're intelligent indeed.

541
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,610
Bingyan,

542
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,850
I already told Buqu about it.

543
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,220
You just need to stand here.

544
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,220
This is my plan.

545
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,020
Sir, please.

546
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,530
Please.

547
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,130
Buqu,

548
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,570
this is the student of the divine healer.

549
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,090
My name is Guo Hai.

550
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,610
Greetings, General.

551
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,570
Spare the formalities.

552
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,420
All right.

553
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,570
Hurry and give Buqu a diagnosis.

554
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:58,850
General,

555
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,980
please remain seated

556
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,220
and don't move around.

557
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,940
I'll relay my master's message

558
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,740
to you.

your condition started
when you were in the South.

564

It happened in Yangzhou.

565
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,290

566
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,220
that you were struck by

hide her money and jewelry?

638
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,850
She hid her money and jewelry

I know its layout inside out.

644
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,090
I'm sure her bedroom

645
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,530
contains another room.

650

651

No, I haven't.

Have you ever seen any silver taels

656
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,570
in her room when you clean it then?

657
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,050
There was nothing valuable in her room.

00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:32,860
Yes, Old Madam.

749
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,340
Leave.

750
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,340
Tianlei,

751
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,860
we already have evidence of

752
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,090
Ke Shizhao's crimes.

753
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,460
We can just report him
to the local authorities.

754
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,170
Why must Grandmother

755
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,610
stage such an act?

756
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,170
It's not that we're not reporting him
to the local authorities.

757
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,860
It's just not time yet.

758
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,860
We have to drive him into a corner first.

759
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,820
After that, we can arrest him.

760
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,250
How can we

761
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,460
drive him into a corner, then?

762
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,020
It's a secret.

763
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,250
So, you don't trust me?

764
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,860
Why are you angry at me?

765
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,020
Look at you.

766
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,690
Sometimes, you talk too much.

767
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:47,860
Just tell me already.

768
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,860
Fine. I'll tell you.

769
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,860
You're such a scum.

770
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,020
I told you to tell me the secret!

771
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,860
-How dare you take advantage of me?
-Fine.

772
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,650
I'll tell you.

773
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:10,730
I'll tell you.

774
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,340
Put your hand down first.

775
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,130
No, I won't.

776
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:17,860
You!

777
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,650
Look at you!

778
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,380
How dare you trick me?

779
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,650
Can't I trick you?

780
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,570
