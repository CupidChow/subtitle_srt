Please don't.

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,430
I wouldn't dare to let you bow to me.

find an excuse

You haven't got the news, have you?

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,840
A few days earlier, the princess told me

43
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,710
His Majesty told Buqu
to work in the capital

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,240
and made him in charge
of the imperial guards

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,400
and all the armies.

Afterward,

51
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,630
I still have to work
under Marquis of the North.

Ziren,

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,680
is this real?

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,080
His Majesty did mention that to me,

55
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,910
but the imperial edict hasn't been issued.

56
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,680

to fight on the battlefield,

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,360

you don't need to worry about Buqu,

63

130
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,480
But my father has granted the marriage.

131
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Where's the edict?

132
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,830
The edict...

133
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,750
I...

134
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,040
I will never allow you

135
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,510
to ruin your whole life.

136
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,240

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,720
You're Yuan Buqu's new wife?

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,870
Raise your head so I can see you.

186
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,440
You look like a proper beauty.

187
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,360
I heard that Miss Du is not only beautiful

188
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,000
but also intelligent and talented.

189
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,080
Since you're a clever girl,

190
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,000
you should understand the consequences.

191
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,480
Go talk to General Yuan.

192
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,030
Bingyan.

193
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,100
[Letter of Divorce
Yuan Buqu and his wife Du Bingyan]

194
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,100
[seek separation due to differences.]

195
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,100
[We write this letter
as proof of divorce.]

196
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,150
Your Majesty,

197
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,670
the two of us have vowed

198
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,000
to never fail each other in this life.

199
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
Then I'd like to see

200
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,910
how long your vows

201
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
can last.

202
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,200
Guards.

203
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,080
Yes.

204
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,720
Yuan Buqu was deliberately mystifying

205
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,910
to fool the princess.

206
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,390
And now he defied my decree.

207
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,960
This is a great disrespect.

208
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,870
Arrest the two and throw them into prison.

209
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,750
Yes.

210
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,200
Marquis, forgive us.

211
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,270
I'll do it myself.

224
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,910
Mother,

225
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,390
I don't want to marry Yuan Buqu.

226
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,120
The one I love is Sha Pingwei.

227
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,270
I want him to be your son-in-law.

228
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,550
You're breaking us up.

229
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,080
You're pushing me into a fire pit.

230
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
How dare you say that?

231
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,240
You're still too young.

232
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,750
That's why you think

233
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,630
love is the most important thing in life.

234
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,360
One day, when you finally grow up,

235
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,150
you'll understand

236
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,630
that love will disappear sooner or later.

237
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,550
You're a woman.

238
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,440
Only your husband's high status

239
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,150
can protect you for a lifetime.

240
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Pingwei has been promoted to vice general

241
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,720
by my father due
to his battle achievements.

242
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,120
He can also protect me.

243
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,510
Although he is vice-general,

244
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,320
your father

245
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,150
ordered him to guard the borders.

246
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,320
If there's another war,

247
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,440
anything could happen
to him on the battlefield.

248
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,120
To fulfill his duty,

249
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,600
his life must be in danger.

250
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,960
If you marry someone like him,

251
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,790
you'll be worried all day long.

252
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,480
If anything happens to him,

253
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,510
or if he dies in battle,

254
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,910
are you going to be a widow for life?

255
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,870
Mother,

256
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,240
just let father transfer Pingwei
to the capital.

257
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,030
Nonsense.

258
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,510
Guarding the borders
concerns state security.

259
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,000
This is a serious matter.

260
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,240
Your father needs
to consider the big picture.

261
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,150
How can he change his orders at will?

262
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,910
But Yuan Buqu is different.

263
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,720
He's rendered excellent service,

264
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,440
and your father
has made him Marquis of the North.

265
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,720
In the future,

266
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,480
he'll let him command the imperial guards

267
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,600
and make him commander-in-chief.

268
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,440
He not only has the military power

269
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,240
but also doesn't need
to guard the borders.

270
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,960
Only a man like this

271
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,150
is your best choice.

272
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,030
Mother,

273
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,150
but I simply don't like him.

274
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,480
You're a woman, too.

275
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,630
Can't you understand how I feel?

276
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,630
I don't care.

277
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,320
I just wanna be together with Sha Pingwei.

278
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,550
I love him.

279
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,910
You were just like me when I was young.

280
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,320
A silly girl

281
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,360
who believes in love.

282
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,840
But when you finally grow up someday,

283
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,480
you'll see

284
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,600
that this is nothing but a fantasy.

285
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,120
It is not reliable.

286
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,120
Had I realized this earlier...

287
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,240
Mother,

288
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,360
you often stare at this portrait.

289
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,000
What exactly happened back then?

290
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,960
Just some sad things.

291
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,670
I look at this portrait every day

292
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,150
just to remind myself

293
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,670
not to abandon myself to emotion

294
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,960
like I did before.

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,670
Mother,

296
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,440
but I just wanna know...

297
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,510
I'm tired.

298
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,120
You should go back to rest now.

299
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:50,870
Mother.

300
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,200
No more discussion.

301
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,910
This thing is settled.

302
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,270
Then I'll take my leave.

303
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,590
Your Majesty,

304
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,160
Yuan Buqu is known
for his military merits.

305
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,790
His Majesty is letting him
lead the imperial guards and the armies.

306
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,350
If you push him like this,

307
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,310
aren't you afraid that he'll rebel?

308
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,200
The military power

309
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,350
hasn't been handed over to him, has it?

310
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
Besides, the wine today

311
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,590
wasn't really poisonous.

312
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,920
This is but

313
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,310
a strategy

314
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,070
to kill two birds with one stone.

315
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,480
There's a personal reason.

316
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,830
Changping

317
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,310
is still childlike.

318
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,110
I wanted to test

319
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,200
if Changping

320
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,790
and Sha Pingwei

321
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,510
really love each other like they said.

322
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,310
I also did this for the country.

323
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,480
Yuan Buqu had rejected the marriage

324
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,310
when he was guarding the border.

325
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,350
Now, he returns in triumph.

326
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,480
If he chooses to marry the princess

327
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,070
and abandons his wife for his future,

328
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,880
he is a heartless man.

329
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,030
How can he be trusted with the country?

330
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,920
You're so considerate, Your Majesty.

331
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,460
[Qi Residence]

332
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,790
Earlier, Bingyan

333
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,400
pretended to be
an elder brother from the Dus

334
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
and did me a solid.

335
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,440
I have to prepare a gift

336
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,400
and thank her properly.

337
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,030
I heard from Bingyan

338
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,590
that when she was married
to the General's Residence,

339
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,400
since the residence is at the border,

340
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,400
the general didn't
hold a wedding ceremony for her.

341
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,000
Now, he's making it up for her.

342
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,030
Thank goodness. The general

343
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,270
didn't fail her.

344
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,400
I'm gonna

345
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,200
make her a headband.

346
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,550
What a shame

347
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,030
I didn't learn embroidery well.

348
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,440
I wanted to embroider

349
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,400
a pair of wild geese on it.

350
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
But now I look at it,

351
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,960
and they look like fat ducks.

352
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,160
Tell me,

353
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,880
since Bingyan is the general's wife,

354
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,350
wearing this on her head

355
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,640
would be laughed at by people, right?

356
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,830
Your Ladyship,

357
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,270
just let me do it.

358
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,640
You have a good will.

359
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,000
This gift

360
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,720
represents your heart anyway.

361
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:19,720
You're right.

362
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,400
I tailored this piece of cloth

363
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,920
and embroidered this flower.

364
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,400
Yes.

365
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,350
Her Ladyship will definitely like it.

366
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,270
Here.

367
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,680
News of Du Bingyan came from the capital.

368
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,070
What news?

369
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,480
The two of them
had reunited in the capital.

370
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,720
I thought
it was going to be a happy ending,

371
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,240
but Her Majesty insisted that General Yuan

372
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
marry the princess.

373
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,720
General Yuan defied her decree

374
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,240
and was thrown into prison.

375
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,750
How could it be like this?

376
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,270
Bingyan is so unlucky.

377
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,510
First a princess,

378
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,200
now there's a queen getting in the way.

379
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,790
Then if the general divorces Her Ladyship

380
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,960
to marry the princess,

381
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,030
what would happen to Her Ladyship?

382
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,720
I dare him.

383
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,550
If Yuan Buqu fails Bingyan

384
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,640
in order to be the emperor's son-in-law,

385
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,510
I'm gonna kill him!

386
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,000
He won't.

387
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,240
It's said that General Yuan

388
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,070
attended the queen's banquet

389
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,960
and rejected her decree openly.

390
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
He'd rather die than accept it.

391
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,720
Du Bingyan dressed like a maid

392
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,030
and stayed by General Yuan's side,

393
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,920
refusing to be separated.

394
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,680
Seems like

395
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,030
Bingyan has prepared
to die with the general.

396
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,790
Alright.

397
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,270
You should pack up.

398
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,920
Let's set off to the capital right away

399
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,880
and find a way to rescue them.

400
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,000
Master and Ms. Shu are also on the way.

401
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,270
We'll meet in the capital

402
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,240
to work things out together.

403
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,750
Tianlei and Yuhu are coming.

404
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,300
[Guiyuan Inn]

405
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,240
Tianlei.

406
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,510
Master, Ms. Shu.

407
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,270
Come on in.

408
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,070
Your Highness,

409
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,640
my uncle and aunt are here.

410
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,200
Greetings, Your Highness.

411
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,960
Save it.

412
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,640
There's no need for that at moments like this.

413
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,070
Pingwei told me

414
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,920
that you're familiar with General Yuan.

415
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,830
I used to be a surgeon
in General Yuan's camp.

416
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,920
As for these two,

417
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,750
this is Third Young Master from Qi family,

418
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,480
and this is Third Young Mistress.

419
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,400
Me and Bingyan are sworn sisters.

420
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,920
By the way,

421
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,590
have you visited Bingyan in the prison?

422
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,240
How is she?

423
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,350
Did anyone bully her?

424
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,550
She's in
the Prison of the Ministry of Penalty.

425
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,720
Unless there's a written permit
from His or Her Majesty,

426
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,270
nobody can get in there.

427
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,270
I've asked my father and cried.

428
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,550
But he said

429
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,030
mother did this for my own good,

430
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,110
and he wouldn't interfere.

431
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,000
My parents are such breaker-uppers.

432
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,000
You're quite reasonable, though.

433
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,880
I'll give up being the princess
at the worst.

434
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,680
I'm gonna run away with Pingwei.

435
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,790
See how they're gonna do with me.

436
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,350
It's just

437
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,830
that we've
implicated General Yuan and your sister.

438
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,790
We have to find a way
to infiltrate the prison

439
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,400
and meet with them two.

440
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,200
We're outsiders

441
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,030
and are unaware of the details.

442
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,640
I'm afraid

443
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,960
it'll be hard for us to find the key.

444
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,030
Maybe the two of them have some clues.

445
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,510
You're right.

446
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,920
We're circling aimlessly outside.

447
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
We have to see Bingyan as soon as possible

448
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,000
and discuss this with her.

449
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:52,880
Lan,

450
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,590
you're the princess.

451
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,480
Don't you have a way

452
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,750
to bring us into that prison?

453
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,070
I've cried in front
of my mother three times.

454
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,310
I'm really running out of ideas.

455
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,750
What's the use of crying?

456
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,790
When I was little, when dad prohibited me

457
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,880
from doing anything,

458
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,200
I'd outsmart him

459
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,030
with various strategies.

460
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,790
You gotta use your wits.

461
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,590
You mentioned

462
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,400
that in order to see Bingyan,

463
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,680
you gotta have a written permit, right?

464
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,030
Then let's steal or snatch one.

465
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,160
Or forge one.

466
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,510
Well...

467
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,440
Are you serious...

468
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,030
I think it's a good idea.

469
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,480
Let's do this.

470
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,680
Then let's split up to take action.

471
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,510
Me and Master go scout first

472
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,310
to see how they patrol that prison.

473
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,480
Then we come up with a plan.

474
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,750
Your Majesty, you're tired.

475
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,550
Please go rest now.

476
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,110
People say

477
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,680
that bloodlines are the most miraculous thing.

478
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,480
In my opinion,

479
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,440
they are absolutely right.

480
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,830
The princess is so like you.

481
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,680
When you're young,

482
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
you're also quite stubborn.

483
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,960
Back then,

484
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,590
I also cried and screamed

485
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,830
to defy my parents' arrangement.

486
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,920
Take my gold lotus out for me.

487
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,510
Your Majesty.

488
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,350
After all these years,

489
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,960
this gold lotus still looks

490
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,550
as shiny as before.

491
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:56,830
Back then,

492
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,200
when he gifted me this gold lotus,

493
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,640
I felt like I was in a dream.

494
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,680
I thought happily

495
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,270
that I'd finally found

496
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,920
the one that I could depend on.

497
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,830
For him,

498
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,960
I put aside my dignity

499
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,400
and defied my parents.

500
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,680
I wanted to elope with him.

501
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,790
He promised

502
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,350
to meet me
in the bamboo forest on the outskirts.

503
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,200
But he didn't show up.

504
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,350
I waited from dawn till dusk.

505
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,720
But he's nowhere to be seen.

506
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,880
All men in the world are fickle.

507
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,790
He must have run away

508
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,960
for fear of offending the royal family

509
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,640
after hearing that I was drafted

510
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,590
for imperial concubines.

511
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,920
I was blinded by love

512
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,350
and trusted a wrong man.

513
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,590
Now,

514
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,270
I can never watch my daughter

515
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,720
make the same mistake.

516
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,750
I must find her

517
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,720
a reliable husband.

518
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,720
I won't allow her
to be carried away by love

519
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,310
and ruin her life.

520
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,110
[Turns out mother is afraid]

521
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,310
[that I'd be fooled and abandoned by men.]

522
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,270
[I misunderstood her.]

523
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,750
Come.

524
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,030
Pingwei.

525
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,680
Uncle.

526
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,160
Anything?

527
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,440
This is my mother's token.

528
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,590
I stole it without her knowing.

529
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,440
You're not bad, huh?

530
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,110
My Lan is the best.

531
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,640
With the token,
things will be a lot easier.

532
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,510
Your Highness, please go no further.

533
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,270
How dare you?

534
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,400
Are you blind?

535
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,720
How dare you stop me, the princess?

536
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,830
I dare not.

537
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,110
It's just that this is a restricted prison.

538
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,160
Nobody enters without a permit.

539
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,510
I'm just following my orders.

540
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,720
Please don't blame us, Your Highness.

541
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,350
I'm here to visit General Yuan Buqu

542
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,000
by order of my mother, the queen.

543
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,880
My apologies. This way, Your Highness.

544
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,750
It's all my fault, Bingyan.

545
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,110
I couldn't protect you.

546
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,200
We're husband and wife.

547
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,070
We are supposed
to be in hardships together.

548
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,680
What if Her Majesty wants to punish us...

549
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,160
You've offended Her Majesty

550
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,920
for the sake of me.

551
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,790
Since you treated me like this,

552
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,200
I will follow you till the end.

553
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,400
Wish we could make it through.

554
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:27,920
Bingyan.

555
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,000
Yuhu,

556
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,590
how did you get in here?

557
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,590
Princess brought us here.

558
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,160
How are you doing?

559
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,160
Did you eat well? Did you sleep well?

560
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,200
Will you feel cold in here?

561
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,200
I'm fine.

562
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,270
Everyone here admires the general.

563
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,830
They brought us food and quilts.

564
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,440
Thank you, Your Highness,

565
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,640
for bringing Yuhu to meet me.

566
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Don't mention it.

567
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,200
You're a perfect couple,

568
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,480
but ended up in prison for no reason.

569
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,350
Even if we cannot survive this,

570
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,240
we'll never separate from each other.

571
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,240
Previously,

572
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,440
I made a headband for you.

573
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,550
I thought

574
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,200
I'd give it to you and General Yuan

575
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,640
as a wedding gift.

576
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,400
But I didn't expect us

577
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,440
to be meeting each other in prison.

578
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,240
Yuhu,

579
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,830
the gift you made for me,

580
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,830
take it out and let me see.

581
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,640
You want me to give it to you here?

582
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,830
As long as it's from you,

583
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,590
wherever I receive it,

584
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,200
I'd be so happy.

585
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,160
I always carry it on me.

586
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,270
I love it.

587
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,960
I'm sorry, Bingyan.

588
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,200
I was planning

589
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,880
to give you a magnificent wedding ceremony

590
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,880
after settling in Marquis Mansion.

591
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,070
But life took a sharp turn.

592
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,510
You've suffered.

593
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,960
I'd like you three to be our witnesses.

594
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,510
Today,

595
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,750
I'd like to give Bingyan
a wedding ceremony.

596
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,070
My wife,

597
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,880
are you willing?

598
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,750
It's good

599
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,720
that there's also a candle in here.

600
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,200
Although it's not a red one,

601
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,830
it's still warm and bright.

602
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,110
Since our parents are not present,

603
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,160
the sun and moon outside shall witness us.

604
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,070
Yuhu,

605
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,550
I'm gonna put on this gift from you.

606
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,480

Mother has made such a foolish decision.

She broke up such a loving couple.

627
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,880
Let's come up with a plan

628
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,030
to get Bingyan and General Yuan
out of here.

629
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,760
By the way,

630
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,030
when I went to steal my mother's token,

631
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,030
I overheard her talking with the nanny.

632
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,230
Seems to be what happened
to my mother back then.

633
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,070
We can start with this.

634
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,550
What is it?

635
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,030
When mother was young,

636
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,400
she also had a loved one.

637
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,760
In order to be together with him,

638
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,480
she defied her parents.

639
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,840
They promised to elope together,

640
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,110
but something unknown happened,

641
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,710
and that man actually abandoned my mother.

642
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,960
He never showed up.

643
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,070
Then let's find that unfaithful lover

644
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,590
to make Her Majesty feel better.

645
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,440
Otherwise, she'll be mad at you

646
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,550
and Bingyan.

647
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,480
You're quite clever.

648
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Come on, think.

649
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,110
Is there any clue about that man?

650
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,480
Clue?

651
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,960
That man

652
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,880
gave my mother a love token.

653
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,440
What token?

654
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,360
It's a gold lotus that he made by himself.

655
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,590
I took a peak.

656
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,360
The workmanship is exquisite.

657
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,110
But pity, there's only half of it.

658
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,550
The other half is missing.

659
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,400
Gold lotus?

660
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,760
[Adoptive Father,]

661
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,760
I saw this today.

662
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,000
This is the love token
of a pair of star-crossed lovers.

663
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,110
Is the gold lotus that you mentioned

664
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,840
in the form of twin lotus flowers?

665
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,230
How do you know that?

666
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,880
Does Her Majesty

667
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,400
used to have a physician friend?

668
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,400
A physician friend?

669
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,630
Let me think.

670
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,840
I remember when I was sick as a little girl,

671
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,960
my mother always checked
the imperial physician's formula personally.

672
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,880
Later, I kept asking her why.

673
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,280
She then told me

674
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,110
that she had an old friend

675
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,550
who was a physician.

676
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,110
She learned medicine

677
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,110
and acupuncture from him.

678
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,110
Great.

679
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,000
Ziren,

680
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,110
I have a plan.

681
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,440
I think we should be safe.

682
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,550
What plan?

683
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,630
Tell us, Bingyan.

684
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,880
I'll do it however dangerous it is.

685
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,000
Yuhu,

686
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,400
I do need your help with this.

687
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,630
When you go out,

688
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,000
tell this to my Adoptive Father.

689
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,110
He can decide on his own afterward.

690
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,630
The gold lotus?

691
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,070
Are you sure it's it?

692
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,280
The princess saw it with her own eyes.

693
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,360
It must be it.

694
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,760

What fate?

697
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,880
Master, please enlighten us.

698
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,760
Master,

699
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,110
aren't we here
to find Her Majesty's unfaithful lover?

700
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,630
Why do you bring this little medicine box?

701
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,480
Aren't we supposed to bring some tools?

702
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,070
If that guy refuses to leave with us,

703
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,510
we'll kidnap him.

704
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,440
Honey, no hurry.

705
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,320

00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,550
Look.

741
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,840
Do you like it?

742
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,630
[Your Ladyship!]

743
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,630
Go now.

744
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,360
What's wrong?

745
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,070
Take care.

746
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,110
Now.

747
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,800
[Her father got the news]

748
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,000
[that the capital
was drafting for concubines.]

749
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,670
[He forced her daughter
to enter the palace,]

750
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,880
[hoping that one day]

751
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,320
[her daughter could be an imperial concubine.]

752
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,110
[And his entire family
would be prosperous.]

753
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,110
[But that girl was loyal to love.]

754
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,110
[Once she decided to marry Feng,]

755
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,280
[she wouldn't change her mind.]

756
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,920
[When they were parting, they promised]

757
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,070
[that after Feng was done
with plague relief,]

758
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,110
[on an agreed date,]

759
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,030
[Feng would go to the outskirt
of the capital]

760
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,630
[to elope with her.]

761
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,880
[Deeply in love,
Mr. Feng decided to do that.]

762
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,110
[He also made plans]

763
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,920
[for the rest of their lives.]

764
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,920
[He once told me]

765
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,360
[that he and his wife]

766
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,280
[would be traveling the world]

767
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,800
[to save those in need.]

768
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,280
[They'd enjoy the scenery when free.]

769
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,550
[They were going to lead]

770
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,630
[the most carefree life.]

771
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:35,630
[The two promised]

772
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,840
[to meet again in the bamboo forest]

773
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,110
[and then elope.]

774
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,400
Next?

775
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,800
What happened

776
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,710
that Uncle Master Feng didn't go there,

777
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,760
and Her Majesty became so sad

778
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,070
that she entered the palace?
