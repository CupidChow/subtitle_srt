00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,140
I still have to travel all around

189
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,570
just to find him.

190
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,020
Tell me.

191
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,690
Isn't he being ridiculous?

192
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,410
He is.

193
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,410
So, Master didn't even write to you?

194
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,980
Before,

195
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,530
he wrote to me when he was away from home.

196
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,020
But once he was away for two years,

197
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,050
I was impatient with all this waiting.

198
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,890
When I was young, I used to be gentle.

199
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,650
But when I was no longer young,

200
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,020
I became impatient.

201
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,380
I then reproached him fiercely.

202
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,410
Why didn't you come back home?

203
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,290
What's so bad about our home?

204
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,140
So,

205
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,770
he was scared away.

206
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,290
Sometimes,

207
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,530
the closer you got to someone,

208
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,690
the more bitingly you spoke to him.

209
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,410
What exactly did you say

210
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,620
to have scared him away?

211
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,810
Just one word.

212
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,340
What is that?

213
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,140
If you have the guts,

214
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,620
don't set foot in my house!

215
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,930
That was harsh, Ms. Shu.

216
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,220
No wonder Master didn't go home.

217
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,860
I knew that.

218
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,930
But when I said that,

219
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,050
I didn't really mean it.

220
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,410
We were just

221
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,530
quarreling.

222
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,170
And I thought we would make it up soon.

223
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,740
Unexpectedly, I hurt his feelings.

224
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,860
Ms. Shu,

225
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,740
if you knew it was your fault,

226
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,530
why didn't you just apologize to him?

227
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,770
Yeah.

228
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,020
I know it was my fault.

229
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,740
That's why I've been
looking for him everywhere.

230
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,100
And after such a long time,

231
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,650
now I just know he's your master.

232
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,740
Ms. Shu, nice to meet you, then.

233
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,690
Stop, stop.

234
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,020
Don't do this.

235
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,380
Oh, Ms. Shu,

236
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,220
Master came back from Jingzhou
to buy some herbs

237
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,770
for wounded soldiers on the border.

238
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,500
So, I'll cover all the expenses.

239
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,890
Please go back to your shop

240
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,770
and pack the herbs with Jingtang.

241
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,500
I promise you.

242
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,460
When Master is back,

243
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,810
he'll be reunited with you.

244
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,500
All right.

245
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,690
Yansheng,

246
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,460
go back to Jingyou House
and wait for my master.

247
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,220
When he's back, bring him to me.

248
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,690
We should go, then.

249
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,500
Sorry for not walking you out.

250
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,260
Ms. Shu is

251
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,340
really vixenish and straightforward.

252
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,460
Miss Li,

253
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,050
you won't be such an old lady, will you?

254
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,220
I won't.

255
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,650
I will

256
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,460
just turn into a giant tiger

257
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,570
and eat you up.

258
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,650
Oh, what a poor man I am!

259
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,570
I'll be eaten by a tiger.

260
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,020
Watch this!

261
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,580
[Jingyou House]

262
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,980
Yansheng.

263
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,620
Want me for something?

264
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,620
All right. Go.

265
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,740
Um-hmm.

266
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,500
After you.

267
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,530
What's the hurry?

268
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,260
Master.

269
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,930
Miss Yuhu.

270
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,980
What's up, Tianlei?

271
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,740
Master,

272
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,410
thank Heaven you're back.

273
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,380
The landlady came personally,

274
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,690
saying two herbs ran out,

275
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,100
and she wanted to offer substitutes.

276
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,620
We were waiting for you

277
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
so that you could make a decision.

278
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,140
What herbs ran out?

279
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,100
They are...

280
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,860
Rehmannia root

281
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,650
and Chinese angelica.
[*Sounds like "You should return home."]

282
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,570
Chinese angelica?

283
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,410
That's the most common herb.

284
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,380
How can it be in short supply?

285
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,930
She just said that.

286
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,380
Yeah.

287
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,410
Chinese angelica.

288
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,020
Master.

289
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,170
Let me tell you something.

290
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,500
The landlady is a close friend of mine.

291
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,770
She's straightforward and helpful.

292
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,980
As soon as she knew

293
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,770
you needed herbs for frontier soldiers,

294
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,460
she closed her shop

295
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,930
and packed the herbs with her adopted son.

296
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,140
She wouldn't even charge a penny.

297
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,290
It's really hard

298
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,140
for a businesswoman like her

299
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,460
to be so generous.

300
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,260
I'm going to see her now.

301
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:41,620
All right.

302
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,570
Yansheng.

303
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,650
Take Master there.

304
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:55,860
Jingtang.

305
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,410
Yes, Mother.

306
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,690
Why haven't they come yet?

307
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,890
Mother, rest assured.

308
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,100
We prepared so many herbs.

309
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,290
Adoptive Father will come.

310
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,090
Jingtang,

311
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,570
you must keep in mind

312
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,020
what I just told you.

313
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,050
Mother, don't worry.

314
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,850
Today,

315
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,900
I'll get you and Adoptive Father back together.

316
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,900
Good.

317
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,130
Here they come.

318
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:17,370
Really?

319
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,130
Come on.

320
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,530
I'll count on you.

321
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,180
Got it.

322
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,420
Yansheng.

323
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,370
Cure the sick?

324
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,700
You must be Mr. Liu from the border.

325
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,420
Yes, I'm Liu Ruoqian.

326
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,770
I'm Ji Jingtang,

327
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,940
the shop assistant.

328
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,740
Where's your landlady?

329
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,740
Oh, her.

330
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,900
She was here, waiting for you.

331
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,980
But unfortunately,

332
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,900
she went out for some emergency.

333
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,740
Wait a minute, please.

334
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,530
She'll be right back.

335
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,090
Sure.

336
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:03,740
Do what you got to do.

337
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,530
Sure.

338
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,180
What was that sound?

339
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,290
Could it be a rat?

340
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,420
Humph, you're the rat.

341
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,180
Oh, Mr. Liu,

342
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,330
I heard you were from Luoyang, Henan.

343
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,020
Yes.

344
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,220
My landlady is from the same city.

345
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,420
She said she was your childhood friend.

346
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
What is her name?

347
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,740
Her name is She Yu.

348
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,330
She Yu?

349
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,610
Sorry, but I can't remember.

350
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,700
Can't remember me?

351
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,940
Think hard, then.

352
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,770
Get to your business.

353
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,370
How long have you practiced calligraphy?

354
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,020
For four years.

355
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,610
Your calligraphy is vigorous.

356
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,850
A promising young man, indeed.

357
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,260
Why isn't your landlady back yet?

358
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,330
Is anything holding her up?

359
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,420
Indeed.

360
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,530
Well, to be honest,

361
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,980
there was a conflict yesterday.

362
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,770
What conflict?

363
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,260
Last night, she and her husband quarreled.

364
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,020
At first, it wasn't a serious problem.

365
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,660
But as they quarreled,

366
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,500
they were both enraged.

367
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,810
My landlady is

368
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,770
a very stubborn woman.

369
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,130
So, she said something

370
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,260
very mean.

371
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,180
That was awful.

372
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,370
So, her husband stormed out.

373
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,940
She was worried, then.

374
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,770
But in order not to keep you waiting,

375
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,180
she forced herself to pack the herbs

376
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,500
before hurrying out for her husband.

377
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,660
Oh, we all have our crosses to bear.

378
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,770
She could have ignored her husband.

379
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,260
Why must she get him back?

380
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,570
You're too young to understand.

381
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,460
Even though

382
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,020
a couple don't actually hate each other.

383
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,460
But she said something mean.

384
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,130
If she didn't look for him,

385
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,740
how could he have a face-saving return?

386
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,020
You heartless man.

387
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,980
I'll save your face, and will you return?

388
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:15,900
By the way,

389
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,260
my landlady left something before leaving.

390
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,660
She said after I gave it to you,

391
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,090
you would know we had Chinese angelica.
[*Sounds like "You should return home."]

392
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,610
Return home.

393
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,980
Who is your landlady exactly?

394
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,460
She Yu...

395
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,090
It's actually Shu.

396
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,900
Ruoqian.

397
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,090
I had great difficulty looking for you.

398
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,130
Where have you been?

399
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,370
Where have you been all these days?

400
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,500
Tell me! Where have you been?

401
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,460
I'm Jingtang. Greetings, Adoptive Father.

402
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,770
You may rise.

403
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,900
Adoptive Father,

404
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,980
look at grapes.

405
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,500
You brought them back from the border.

406
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,770
Through quite a lot of people,

407
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,530
they ended up with Mother.

408
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,740
Ruoqian,

409
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,570
I've made up my mind.

410
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,770
From this day on,

411
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,290
wherever you go, I'll go with you.

412
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,810
We will never be apart.

413
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,180
Xiuyun,

414
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,700
don't worry.

415
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,660
The day after tomorrow,
I'll deliver the herbs to the border

416
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,980
and then come back soon.

417
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,660
The day after tomorrow?

418
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,700
Can't you stay for even one more day?

419
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,260
On the frontline,

420
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,610
many wounded soldiers
are waiting to be treated.

421
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,020
You always worry about everyone.

422
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,500
But why don't you ever worry about me?

423
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,530
I won't stop you from curing the sick.

424
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,700
But you shouldn't leave me all alone

425
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,850
without caring at all.

426
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,290
Come on.

427
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,090
You were sensible for only a few minutes.

428
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,700
Now, you're nagging again,

429
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,260
and you just won't stop it.

430
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,500
I nag

431
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,370
only because I care about you.

432
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,020
I know you care about me.

433
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,290
Faster! Faster!

434
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:38,980
Move!

435
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,530
Come in and check it for me.

436
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,260
Press on his wound.

437
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,850
Be careful.

438
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,220
How's he?

439
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:45,980
Du Bin,

440
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,130
are hemostatic herbs available?

441
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,290
Hemostatic herbs?

442
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,460
We ran out of them.

443
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,740
What do we do now?

444
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,810
We must stop this soldier from bleeding.

445
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,420
Or he would just die.

446
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,180
I've got an idea.

447
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,370
My master once

448
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,900
pointed at the guinea grass and said,

449
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,370
"This herb is poisonous in some way,

450
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,370
but it saves life in case of emergency."

451
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,290
Right in this emergency,

452
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,570
it will save his life!

453
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,500
I'll send some soldiers for it.

454
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:06,900
Don't bother.

455
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,020
I can recognize it. I'll go.

456
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,700
All right.

457
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,940
Stay safe!

458
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,770
Hurry. Press on his wound.

459
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,700
I found it.

460
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,660
You did?

461
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,900
That's great.

462
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,700
At last.

463
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,610
There must be some more nearby.

464
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,500
Let's search separately.

465
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,420
All right.

466
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,220
What happened, Dr. Du?

467
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,940
Dr. Du! Dr. Du!

468
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,020
Hang in there, man.

469
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,530
This will save your life.

470
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,500
You'll live.

471
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,770
Dr. Du got the herb this very night.

472
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,420
Come on.

473
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,700
Doctor,

474
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,260
I heard Du Bin was injured.

475
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,260
What happened?

476
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,530
To save a wounded soldier,

477
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,770
Du Bin went up the mountain
and got some herbs.

478
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,940
He fell and hurt himself.

479
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,660
Is it serious?

480
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,050
No, luckily.

481
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,290
Just a flesh wound.

482
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,460
But anyway, he's rather stubborn.

483
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,420
Letting no one touch him,

484
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,660
he went back alone for some dressing.

485
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,500
Come.

486
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:06,660
Be right there.

487
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,460
Du Bin.

488
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,810
Du Bin.

489
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,530
How do you feel now?

490
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,260
Pingwei.

491
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,850
Does it still hurt?

492
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,850
I feel much better now.

493
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
Come on.

494
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,180
You went out there surreptitiously.

495
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,420
Why didn't you tell me?

496
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,700
I could have accompanied you.

497
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,700
I had no time to tell you.

498
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,850
I had to save that soldier.

499
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,500
Fine.

500
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,700
Let me tell you some good news.

501
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,940
The soldier who spied
in the enemy's barrack

502
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,570
was saved.

503
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,530
He was?

504
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:44,900
And, of course,

505
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,290
he couldn't live

506
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,940
without your timely herbs.

507
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,770
You made another contribution.

508
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,700
Our soldiers fought in the battle.

509
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,770
And we saved that man together.

510
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,940
That's not my credit to take.

511
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,810
You contributed, anyway.

512
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,180
I'll get credit for you from Buqu.

513
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,020
What?

514
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,020
There you are, Buqu.

515
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,570
Want credit for him?

516
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,420
Yes.

517
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,980
Our main force is still out there.

518
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:07,700
Out you go.

519
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,330
Aye.

520
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,330
Du Bin,

521
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,810
I should go.

522
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,020
Come on. Sit.

523
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,810
Where are you hurt? Show me.

524
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,370
I'm fine.

525
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,370
Let me check it.

526
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,610
Does it still hurt?

527
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,530
Why didn't you tell me
before you went up the mountain?

528
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,530
It was an emergency last night.

529
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,740
I had to save his life.

530
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,770
Sorry for all that you've suffered.

531
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,050
I really didn't know

532
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,050
you were from a rich family in Yangzhou.

533
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,660
Actually,

534
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,980
it's not bad to leave Yangzhou
for somewhere strange.

535
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,420
Before I came here,

536
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,900
I didn't know

537
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,020
this world could be so big

538
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,460
and I could do so many things.

539
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,570
Now, I'm no longer as homesick

540
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,530
as I was when I first arrived.

541
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,220
A girl like you is staying away from home.

542
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
You must be homesick,

543
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,500
and that's human nature.

544
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,570
Bingyan,

545
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,220
I want to have you sent
back to my residence.

546
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:02,700
No.

547
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,330
I would be bored there.

548
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,330
Then I'll have you sent back to Yangzhou.

549
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:10,810
Still no.

550
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,810
The scent of victory is in the air.

551
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,090
I want to return with you in triumph.

552
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,980
But it's inconvenient for a lady like you

553
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,500
to stay here, disguised as a man.

554
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,020
You made sense.

555
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,460
When I live in the barrack,

556
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,130
there are a lot of inconveniences, indeed.

557
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,180
How about this?

558
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,610
Tomorrow, I'll repeal the military notice.

559
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,810
You can't.

560
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,220
You're on an important imperial mission.

561
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,050
Don't worry too much about me.

562
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,660
When I'm resting for recovery,

563
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,090
I'll try to figure out a way.

564
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,260
Fine.

565
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:04,810
But from this day on,

566
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,220
you can't be out of my sight.

567
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,290
Soldiers,

568
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,370
since we were stationed on the border,

569
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,290
we've fought the enemy

570
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,020
and won every single battle.

571
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,020
Because you're fierce warriors,

572
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,180
and we have very strict discipline.

573
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,980
According to the sixth term,

574
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,330
no woman can come in without permission.

575
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,050
But lately,

576
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,090
a woman ventured

577
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,260
to have sneaked in!

578
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,530
-Woman?
-Woman?

579
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,420
I've never seen one.

580
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,740
Where's the woman? I didn't see her.

581
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,700
I didn't see any woman sneak in.

582
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,570
What's a woman doing here?

583
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,090
Buqu,

584
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,570
there isn't a woman here.

585
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,220
It's nobody else

586
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,610
but my wife

587
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,260
who came from Yangzhou to Jingzhou.

588
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,090
Bring her to us!

589
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,090
Du... Du Bin?

590
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,420
Buqu,

591
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,460
did you get the wrong person?

592
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,180
Don't be scared.

593
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,330
Du Bin.

594
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,810
According to military regulations,

595
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,900
a woman
who enters the barracks without permission

596
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,500
shall be executed!

597
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,300
Wait.

598
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
I don't think

599
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,860
this is appropriate.

600
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,730
Why is it not?

601
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,090
Now that she's your wife,

602
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,730
she isn't a woman who just sneaked in.

603
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,570
Besides,

604
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,460
after she came here,

605
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,090
she offered a great plan

606
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:27,860
and saved wounded soldiers.

607
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:28,860
Buqu,

608
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,820
you had an arrow wound,

609
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,210
and she took good care of you

610
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,130
day and night before you recovered.

611
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,610
Giving her no chance to explain,

612
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,500
you want to execute her.

613
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,730
It's unfair, anyway!

614
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,650
That's right.

615
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:58,250
-It's unfair!
-It's unfair!

616
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,610
There are rules for a country.

617
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,170
So are there for an army.

618
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,900
And the rules are set

619
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,250
for a reason.

620
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,210
She's my wife who I didn't meet before.

621
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,460
But she broke the discipline I made.

622
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,340
I'm a man

623
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,900
who keeps strictly the rules!

624
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:16,690
General,

625
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,570
please let go of Dr. Du.

626
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,340
Yeah, General.

627
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,610
Let go of her, please.

628
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,250
My wife violated military regulations,

629
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,380
and I cannot escape blame.

630
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,500
I allowed her to stay,

631
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:31,820
and I deserve to be punished.

632
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,020
Guards!

633
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,500
Beat Yuan Buqu up

634
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,300
100 times with military canes!

635
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,130
Buqu...

636
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,340
No, General.

637
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,380
You're my wife,

638
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,170
and we're a couple.

639
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,500
I can't let you suffer this alone.

640
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,210
Do it.

641
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,170
But General...

642
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:01,980
Do it!

643
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,730
Sorry, General.

General,

657
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,730
as your military counselor,

658
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,940
I keep the rules most strictly.

659
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,610
Listen to me, please.

660
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,980
Prime Minister Cao of the Three Kingdoms

661
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,020
ordered that horses should be killed
for treading on young crops.

662
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,380
Yet his own horse

663
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,610
trod on some young crops.

664
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,020
To abide by his order,

665
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,210
he planned to kill himself.

666
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,020
And he didn't allow himself

667
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,650
to escape punishment.

668
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:28,860
Later,

669
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,570
all military counselors pleaded

670
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,690
that he could cut his hair
instead of his head

671
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,130
as an apology.

672
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,570
Right, I know that story.

673
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,090
What you did ignorantly is not a sin.

674
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,610
General, you were flogged

675
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,050
for implicated responsibility.

676
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,340
So,

677
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,380
this is over.

678
00:37:48,780 --> 00:38:03,500
-General is innocent!
-General is innocent!

679
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,210
Buqu.

680
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:14,860
Fine.

681
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,610
Today, I'll emulate Prime Minister Cao

682
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,020
