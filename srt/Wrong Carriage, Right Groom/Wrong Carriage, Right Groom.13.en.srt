00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,630
have become a couple, right?

111
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,000
His Majesty just issued an edict

112
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,000
letting Buqu be his royal consort,

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360

118
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,560
Absolutely!

119
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,680
My sister-in-law suffered so much

120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,430
and finally had a chance

121
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,000
to be husband and wife with Buqu.

122
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,630

123
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,630
there comes an imperial edict.

124
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Then does General Yuan have a plan?

125
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,560
The edict is nonnegotiable.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,390

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,800

is the smartest in our family?

Stop kidding me.

132
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,680
Your uncle is the smartest.

133
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,160
We gotta tell this to your uncle

134
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,480
and let him work it out.

135
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's go.

136
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,870

137
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,480

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,390

142
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,120
Some beans ought to be spilled.

143
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,070
Let's go.

144
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,120
Are you coming?

145
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,000
Just follow me.

Make way!

149
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,560
Mr. Guan,

150
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,430
we've searched the city inside and out,

151
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,870
but nobody is found.

152
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360

153
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,270

as night soil dumpers.

155
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,390
Now you can't even
find three living persons.

156
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,190

160
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,560
and go to each city gate.

161
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,080
Okay, thank you, Officer.

173
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,600
Since they know we've escaped,

174
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,750
they'll definitely
set an ambush at the gate

175
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,960
to keep hunting down Abbess Luxuan.

176

00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,750
just leave me here.

178
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,480

179
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,000
Please don't think like that.

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,960

What now?

187
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,550
Skinny.

Have you seen a nun?

197
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,150
No.

201
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,910
They look like a young master

202
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,030
and a young lady from a rich family.

203
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,000
But they're wearing the clothes
of nuns and night soil dumpers?

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,600
And they're bringing a blind nun.

205
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,150
No, we haven't.

As of now,

216
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,260
they've probably caught

217
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,380
our substitutes.

218
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,740
They must be super pissed.

219
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,100
They can never know

220
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,020
that we've taken a detour.

221
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,980
Even if they come back to chase us again,

222
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,460
they won't catch up with us anyway.

223
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,020
When we're back to Linzhou,

224
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,410
we gotta find a safe place

225
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,170
to let Abbess Luxuan settle down.

226
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,980
Then we go back
to the house in the forest.

227
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,620
We must finish the show

228
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,690

You're back.

230
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,380
Of course we are.

231

That's not worth mentioning.

It'll recover after a few days.

237

What's important is

238
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,690
that we've brought back the one
we were looking for.

But this is a serious matter.

242
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,380
We mustn't let Ke Shizhao
know this in advance.

243
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,100
Otherwise he'll definitely act ruthlessly.

244
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,770
You must be cautious these days.

245
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,810
Do not slack at all.

246
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,460

259
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,050
and Third Young Mistress had done

260

along the way to Jiangzhou.

262
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,890
And anything that's suspicious.

263
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,810
If they could reach Jiangzhou smoothly,

264
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,380
someone must be helping them.

265

Do find out who this helper is.

the blind old lady out of Jiangzhou?

00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,090
I'm a little tired now.

377
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,090
I'll go take a rest first.

378
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Then let me support you to your room.

379
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,500
No need.

380
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,260
I'll go by myself.

381
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,740
Pingwei.

382
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,900
Sister-in-law?

383
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,260
I gotta go patrol.

384
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,020
Excuse me.

385
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:09,700
Stop right there.

386
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,850
General has told me

387
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,770
about what's on the edict.

388
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:25,850
He told you?

389
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,330
He specially told me

390
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,020
not to tell anyone.

391
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,370
Sister-in-law,

392
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,900
please don't take it to heart.

393
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,220
Although His Majesty
wants him to be his royal consort,

394
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,700
he's unwilling to obey.

395
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,090
Sister-in-law?

396
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,460
Yuan Buqu,

397
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,980
you dare defy the imperial edict

398
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,220
and disrespect
the emperor and the princess.

399
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,130
Today I'm gonna

400
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,660
send you two to hell.

401
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,530
Bingyan.

402
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,980
I already knew

403
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,500
about what was on the imperial edict.

404
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,050
Am I doomed

405
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,810
to die alone in this life?

406
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,810
My two ex-wives died due to misfortune.

407
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
I've tried so hard

408
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,500
to be a couple with you on the border.

409
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,850
But now there's another undeserved event.

410
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,180
No.

411
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,940
I'd rather resign and go back home

412
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,530
than let you feel miserable.

413
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,660
Not to mention
letting you be the concubine.

414
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,660
Ziren,

415
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,570
you don't have to resign.

416
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,460
You should still be Marquis of the North.

417
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,660
I don't care

418
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,740
about fame or wealth.

419
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,980
I won't let you live in misery

420
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,810
for a bubble reputation like this.

421
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,700
But defying the edict is a felony.

422
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,770
We must let His Majesty

423
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,220
take that order back by himself.

424
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,980
You need to send me back to Yangzhou.

425
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,420
Send you back to Yangzhou?

426
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,260
Do you have some sort of plan?

427
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,660
Sending me back to Yangzhou

428
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,090
is just a part of my plan.

429
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,740
This thing

430
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,290
is only between you and me

431
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,530
and Adoptive Father and Adoptive Mother.

432
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,900
How do you mean?

433
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,980
You sending me back to Yangzhou

434
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,290
is just the first step.

435
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,500
Adoptive Father and Adoptive Mother
not returning to Linzhou

436
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,940
is the second step.

437
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,900
As for the third step,

438
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,770
it'll depend on you,

439
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,900
General Yuan.

440
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,700
Hold on. Just tell me in detail.

441
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,980
Fine. Listen carefully then.

442
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,220
Ziren,

443
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,850
The road to happiness
is strewn with setbacks.

444
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,260
Let's have another one of those.

445
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,700
Sorry for putting you on the road.

446
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,980
I'm not going to the end of the world.

447
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,020
We're just having a temporary departure.

448
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,570
How lucky I am

449
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,500
to be able to marry

450
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,020
a most intelligent and gentle woman

451
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,220
who is capable of turning the tides...

452
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,660
Now it's still hard to tell

453
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,940
whether my plan works.

454
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,330
You need to

455
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,940
discuss with Adoptive Father more.

456
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,180
Okay.

457
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,530
Rest assured.

458
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,330
Then, see you.

459
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,660
I'm leaving.

460
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,370
Okay.

461
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,340
[Qi Residence]

462
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,900
Grandmother.

463
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,220
You two are finally willing to come back.

464
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,570
Come. Let me take a look.

465
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,290
Your complexion looks much better.

466
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,810
And you're much stronger physically.

467
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,370
Good.

468
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:17,850
Grandmother,

469
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,610
the house in the forest has great views.

470
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,980
The air was so fresh there.

471
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,420
My illness has almost recovered.

472
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,900
Wonderful to hear.

473
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,940
Let me see Bingyan then.

474
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,420
Much thinner.

475
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,660
I even feel sorry for you.

476
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,500
By the way,

477
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,220
I've cooked red cubilose

478
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,050
to nourish your bodies.

479
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,290
Someone,

480
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,700
serve the red cubilose.

481
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,220
Come on, take your seats.

482
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:43,980
Sit down.

483
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,660
Thank you, Grandmother.

484
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,130
All of you, sit down now.

485
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,050
Say, Tianlei,

486
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,610
your complexion

487
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,770
really looks much better.

488
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,770
Grandmother, look.

489
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,130
Tianlei seems to have tanned a little.

490
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,700
Speaking of which,

491
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,130
I do find him a little tanned.

492
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,420
I know why.

493
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,500
It must be that Third Young Mistress

494
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,370
was too active to stay
in that small courtyard,

495
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,220
so she took Tianlei

496
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,850
to have fun somewhere else.

497
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,900
Sister-in-law,

498
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,940
why don't you tell us

499
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,570
where did you take Tianlei to

500
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,020
so that we can share the fun?

501
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,850
The fun places...

502
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,610
Where?

503
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,370
We've gone to none.

504
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,980
You've been staying indoors every day?

505
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,740
Not like that.

506
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,610
Grandmother,

507
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,610
me and Tianlei copied
Buddhist scriptures for you.

508
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,260
Xiaoxi.

509
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,500
[Heart Sutra]

510
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,610
Such a couple of good kids.

511
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,740
Thank you Buddha

512
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,850
for letting my grandson's body get better.

513
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,090
Grandmother,

514
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,460
actually copying the scripture

515
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,940
and praying for you

516
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,500
was directed by an erudite mentor.

517
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,610
What mentor?

518
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,420
This mentor

519
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,700
is a compassionate

520
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,740
and saint-like abbess.

521
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,700
When my master was young,

522
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,370
he ran into this abbess

523
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,770
while touring the world.

524
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,700
From their conversation,

525
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,460
master knew that this abbess was erudite.

526
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,050
Afterward, when master treated me,

527
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,220
he transcribed

528
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,260
the Buddhist scripture
explained by her to me

529
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,980
so that I could study it.

530
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:25,980
But to my surprise,

531
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,660
my illness has almost been cured.

532
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,090
Good karma.

533
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,050
This is good karma.

534
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,260
This abbess travels everywhere

535
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,660
and explains to people
about Buddha dharma.

536
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,570
It's really hard
to meet her through seeking.

537
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,290
But master wrote me a letter saying

538
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,500
that this abbess will be

539
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,980
travelling to Linzhou these days.

540
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,330
So I thought,

541
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,770
since grandmother is interested
in Buddhism,

542
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,330
if I can invite this abbess

543
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,660
to our Qi Residence

544
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,020
to explain Buddha dharma for us,

545
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,700
wouldn't it be a great thing

546
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,570
for our Qi Residence?

547
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,420
That's why I asked master

548
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,260
to invite this abbess to our place.

549
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,330
What do you think, Grandmother?

550
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,180
Of course you should.

551
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,090
I've been doing good
and accumulating virtue

552
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,420
exactly for

553
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,130
the blessing from Buddha to our family,

554
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,500
and to you.

555
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,610
If we could meet this abbess,

556
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,220
that would be our good karma.

557
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,090
You're right, Grandmother.

558
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,260
Tianlei,

559
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,370
why don't you tell me

560
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,180
the whereabout of this abbess.

561
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,290
I'll send someone to fetch her right now.

562
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,370
Cousin,

563
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,330
this abbess is an enlightened one.

564
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,900

that they weren't in the house at all.

she wanted to buy

00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,500
someone evil tricked my son.

754
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,940
He offered us good food every day.

755
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,020
One day, my son caught a cold.

756
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,050
We went to an apothecary
to buy some medicine.

757
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,900
However,

758
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,530
that crook poisoned my son's medicine

759
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,090
in order to take over that apothecary.

760
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,820
My son suffered a terrible death.
