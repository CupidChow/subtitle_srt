00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,200
Well...

191
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,480
Madam,

192
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,240
it's getting late.

193
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,910
We should head back for supper.

194
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,360
Why are you afraid of me getting in?

195
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,150
Well...

196
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,910
If you don't tell me,

197
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,440
I'll find out by myself.

198
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,840
Madam,

199
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,720
the supervisor told us

200
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
not to bring you here.

201
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm just gonna get in and take a look.

202
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,600
If the supervisor asks about it,

203
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,510
I'll take full responsibility.

204
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,080
Well...

205
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,790
Madam.

206
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,320
Madam.

207
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,030
-Madam.
-Madam.

208
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,600
[Memorial Tablet for Late Wife Li Xiuling,
January, Fifth Year of Yonghui]

209
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,020
[Memorial Tablet for Late Wife Yang Kexin,
November, Third Year of Xianqing]

210
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,100
[He did marry two wives.]

211
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,770
[People say that]

212
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,410
[they both were tortured to death.]

213
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,380
Madam,

214
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,050
you shouldn't be here.

215
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,170
Supervisor Li.

216
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,860
How did I tell you before?

217
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,140
They're not at fault.

218
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,860
I broke in by myself.

219
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,410
Madam,

220
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,890
you should go back to rest.

221
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,530
You...

222
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,410
Please, Madam.

223
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,900
[Qi Residence]

224
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,260
Tianlei,

225
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,380
you just got married.

226
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,740
So,

227
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,020
why aren't you spending time
with your wife

228
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,290
but coming to my place?

229
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:47,860
Master,

230
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,020
now things are really confusing.

231
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,930
This marriage is too suspicious.

232
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,170
How do you mean by that?

233
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,220
I've heard long ago

234
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,020
that Miss Du Bingyan from Yangzhou is my age

235
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,460
and is both well-educated and gentle.

236
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,340
But now this bride...

237
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,770
After getting to know her in a few days,

238
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,410
I don't think she fits that description.

239
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,890
She seems younger than me.

240
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,100
Although she's cute,

241
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,100
or even heroic in character,

242
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,980
she doesn't have too much education.

243
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,460
She actually misread Garden of Harmony

244
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,890
as "Guard of Honey".

245
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,930
And "Enlightened and Thus Happy"

246
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,530
as "Enlightened and This Happy".

247
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,170
Talking Grandmother
into forcing me to marry

248
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,930
is already an ill-intentioned move.

249
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,740
Do you think
this is his another scheme?

250
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,220
Did he swap the bride somehow?

251
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,500
Xiaoxi, hurry.

252
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,740
Your Ladyship,

253
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,220
you need to be quiet and refined.

254
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,050
You're the gentlewoman Du Bingyan.

255
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,020
Don't give yourself away.

256
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,170
I get it.

257
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,050
Don't you know

258
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,020
how good I'm at pretending?

259
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,740
Your Ladyship.

260
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,860
Save your breath.

261
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,620
Third Young Mistress, there you are.

262
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,500
Old Madam is expecting you inside.

263
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,260
Please.

264
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,100
Come on.

265
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,690
Mother.

266
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,530
We specially saved a seat

267
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,740
by Old Madam's side.

268
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,460
Sit down now.

269
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:03,650
Grandmother.

270
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,570
We're expecting you.

271
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,220
Today, the kitchen served us crabs.

272
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,660
The women of the family

273
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,980
drink wine and compose poems here

274
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
to pay respect to the moon.

275
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,660
Let's have some fun.

276
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,260
Tianlei is too weak

277
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,420
to eat this cold stuff.

278
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,130
Shizhao is too occupied with his shop.

279
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,290
He can't come.

280
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,700
That's why all of these crabs

281
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,260
are ours to enjoy.

282
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,330
By the way,

283
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,850
these crabs were bought
from your hometown.

284
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,660
Guess this will remind you of your home.

285
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,700
Thank you, Grandmother.

286
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,660
Bingyan is the most talented girl
in Yangzhou.

287
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,660
As for the fun facts about crabs,

288
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,980
we're counting on you to tell us some.

289
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,610
Mother,

290
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,770
Grandmother,

291
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,220
you flatter me.

292
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,370
Speaking of fun facts,

293
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,330
I can't remember a thing or two for now.

294
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,420
But I know a lot of

295
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,980
popular wisecracks.

296
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,850
Please don't laugh at me

297
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,980
if I tell one.

298
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,850
Why would we?

299
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,460
We all know you're a scholarly girl.

300
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,370
We'd love to hear anything

301
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,700
coming out of your mouth.

302
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,810
Eyes popping,

303
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:27,940
foaming at the mouth,

304
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,530
such an arrogant creature.

305
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,220
Even with thick skin, dark guts,

306
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,020
ironlike shell, strong pincers,
and fast legs,

307
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,260
it can't avoid

308
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,500
the fate of being ripped and eaten.

309
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,180
Interesting, huh?

310
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,770
Indeed.

311
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,500
When it comes out of Bingyan's mouth,

312
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,700
it simply sounds like proper literature.

313
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,740
How unique and fun.

314
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,220
That's right.

315
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,130
Grandmother, you flatter me.

316
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,420
[Luckily I often go to]

317
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,940
[pubs and teahouses with my dad.]

318
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,420
[Who'd have thought the spiels]

319
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,770
[of the bartenders come in handy.]

320
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,090
Serve the eight tools for eating crabs.

321
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,460
The hammer.

322
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,460
The spoon.

323
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,610
The tweezers.

324
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,740
The scissors.

325
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,020
The block.

326
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,500
The axe.

327
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,660
The needle.

328
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,770
And the scraper.

329
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,770
[What the hell is this whole set?]

330
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,130
[Do these people
have too much time to kill?]

331
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,050
[Why can't they just eat
with their mouths?]

332
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,850
Ours is a literary family.

333
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,940
Now the Old Madam has

334
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,500
a talented granddaughter-in-law like Bingyan,

335
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,420
why don't we take this festival chance

336
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,130
to eat crabs, drink wine,
and compose poems?

337
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,130
Old Madam, what do you say?

338
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,770
Good.

339
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:17,220
Let's compose crab-themed poems.

340
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,260
How about I go first?

341
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,260
Sure.

342
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,770
Ripening paddy,

343
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,770
which means the rice crops are ripe.

344
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,740
The fall offers us ripening paddy

345
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,900
and crabs that are fighty and muddy.

346
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,420
Good one!

347
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,460
Good one!

348
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,220
Then, who's next?

349
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,740
Old Madam,

350
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,700
why don't we
let Third Young Mistress go next?

351
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,090
She can show us how graceful

352
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,460
a gentlewoman from Yangzhou eats crabs,

353
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,220
while composing a masterpiece.

354
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,610
[Fang Xiaoqiao, huh?]

355
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,810
[You really wanna embarrass me.]

356
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
[Sister Bingyan,]

357
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,220
[your role is too hard to play.]

358
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,660
Wisdom in hold, elegance in mold.

359
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,180
Third Young Mistress
is surely the best candidate.

360
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,700
Well...

361
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,180
[The little axe and hammers]

362
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,610
[are no different from the weapons]

363
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,530
[at Mighty Martial Arts Center.]

364
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,570
Grandmother,

365
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,220
then I'll have a try?

366
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:36,610
Go ahead.

367
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,530
Cut off the tail and rip off the legs,

368
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,700
Hit the back and hammer the chest.

369
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,220
Lift up the shell and pierce the heart

370
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,180
Taste the meat with tongue of sword.

371
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,770
Good.

372
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,500
Very manly.

373
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,370
Quite heroic actually.

374
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,660
But it sounds...

375
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,740
A bit ungraceful.

376
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,130
We're dismembering the crab, aren't we?

377
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,260
It can't be all that graceful.

378
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,570
Being a bit unbridled is forgivable.

379
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,020
But why do they sound like

380
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,050
martial art moves?

381
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,660
Old Madam,

382
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,290
our lord often says to Her Ladyship,

383
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,130
girls should also be broad-minded

384
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,770
and magnanimous.

385
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,660
There's no need to be too girlish.

386
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,050
That's why

387
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,460
he had Her Ladyship

388
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,370
read a lot of frontier fortress poems.

389
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,260
So her style is naturally bold and heroic.

390
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,020
That's right, Grandmother.

391
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,700
I love frontier fortress poems.

392
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,660
Who would have thought Third Young Mistress

393
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,420
to have the makings of a heroine?

394
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,020
Of course.

395
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,290
Females are as excellent
as their male peers.

396
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,050
Old Madam,

397
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,740
the chrysanthemums are ready outside.

398
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,050
Why don't we go out

399
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,700
to appreciate them and draw pictures?

400
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,850
Good idea.

401
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,090
Let's go.

402
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,980
Let's see our chrysanthemums at the door.

403
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,090
Bingyan,

404
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,570
Old Madam used to be

405
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,500
a famous woman painter.

406
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,940
You're also a famous gentlewoman
from Yangzhou.

407
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,980
I trust that you must be good at

408
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,370
all the fancies of men of letters.

409
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,850
So today,

410
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,850
do show us your excellent skills.

411
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,980
Why don't you draw
that White Phoenix Pearl?

412
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,420
Okay.

413
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,330
Okay, then let's all get started.

414
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:24,940
Okay.

415
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,900
It's so hard to be a gentlewoman.

416
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,020
Your Ladyship,

417
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,770
you must hang on.

418
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,420
I can hang on when I'm doing chin-ups.

419
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,770
But the literary stuff...

420
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,260
I'll do my best.

421
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,020
Oh, chrysanthemum.

422
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,530
You're the White Phoenix Pearl,

423
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,900
and I am the Tanned Black Bug.

424
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,130
I should've studied harder

425
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,290
when dad sent me to school.

426
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,370
Old Madam,

427
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,220
the Red Lips you drew looks so vivid.

428
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,090
What a graceful painting.

429
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,020
Third Young Mistress has also finished.

430
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,460
Let's all take a look at Bingyan's work.

431
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,770
Grandmother,

432
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,500
actually I'm not good at drawing.

433
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,090
It's okay.

434
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,460
These are just for fun.

435
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,610
Let mother have the first look.

436
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,420
Bingyan,

437
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,460
how did you draw

438
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,050
with this seal-like style?

439
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,460
Watch this now.

440
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,180
This style is so unique

441
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,900
and so special.

442
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,050
It's a whole new experience.

443
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,180
Great!

444
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,500
Let me have a closer look.

445
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:27,900
This...

446
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,530
Grandmother,

447
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,770
I'm a little hungry.

448
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,770
We spent too much time
on poems and drawing

449
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,610
and forgot to let her eat.

450
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,290
Okay.

451
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,570
What do you like to have?

452
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,700
I'll take you.

453
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,330
I'd like to have sweet-and-sour ribs

454
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,260
and braised pork.

455
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,130
No problem.

456
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,090
Sweet-and-sour ribs and braised pork.

457
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,940
Tell the kitchen to serve these.

458
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,260
Sheng'er, come on.

459
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,180
Careful, Grandmother.

460
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,290
Okay.

461
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,850
[Dear Father and Mother,]

462
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,020
[This is your daughter
hoping you well.]

463
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,810
[You would never have imagined]

464
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,220
[I was married wrongly
to General Yuan's mansion in Jingzhou.]

465
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,290
[Now I'm like living in prison.]

466
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,770
[Sincerely yours,
Bingyan]

467
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:03,020
[Sincerely yours]

468
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,220
Even if I didn't get
on the wrong bridal sedan,

469
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,850
being married to the Qi Residence
in Linzhou

470
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,370
to counteract bad luck for a dying man

471
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,460
is not much better than this.

472
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,810
I wonder what's going on with sister Yuhu.

473
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,850
Could she be like me?

474
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,810
Did she go to Linzhou

475
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,940
and end up in a fire pit?

476
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,940
Sister Yuhu,

477
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,500
how are you now?

478
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,420
[Dear Father and Mother, this is your daughter
hoping you well. You would never have imagined]

479
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,420
[I was married wrongly
to General Yuan's mansion in Jingzhou.]

480
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,420
[Now I'm like living in prison.]
[Sincerely yours, Bingyan]

481
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,500
This is so boring.

482
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,500
If I stay in here a bit longer,

483
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,130
my kung fu will get rusty.

484
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,460
Your Ladyship.

485
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,940
Your Ladyship.

486
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:49,810
Remember,

487
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,260
you're now Miss Du,

488
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,810
who's well-educated and quiet.

489
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,050
How can you use a sword?

490
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,740
I haven't practiced kung fu for so long.

491
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,900
My hands and feet itch.

492
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,570
You just can't, no matter how they itch.

493
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,420
What if you give yourself away?

494
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,330
Think about the consequences.

495
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,180
How careless.

496
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,980
Okay, I got it.

497
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,290
I won't practice again.

498
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,180
I'm not gonna do it. Let's go.

499
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,290
You're the miss, and I'm the maid.

500
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,050
Fine, I'll act like one.

501
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:27,980
Will this do?

502
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,420
That's more like it.

503
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,260
Let's sit over there.

504
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,290
[The maid doesn't look like
a proper maid.]

505
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,570
[The miss doesn't look
like a proper miss.]

506
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,740
[Interesting.]

507
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,290
Your Ladyship,

508
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,610
we've been at Linzhou for so long.

509
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,940
What do you think of this Qi Residence?

510
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:56,740
Strange.

511
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,980
Then what about Young Master Tianlei?

512
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,850
Also strange.

513
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,700
Then what about that mute miss?

514
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:06,940
Who is it?

515
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,810
Take a guess.

516
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,090
Is that Xiangyun?

517
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,020
Nope.

518
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,090
Aizhu?

519
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:12,980
Nope.

520
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:13,700
Baozhu?

521
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,570
Not even close.

522
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,770
I... I can't guess.

523
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,980
Miss Yansheng.

524
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,180
Thank you.

525
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,980
This Miss Yansheng is a good girl.

526
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,740
But what a shame.

527
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,850
She's mute.

528
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,290
Xiaoxi,

529
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,370
I think everyone in the Qi Residence

530
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,290
is weird.

531
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,570
The person in charge is Grandmother.

532
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,940
The only miss in the house is mute.

533
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,370
Crazy may she looks, she's kinda cute.

534
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,220
The only young master in the house

535
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,370
is seriously sick.

536
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,220
But this sickness of his is also weird.

537
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,130
He'd faint any moment.

538
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,660
You think he's about to die,

539
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,610
but a minute later,

540
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,610
he's all recovered.

541
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,940
And he's always smiling while talking.

542
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,810
I can't tell if he's telling the truth.

543
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,020
Your Ladyship,

544
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,610
you're such a straightforward person.

545
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,500
Third Misstress,

546
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,130
Third Young Master needs you urgently.

547
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,500
Urgently?

548
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,980
What's so urgent?

549
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,900
It is urgent,

550
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,370
and also not.

551
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,290
Just cut to the chase.

552
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,660
Here's the thing.

553
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,500
You've been at Qi Residence for some days.

554
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,420
According to customs,
we should send someone to Yangzhou

555
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,050
to let your family know you're safe

556
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,130
and to show some respect

557
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,370
to my parents-in-law.

558
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,610
What do you think?

559
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,090
Sure.

560
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,050
You arrange that.

561
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,940
I've prepared the gifts.

562
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,050
This is the list.

563
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,130
See if you wanna add something.

564
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,980
These will do.

565
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,050
Okay.

566
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:50,860
Also,

567
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,780
I've written this letter.

568
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,050
But I really don't know

569
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,690
your parents' names.

570
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,980
How do I spell them correctly?

571
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,610
So I'll trouble you

572
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,820
to write them personally.

573
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,380
I don't know.

574
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,380
Just write them, Your Ladyship..

575
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:23,940
Please.

576
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,570
Please.

577
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,090
Young Master,

578
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,050
back in Yangzhou,

579
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,170
when Her Ladyship is reading or writing,

580
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,210
she never needs anyone to serve her.

581
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,210
She

582
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,460
only likes me to be by her side.

583
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:06,940
Because

584
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,940
only Xiaoxi knows,

585
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,210
when Her Ladyship writes,

586
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,300
she needs to grind the ink
till it's so thick.

587
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,650
That's how the letters look good.

588
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,570
Don't you agree?

589
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,210
Her Ladyship

590
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,210
is known for her beautiful handwriting.

591
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,690
Right, Your Ladyship?

592
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,050
Xiaoxi,

593
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,380
you've said enough.

594
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,570
Just let her write it now.

595
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,570
Cut the crap. What should I write?

596
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,020
Your Ladyship,

597
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,730
this letter is the first one

598
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,050
you two write to Yangzhou, right?

599
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,130
In my opinion,

600
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,210
the envelope

601
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,420
should be written together by you two.

602
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:57,940
Your Ladyship,

603
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,130
please write Mr. Du Zhixiang.

604
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,170
Du Zhixang?

605
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:02,730
Young Master,

606
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,860
please write Madam Wang Guihua.

607
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,050
Which "Xiang"?

608
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,050
Wait a sec.

609
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,650
The husband should write the lord's name,

610
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,210
and the wife write the madam's name.

611
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,460
Your Ladyship,

612
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,900
please write "Madam Wang Guihua".

613
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,020
Wang Guihua.

614
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:29,690
Young Master,

615
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,170
please write "Mr. Du Zhixiang".

616
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,250
Okay, Xiaoxi, I got it.

617
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,770
How can we write a letter like this?

618
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,940
I'll do it myself.

619
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,090
Wrong.

620
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,610
It's wrong.

621
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,540
[To Wang Guihua and Du Ziyang]

622
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,770
Du Ziyang?

623
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,980
Misspelled two out of three characters.

624
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,060
Young Master,

625
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,060
need me for anything?

626
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,940
I'm calling you here today

627
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,420
not for anything major.

628
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,060
I just discover how clever you are

629
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,690
when you were grinding ink just now.

630
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,250
You're no common maid.

631
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,540
I'd like you to serve in the study.

632
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,020
Back in Yangzhou,

633
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,610
I served mostly in the study.

634
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,090
You can read?

635
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:56,940
I can.

636
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:57,940
Miss taught you?

637
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,460
Yes.

638
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,500
Then can you write?

639
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,420
I can.

640
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,380
Miss taught you?

641
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,090
Yes.

642
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,090
Okay.

643
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,770
Then I'm gonna test you.

644
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,900
Since you're a maid from Yangzhou,

645
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,060
recite a Yangzhou ballad for me.

646
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,090
Ballads are our local specialty.

647
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,500
A grass falls and breaks a wok.

648
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,650
I see my donkey lay eggs at home.

649
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,130
I see a horse making a nest outside.

650
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,690
What the hell is this?

651
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,020
This is a ballad of Yangzhou.

652
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,650
It's called The Big Liar.

653
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,460
The Big Liar?

654
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,770
You've got a big liar in Yangzhou, huh?

655
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,460
Xiaoxi,

656
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,500
I think you are that big liar.

657
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,090
How...

658
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,900
How can I be the big liar?

659
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,460
Of course, you are.

660
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,650
You said your Miss taught you this

661
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,210
and taught you that.

662
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,940
But your Miss's handwriting is so poor.

663
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,250
Tell me what exactly is going on.

664
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,170
Yes,

665
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,090
Young Master.

666
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,210
That's because

667
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,500
when Her Ladyship went out the other day,

668
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,060
her hand was pinched by the door.

669
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,820
That's why

670
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,060
when she was writing this,

671
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,900
her hand was shaking.

672
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,420
Stop!

673
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,570
You're clever.

674
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,770
While you're grinding ink, you told her

675
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,500
that her father is called Du Zhixiang

676
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,770
and her mother is called Wang Guihua.

677
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,730
But she somehow wouldn't accept the favor.

678
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,770
She wrote two characters wrong
out of three.

679
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,130
Is there really a daughter in this world

680
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,860
who doesn't even know her parents' names?

681
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,130
She wrote wrong even after you told her!

682
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,380
When she took a stick as a sword

683
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,940
and tried to practice it in the garden,

684
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,650
you tried to stop her

685
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,690
and taught her to walk like a lady.

686
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:47,060
You didn't know I was watching, did you?

687
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,650
How dare you

688
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,380
pretend to be Mr. Du's family?

689
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:53,770
Young Master,

690
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,420
I wasn't pretending.

691
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,610
I am from the Du family.

692
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,770
Miss Du isn't the daughter of the Dus.

693
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,380
I mean

694
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,420
Miss Li isn't.

695
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,610
Tell me the truth.

696
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,130
The truth.

697
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,250
The truth is like this.

698
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,250
[That day,]

699
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,250
[the Du family and the Li family in Yangzhou
married off their daughters on the same day.]

700
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,900
[Somehow]

701
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,380
[the two bridal processions
merged into one.]

702
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,980
[What's more bizarre is]

703
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,940
[it started to rain heavily]

704
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,250
[right after we passed the city gate.]

705
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,090
[The two bridal processions]

706
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,940
[entered the Fairy Temple in the suburbs
to take shelter from the rain.]

707
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:30,770
Miss,

708
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,900
it's raining cats and dogs outside.

709
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,250
Let's wait it out here, okay?

710
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,060
Miss, let's go.

711
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,020
Bandits are coming.

712
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,820
That's how Miss Li was sent to Linzhou

713
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,130
by getting on the wrong bridal sedan.

714
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,250
She refused to come initially.

715
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,250
But we told her

716
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,770
that she and Miss Bingyan were both poor girls.

717
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,690
Being a straightforward girl,

718
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,020
Miss Li couldn't bear Miss Du suffering.

719
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,570
That's why she agreed

720
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:04,770
to be the fake Third Young Mistress here

721
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,380
to do Miss Du a solid.

722
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,650
Young Master,

723
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,460
Miss Li is a heroic good girl.

724
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,770
I beg you.

725
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,860
Please don't blame it on her.

726
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,730
Get up.

727
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,060
Yes, Young Master.

728
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,020
About what you said just now,

729
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,460
except for me,

730
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,020
you mustn't tell anyone.

731
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:42,900
From now on,

732
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,060
speak less and work more.

733
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,540
Do be cautious.

734
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,250
Don't give yourselves away.

735
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,460
Yes.

736
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,500
Yes, Young Master.

737
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,020
Also,

738
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,500
don't mention this conversation
to your Miss.

739
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,090
If you dare reveal a tiny bit,

740
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,980
you'll be severely punished.

741
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:03,770
Keep these in mind, will you?

742
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,250
I will.
