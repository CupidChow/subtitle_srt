[Episode 15]

19
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,840
Old Madam,

20
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,280
I see

21
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,590
that Third Young Mistress

22
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,710
and Miss Xiubo like each other.

23
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,870
They're having so much fun all day long.

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,790
Miss Xiubo has a gentle character.

25
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,200
Me and Xiubo's grandmother
are like sisters.

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,560
I watched her grow up.

27
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,470
She's like my own granddaughter.

28
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,150
Miss Xiubo is so poor.

29
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,030
She's all alone.

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,630
Every time I passed the courtyard,

31
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,870
I saw her
missing her grandmother in tears.

32
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,190
Luckily she has you to back her up.

33
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,910
I heard Miss Xiubo and her nanny say

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,470
she's gonna treat you as her grandmother.

35
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,310
Xiubo is indeed a good child.

36
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,000
In my opinion,

37
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,840
you should let her stay in the house.

38
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,190
She could keep you company.

39
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,560
That's what I had in mind, too.

40
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,030
Old Madam,

41
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,840
I cooked tonic for you.

42
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,190
Look who's here?

43
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,120
She has come

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,630
as we were speaking of her.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,680
Come here.

46
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,520
Let's go have tea.

47
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,240
Old Madam,

48
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,400
have a taste.

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,750
This is the tonic
I specially picked for you.

50
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,710
Premium cubilose

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,360
is one of the best tonics.

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,520
I've added sunflower honey in it.

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,150
Really?

54
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,190
Okay. Let me have a taste.

55
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,590
Come on, sit down.

56
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,800
Sit.

57
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,710
Not bad.

58
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,240
Xiubo, you're kind in mind
and skillful in hand.

59
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,870
I'm an orphan.

60
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,080
I'd be satisfied to be able to

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
serve you for life.

62
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,080
What are you talking about?

63
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,980
You're such a good girl.

64
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,890
How can you

65
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,450
be stuck with an old woman for life?

66
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,730
You gotta marry someone and have kids.

67
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,210
I'm a miserable one.

68
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,930
After my grandmother died,
I had no one to rely on.

69
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,330
Thankfully you favored me.

70
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,770
I admire Bingyan,

71
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,890
who can be loved by Tianlei.

72
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,410
And they can spend a lifetime together.

73
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,020
Don't worry.

74
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,450
I watched you grow up.

75
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,970
When that time comes,

76
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,330
I shall find you a fine man.

77
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,820
You won't be mistreated.

78
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,450
Thank you, Old Madam.

79
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,530
If...

80
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,060
If one day

81
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,410
I have someone whom I'd like to marry,

82
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,940
would you support my decision?

83
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,890
I watched you grow up.

84
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,500
You're like my own granddaughter.

85
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,500
When that time comes,

86
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,530
I'll definitely support you

87
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,700
and won't let you suffer.

88
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,090
Thank you, Old Madam.

89
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,850
I just want to be by your side.

90
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,140
Good.

91
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,700
What a good girl.

92
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,700
Thank you, Grandmother.

93
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,380
Didn't you say

94
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,770
you took me as your own granddaughter?

95
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,970
Then I called you Grandmother.

96
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,330
Grandmother.

97
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,330
Next month will be your birthday.

98
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,060
I'd like to draw with Tianlei

99
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,180
a Longevity Calligraphy for you.

100
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,620
Would you permit that?

101
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,180
Of course, I would.

102
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,020
Our Xiubo

103
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,450
is such a caring kid.

104
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,410
Be careful.

105
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,290
These are all expensive objects.

106
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,210
If you break any of them,

107
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,580
watch how I'll punish you.

108
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,410
Nanny, go watch them.

109
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,210
Yes.

110
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,140
Slowly. Careful.

111
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,500
Thank you for your work.

112
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,940
Miss Xiubo,

113
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,210
these are all rewards from Old Madam.

114
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,580
Old Madam said,

115
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,740
if you need anything,

116
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,770
we'll satisfy you as if you're
a daughter of the Qis.

117
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,020
Old Madam really loves you.

118
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,290
Xiaoqiao,

119
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,970
please thank Old Madam for me.

120
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,500
Xiubo.

121
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,410
Cousin Ke.

122
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,620
Congrats to you.

123
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,410
You're so lucky.

124
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,330
This side courtyard

125
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,140
is specially left for you.

126
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,620
You can see how Old Madam adores you.

127
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,330
I'll still need your support, Cousin Ke.

128
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,290
Xiubo,

129
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,090
Those on the waterfront
are the first to see the rising moon.

130
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,450
But whether you can get the moon

131
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,290
will depend on your actions.

132
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,770
I've asked permission from Old Madam

133
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,020
to invite Tianlei a few days later

134
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,580
to draw a Longevity Calligraphy with him.

135
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,700
You're an innocent girl.

136
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,740
To win a man's heart,

137
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,140
you gotta let him think of you
all the time.

138
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,580
Nobody else must be in his mind.

139
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,380
Xiubo,

140
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,650
control your lover's mind

141
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,180
and make your rival jealous.

142
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:12,770
You must

143
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,500
remember this tactic.

144
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,290
This thing is so interesting.

145
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,450
I've been solving it for an hour.

146
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,290
But I haven't cracked it yet.

147
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,260
Your Ladyship,

148
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,850
you're still playing

149
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,410
the ring puzzle even now?

150
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,140
That Miss Xiubo

151
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,140
has moved into our courtyard.

152
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,530
So what if she has?

153
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,580
It's a big yard.

154
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,330
There's gonna be more fun with her here.

155
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,090
Stop being so simple-minded, Your Ladyship.

156
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,970
Is this the end of the world?

157
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,330
Everything's fine.

158
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,530
You're not letting me play.

159
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,820
You're not letting me eat.

160
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,530
What do you have to say to me?

161
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,820
Old Madam settled Miss Xiubo

162
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,770
according to the standard
of a Qi's daughter.

163
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,020
She now has a courtyard of

164
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,020
maids and footboys.

165
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,650
Even more than ours.

166
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,530
And I think it's something serious.

167
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,580
If she likes to have more people,

168
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,500
just let her have them.

169
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,890
I just need you.

170
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,500
But,

171
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,380
I see that Miss Xiubo

172
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,530
has feelings for

173
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,970
our Third Young Master.

174
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,210
No, you can't underestimate her.

175
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,770
Besides, the two of them

176
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,170
have known each other since young.

177
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,500
They are literally childhood sweethearts.

178
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,930
They told me

179
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,860
that they were just childhood friends.

180
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,500
Who doesn't have

181
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,290
several good friends when little?

182
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,290
-But...
-I used to

183
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,890
play together with my sect brothers.

184
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,290
Your Ladyship,

185
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,050
that Miss Xiubo

186
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,410
has now become a proper beauty.

187
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,650
She's no longer a childhood playmate.

188
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,170
Besides,

189
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,860
the gold Kylin
she gave Third Young Master

190
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,290
obviously comes in pairs.

191
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,810
Where's Tianlei?

192
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,810
Miss Xiubo just sent someone

193
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,220
to invite

194
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,380
Third Young Master to draw in her place.

195
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,100
Draw?

196
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,980
Remember when we were young,

197
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,500
you taught me

198
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,860
every character hand by hand.

199
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,140
In a way,

200
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,500
Tianlei is my teacher.

201
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,380
Oh, yeah?

202
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,340
How come I don't remember?

203
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,690
But everything about you,

204
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,740
each and every one of them,

205
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,020
I've kept well in my mind.

206
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,460
When I was little,

207
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,890
I admired how good your calligraphy was.

208
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,380
So smooth and so grand.

209
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,860
Three years later,

210
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,690
your calligraphy
must have got even better.

211
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,500
Would you please

212
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,890
write a few characters for me?

213
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,620
Sure.

214
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,380
Allow me.

215
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,740
[Highest]

216
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:07,180
[Aim for the Highest]

217
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,740
Your writing is so beautiful.

218
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,380
Only a righteous man

219
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,860
can write such a

220
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,170
natural piece of work.

221
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,460
You flatter me.

222
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,260
What style of calligraphy is yours?

223
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,500
The Liu style.

224
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,460
Please forgive my poor writing.

225
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,930
I'd be happy
if you could say a few remarks

226
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,260
for your stupid student.

227
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,140
Okay.

228
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,260
So this is where

229
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,050
Xiubo lived as a child.

230
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,500
Let's go, Xiaoxi.

231
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,380
See what painting they're drawing.

232
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,260
It's good weather outside.

233
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,020
Opening the doors

234
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,740
and letting the fresh air in

235
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,380
will make your writing better.

236
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,530
Please leave us.

237
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,570
Don't let anyone

238
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,460
disturb me and Tianlei.

239
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,050
Yes.

240
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,140
[You]

241
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,780
[Plum]

242
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,650
You came on the bamboo horse,

243
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,740
playing green plum catch around the bed.

244
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,420
[You came on the bamboo horse,
playing green plum catch around the bed.]

245
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,380
Tianlei,

246
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,620
the writer of this poem

247
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,620
must be a romantic one.

248
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,290
Look how passionate

249
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,930
every character is.

250
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,620
Isn't this talking about me and you?

251
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,380
Your Ladyship, look at how

252
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,170
they're reciting poems.

253
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,980
How can Third Young Master do this?

254
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,170
He said he liked your martial arts

255
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,170
and wouldn't mind
your scholarly attainments.

256
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,340
Now he's drawing paintings

257
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,380
with Miss Xiubo here.

258
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,220
What's the panic?

259
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,460
I'm Qi Tianlei's

260
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,020
legal wife.

261
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,050
Dear.

262
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,810
Good day, Sister-in-law.

263
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,020
Good day, Sister.

264
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,860
What were you writing?

265
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,570
Tianlei?

266
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,770
Well...

267
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,340
You came on the bamboo horse,

268
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,930
playing green plum catch around the bed.

269
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,050
What does this mean?

270
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
This is about how a little boy

271
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,170
uses bamboo as his pony

272
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,380
to amuse a little girl.

273
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,530
Please don't overthink, Sister-in-law.

274
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,410
I just thought

275
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,650
that I grew up with Tianlei.

276
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,050
So I wrote this.

277
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,530
It's fine.

278
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,980
I knew you two grew up together.

279
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,860
As childhood sweethearts,

280
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,100
you were quite close.

281
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,260
Dear,

282
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,380
you can't say it like this.

283
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,140
Although we grew up together,

284
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,890
I've always taken Xiubo

285
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,380
as my own younger sister.

286
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,690
Tianlei is right.

287
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,770
There's nothing between us.

288
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,890
I didn't say anything.

289
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,220
Tianlei,

290
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,810
I know that young masters in big families

291
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,100
often have several wives.

292
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,620
If you like Xiubo so much,

293
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,140
just marry her.

294
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,930
I wouldn't dare, dear.

295
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,220
I've promised you

296
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,650
to stay married to you only.

297
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,050
Xiaoxi.

298
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,690
Xiubo,

299
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,500
these are pastries from my little kitchen.

300
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,220
They are quite delicious.

301
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,500
You can't have these outside.

302
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,100
Now I've delivered the pastries.

303
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,050
I'm gonna leave now.

304
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,980
I'll leave you two alone.

305
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,690
Dear.

306
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:53,930
Xiubo,

307
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,220
the longevity rubbings in this book

308
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,650
don't seem to be enough
for the Longevity Calligraphy.

309
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,930
I'll find more in my study.

310
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,410
When I finish my half,

311
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,340
I'll send it to you.

312
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,620
I'll take my leave now. Excuse me.

313
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,900
♪The swallow returns and settles
in the west of the hall♪

314
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,650
Tianlei.

315
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,740
♪The second sigh laments about the past♪

316
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,620
Your Ladyship.

317
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,890
I thought Du Bingyan

318
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,100
would be jealous and sad

319
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,410
after seeing Tianlei and me

320
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,020
spending time together.

321
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,340
I didn't expect
that she just walked right in.

322
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,650
And she forced Tianlei

323
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,810
to vow like that.

324
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,810
This Third Young Mistress

325
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,260
is quite something else.

326
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,170
No hurry.

327
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,930
Tianlei hasn't grown fond of me yet.

328
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,340
I can't push this thing.

329
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,740
Things will get tricky

330
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,380
if we get on bad terms.

331
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,340
This thing will take

332
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,100
a lot of time and effort.

333
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,020
Why are you so mad now?

334
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,810
Weren't you quite generous just now?

335
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,260
Who said I was generous?

336
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,810
I'm the meanest one in the world.

337
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,220
Qi Tianlei, be warned.

338
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,290
If you like

339
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,700
that pretty girl who's already ready to cry.

340
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,130
Tell me in advance.

341
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,740
I promise

342
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,420
I'll go back to Yangzhou right away.

343
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,330
Yeah, together with Xiaoxi.

344
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,530
Let's go back to Yangzhou.

345
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,130
You...

346
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,940
Isn't she a childhood sweetheart?

347
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,090
Like I don't have one.

348
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,420
The sect brothers who grew up with me

349
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,330
in the Martial Arts Center

350
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,020
are all my childhood sweethearts.

351
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,660
Their tempers and hobbies

352
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,420
are similar to mine.

353
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,570
And all they like is martial arts

354
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,980
instead of your crappy books.

355
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,420
Speaking of which,

356
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,770
they might be a better choice for me.

357
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,050
Xiaoxi,

358
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,810
let's go back to Yangzhou tomorrow

359
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,130
and marry me to one of my sect brothers.

360
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,420
Your Ladyship are right.

361
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,810
I support you.

362
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,770
Let's find a childhood sweetheart too,

363
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,420
and get married happily.

364
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,290
I'm still alive and kicking.

365
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,810
How can you marry someone else?

366
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:13,940
I won't allow it.

367
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,330
You

368
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,500
just go find your sweet Xiubo.

369
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,740
Stop minding my business.

370
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,220
Let's put everything else aside.

371
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,050
Where did you get

372
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,420
the so-called childhood sect brothers?

373
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,530
Why haven't I heard of any?

374
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,810
I've got plenty of

375
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,700
childhood sect brothers.

376
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Why should I tell you?

377
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,810
What are they called,
and where do they live?

378
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,050
Are you still in touch with them?

379
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,050
None of your business.

380
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,020
Yeah.

381
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,020
You only have one Miss Xiubo.

382
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,500
But Her Ladyship

383
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,980
has a full house of

384
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,050
sect brothers.

385
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,980
You'd better comfort Her Ladyship now.

386
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,530
Otherwise,

387
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,700
she'd really pack her things

388
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,130
and go back to Yangzhou
to marry someone else.

389
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,570
Yes, you're right.

390
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,660
My wife

391
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,810
is as beautiful as a fairy.

392
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,700
I must have hit the jackpot

393
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,940
to have married my wife

394
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,530
among all those people in Yangzhou.

395
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:17,900
Dear,

396
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,460
just stop being mad, okay?

397
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,220
Save your pretty talk.

398
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,290
I won't buy it.

399
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,500
How can you not be mad, then?

400
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,740
Be it stars in the sky
or pearls in the sea,

401
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,810
as long as you want one,

402
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,740
I'll get it for you

403
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,810
as my apology.

404
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,810
When I walked past the courtyard,

405
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,570
I saw a green plum tree

406
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,500
with a few green plums on it.

407
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,260
I wanna drink green plum wine.

408
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,050
No problem.

409
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,570
I'll go pick all the green plums

410
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,460
right now

411
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,050
for you to enjoy alone.

412
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,180
Dear,

413
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,330
Over there.

414
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,290
This one?

415
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,570
Forget it.

416
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,940
That one.

417
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,530
This one is easier.

418
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,660
This one.

419
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,330
This is it.

420
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:20,900
Okay.

421
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,020
Are you ready?

422
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,770
I'm ready.

423
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,940
Catch.

424
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,810
One more.

425
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:34,940
This one.

426
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,020
Okay.

427
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:51,980
I caught it.

428
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,050
Okay.

429
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,090
Come on, Xiaoxi.

430
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,700
These aren't enough to brew wine.

431
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,050
This season is too late
for plums to be ripe.

432
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,330
These are all that's left.

433
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,570
Besides,

434
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,130
this tree was planted by me personally.

435
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,180
It doesn't yield too much every year.

436
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,180
If you like,

437
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,900
I'll save them all for you to make wine.

438
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,570
This is too sour.

439
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,500
Little glutton.

440
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,740
This is your little punishment.

441
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,460
Xiaoxi,

442
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,570
please clean and dry

443
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,460
all these plums.

444
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,810
Remember,

445
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,530
these are for Third Young Mistress.

446
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,700
Nobody else is allowed to touch them.

447
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,900
I'm gonna make wine personally
for my wife.

448
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,810
Thank you, honey.

449
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,900
Don't worry, Third Young Master.

450
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,570
I'm gonna watch them myself.

451
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,740
No one is gonna be missing.

452
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,460
Let's go.

453
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,290
Yummy, huh?

454
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,330
It does taste sour.

455
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,050
That tree

456
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,420
was planted by Tianlei when he was young.

457
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,460
Every year since then,

458
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,740
he earthed up and applied fertilizer for it
with me by his side.

459
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,980
When the plums were ripe,
and I asked for some from him,

460
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,420
he'd give me all of them.

461
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,020
[Why?]

462
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,850
[Why is this Du Bingyan]

463
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,500
[having my Tianlei all to herself?]

464
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,530
[He's obviously mine.]

465
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,810
[He's mine.]

466
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,130
I'm telling you.

467
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,180
The water
from the backyard well is too cold.

468
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:40,980
I simply

469
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,700
washed a piece of clothes
for Miss Yansheng.

470
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,460
But look at my hands.

471
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,420
They're all red from the coldness.

472
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,530
Go apply some ointment now.

473
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,570
That well water is cold all year round.

474
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:47,980
Go now.

475
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,900
-Go.
-Okay.

476
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,260
[If I get sick,]

477
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,660
[Tianlei will definitely care about me.]

478
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,500
Your Ladyship.

479
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,460
Your Ladyship.

480
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,420
You can't do this!

481
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,740
You've been physically weak since little.

482
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,700
How can you withstand this cold water?

483
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,500
Nanny,

484
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,180
it's good that you're here.

485
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,770
Come help me.

486
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,940
I wanna get sick.

487
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,570
So Tianlei will pity me

488
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,700
and come to see me.

489
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,220
Why bother, Your Ladyship?

490
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,460
Nanny,

491
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,500
do it now.

492
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,290
Again.

493
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,610
Seems like Miss Xiubo.

494
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,530
But it's the middle of the night.

495
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,290
Maybe I was seeing things.

496
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,700
Bad news!

497
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,740
Someone, please help!

498
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,530
Bad news!

499
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,180
-What's going on?
-What's going on?

500
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,330
Her Ladyship is having a fever.

501
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,370
Go fetch the doctor now.

502
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,020
Now!

503
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,020
Yeah, you guys go now.

504
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,420
Go!

505
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,500
I'll go notice Old Madam.

506
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,090
What should we do now?

507
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,850
Her Ladyship is having a fever.

508
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,020
What?

509
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,980
Xiubo is sick?

510
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,220
What did the doctor say?

511
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,900
Did he prescribe something?

512
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,260
Don't worry.

513
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,740
We've fetched the doctor,

514
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,330
and he has prescribed the drugs.

515
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,980
It's just that...

516
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,740
Just what?

517
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,220
Come on. Tell me now.

518
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,090
It's just that Xiubo has a fever suddenly,

519
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,740
and she can't eat anything.

520
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,900
The doctor said

521
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,260
that by any means,

522
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,420
we should let her eat something.

523
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,460
If she only takes the medicine,

524
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,810
her stomach may be damaged.

525
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,260
By then,

526
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,810
in addition to the fever,

527
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,370
she might get another illness.

528
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,020
Then let's

529
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,850
cook some gruel

530
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,900
or some wonton.

531
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,180
We tried those.

532
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,020
She couldn't eat anything.

533
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,900
Let's go check on her.

534
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,900
Old Madam,

535
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,260
Her Ladyship is having a fever.

536
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,570
You'd better not go visit her.

537
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,900
If you get infected,

538
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,370
Her Ladyship will blame me for telling you this.

539
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,420
Besides,

540
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,090
Third Young Master
and Third Young Mistress

541
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,740
are looking after her now.

542
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,610
They both have gone there?

543
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,290
That's right.

544
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,610
Then I'm relieved.

545
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,460
Xiaoqiao,

546
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,660
go take a look over there.

547
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,570
Tell Tianlei

548
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,050
to look after her carefully.

549
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,460
Tell him I said that.

550
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,260
Old Madam, please be assured.

551
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,130
I'm on my way now.

552
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,330
Go now.

553
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,740
Old Madam,

554
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:09,940
don't worry.

555
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,610
Tianlei...

556
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,260
She's awake.

557
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,810
Let's hear what Miss Xiubo says.

558
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,770
Tianlei.

559
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,290
Tianlei.

560
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,220
Third Young Master,

561
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,090
Her Ladyship is calling your name.

562
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,770
She's been calling your name for a night.

563
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,130
Xiubo.

564
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,370
Don't... Don't abandon me.

565
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,530
Tianlei.

566
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,180
Why

567
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,050
are you all here?

568
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,020
I was dreaming just now.

569
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,180
I dreamed about the days

570
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,260
when I was young,

571
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,050
and Tianlei was playing with me.

572
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,130
Your Ladyship,

573
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,940
you were having a fever all this time.

574
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,050
We were so scared.

575
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,810
Now thank goodness

576
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,610
you've come to yourself.

577
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,050
I've made you and Sister-in-law worried.

578
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,530
This isn't your fault.

579
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,260
It must be your maids

580
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,130
who didn't do their job well.

581
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,370
That's why you got sick.

582
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,420
That's not true, Sister-in-law.

583
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,940
They've taken care of me pretty well.

584
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,420
It's because
I was physically weak since little.

585
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,740
I'm afraid the climate doesn't suit me

586
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,460
when I come to Linzhou all of a sudden.

587
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,700
I'll be fine
after resting for a couple of days.

588
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,330
I remember

589
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,130
when Your Ladyship first came to Linzhou,

590
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,130
she got sick exactly like this.

591
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,570
I'm fine.

592
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,770
Tianlei and Sister-in-law,
thank you for caring.

593
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,260
Still claiming to be fine.

594
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,180
From last night to now,

595
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,180
you haven't eaten anything.

596
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,900
Nanny,

597
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,290
don't tell them that.

598
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,420
Here it comes.

599
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,740
The kitchen made vegetable wonton.

600
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,460
Allow me.

601
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,370
Your Ladyship, let me feed it to you.

602
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,770
Your Ladyship...

603
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,660
Third Young Master,

604
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,130
she felt sick before she started eating.

605
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,420
What should we do?

606
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,290
I'm fine.

607
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,610
I just have no appetite.

608
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,460
What do you feel like eating?

609
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,770
I'll tell the kitchen to cook for you.

610
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,980
I'd like to eat

611
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,020
salted and dried green plums

612
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,900
you made for me when we were little.

613
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,260
Whenever I felt sick somewhere,

614
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,420
Tianlei would make those for me.

615
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,220
Third Young Master,

616
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,770
just now, the Old Madam said

617
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,770
that you must take good care of Miss Xiubo.

618
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,420
I remember

619
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,460
that there's a green plum tree
in the back, right?

620
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,740
Go tell someone to pick the plums

621
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,050
and make the salted and dried plums for her.

622
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,740
Now it's already passed the plum-picking season.

623
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,220
Besides, there're no green plums on that tree.

624
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:42,940
None?

625
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,770
When I walked by it a few days ago,

626
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,090
I saw some still hanging on it.

627
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,260
They've all been picked by me.

628
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,050
I did that.

629
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,810
I wanted to have green plum wine.

630
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,330
So I picked all of them.

631
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:57,980
But,

632
00:30:59,130 --> 00:30:59,770
Tianlei,

633
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,740
since she's so sick now,

634
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,020
why don't you take them out

635
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,090
and make them into salted and dried plums

636
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,420
to appetize her?

637
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,500
It won't do if she

638
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:08,660
can't eat anything.

639
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,810
I'm sorry, Sister-in-law.

640
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,090
Now you can't have green plum wine.

641
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,740
It's okay.

642
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,370
It's all my fault.

643
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,500
Sorry to trouble you with it, Tianlei.

644
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,180
No problem.

645
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,220
Making these requires too many steps.

646
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,460
That's why it's a little late.

647
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,260
It's truly the work of Tianlei.

648
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,980
Just by smelling it,

649
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,810
my mouth is starting to water.

650
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,460
Third Young Master is really impressive.

651
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,570
He makes you feel like eating.

652
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,460
Come on, eat some to appetize yourself.

653
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,260
Tianlei really cares for me.

654
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,090
I've got something else to do. Excuse me.

655
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,530
Your Ladyship,

656
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,130
please eat something.

657
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,850
This whole day,

658
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,900
you've been taking care of Miss Xiubo.

659
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,610
You barely had anything.

660
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,610
I don't feel like eating.

661
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,020
It's all Third Young Master's fault.

662
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,980
He promised to use those plums

663
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,850
to make wine for Your Ladyship.

664
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,330
And he said nobody else
was allowed to touch them.

665
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,180
Turns out,

666
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,700
once Miss Xiubo got sick,

667
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,900
he forgot all of it.

668
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,500
You can't blame it all on him.

669
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,770
Who wouldn't feel sorry for Xiubo

670
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,220
after seeing how poor she is?

671
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,660
Xiaoxi,

672
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,770
I felt something strange.

673
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,050
But I can't tell where exactly.

674
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,020
Where exactly?

675
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,660
Dear, you're indeed keen.

676
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,810
This is absolutely a strange thing.

677
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,460
Why are you here?

678
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,130
Why aren't you keeping Xiubo company?

679
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,370
She's unwell.

680
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,050
She's calling your name
even when she's sick.

681
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,850
She was confused

682
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,050
due to the fever, wasn't she?

683
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,530
Qi Tianlei,

684
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,610
it's easy for you to say.

685
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,850
But haven't you held her hand enough?

686
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,460
Holding her hand...

687
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,130
I shouldn't have done that.

688
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,420
Dear.

689
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,530
Don't touch me.

690
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,180
Dear,

691
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,570
are you asking me to chop off my hand

692
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,300
simply because it was touched by others?

693
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,050
Once you touched Xiubo's hand,

694
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,210
you must not touch mine.

695
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,250
Xiaoxi,

696
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,570
go talk to Miss Yuhu.

697
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,210
Her Ladyship is right.

698
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,570
The hand touched by another woman

699
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,730
should be chopped off.

700
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,940
You can say that again!

701
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,570
The two of you are actually

702
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,420
such jealous women!

703
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,050
Yeah, I'm a jealous type.

704
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:37,820
If you don't like it,

705
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,050
go find your Xiubo.

706
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:44,980
Why are you laughing?

707
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,570
I laughed
because my wife was jealous for me.

708
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,170
I certainly feel happy.

709
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,860
Stop complimenting yourself.

710
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,020
I was not jealous.

711
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,860
Alright.

712
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,050
You were not jealous.

713
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,570
You were just angry

714
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,210
that your husband was missed by others.

715
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:58,820
Correct.

716
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,340
I was just angry

717
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,570
that someone was trying to take my things.

718
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,570
Then you shouldn't be angry now.

719
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,820
I am yours.

720
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,420
The green plum wine

721
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,380
is also yours, dear.

722
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,340
Nobody

723
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,570
is going to take them from you.

724
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,900
It's really green plum wine.

725
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,780
Where did you get the green plums?

726
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,500
In order to save the few green plums of yours,

727
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,210
I sent someone

728
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,050
to search half of Linzhou.

729
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,780
I've tried so hard,

730
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,050
but you're actually letting me cut off my hand.

731
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,820
How heartbroken I am!

732
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,460
Fine.

733
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,570
I wronged you.

734
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,050
I've promised you

735
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,780
that nobody else can touch those plums.

736
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,570
How can I go back on my promise?

737
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,820
Good. I'll give you that.

738
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:06,980
By the way,

739
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,210
you said that something was strange.

740
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,460
Did you find anything?

741
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,570
Xiubo got sick

742
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,300
in a really strange way.

743
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,170
I felt that too.

744
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,300
Everything was perfectly fine.

745
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,020
How come she suddenly got sick?

746
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,570
She called my name in her dreams.

747
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,530
She pulled my hand.

748
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,050
These all looked deliberate.

749
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,570
Are you saying that she's faking it?

750
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,020
The fever is real.

751
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,820
But the scene

752
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,530
really looks somewhat fake.

753
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,690
Your Ladyship,

754
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,460
what are you doing?

755
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,050
I remembered.

756
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,570
Last night,

757
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,570
when I was collecting plums
in the backyard,

758
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,300
I saw two people arguing by the well.

759
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,300
And I heard splashes.

760
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,340
One of them looked like Miss Xiubo.

761
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,570
I saw

762
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,090
her fetching water from the well

763
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,050
and pouring it.

764
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,530
That means...

765
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,050
In order to get sick,

766
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,500
she poured cold water onto herself?

767
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,940
That's pretty much it.

768
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,860
This is too...

769
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,050
But Xiubo is an innocent girl.

770
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,050
Why would she sow discord
between you and me

771
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,570
at the cost of her own health?

772
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,730
Maybe

773
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,340
she's really into you?

774
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,820
Dear,

775
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,460
stop making fun of me.

776
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,460
A leopard can not change its spots.

777
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,020
Even if a woman really loves a man,

778
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,690
with Xiubo's personality,

779
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,050
she would never go this far.

780
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,820
Someone's inciting her.

781
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,570
You're so lucky.

782
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,570
This side courtyard

783
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,300
is specially left for you.

784
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,780
You can see how Grandmother adores you.

785
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,210
I remembered.

786
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,380
That day when Miss Xiubo moved in.

787
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,210
Young Master Ke also came
to congratulate her.

788
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,380
They told the servants to leave

789
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,210
and chatted for quite a while.

790
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,690
As expected.

791
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,250
It's Ke Shizhao again.

792
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,570
Ke Shizhao.

793
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,530
It's him again.

794
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,860
Trying to break me up with my husband.

795
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,170
Taking advantage
of Xiubo's feelings for you.

796
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,460
I won't go easy on him!

797
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,380
Dear, there's no hurry.

798
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,860
This thing involves Xiubo.

799
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,500
We must take time to come up with a plan.

800
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,900
Xiubo is also a romantic type.

801
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,690
If Ke Shizhao utilizes her again,

802
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,380
I don't know what would happen.

803
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,380
Then let's

804
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,460
help Xiubo to wipe clean her eyes

805
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,170
and see how evil Ke Shizhao really is.

806
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,900
What plan do you have?

807
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,690
Aren't they trying to break us up?

808
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,420
Then let's just

809
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,380
put on a good show for them.

810
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,340
Understood.

811
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,340
It's a counterplot.

812
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,940
We'll make Ke Shizhao think

813
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,570
that his evil plan has worked.

814
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,380
So he's gonna let his guard down

815
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,780
and give away his real character.

816
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,170
You little vixen!

817
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,300
[Why have you been so jealous?]

818
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,780
[I'm the third son of the Qi family.]

819
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,460
So what if I have three or four wives

820
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,380
and a handful of maids?

821
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,980
[You heartless man!]

822
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,940
I've married into your family
from so far away,

823
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,300
and this is what you do to me!

824
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,380
You want me to compete
with those lowly ones?

825
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,780
I shouldn't have come if I knew this!

826
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,210
I'd let you die of sickness!

827
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,250
[Take a look at you from top to bottom.]

828
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,500
[Which one spot matches me?]

829
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,050
[I wanna marry a fairy-like young lady.]

830
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,730
[She will have smooth hair
and charming eyes.]

831
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,860
In your dreams!

832
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,860
Which good girl would love you?

833
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,170
[You're an invalid at first glance.]

834
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,570
You're as bad-tempered as a lion!

835
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,050
You're as eccentric as a monkey!

836
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,860
[You look ugly!]

837
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,210
[You're shameless!]

838
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,780
[I can't take this anymore!]

839
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,570
I'm leaving!

840
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,570
Exactly what I wanted!

841
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,530
I can finally have peace!

842
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,380
You should thank me

843
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,300
for saving your life!

844
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,420
[What are you doing?]

845
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,210
I'm not gonna be civil
if you keep talking!

846
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,780
What are you gonna do to me?

847
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,570
How dare you get physical with me?

848
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:29,500
Why wouldn't I dare?
