if you can grow into a tree

162
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,700

163
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,060
I can.

164
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,530

without coming out.

168
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,020
Apart from this,

169
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,260
you'll have to plant

170
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,380
fifty fruit trees for them.

171
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,410
No.

172
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,580
Five hundred fruit trees for them.

173
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,650
Okay, 500 it is.

174
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,100
You gotta water them every day.

175
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:38,570
Oh.

176
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:39,810
In the end,

177
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,690
you must write a report to my father

178
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,570
detailing your evil doings

179
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,460
to let my father punish you.

180
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:43,930
Then I'll spare your life.

181
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,260
I'll definitely do that.

182
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,890
Also,

183
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,140
if you dare bully

184
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,860
any common folks in this county again,

185
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,260
the princess will execute you immediately.

186
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,770
I dare not!

187
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,530
I dare not!

188
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,410
Your Excellency.

00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,620
I'm tired today.

190
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,810
Let's go back to rest first.

191
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,140
Then please get on the carriage,
Your Highness.

192
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,100
Let's see Her Highness off.

193
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,770
Let's go, Dad.

194
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,570
Go.

195
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,620
Master.

196
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,570
Don't come over!

197
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,690
They haven't gone far yet.

198
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,410
Get back.

199
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,900
[Yayun Courier Hostel]

200
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,170
We've arrived?

201
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,770
What a long bumpy road.

202
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,890
My old bones are falling apart.

203
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,980
You must be the guest from the capital.

204
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,690
Yes, I am.

205
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,380
And you are?

206
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,260
I'm the butler
of Marquis of the North Residence.

207
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,220
I'm called Liu Ruoqian.

208
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,260
Butler Liu.

209
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,290
Good.

210
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,290
We're exactly invited by the Marquis.

211
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,620
I mean, we're his guests.

212
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,410
It's a long journey.

213
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,890
Please come in to take a rest.

214
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,100
Just a moment.

215
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,810
Daughter, time to get off.

216
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,530
Support her.

217
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,650
So unprofessional.

218
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,380
Miss,

219
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,410
please rest early.

220
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,690
Butler Liu,

221
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,170
what you saw just now
is Princess Changping.

222
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,890
Then you are...

223
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,500
Me?

224
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,170
I am the chamberlain
who served His Majesty

225
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,770
for years.

226
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,740
I didn't expect you to come.

227
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,530
Sorry for not showing enough respect.

228
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,100
Save it.

229
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,650
Butler Liu,

230
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,530
I'm getting old.

231
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,260
By order of Her Majesty,

232
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,740
I'm escorting the princess
to Spiritual Mountain.

233
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,380
It's been a bumpy journey.

234
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,530
My old bones are falling apart

235
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,290
from all the ups and downs.

236
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,890
Now,

237
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,260
the responsibility of protecting
the princess will fall on your shoulder.

238
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,050
Your Excellency,

239
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,690
you and Her Highness go rest early today.

240
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,340
After having breakfast tomorrow morning,

241
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,020
you can meet Marquis of the North
at the temporary residence.

242
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,100
I'm not going to the temporary residence.

243
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,140
By then,

244
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,340
you just come to fetch the princess.

245
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,410
As you wish.

246
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,170
You may go now.

247
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,980
Am I pretty?

248
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,650
Your Highness is so pretty!

249
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,460
So pretty!

250
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,290
Your Ladyship.

251
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,500
Why are you guys here?

252
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,930
We were ordered to protect Your Ladyship.

253
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,340
So that Your Ladyship can have a good rest.

254
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,530
With you here,

255
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,620
I can't rest well at all.

256
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,290
Go now!

257
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,220
Your Ladyship,

258
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,380
we can't go.

259
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,980
His Excellency ordered us to be here.

260
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,530
His Excellency?

261
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,620
All you talk about is His Excellency.

262
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,410
Are you leaving or not?

263
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,570
What about you then?

264
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:23,930
Fine.

265
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,290
Since neither of you is leaving,

266
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,170
I'll leave!

267
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,770
Outrageous!

268
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,890
Your Highness, please have some water.

269
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,650
Don't get upset.

270
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,340
Alright.

271
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,530
I don't want anything. Leave me.

272
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,170
Is she in?

273
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:58,980
Yes.

274
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,930
Your Highness,

275
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,020
did you have fun

276
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,860
on the way here?

277
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,740
Oh? I guess not.

278
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,020
But

279
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,530
it's still more fun

280
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,170
than staying in the palace.

281
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,380
Really?

282
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,050
Alright, then. Your Excellency.

283
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,980
I'm not mad now.

284
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,460
Have a seat.

285
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,740
Wait, is this appropriate?

286
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,170
What's not appropriate?

287
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:29,890
It is.

288
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,050
Then I shall comply.

289
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,460
Say,

290
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,220
are you gonna bring me
up to Spiritual Mountain

291
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,460
to have fun at the South Heavenly Gate?

292
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,220
I'm not the one to bring you there.

293
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,740
Have you forgotten?

294
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,220
You're here to meet your fiance.

295
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,690
If you're going there,

296
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,770
it's gotta be him to bring you there.

297
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,140
My fiance?

298
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,220
He is the emperor's son-in-law.

299
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,930
Your husband.

300
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,020
Yuan Buqu, the Marquis of the North.

301
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,570
I still have no idea

302
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,100
what thing my husband is.

303
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,140
Your Highness,

304
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,500
you can't talk like this

305
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,260
ever again in the future.

306
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,290
What do you mean I can't talk like this?

307
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,740
I think I'm talking just fine.

308
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,140
Oh...

309
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,570
Is my beard somehow...

310
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:17,530
Is it...

311
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,050
Not falling!

312
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:20,890
Your Highness,

313
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,690
well,

314
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,740
after having breakfast tomorrow morning,

315
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,140
your fiance will send butler Liu
to pick you up.

316
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,770
When you meet your fiance,

317
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,100
every word you say,
and every move you make,

318
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,380
you must display

319
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,380
the royal style of a princess.

320
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,980
Okay, I got it.

321
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,100
Your Highness,

322
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,770
please rest early.

323
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,650
Tomorrow...

324
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,220
I get it. Stop nagging me.

325
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,380
Leave me now.

326
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,220
Then I'll go now.

327
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,380
Go.

328
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,290
Halt.

329
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,620
Let's welcome the princess.

330
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,740
Your Highness,

331
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,410
General has been expecting you.

332
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,100
Please.

333
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,740
[Yuan Residence]

334
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,100
Let's go.

335
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,020
Your Highness, look.

336
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,220
The front yard

337
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,020
features rare stones and plants,

338
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,570
while the backyard rockeries.

339
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,530
Not bad.

340
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,930
You've picked a really nice place.

341
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,810
Your Highness, please.

342
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,020
Okay.

343
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,380
This way.

344
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,260
Okay.

345
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,740
You lot,

346
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,740
protect the princess at all times.

347
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,530
If she needs anything,

348
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,500
be sure to show up immediately.

349
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,900
[It's the little general in purple robe
who saved me earlier.]

350
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,850
[How come he's here?]

351
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,700
In the front yard,

352
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,290
you'll have five men patrolling.

353
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,260
In the backyard,

354
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,460
you'll have at least five guards.

355
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,220
[Could he be...]

356
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,940
Your Highness?

357
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:49,980
Your Highness?

358
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,770
Butler Liu,

359
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,940
that man

360
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,810
must be General Yuan, right?

361
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,260
He's not.

362
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,220
Let's go.

363
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,050
Chest out.

364
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,220
[If only he is Yuan Buqu.]

365
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,660
If the princess wants
to take a walk outside,

366
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
you have to report it to me.

367
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,700
Is that clear?

368
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,500
Clear!

369
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,660
Your Highness?

370
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,740
Your Highness?

371
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:03,850
Your Highness?

372
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,660
Butler Liu.

373
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,530
General Liu has been waiting
for you inside.

374
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,810
You can go back.

375
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,940
No need to follow me.

376
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,290
This way, please.

377
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,660
Your Highness, please.

378
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,050
Where is he?

379
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,940
He's in the inner room.

380
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,290
I'm already here.

381
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,460
Why isn't he coming out to see me?

382
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,130
General has something important
to attend to.

383
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,290
After he finishes it,

384
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,260
he'll come out to welcome you in person.

385
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,180
Excuse me.

386
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,900
What the heck?

387
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,050
You must keep in mind

388
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,180
what I've told you.

389
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,020
Yes!

390
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,460
Dismissed.

391
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,260
Pingwei.

392
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,660
Aunt?

393
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,530
Have you noticed

394
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,500
that someone's watching you just now?

395
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,460
Who?

396
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,900
Silly nephew.

397
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,020
Well,

398
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,500
this is a secret.

399
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,530
Aunt, what do you keep me guessing?

400
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,900
[This general]

401
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,290
[seems quite mysterious.]

402
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,020
[Is he in the middle of a religious rite?]

403
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,220
[Look at him.]

404
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,370
[Why is his beard so long?]

405
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,610
[This is unhygienic.]

406
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,460
[Mom told me]

407
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,290
[he's majestic and handsome.]

408
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,770
[But he's obviously]

409
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,130
[ugly and old.]

410
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,700
[He's not handsome at all.]

411
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,200
[Memorial Tablet for Late Wife Li Xiuhe,
January, Fifth Year of Yonghui]

412
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,700
[Memorial Tablet for Late Wife Yang Kexin,
November, Third Year of Xianqing]

413
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,050
[Wait...]

414
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,980
[He already had two dead ex-wives!]

415
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,810
[Could he be a jinx?]

416
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,530
Your Highness, what's wrong?

417
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,220
Butler Liu,

418
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,020
go take a look.

419
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,370
Now.

420
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,900
See what's going on.

421
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,220
What's wrong with him?

422
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:32,700
Well...

423
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,460
I'm afraid General is dream walking

424
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,290
when he's offering libation
to his late wives.

425
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,740
Dream walking?

426
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,420
What?

427
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,050
Help!

428
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,660
Your Highness.

429
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:56,940
Your Highness.

430
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,740
-Don't be afraid.
-Help!

431
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,020
Your Highness.

432
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,420
What's wrong?

433
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,330
Don't cry.

434
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,220
What happened?

435
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:33,980
What's wrong?

436
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,130
Why are you crying?

437
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,530
Talk to me.

438
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,420
I'm not marrying Yuan Buqu!

439
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,090
What?

440
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,220
Butler Liu,

441
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,530
what exactly happened?

442
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,570
What's going on?

443
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,220
Your Excellency,

444
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,290
Her Highness ran into General

445
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,330
offering a libation to his two late wives.

446
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,940
And she got shocked.

447
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,050
Your Highness,

448
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,050
don't cry.

449
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,090
Let's talk, okay?

450
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,130
I'm not marrying

451
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,940
that old and ugly jinx!

452
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,420
In this Yuan Residence,

453
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,050
only that little general in purple robe

454
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,260
looks majestic.

455
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,330
My princess,

456
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,260
you're confusing me.

457
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,770
Is that little general in purple robe
General Yuan?

458
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,980
That little general in purple robe

459
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,050
is that young man

460
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,500
who saved me on our way here.

461
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,460
What purple robe are you talking about?

462
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,460
Is that purple robe Yuan Buqu?

463
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,330
It'll be nice if he really is!

464
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:35,900
Buqu,

465
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,530
I really didn't know

466
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,260
you were capable of such tricks.

467
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,810
I have no other option.

468
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,740
This whole thing was more toilsome

469
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,420
than killing enemies on the battleground.

470
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,900
You're not running out of options.

471
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,130
You're hen-pecked.

472
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,330
This is my adopted daughter
Bingyan's good idea.

473
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,090
It is, indeed.

474
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,420
Wives normally follow their husbands.

475
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,770
But for you,

476
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,500
you're following your wife.

477
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,370
How unexpected.

478
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,420
Buqu actually

479
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,660
listens to my sister-in-law.

480
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,770
I could ask for nothing more

481
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,020
after having such a wife.

482
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,020
I've met Yuan Buqu.

483
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,220
But he's both old and ugly.

484
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,570
He's wearing grubby clothes.

485
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,130
What kind of general is that?

486
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,180
His beard is so long and messy.

487
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,500
He's literally a nasty hobo!

488
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,610
Why do I have to be so unlucky?

489
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,020
-Wait.
-Mom!

490
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,090
Don't say it like this.

491
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,130
I also heard

492
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,660
that he already had two dead wives.

493
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,130
If I marry him,

494
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,220
I may be cursed too!

495
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,290
Wouldn't I be the third one?

496
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,130
Your Highness,

497
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,420
stop crying.

498
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,370
But if we do so,

499
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,700
aren't we fooling the emperor?

500
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,220
Bingyan had it all planned out.

501
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,260
My adopted daughter thought of this long ago.

502
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,330
She said

503
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,770
that there're three reasons
why this isn't lying.

504
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,940
First,

505
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,610
General Yuan did have two wives

506
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,770
who were both dead.

507
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,050
Everybody knows it.

508
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,610
Second,

509
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,290
his offering libation
to his wives is also true.

510
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,850
As for him missing them so much
that he was lost in dreams,

511
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,420
nobody can prove it to be true or false.

512
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,370
Third,

513
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,370
for a man involved in warfare,

514
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,900
it's quite normal for him

515
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:24,900
to not shave his beard for days.

516
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,980
I see.

517
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,850
My sister-in-law is so considerate.

518
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,020
Cheers.

519
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,020
Cheers.

520
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,180
After all these days of waiting,

521
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,530
my so-called fiance,
the emperor's son-in-law,

522
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,810
is actually such a thing!

523
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,770
Also,

524
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,700
what's so good about being a general?

525
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,660
Fighting and killing every day.

526
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,090
Being violent all the time.

527
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,900
If it's a victory,

528
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,370
he's winning it risking his life.

529
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,660
But if it's a defeat,

530
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,090
my father will be so angry

531
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,330
and punish him with the death penalty.

532
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,940
Your Highness, please don't cry.

533
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,050
You're making me sad.

534
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,460
Even I wanna cry with you.

535
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,810
Stop crying.

536
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,740
Your crying sounds horrible.

537
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,460
Okay.

538
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,570
I'm not gonna cry.

539
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,770
You should stop too.

540
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,530
Butler Liu,

541
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,980
is Her Highness telling the truth?

542
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,460
Well...

543
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
It's all your fault.

544
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,460
That day,

545
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,940
I wanted
to draw divination sticks at a temple,

546
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,940
but you wouldn't let me

547
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,220
and dragged me back.

548
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,260
If that day

549
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,740
I drew a divination stick at the temple,

550
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,700
there could be a deity guiding me

551
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,130
by offering me the unluckiest one,

552
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,900
and then I wouldn't need to come here.

553
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,770
Your Highness.

554
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,610
Your Excellency.

555
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,420
In my humble opinion,

556
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,850
Her Majesty might not know

557
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,180
that the Marquis of the North

558
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,700
isn't to Her Highness's taste as such.

559
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,810
Indeed.

560
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,740
When there was a victory
in the north frontier,

561
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,330
Her Majesty was so glad

562
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,330
that she asked His Majesty to grant this.

563
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,420
Your Highness,

564
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,290
how about this?

565
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,610
Let's go back to the capital tonight.

566
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,460
We'll report to Her Majesty

567
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,420
and let her pick another husband.

568
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,850
And we'll tell her

569
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,940
how Yuan Buqu failed
to welcome you properly.

570
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,020
We'll let Her Majesty punish him

571
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,660
for the sake of disrespecting you.

572
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,850
How does this sound?

573
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,740
This is a good idea.

574
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,700
[Bingyan's plan avoided
the crime of lying to the emperor,]

575
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,330
[but we didn't expect]

576
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,940
[the princess to be so imperious]

577
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,020
[that general is now deemed
as disrespectful.]

578
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,020
[This must be solved as the soonest.]

579
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,290
Hey,

580
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,260
do you still remember

581
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,660
you're taking me to Spiritual Mountain

582
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,050
to watch the sunrise by the East Sea?

583
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,850
Don't you remember?

584
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,330
I...

585
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,700
Please, take me.

586
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,220
Just take me there.

587
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,740
Your Highness.

588
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,660
-Please.
-Your Highness.

589
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,260
Your Excellency,

590
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,530
you and Her Highness traveled a long way

591
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,570
to get here.

592
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,050
Even if you're returning to the capital,

593
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,180
you don't have to be in such haste.

594
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,050
Why don't you have a rest today

595
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,050
and then go up the mountain tomorrow

596
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,260
to draw a divination stick
in Bixia Temple?

597
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,500
Then you get on top of Spiritual Mountain

598
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,740
to let Her Highness enjoy the views.

599
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,130
Then you can go back to the capital.

600
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,660
This is settled, then.

601
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,420
I'm tired. I need to rest.

602
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,530
Make way, please.

603
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:47,980
Pingwei.

604
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,850
Uncle?

605
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,020
Uncle,

606
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,290
what's going on with the princess?

607
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,530
Don't talk about it on the street.

608
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:01,900
This way.

609
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:06,700
Uncle,

610
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,260
tell me now.

611
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,020
After Buqu pulled off that trick,

612
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,330
how did the princess react

613
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,050
when returning to the hostel?

614
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,420
Pingwei,

615
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,260
I'll put it this way.

616
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,660
The first step was a success.

617
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,660
Princess Changping is unwilling

618
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,330
to marry Yuan Buqu.

619
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,420
So the plan worked, right?

620
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,660
Great.

621
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,770
But I heard that old eunuch say

622
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,610
they will punish Yuan Buqu
for being disrespectful.

623
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:33,940
Being disrespectful?

624
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,460
Why?

625
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,090
Keep it down.

626
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,220
But...

627
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,900
But it's obviously the Her Majesty

628
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,740
who forced Buqu to be her son-in-law.

629
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,500
Who's disrespecting who?

630
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,420
Yeah.

631
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,530
Buqu pulled off a ghost show

632
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,980
and scared the princess off.

633
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,020
But it's the princess's own decision

634
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,940
not to marry Buqu, right?

635
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,770
We weren't truly disrespecting them.

636
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,900
We weren't forcing her.

637
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,740
Either way,

638
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,220
they can't blame Buqu for this.

639
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,700
What you said makes sense,

640
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,130
but if we want to change their mind now,

641
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,940
we gotta come up with a second plan.

642
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,370
We got another plan?

643
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,260
As for the second step,

644
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,460
I've figured it out.

645
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,660
The princess is born
into the royal family.

646
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,260
She's an imperious one.

647
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,900
But she knows her own mind.

648
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,660
Maybe,

649
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,980
she'll change
this old eunuch's mind by herself.

650
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,420
Uncle,

651
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,980
you know both medicine

652
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,770
and divination.

653
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,940
You're like one of those

654
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,460
immortals in stories.

655
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,050
I don't have the luck

656
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,330
to meet immortals yet.

657
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,500
However,

658
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,980
when I was young,

659
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,570
I learned divination
in your aunt's family.

660
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,500
I know a thing or two about yin and yang,

661
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,530
the five elements, medicine,

662
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,940
and physiognomy.

663
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:00,420
I'll tell you what.

664
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,130
When I see someone's face,

665
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,330
I can predict his ups and downs in life

666
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,660
as well as his fortune and misfortune.

667
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,900
Why don't you predict mine?

668
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,460
Uncle.

669
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,850
I've done that for you long ago.

670
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,500
It's just

671
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,420
that it's not yet time to tell you.

672
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,900
I can't tell it to you now.

673
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,700
Are you trying to say
that I'll have a disaster?

674
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,330
You were having one long ago.

675
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,130
You almost died during marching.

676
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,770
And you implicated General Yuan.

677
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,330
He took a surprise shot
from the enemy.

678
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,660
Doesn't that count as a disaster?

679
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,460
But good fortune comes out of bad.

680
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,370
Although you've caused major trouble,

681
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,610
you brought out

682
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,050
the beautiful marriage

683
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,660
between Yuan Buqu and Du Bingyan.

684
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:54,530
This is Buqu's fortune, I guess.

685
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,940
For me, it's truly a misfortune.

686
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,180
It's hard to tell.

687
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,940
Maybe a big fortune

688
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,610
is coming your way, kid.

689
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,660
Uncle, please predict
my fortune carefully.

690
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,980
Come on, read my palm.

691
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,500
Come on.

692
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,290
Is it a little different

693
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,330
from what my face implies?

694
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,020
-Uncle.
-Fine.

695
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,050
Let me read your palm, then.

696
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,850
Thank you, Uncle.

697
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,130
Pingwei,

698
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,180
palm prints reflect a person

699
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,500
just like the wood grains reflect a tree.

700
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,330
Only by observing carefully

701
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,090
can I tell what kind of person you are.

702
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,180
I see that your palm prints

703
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,260
are straight and thick,

704
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,940
which indicates that you're overly loyal

705
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,330
but insufficiently intelligent.

706
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,700
But your face structure looks good.

707
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,180
Thick and smooth eyebrows.

708
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,850
You'll get luck easily.

709
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,050
Yeah, I do feel lucky.

710
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,660
According to your date of birth

711
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,500
and the eight characters of a horoscope,

712
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,530
you're destined
to get help from a noble one.

713
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,820
By the way, Pingwei,

714
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,650
when you entered the temporary residence

715
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,650
and met Princess Changping today,

716
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,420
were you wearing a purple robe?

717
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:21,940
I guess...

718
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,780
I was wearing a purple robe.

719
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:26,860
Heaven's will!

720
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,210
This is indeed Heaven's will!

721
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,530
The Purple Air comes from the east.
It's a propitious omen.

722
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:34,860
Pingwei,

723
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,380
your fate shows you're a late bloomer.

724
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,380
Your twist of fate
doesn't come from elsewhere

725
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,780
but on top of Spiritual Mountain.

726
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,780
Tomorrow morning,

727
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,210
wear a purple robe

728
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,690
and go to the top
of the mountain before sunrise

729
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,250
without going anywhere else.

730
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,090
Just spend a whole day

731
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,420
in front of the Bixia Temple.

732
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,900
When the time comes,

733
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,090
your noble one will show up.

734
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,500
This special person

735
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,380
will not only change your fate

736
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,090
but also help General Yuan
get out of trouble.

737
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,820
Are you fooling me, Uncle?

738
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,570
When did I ever fool you?

739
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,780
Then,

740
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,940
meeting a noble one
in front of Bixia Temple?

741
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,340
Who is this noble one?

742
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,250
What's his name?

743
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,420
Or tell me what he looks like.

744
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,130
A rough description will do.

745
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,340
Well,

746
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,090
this is a secret.

747
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,130
Uncle,

748
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,570
just tell me.

749
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,050
Tell me, please.

750
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,090
My silly nephew,

751
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,500
you gotta use your own judgment tomorrow.

752
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,300
Go get your horse now.

753
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,130
Uncle, you're not tricking me, are you?

754
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,610
Uncle,

755
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,020
is this for real?

756
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:16,860
Xiuyun.

757
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,730
Ruoqian.

758
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,170
Put it on my back.

759
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,170
By the way,

760
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,860
how is it going with the princess?

761
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,210
We still got to solve another problem.

762
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,900
Otherwise, everything we did
will be in vain.

763
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,530
What problem?

764
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,340
The good plan of our adopted daughter

765
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,170
did make the princess

766
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,820
give up marrying Buqu,

767
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,340
but the princess was terrified that day.

768
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,090
She wouldn't stop crying.

769
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,690
Eunuch Zhang kept comforting her

770
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,690
by the side.

771
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,610
Then he kept blaming Buqu,

772
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,900
and the princess decided

773
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,130
to punish Buqu for being disrespectful.

774
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,690
Then, do you think

775
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,900
Buqu can get away with this?

776
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,610
Whether he can be free from the punishment

777
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,210
depends on tomorrow.

778
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,900
Then work out something now.

779
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,820
You gotta help Buqu solve this problem.

780
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,860
That's for sure.

781
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,020
However,

782
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,250
solving this problem
is too hard for me alone.

783
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,860
I need the help of another mighty one.

784
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:31,900
We can't wait any longer.

785
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,900
Let's go find this person now.

786
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,530
I am finding this person right now.

787
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,250
You mean me?

788
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,530
Tomorrow,

789
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,380
it'll be your turn to shine.

790
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:48,900
Okay.

791
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,020
For the sake of you bringing me flowers.

792
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,020
What do you need me to do?

793
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,130
Everything is set

794
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,690
for the side of our nephew.

795
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,570
Now the last thing remaining

796
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,170
is actually...

797
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,730
This is how I planned.

798
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,900
This way, we can
kill two birds with one stone.

799
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,170
No.

800
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,610
I can't trick people

801
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,500
as you do.

802
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,530
I can't do that.

803
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,690
This is called digging a well
when you're thirsty.

804
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,170

What should we do next?

That overbearing girl!

829
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,820
I don't care if she's noble.

830
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,900
I don't care
if she's the emperor's family.

No.

838
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,170

At most,

00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,020
I'll be dead.
