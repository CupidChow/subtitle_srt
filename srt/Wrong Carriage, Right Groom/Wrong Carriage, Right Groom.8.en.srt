your disciple didn't come,

114
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,630

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,240
had a rather exhausting day,

118
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
and he doesn't feel very well.

119
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,040
I sent him back for some rest.

120
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,750
Oh, he...

122
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,270
He advised using black beans,

123
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,310
and that was really stunning.

124
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,040
He's highly intelligent, indeed.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,870
He's not only intelligent

126
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,630
but also faithful.

127
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,720
For his brother,
he came to Jingzhou alone.

128
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,510
And to save our soldiers,

129
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,390
he did everything he could.

130
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,240
He tried his best to help you, too.

131
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,680
By the way,

132
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,120
tomorrow,

133
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,680
I'll write to
the commanders of other troops,

134
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,680
asking them to check
their soldiers' identities

135
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,120
and help Du Bin find his brother.

136
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,310
I wish them a speedy reunion.

137
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,040

139
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,830

140
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,750
when Du Bin finds his brother,

141
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
he'll leave with him.

142
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,390
As his master,

143
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,040
I can't help feeling bad.

144
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,560
What?

145
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,600
Will Du Bin leave here?

146
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,120
He came here just to find his brother.

147
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,120
So, after he finds his brother,

148
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,360
they'll leave together.

149
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,390
In this case,

150
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,120
I'll have to respect his choice.

151
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,390

General,

156
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,750
you look terrible.

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,440

Your arrow wound has almost recovered.

163
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,790
Your pulse is also smooth and strong.

164
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,270
Yet you look rather gloomy.

165
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,840
Is anything bothering you, General?

166
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,670
The first time I saw him,

167
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,080
I felt like I knew him from somewhere.

168
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,690
I asked him,

169
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,380
and he said
we had met on the drill ground.

170
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,810
I was on horseback, and he was on foot.

171
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,810
But I knew it wasn't that time.

172
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
Oh, I remember.

173
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,770
It was on the street of Jingzhou.

174
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,770
A scholar...

175
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,860
He wanted to join the army. He...

176
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:19,980
No.

177
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,620
That scholar was a bit taller than him.

178
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,860
A bit older, too.

179
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,100
General,

180
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,460
Du Bin traveled to the border with me.

181
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,690
So, I'm sure

182
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,570
before we arrived,

183
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,170
you'd never seen him.

184
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,460
But when I first met him,

185
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,620
he looked so familiar.

186
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,650
I've got a riddle.

187
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,220
If you can solve it,

188
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,570
the confusion that has haunted you

189
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,530
will be gone.

190
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,170
I'm all ears.

191
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,770
The male rabbit normally hops and runs

192
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,100
while the female sits and stares.

193
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,340
But both flee fast when danger threatens.

194
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,340
How can one tell
whether they are male or female, then?

195
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,860
Du Bin is a woman?

196
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,620
So, it was her.

197
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,530
General?

198
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,380
This is her scarf.

199
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,650
But some accidents happened.

200
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,860
She...

201
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,170
She wasn't meant to be your wife.

202
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,220
It should be Li Yuhu
from Mighty Martial Arts Center.

203
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,000
General,

204
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,510
time to change your dressing.

205
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,510
General.

206
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,480
Your dressing.

207
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,840
Sorry.

208
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,030
What are you writing, General?

209
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,390
You were so lost in thought.

210
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,270
Look.

211
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,910
By riverside are cooing,

212
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,790
a pair of turtledoves.

213
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,080
A good young man is wooing,

214
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,910
a fair maiden he loves.

215
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,630
Du Bin,

216
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,510
check my handwriting.

217
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,750
What do you think of it?

218
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,950
[By riverside are cooing,
a pair of turtledoves.]

219
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,860
[A good young man is wooing,
a fair maiden he loves.]

220
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,480
General, your handwriting

221
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,630
looks very powerful.

222
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,320
Normally,

223
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
style is the man himself.

224
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,630
I just wonder

225
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,150
why you wrote this poem.

226
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,270
Is it because

227
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,720
some lady

228
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,480
captured your fancy?

229
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,030
Yes, indeed.

230
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,360
A few days ago,
I was honored to meet a lady.

231
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,440
She's gorgeous

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,030
and very smart.

233
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,080
I really adore her.

234
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,960
But...

235
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,510
But I'm pretty nervous,

236
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,030
wondering if this lady

237
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,870
has the same feelings for me.

238
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,120
General,

239
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,000
you don't need to be nervous.

240
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,880
All beautiful girls love heroes.

241
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,360
You have great deeds in battle,
and you're an all-rounder.

242
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,950
What's more,

243
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,670
you're handsome.

244
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,160
Any girl, however gorgeous she is,

245
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,360
will fall in love with you.

246
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,400
Is that so?

247
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,590
Am I really that great?

248
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,760
In this case,

249
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,520
Du Bin, if you were a woman,

250
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,190
would you marry me?

251
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,040
Me?

252
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,790
General,

253
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,160
I must change your dressing now.

254
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,910
There's no hurry.

255
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,710
I have something else to ask you.

256
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,120
Du Bin,

257
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,910
you're always thoughtful.

258
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,910
Help me figure out

259
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,190
how I should confess my love

260
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,910
to that lady.

261
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,310
I'm not quite familiar

262
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,950
with such love stuff.

263
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,000
But I believe

264
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,310
as long as you really like her,

265
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,790
she will be delighted.

266
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,590
You have no idea.

267
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,160
All ladies love presents.

268
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,670
Well then,

269
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
let me show you

270
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,550
her portrait.

271
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,000
Then think for me

272
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,120
about what present I should give her.

273
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:45,950
Open it and look.

274
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,590
A few days ago,

275
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,590
I met that lady in a hurry.

276
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,830
But her figure

277
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,590
has lingered in my heart.

278
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,350
Sadly, I was in such a hurry

279
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,680
that I didn't see her face very clearly.

280
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,830
Many times in my dream,

281
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,720
I wanted her to turn around

282
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,240
so that I could see her face.

283
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,520
I've prepared a present.

284
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,310
Check if it fits.

285
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,760
If I give it to her

286
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,720
and confess my love,

287
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,350
will she like it?

288
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,350
This is the General's wife's scarf.

289
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,480
[Who are you? Tell me!]

290
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,760
I'm the General's wife.

291
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,150
It should be returned to her.

292
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,200
Do you

293
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,040
like it?

294
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,040
General,

295
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,350
I like it.

296
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,000
Bingyan,

297
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,680
how about you call me Ziren?

298
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,590
Do you know my real name?

299
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,830
Your master told me

300
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,760
about the sedan accident.

301
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,590
Regardless of whether
you got on the wrong bridal sedan,

302
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,550
the only one I'm devoted to is you,

303
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,520
Du Bingyan.

304
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,920
Ziren.

Uncle,

312
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,000
you're leaving so suddenly,

313
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,480
and I hate to have you go.

314
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,070
Please come back early.

315
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,830
I'll return to Linzhou,

316
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,480
buy the herbs, and come back immediately.

317
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,240
Traveling around to treat patients

318
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,200
and help people matters a lot.

319
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,040
But you shouldn't leave your wife at home

320
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,480
all alone.

321
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,830
Don't kid me like that.

322
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,240
Pingwei,

323
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,680
leave us.

324
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,000
I have something to tell Du Bin.

325
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,000
Back you go.

326
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,200
Take care.

327
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,350
Come.

328
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,760
When I'm away,

329
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,550
you must take good care of General

330
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,280
in case his arrow wound re-emerges.

331
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,590
And...

332
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,240
You must remember

333
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,070
to be extra careful with everything.

334
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,790
Don't let anyone know

335
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,070
that you're a woman.

336
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,590
Rules are rules, after all.

337
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,310
Adoptive Father,

338
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,150
don't worry.

339
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,630
I'll be careful.

340
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,280
Oh, Adoptive Father,

341
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,520
here's one thing.

342
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,920
After you arrive in Linzhou,

343
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,440
please give it to Yuhu.

344
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,790
I will.

345
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,480
Adoptive Father,

346
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,070
travel safely.

347
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
You take care, too.

348
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,830
Go.

349
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,310
Adoptive Father,

350
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,790
stay safe.

351
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,620
[Qi Residence]

352
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,040
I don't know

353
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,960
what Third Young Mistress is up to.

354
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,440
She visits Old Madam every day.

355
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,520
Old Madam is so pleased

356
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,720
that she keeps praising her
for being caring.

357
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,070
And a lot of great things are delivered

358
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,760
to the Garden of Harmony.

359
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,790
Now, Third Young Mistress

360
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,480
must be very cocky.

361
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,790
Xiaoqiao,

362
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,240
that isn't our concern.

363
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,000
Our concern is how we can

364
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,150
expose her.

365
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,390
I swear,

366
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,110
I saw her do martial arts
with Third Young Master.

367
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,480
If I saw that wrongly,

368
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,240
may Heaven strike me dead.

369
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,150
Fine, fine.

370
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,520
Xiaoqiao,

371
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,150
whether you saw them

372
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,150
do martial arts around the wall

373
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,150
isn't important.

374
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,000
The important thing is
to make Grandmother see that,

375
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,040
and it'll really count.

376
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,630
You must be extremely careful.

377
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,280
If they do anything unusual again,

378
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,720
catch them in the act.

379
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,350
But now,

380
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,480
they don't allow me
to deliver the decoction upstairs.

381
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,960
How can I catch them in the act?

382
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:35,920
Besides,

383
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,550
Third Young Master has had
a ruddy face lately.

384
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,310
Maybe...

385
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,720
Maybe he didn't take

386
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,280
the decoction I delivered.

387
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,590
Xiaoqiao,

388
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,790
please never say anything

389
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,630
like "maybe", "perhaps", or "I guess"

390
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,280
ever again.

391
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,790
Anyway, since Third Young Mistress came,

392
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,310
Third Young Master has been cheerful.

393
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,520
Du Bingyan is

394
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,200
a nice indoor girl from Yangzhou.

395
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,350
Logically, she should use

396
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,350
decent and graceful words.

397
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,150
But during the audit of accounts,

398
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,760
she used some slang.

399
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,390
This is really incomprehensible.

400
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,070
Is it possible

401
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,440
that she's a phony?

402
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,040
We won't know

403
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,870
unless we test it.

404
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,870
I have an idea.

405
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,200
When Old Madam prepared betrothal gifts,

406
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,920
she had a valuable crystal goose made.

407
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,520
It was delivered
to Third Young Mistress as a token.

408
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,790
But ever since she came,

409
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,760
I've never seen her wear it.

410
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Did you see her wear it?

411
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,790
No.

412
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,440
Then, let's ask her
to show us this crystal goose.

413
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,280
If she can't,

414
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,680
she must be a phony.

415
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,040
Xiaoqiao,

416
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,680
it's really wise of you.

417
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,000
This is a great idea.

418
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,590
It's a couple of days before the 15th.

419
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,760
By then, Grandmother will hold

420
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,790
a banquet at Qi Residence.

421
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,200
Everybody will be present.

422
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,200
Then,

423
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,680
you propose to take a look
at the crystal goose.

424
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,350
In front of the whole family,

425
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,150
I don't think Du Bingyan

426
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,350
can give the runaround.

427
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,760
Last time,

428
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,870
Bingyan had a false pregnancy.

429
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,960
But you shouldn't give up.

430
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,390
Well, best wishes to Bingyan

431
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,920
for an early pregnancy.

432
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,200
Mother, wish you a great-grandson soon.

433
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,680
Good.

434
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,630
Let's drink together.

435
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,200
Come on. Enjoy the food.

436
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,280
Here, Bingyan.

437
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,070
Thank you, Mother.

438
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,200
Bingyan,

439
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,590
in this violet dress
with red-flower patterns,

440
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,390
you look great.

441
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,520
Bingyan,

442
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,550
Old Madam had this dress made for you.

443
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,310
Say "thank you" to her.

444
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,000
Thank you, Grandmother.

445
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,110
As the old saying goes,

446
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,550
clothes make the man.

447
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,680
Look at her.

448
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,440
In this dress,

449
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,680
she's gorgeous.

450
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,830
Thanks to your great taste, Mother.

451
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,150
Yan Sheng,

452
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,390
it's dinner time. Where have you been?

453
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,760
Take your seat.

454
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,390
Enjoy the meal.

455
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,520
Third Young Mistress's dress

456
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,200
looks really resplendent.

457
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,040
But if she wears one thing,

458
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,630
she'll look even better.

459
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,790
Xiaoqiao,

460
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,000
what do you think she should wear?

461
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,390
Something she has, actually.

462
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,150
Among the betrothal presents,

463
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,520
there's a valuable crystal goose

464
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,440
that you had made for her, Old Madam.

465
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,280
Your advice

466
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,200
reminded me of that.

467
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,280
Oh, Bingyan.

468
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,000
Back then, I spent a fortune

469
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,110
to have a precious crystal goose

470
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,040
crafted in your name.

471
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,200
Why aren't you wearing it?

472
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,680
Go put it on

473
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,760
and give us a show.

474
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That's right.

475
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,440
I haven't seen it for a while, either.

476
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,480
You made sense, Grandmother.

477
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Bingyan and I

478
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,070
will go get it now.

479
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,070
All right.

480
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,440
Mother, we'll be right back.

481
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,040
Off you go.

482
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,200
What are you doing?

483
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,440
Going back to Yangzhou.

484
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,040
How would that help?

485
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,280
Let's try to find a way out, shall we?

486
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,550
I don't have that crystal goose at all.

487
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,480
How can I find a way out?

488
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,680
How about I tell Grandmother

489
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,680
that I left it in Yangzhou

490
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,110
instead of taking it here?

491
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,200
If you had used this excuse

492
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,960
when Fang Xiaoqiao gave us trouble,

493
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,440
it might work.

494
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,110
But now, too late.

495
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,040
Then you feign illness again

496
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,920
to get over this.

497
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,520
It won't work, either.

498
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,390
So, nothing is gonna work now.

499
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,830
Fang Xiaoqiao is always against me!

500
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,070
Ke Shizhao is behind her, you know.

501
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,440
He's a big bad guy, too!

502
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,760
What the heck!

503
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,680
In the worst case...

504
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,920
In the worst case,
I'll just say I'm Li Yuhu,

505
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
not Du Bingyan!

506
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,040
I'll see what he dares to do to me.

507
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,520
Be patient,

508
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,920
and let's see what we can do.

509
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,110
Come on in.

510
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,350
Master?

511
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,070
Why are you back here?

512
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,920
I'm back here

513
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,520
for something very important.

514
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,720
I met someone in Jingzhou.

515
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,960
The real Du Bingyan.

516
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,150
She asked me to give this present

517
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,240
to Miss Yuhu.

518
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,760
Me?

519
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,870
-Crystal goose?
-Crystal goose?

520
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,630
Ke Shizhao

521
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,110
tried to embarrass us again and again.

522
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,200
This time,

523
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,040
let's make him horribly disappointed.

524
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,110
Old Madam,

525
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,920
Third Young Mistress isn't wearing it.

526
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,590
Bingyan,

527
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,390
where is your crystal goose?

528
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,630
Grandmother,

529
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,590
how about

530
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,280
we don't see it today?

531
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,720
Old Madam,

532
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,310
the crystal goose

533
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,790
is a token of marriage

534
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,200
for Third Young Master and Mistress.

535
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:42,870
And look.

536
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,480
Everyone's waiting

537
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,680
to see this lucky thing.

538
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,150
That's right.

539
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,480
Bingyan,

540
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,960
why didn't you put it on

541
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,390
to give us a show?

542
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,390
Grandmother.

543
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,110
The crystal goose is very valuable.

544
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,680
The day after I arrived,

545
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,240
I gave it to Tianlei.

546
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,520
Just now, we looked for it

547
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,790
but didn't find it.

548
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,070
Tianlei,

549
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,110
how could you be so careless?

550
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,000
Old Madam,

551
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,550
the crystal goose is valuable.

552
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,680
It can't be just missing.

553
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,040
Did someone within

554
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,590
stealing it?

555
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,960
As I see it,

556
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,630
if someone within stole it,

557
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,350
Third Young Master's servants

558
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,790
must be replaced.

559
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,480
Xiaoqiao,

560
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,150
no need to have them replaced.

561
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,200
And no one within stole it.

562
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,790
Don't keep them guessing.

563
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,440
I feel nervous.

564
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,680
So do Mother and Grandmother.

565
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,480
You're no longer a child,

566
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,000
but you don't remember where you kept it.

567
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,760
If it hadn't dropped accidentally,

568
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,200
I wouldn't know
how to explain it to Grandmother.

569
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,310
Take it out.

570
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,880
Old Madam,

571
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,840
look.

572
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,000
Still so exquisite.

573
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,670
Yes, this is it.

574
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,360
The crystal goose.

575
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,840
It's so crystal,

576
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,960
and it goes great with Bingyan.

577
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,230
Grandmother, you know what?

578
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,520
Tianlei loves to tease me.

579
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,480
Whenever I get anxious,

580
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,750
he'll be delighted.

581
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I complained about it just now,

582
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,480
and he even yelled at me.

583
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,520
Look, he's tormenting me.

584
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,270
Tianlei,

585
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,710
don't torment Bingyan anymore.

586
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,000
Grandmother,

587
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,670
I didn't dare to.

588
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,320
Old Madam,

589
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,880
they are just

590
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,000
joking with each other.

591
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,920
Are you leaving?

592
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,000
Yes.

593
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,000
We worked so hard

594
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,270
to have gone through this trouble.

595
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,520
Why are you still leaving?

596
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,480
Trouble comes one after another.

597
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,520
Who knows what I have to face later?

598
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,520
It's so tiring to act in Qi Residence.

599
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,270
It's so exhausting and oppressive.

600
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,630
Didn't you promise to help me?

601
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,360
I quit.

602
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,110
Didn't you promise to catch the bad guys?

603
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,880
I quit, too.

604
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,670
Fine.

605
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,800
When are you leaving, then?

606
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,710
Whenever I want to leave,

607
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,750
I'll go.

608
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,480
It's not up to you.

609
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,440
Very well.

610
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,320
Now that you have decided to leave,

611
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,750
I can't stop you.

612
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,960
Then leave early.

613
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,000
Luckily, Grandmother was quite thoughtful.

614
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,880
She has found me

615
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,000
another lady.

616
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,000
I hate to have two wives.

617
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,400
So, I swore to myself

618
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,880
that I wouldn't marry a second woman.

619
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,480
Since I married you,

620
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,520
I've never snatched

621
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,360
a single look at her.

622
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,880
I love no one

623
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,360
but Miss Li
from Mighty Martial Arts Center.

624
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,750
She insists on leaving, though.

625
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,880
Fine.

626
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,190
I can't ravish her against her will.

627
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,000
However,

628
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,000
that lady

629
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,400
looks much prettier

630
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,480
than Miss Li.

631
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,880
She's more charming,

632
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,360
and she's gentler, too.

633
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,440
What?

638
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,000
