00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,190
you're old now.

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,680
It's inconvenient for you to walk around.

Why don't you tell her
to visit you in Linzhou?

There's nothing to see

00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,150
in Jiangzhou.

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
I've only visited Jiangzhou once.

51
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,680
And, it was a hasty trip.

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,080

to enjoy the excellent views there.

There's nothing for you
to see in Jiangzhou!

Grandmother,

56
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,800
to be honest with you,

57
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,400
Jiangzhou is my hometown indeed.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,150
Although it isn't a rich village
by any means,

59
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,590
it's populous and affluent.

60
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,360
It's a shame
that Jiangzhou adopts mediocre customs.

61
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,190
The people there are known for being mean.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,590
It makes me sentimental
when I think about it.

63
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,750
That's not right.

64
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,590
Back then, your father
was an esteemed figure

65
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,680
in Jiangzhou.

66
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,800
Supposedly, those tricky rascals

67
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,630
don't dare to offend the Ke family.

68
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,840
It's precisely because
my father was an esteemed figure.

69
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
He was honest and upright.

70
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,750
He couldn't bear having grit in his eyes.

71
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,870
Therefore,

72
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,280
he made

73
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,840
plenty of enemies as well.

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,910
And now, he's gone.

75
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,030
However, some shady individuals

76
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,080

and malign him.

77

Those rumors

78
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,190
were spread from mouth to mouth.

79
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,120
And, they ruined the reputation

80
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,560
of the Ke family.

81
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,510

you encountered out there.

00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Yes, Grandmother.

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,920

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,600
were you looking for me?

96
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,700
Guan,

97
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,180
I have a task for you.

98
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,020
Please go ahead.

99
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,020
There is

100
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,380
a blind female pauper in Jiangzhou.

101
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,210
I want you to bring your men there

102
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,820
and launch a secret investigation.

103
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,700
Find the best timing

104
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,940
and get rid of her.

105
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,820
Understood.

106
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,580
So,

107
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,180
did Grandmother believe our words?

108
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,330
Grandmother questioned Ke Shizhao just now.

109
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,740
Ke Shizhao had an indifferent expression
on his face when he left the hall.

110
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,580
According to my deduction,

111
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,380
Grandmother didn't believe
Ji Jingtang's words.

112
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,750
To catch a thief,
you must find the stolen goods.

113
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,800
If Grandmother doesn't believe us,

114
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,190
we'll just show her
evidence of his crime.

115
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,800
You're right.

116
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,040
Ji Jingtang was a victim.

117
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,920
But Grandmother didn't believe him.

118
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,270
However, if we bring
the blind old lady here to testify for him,

119
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,480
that'll be the ironclad evidence
of his crime.

120
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,720
Grandmother will believe us by then.

121
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,920
However, that old lady is

122
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,480
in Jiangzhou, which is a distant land.

123
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,000
And, we're stuck in the residence.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,160
We can't go anywhere else.

125
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,680
I have an idea.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,720
That's great.

127
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,360
I can go...

128
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,510
Lower your volume,

129
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
my dear.

130
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,560
Tianlei, Grandmother is here.

131
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,160
Don't get up.

132
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,560
Sit down.

133
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,680
Is your old ailment acting up again?

134
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,870
Grandmother, don't worry.

135
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,070
I'm fine.

136
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,560
I'm sure it's because he exhausted himself
a few days ago.

137
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,070
That's why he fell sick.

138
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,000
Grandmother,

139
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,480
I'm fine.

140
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,510
The weather has been hot
and stuffy lately.

141
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,240
I just feel

142
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,600
some tightness in my chest.

143
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Master Liu would always bring me
to the house in the forest

144
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,430
for recuperation purposes
in the past few years.

145
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,120
This year, Master isn't around.

146
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,830
That's why my body is weaker.

147
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,480
Grandmother,

148
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,430
why don't I accompany Tianlei

149
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,070
to the house in the forest
and stay there for several days?

150
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
I heard from Tianlei

151
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,510
that the air and water
there were clean and pure.

152
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,390
Maybe it's a good place
for his recuperation.

153
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,560
I'm just worried
that Tianlei's condition might deteriorate

154
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,040
if we have to wait
for Master Liu Ruoqian's return.

155
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,040
That's a good idea.

156
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
What about this?

157
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,430
I'll tell Shizhao to dispatch his men
and send you guys there.

158
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,270
Grandmother,

159
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,560
Shizhao still needs

160
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,950
to manage our family business.

161
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,160
He's busy with official affairs.

162
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,720
Don't trouble him.

163
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,480
Everything will be fine

164
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,480
now that Bingyan is joining me.

165
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,160
Bingyan,

166
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,920
I'll entrust Tianlei to your care then.

167
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
Grandmother, don't worry.

168
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,750
By the way, Grandmother,

169
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,440
Yansheng was always cooped up
inside her room.

170
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,320
May we bring her there as well?

171
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,360
The house in the forest is
refreshing and quiet.

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
She can take a breather there.

173
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,790
All right.

174
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,320
All right.

175
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,120
Young Master,

176
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,440
seems like
Third Young Master is truly ill.

177
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,600
We cannot afford to be careless.

178
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,480
Are your men reliable?

179
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,390
Don't worry. They're definitely reliable.

180
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,790
Your Ladyship,

181
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,080
that's him.

182
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,440

Mr. Guan,

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,370
You're right.

558
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,460
But do you have any money left?

559
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,460
Hey!

560
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,290
My elders in the family gave me that!

561
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,330
It's just a piece of rock.

562
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,940
Do you think I, Deity of Info,

563
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,500
am a pauper?

564
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,810
That's not enough.

565
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,090
I have some money left.

566
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,460
And,

567
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,440
this guy looks like

568
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,520
he comes from a wealthy family.

569
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,360
If he loses the bet,

570
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,640
you can tell him
to write down a debt receipt.

571
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,570
You can ask his family to repay his debt.

572
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,850
Sir, you mustn't do that!

573
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,980
This won't do!

574
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,220
It'll be fine.

575
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,090
We'll win everything back

576
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,660
with this round.

577
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,770
All right.

578
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,810
Fine.

579
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,130
You two are bold indeed.

580
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,940
I, Deity of Info, never reject

581
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,220
my customers.

582
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,260
Since this is a huge bet,

583
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,180
you two,

584
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,900
please join me in the private room.

585
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:34,850
Wait.

586
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,500
You and I are gambling veterans.

587
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,980
I don't think it's appropriate for us

588
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,850
to be the dealer this time.

589
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,740
Why don't

590
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,420
we find a newbie to be our dealer?

591
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,180
You have a point.

592
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,500
I do own Leisure House after all.

593
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,460
If I don't do this, people will say
that I'm bullying our customers.

594
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,420
That's right.

595
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,770
You can choose

596
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,940
the dealer.

597
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,740
Me?

598
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,770
I can never do it.

599
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,740
I can only write.

600
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,850
I don't know how to do this.

601
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,220
I know nothing about this.

602
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,980
That's precisely what we need.

603
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,700
You shall be our dealer.

604
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,530
Buddy,

605
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,420
it all falls on you now.

606
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,130
I'll give it a try.

607
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,130
Sorry about that.

608
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,370
It's okay.

609
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,530
I'm done.

610
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,530
I'll go first.

611
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,700
I'll bet on Small.

612
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,570
If so, I'll bet on Big.

613
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,500
I'll bet on Big too.

614
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,500
Wait.

615
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,690
Deity of Info,

616
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,900
my buddy and I

617
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,530
are betting everything we have on it.

618
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,460
I wonder

619
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,090
what's your bet?

620
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:30,570
Come.

621
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,300
Yes. Boss.

622
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,170
Deity of Info,

623
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,500
my buddy and I

624
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,940
are already
betting everything we have on it.

625
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,530
This is all you're betting?

626
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,940
Don't you think
you're being too stingy here?

627
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,460
In my opinion,

628
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,610
if you lose the bet,

629
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,340
you should give us

630
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,570
half of your Leisure House.

631
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,170
Such audacity!

632
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,650
That was quite arrogant of you.

633
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,050
Fine.

634
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,610
I'm on board with your idea.

635
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,210
However, I have a condition too.

636
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,380
If you guys lose this bet,

637
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,020
you two

638
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,940
have to work for me in Leisure House
starting from tomorrow.

639
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,250
And, I'll take hold
of all of your private properties.

640
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,380
Doesn't that mean I'm betting
my ancestral properties also on this?

641
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,690
I quit.

642
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,340
I quit.

643
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,940
It's too late!

644
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,250
Fine.

645
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,250
Open it.

646
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:40,690
I...

647
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,300
Open it.

648
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,610
I won?

649
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,730
We won!

650
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,420
Impossible.

651
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,940
I instructed him to...

652
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,250
You instructed your man
to temper with the dice.

653
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,730
Nonsense! The dice are...

654
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,860
Could it be...

655
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,460
They fell to the ground just now.

656
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,250
Sorry about that.

657
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,210
So, you swapped the dice?

658
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,210
Your dice

659
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:24,820
are over here.

660
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,420
Since these were your dice,

661
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,090
you get to decide
what number they take on.

662
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,130
If so, why would we be so silly

663
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,300
as to bet everything we have on it?

664
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,860
Deity of Info,

665
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,820
from now on,

666
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:45,730
we're the owners

667
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,050
of half of your Leisure House.

668
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,020
Who exactly are you guys?

669
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,820
We have no intention
of making things difficult for you.

670
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,130
Deity of Info, we heard
that you were extremely resourceful

671
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,130
and that you possessed all kinds of news.

672
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,500
That's why we came here

673
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,730
to inquire about something.

674
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,650
Ask away.

675
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,210
We're looking for a blind old lady.

676
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,210
Judging from how resourceful you are,

677
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,980
I assume you already know

678
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,130
who and where she is, right?

679
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,250
I heard from the paupers

680
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,500
that two people were inquiring
about her blatantly long ago.

681
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,130
So, it was you two.

682
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,420
Deity of Info, you're resourceful indeed.

683
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,570
We also know

684
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,780
that this case is complicated
and involves many people.

685
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,460
That's why we're daring enough
to use half of your Leisure House

686
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,530
to buy this info from you.

687
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,020
We won't count the bet

688
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,210
if you're willing to help us out.

689
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,170
You will still be

690
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,690
the owner of Leisure House.

691
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,860
I always honor my bets.

692
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,780
But you two outsiders, do you guys dare

693
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,460
to manage my Leisure House?

694
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,300
You could kill us right here.

695
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,500
However,

696
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,250
the gamblers downstairs

697
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,730
saw us heading upstairs.

698
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,530
If we don't leave this place alive,

699
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,980
my men will report this
to the local authorities.

700
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,020
Judging from how resourceful you are,

701
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,170
I'm sure you can
handle the local authorities.

702
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,980
However, you'll get yourself in trouble

703
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,420
because of a trivial matter like this.

704
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,780
It's not worth it.

705
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,170
Moreover,

706
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,170
we're clear with our intentions here.

707
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,500
This is

708
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,210
our token of appreciation.

709
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:38,780
Forget it.

710
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,020
I sell info to make a living
in the first place.

711
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,940
I will honor my bet.

712
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,460
The person you're looking for

713
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,460
is in White Dove Temple.

714
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,610
Thank you, Mister.

715
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,530
We did this because we had no choice.

716
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,730
Please forgive us.

717
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,500
It's fine.

718
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,530
You guys are paying me for this anyway.

719
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,610
You two should depart immediately.

720
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,170
If not,

721
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,690
further trouble will arise if you're late.

722
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,730
Thank you.

723
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,210
Mr. Guan,

724
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,690
they found out

725
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,530
that the blind old lady
was in White Dove Temple.

726
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,170
You have to finish the job.

727
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,610
If not, I'll hold you accountable.

728
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,380
Yes, Mr. Guan.

729
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,170
What are you doing?

730
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,210
Where are you going?

731
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,610
Miss Xiaoxi said

732
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,900
no one is to interrupt

733
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,820
Third Young Master and his wife.

734
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:20,820
Buddy,

735
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,780
Third Young Master
and Third Young Mistress

736
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,380
never left their room

737
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,940
since yesterday.

738
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,650
No one rests and recuperates like that.

739
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,610
In my opinion,

740
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,530
Third Young Master
should take a walk outside

741
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,250
and take in some fresh air, am I right?

742
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,820
You're just a wheeler. How dare you
tell our young master what to do?

743
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,650
