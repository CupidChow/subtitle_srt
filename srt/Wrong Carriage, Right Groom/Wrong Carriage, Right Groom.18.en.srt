Yes.

375
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,500
Listen,

376
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,260
go outside and get something to eat.

377
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,090
Prepare the carriages and horses.

378
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,940
I'll leave a letter for Mr. Liu

379
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:23,770
to explain what happened.

380
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,570
Depart at once.

381
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,570
Yes, General

382
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,770
These fruits look so tempting.

383
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,020
They must be delicious!

384
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,420
These are wild fruits.

385
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,500
You can only find them
in the wild mountains.

386
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,980
I'll pick two for you to try.

387
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,570
Good.

388
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,740
Here you go.

389
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,420
Try it.

390
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:08,940
Sour.

391
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:09,940
Sour?

392
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,610
Let me try.

393
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,570
I tricked you. It's sweet.

394
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,260
Miss,

395
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,130
may I know your name?

396
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,370
Just call me Lan.

397
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,900
Lan?

398
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,770
Such a lovely name.

399
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,020
And what's your name?

400
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,500
I'm Sha Pingwei,

401
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,500
a lieutenant
in Marquis of the North's army.

402
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,020
Then you must know Yuan Buqu.

403
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,330
Yes, I do.

404
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,330
He's our General.

405
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
I call him big brother.

406
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,850
He's always been good to me.

407
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,420
The general who killed his wife?

408
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,570
And you call him big brother?

409
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,330
I've lost my appetite.

410
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,260
You know him?

411
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,020
I...

412
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,770
I don't know him.

413
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,850
I heard it from people
who returned from the border.

414
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,020
My handkerchief!

415
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,980
I'll pick it up for you.

416
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:10,940
Be careful.

417
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,900
Where did it go?

418
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,850
It's okay. It's not dirty.

419
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,180
Lan!

420
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,770
Lan!

421
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,180
Lan!

422
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,130
[Oh no.]

423
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,700
[Something has happened to Lan.]

424
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,500
[There's only one way
to get down the mountain.]

425
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,900
[If Lan was really
kidnapped by criminals,]

426
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,330
[she must have gone down the mountain.]

427
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,770
Uncle,

428
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,740
did you see a girl
coming down the mountain?

429
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,330
A girl?

430
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,130
No...

431
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,980
Well, did you see anyone suspicious?

432
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,090
Suspicious?

433
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,500
Yes, I did.

434
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,220
I saw four people just now,

435
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,370
carrying a large wooden box
down the mountain.

436
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,570
All four of them were dressed in black

437
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,260
with masks on their faces.

438
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,500
They didn't look like good people.

439
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,090
People with masks?

440
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,130
They're probably
at the foot of the mountain by now.

441
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,940
Thank you very much.

442
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,100
[Teahouse]

443
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,050
We're leaving.

444
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,570
Take care.

445
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,220
Alright.

446
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,610
Take care.

447
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,130
Why are they masked in broad daylight?

448
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,740
The Princess has been gone for so long.

449
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,460
Why hasn't she returned yet?

450
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,610
Could something have happened?

451
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,050
Supervisor Liu,

452
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,850
let's send more people

453
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,330
to look for her.

454
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,090
If anything happens,

455
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,850
we'll all be ruined.

456
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,420
Hurry up!

457
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,940
Let's split up and look for them.

458
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,570
Don't miss any corner.

459
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,370
Hurry up!

460
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:21,900
Yes!

461
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:22,810
-Come on.
-Let's go!

462
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,050
Go!

463
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,020
Come, Your Excellency.

464
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,610
Daughter.

465
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,740
-Pingwei!
-Your Highness!

466
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,980
-Your Highness!
-Daughter!

467
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,570
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

468
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,420
Where have you been?

469
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,090
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

470
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,940
Where are you?

471
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,770
You're killing me!

472
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,810
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

473
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,660
-Pingwei!
-Sha Pingwei!

474
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,290
Supervisor Liu.

475
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:55,900
Your Highness!

476
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,530
How's it going?

477
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,460
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

478
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,090
Your Excellency.

479
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,290
Do you think
there's something strange about this?

480
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:02,810
What do you mean?

481
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,180
On your way to the Spiritual Mountain,

482
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,370
did you reveal your true identities

483
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,130
to anyone else?

484
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,700
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

485
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,330
Stop it!

486
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,940
Who are you?

487
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,850
You are quite arrogant!

488
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,980
I'm the Magistrate of this county.

489
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,980
I have the emperor's gold token.

490
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,420
Please spare me, Your Majesty.

491
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,810
You bastard!

492
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,740
You don't deserve to wear this hat!

493
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,850
The Princess will execute you immediately.

494
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,980
I remember now.

495
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,290
By the woods in the neighbouring county,

496
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,260
we punished a corrupt official.

497
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,500
The Princess

498
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:44,020
used the emperor's gold token
to deal with him.

499
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,810
Did you execute him?

500
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,660
No, we didn't.

501
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,810
We just wanted to teach him a lesson.

502
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,370
It's probably him.

503
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,420
What should we do now?

504
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,260
Don't worry.

505
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,260
Lieutenant Sha is with the Princess.

506
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,500
He will do his best

507
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,770
to protect her.

508
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:02,810
Take your men

509
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,180
up the mountain to look for them.

510
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,610
I'll go down and get General Yuan.

511
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,220
Hurry! Go!

512
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,370
Go, Supervisor Liu!

513
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,740
Go!

514
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:14,770
Boss!

515
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:15,940
Boss!

516
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,180
Have you seen four masked men in black

517
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,020
carrying a large wooden box
down the mountain?

518
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,090
The box

519
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,740
has already been loaded onto a carriage.

520
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,020
They may have reached
the foot of the mountain by now.

521
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,330
Thank you very much.

522
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,500
Stop!

523
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,610
This is my horse.

524
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:38,940
Stop!

525
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,810
This is my horse.

526
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,050
Stop!

527
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,580
[Yuan Residence]

528
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,330
Where is General Yuan?

529
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,610
The border conflict has flared up again.

530
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,610
The General has returned with his men.

531
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:05,810
Here's a letter for you.

532
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,660
Please take a look.

533
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,020
[To Master Ruoqian, please read it]

534
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,580
[As the border situation escalates, I have
taken on the responsibility and left ahead.]

535
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,770
Keep staring.

536
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,850
It looks like we're the only ones

537
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,460
who can save Pingwei and the Princess.

538
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,460
Your hero is coming.

539
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,570
Lan, I'm here to save you!

540
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,130
You scoundrel!

541
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,220
Put me down quickly!

542
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,290
Bastard!

543
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,460
Let me down!

544
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,460
Now!

545
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,810
A classic hero saves the beauty.

546
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,330
So impressive.

547
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,770
But your brain doesn't seem to work well.

548
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,660
Calm down, young man.

549
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,290
Don't you dare spray me!

550
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,770
It's a commonly used mark in the army.

551
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,020
It must be left by Pingwei.

552
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:18,850
Let's go!

553
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,570
Let us go.

554
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,810
Pingwei.

555
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,940
Is your hand still intact?

556
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,770
Don't worry, Lan.

557
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,940
I'm fine.

558
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,290
Lan?

559
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,500
You blind fool.

560
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,460
She is the Princess.

561
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,050
You...

562
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,370
You're the Princess?

563
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,810
Whether you're Lan

564
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,500
or the Princess,

565
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,220
I'll do my best to protect you.

566
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,570
You bastard!

567
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,700
Kidnapping the Princess is unforgivable.

568
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:11,940
Let her go!

569
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,500
Come at me.

570
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
Come at you?

571
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,660
Will you die for her?

572
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,610
Pingwei,

573
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,700
I've got you into trouble.

574
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,570
Lan,

575
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,020
this is the happiest day I've had

576
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,050
since I was a kid.

577
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,850
Last time,

578
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,130
you stood up for me.

579
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,180
And the time

580
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,370
in front of the bridal sedan,

581
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,530
it was you, too?

582
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,130
It was me.

583
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,180
It's really touching.

584
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,980
For you two unfortunate couple,

585
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,980
I'll go along with your wishes.

586
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,090
Come, bury them.

587
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,940
Half of them first.

588
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,290
I want them to die in three days

589
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,260
to see if you will sprout.

590
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,530
Pingwei,

591
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,260
I'm glad you're by my side.

592
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,700
I'm not scared at all.

593
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,260
Don't worry, Your Highness.

594
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,850
I'll protect you.

595
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,850
Come on!

596
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,740
Stop it!

597
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,570
Daredevil!

598
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,460
-What are you doing?
-Pingwei.

599
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,290
You must...

600
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,330
Stop right there!

601
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,900
I'll be back.

602
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,610
I'll be back!

603
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,180
Uncle!

604
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,220
Pingwei!

605
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,180
Your Highness!

606
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,130
Forgive me, Your Highness.

607
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:41,700
You bastard!

608
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,810
You can't get away this time.

609
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
-Forgive me, Your Highness.
-I will...

610
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,570
Are you all right?

611
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:48,940
I'm sorry.

612
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,530
Pingwei.

613
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,660
Are you all right?

614
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,460
Well, Pingwei.

615
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,900
Take him back to the capital

616
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,980
and leave him to my father.

617
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:06,700
Uncle!

618
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,850
Thanks to you and Aunt this time.

619
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,370
Thanks to the mark you left behind,

620
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,610
we were able to arrive in time.

621
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,260
Otherwise, the consequences
would have been unimaginable.

622
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,020
Your Highness, what do you think?

623
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,130
Isn't my nephew handsome and powerful?

624
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,570
I'll take him back to recover.

625
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,050
Uncle's here.

626
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,330
It's okay.

627
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,020
[Yayun Courier Hostel]

628
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,420
Pingwei.

629
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,610
Greetings, Your Highness.

630
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,220
Please rise.

631
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,500
Wait here.

632
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,570
Pingwei,

633
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,810
is your injury better now?

634
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,090
I'm fine.

635
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,530
I just like you

636
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,570
and I want to care about you.

637
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,530
Lieutenant Sha.

638
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,610
Your Excellency, please don't!

639
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:07,420
If it weren't for Lieutenant Sha
and Supervisor Liu

640
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,780
risking their lives to save us,

641
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,340
not only would the Princess be in danger,

642
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,570
even my life

643
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,130
would be sacrificed.

644
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,900
The Princess has spoken.

645
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,250
Please return to the capital to recover,
Lieutenant Sha.

646
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,300
Well...

647
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,940
Your Excellency.

648
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,250
Not Lieutenant Sha.

649
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,250
He's my royal consort.

650
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:26,900
No, I'm not.

651
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:27,940
Yes, you're.

652
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,820
I'm Pingwei.

653
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,730
My royal consort is Pingwei,

654
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,900
and Pingwei is my royal consort.

655
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,570
Why does it sound like a tongue twister?

656
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,090
Um, Your Highness,

657
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,900
temporarily,

658
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,050
I can't go back to the capital with you.

659
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,980
Why?

660
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,780
Sit down first.

661
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,250
Let's sit down and talk.

662
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:46,900
No!

663
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,380
I'm going to talk next to you.

664
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,460
You're my royal consort.

665
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,020
The child has grown up.

666
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:01,730
Don't...

667
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,170
Uncle!

668
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:06,730
Uncle!

669
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:07,860
-Let's go together.
-Your Excellency.

670
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,570
Come, let's go.

671
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,170
Royal consort.

672
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,780
You're my royal consort.

673
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,730
Your Excellency, have some tea

674
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,050
to calm your nerves.

675
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,780
Thank you.

676
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,380
Let me tell you something.

677
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,130
These days,
I've been following the Princess

678
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,530
through a series of surprises.

679
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,900
It's fun, thrilling,

680
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,250
and sometimes annoying.

681
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,690
But

682
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,610
our Princess,

683
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,860
she has been pampered
since childhood.

684
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,340
Our nephew has made some mistakes too.

685
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,730
They're just kids, after all.

686
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:54,980
Pingwei,

687
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,210
do you not like me?

688
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:58,980
I like you.

689
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,130
Your Highness.

690
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,020
Should I still call you Lan?

691
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,300
Okay.

692
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,340
Lan,

693
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,340
last night, I tossed and turned,

694
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,650
unable to sleep at all.

695
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,340
I kept thinking,

696
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,570
I,

697
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,730
Sha Pingwei,

698
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,730
how lucky I am

699
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,610
to have the honor of fighting

700
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,130
alongside my big brother
on the battlefield,

701
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,610
and then to have the chance

702
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,300
to meet a noble Princess like you,

703
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,090
experiencing life and death together

704
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,690
on the Spiritual Mountain.

705
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:30,730
I'm...

706
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,860
Am I dreaming?

707
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,820
Pingwei,

708
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,820
this is not a dream.

709
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,340
I can see and feel it.

710
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,820
It's all real.

711
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,340
I, as a Princess of this dynasty,

712
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,340
have met enough dignitaries,

713
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,250
haven't I?

714
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,650
They are either like my father,

715
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,860
constantly worrying about
the country and the people,

716
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,820
rigid and boring,

717
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,050
or they are like fawning dogs,

718
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,730
obsequious and annoying.

719
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,780
It's only when I met you

720
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,610
that I truly understood

721
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,090
what a real man

722
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,500
and a good person are like.

723
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,500
Although we spent only

724
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,340
a short day together,

725
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,980
it surpassed countless relationships
in the world.

726
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,610
It's so heartfelt.

727
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,300
I'm so happy.

728
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,020
♪A city, a lifetime's love♪

729
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:26,820
Moreover,

730
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:28,860
Pingwei,

731
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:30,690
in times of danger,

732
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,130
you'd go through fire and water for me,

733
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,860
even risk your own life.

734
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,460
Such genuine love

735
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,820
cannot be traded

736
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,860
for any wealth, power, or status.

737
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,210
Although I am a Princess,

738
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,860
I can have everything I want,

739
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,860
no one has ever treated me

740
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,980
with such genuine care as you.

741
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,500
Pingwei,

742
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,980
come back to the palace with me.

743
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,500
Okay?

744
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,250
Lan,

745
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,780
you're a Princess,

746
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,610
and you deserve to have the royal consort
as stated in the decree.

747
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,860
Currently, it's my big brother, Yuan Buqu.

748
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,780
Although he has married a new wife,

749
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,730
it's hard to go against the decree.

750
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,860
He's your rightful royal consort.

751
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,130
And I'm just a minor lieutenant.

752
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,250
Even if

753
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,090
I go back to the capital with you,

754
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,050
what's the point?

755
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,170
Enough. Stop it!

756
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:26,780
Your Highness.

757
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,340
Every time you mention Yuan Buqu,

758
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,730
I get really angry.

759
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:32,860
I heard

760
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,780
that he has already
caused the deaths of his two wives.

761
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,820
According to you,

762
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,020
he's going to marry his third wife.

763
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,050
How can a man like him

764
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,340
be my royal consort?

765
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,170
My mother

766
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,650
is really making a mess of things.

767
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,650
Luckily, I chose my royal consort myself.

768
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,020
Otherwise, I'd have been fooled.

769
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,340
How about this?

770
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,860
You ask your mother to...

771
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:55,650
Oh no,

772
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,820
you have Her Majesty

773
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,860
cancel Yuan Buqu's

774
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:01,860
royal consort status.

775
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,860
And change it to Sha Pingwei instead.

776
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,050
That's right!

777
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,610
You've thought it through quite well.

778
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:11,860
However,

779
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,250
there have been ongoing wars
at the border recently.

780
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,650
With urgent military affairs,

781
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,860
my big brother
shoulders heavy responsibilities.

782
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,610
As his right-hand man,

783
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,340
I'm obliged to go back to the barracks

784
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,900
to assist with the battle.

785
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,130
So I need to go back to the border first

786
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,300
and then go to the capital.

787
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,460
This is the most important reason.

788
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,860
Please allow me, Your Highness.

789
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,500
It's mighty for a true man

790
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,650
to protect his home
and defend his country.

791
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,300
I grant your request.

792
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,570
Thank you, Your Highness.
