You and I

196
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,890

I'm not used to the environment here.

202
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,650
I feel unwell.

203
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:38,810
Therefore,

204
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,410
we should sleep separately.

205

[I'm sure she's afraid
to sleep in the same bed with a guy.]

206

207
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,620
Why is there only one bed here?

208
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,690
Why would there be two beds
in a marital chamber?

209
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:02,860
Forget it.

210
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,460
I shall sleep here tonight.

211
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,770
That won't do.

212
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,170
I should be the one sleeping here.

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,050

when men made mistakes.

284
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,330
But when women made mistakes,

285
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,740
however minor the case may be,

286
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,130
men could do whatever they wanted to them.

289

Since that's the case,

if, one day, I do make a mistake,

291
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,260

292

00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,530
Therefore, I'm serving you with some tea.

371
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,370
Old Madam, please.

372
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,850
Old Madam, I wish you longevity and peace.

373
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,940
[I can't remember the phrases]

374
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,260
[Xiaoxi taught me. What should I do?]

375
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,420
[Oh, it's auspicious phrases.]

376
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,600
Old Madam, I wish you
happiness, longevity, wealth,

377
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,700
honor, glory, and peace.

378
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,810
Good.

379
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,700
I like that.

380
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:25,850
Xiaoqiao.

381
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,980
Here, this is for you.

382
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,610
Thank you, Old Madam.

383
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,610
Grandmother,

384
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,850
it's her first time seeing you.

385
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,090
Naturally, she's acting under constraint.

386
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,570
You should address her
as Grandmother instead.

387
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,570
Thank you, Grandmother.

388
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:51,980
Bingyan.

389
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,740
That's Mother.

390
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,290
Mother-in-law, please have some tea.

391
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,180
Mother-in-law, I wish you longevity

392
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,130
and eternal youth.

393
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,130
All right.

394
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,220
I also wish that

395
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
from now on,

396
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,850
you two can embrace
mutual respect and harmony.

397
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,020
Here, take this.

398
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,980
Thank you, Mother-in-law.

399
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,020
Good girl.

400
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,850
There's one more.

401
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,530
That's Second Mother.

402
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,090
Bingyan,

403
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,850
you must be exhausted.

404
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,420
Go and take a break.

405
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,460
Some rites can be skipped.

406
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,130
Even so, I have to follow them.

407
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,530
Third Young Mistress,
may you give birth soon.

408
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,900
Thank you, Second Mother.

409
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,770
Have a seat.

410
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,810
Sheng'er,

411
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,420
do not be rude to your sister-in-law.

412
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,090
Yansheng!

413
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,940
Stop your nonsense.

414
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,660
Xiaoqiao,

415
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,500
bring her outside.

416
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,260
Yes, Old Madam.

417
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,660
Second Madam,

418
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,290
although Yansheng is a mute,

419
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,940
as her parent,

420
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,370
it's your duty to educate her.

421
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,530
The consequences will be unthinkable

422
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,570
if you allow her
to continue her unruly ways.

423
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,260
You should

424
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,220
understand that.

425
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,500
Old Madam, you're right.

426
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,810
I will remember your words.

427
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:32,940
Come.

428
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,220
Yansheng,

429
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,050
Old Madam is speaking inside.

430
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,050
This place is no fun.

431
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,130
You can play over there.

432
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,460
Yansheng!

433
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,180
Listen to me. Be a good girl.

434
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,500
Young Master Ke?

435
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,500
Young Master Ke, you're back.

436
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,660
It must've been a long trip.

437
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,330
Xiaoqiao,

438
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,980
what are you doing here?

439
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,090
Grandmother.

440
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,090
You're back?

441
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:08,770
I'm back.

442
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,370
It must've been a long trip.

443
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,330
Let me introduce him to you guys.

444
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,700
This is my grandson, Ke Shizhao.

445
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,290
This is your cousin-in-law,

446
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Du Bingyan.

447
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,130
Greetings, Bingyan.

448
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,810
I was unable to make it
for the wedding last night

449
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,260
due to business reasons.

450
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,260
Tianlei, Bingyan, please forgive me.

451
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,370
Shizhao, you're too courteous.

452
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,090
Grandmother,

453
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,050
I've done the accounts of all 14 shops

454
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,020
owned by the Qi family.

455
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,050
Please

456
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,900
take a look.

457
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,050
Old Madam, please take a look.

458
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,420
All right.

459
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,220
Put them in my room.

460
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,740
Shizhao.

461
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,530
Sit down.

462
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,500
All right.

463
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,180
Both Shizhao and Tianlei are my darlings.

464
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,290
Shizhao's father passed away
at an early age.

465
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,570
And, his mother knows nothing
about business.

466
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,770
That's why I brought him
to the Qi Residence and educated him.

467
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,980
Tianlei was born with a weak constitution.

468
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,460
And, there are plenty of
business affairs to deal with.

469
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,020
That's why I let Shizhao
became Tianlei's assistant.

470
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,850
I was thinking

471
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:34,290
that Shizhao could help Tianlei

472
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,810
to manage the Qi family's business
one day.

473
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,610
Shizhao is eloquent and capable.

474
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,850
He has dedicated all his time and energy
to the Qi family for the past three years.

475
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,290
He's a good child
who can achieve great things.

476
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,460
Grandmother, you flatter me.

477
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,370
I'm not worthy of your praise.

478
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,460
By the way,

479
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,330
I chose and purchased a gift for you two

480
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,610
when I was in Fujian.

481
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,090
Tianlei, Bingyan, please accept it.

482
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,460
It's so beautiful.

483
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,180
It's exquisite indeed.

484
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,370
It's beautiful.

485
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,500
Tianlei!

486
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:24,940
Lei'er!

487
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,740
Tianlei!

488
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,180
-Tianlei!
-Lei'er!

489
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,810
Tianlei!

490
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,570
Slowly.

491
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,420
-Are you okay?
-Tianlei!

492
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,420
How's Tianlei doing?

493
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,570
Lei'er!

494
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,660
Tianlei!

495
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,810
This physician is strange.

496
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,260
He doesn't allow people
to witness his diagnosis.

497
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,980
Mr. Liu is an excellent physician.

498
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,420
However, he has a rule
when he treats patients.

499
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,850
He doesn't allow anyone
to see the process.

500
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,980
[Yuan Residence, Jingzhou]

501
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,420
Why isn't our new mistress awake yet?

502
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,300
Yeah.

503
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,940
She already slept
for two days and two nights.

504
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,900
Our new mistress is so beautiful.

505
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,340
Yeah, she's so beautiful.

506
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:17,650
This...

507
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,780
Where am I?

508
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,690
Madam,

509
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,500
this is the General's Residence
in Jingzhou.

510
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,530
Where's Meixiang?

511
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,380
Where's Matchmaker Zhang?

512
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,980
Didn't we say

513
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,020
that we were returning to Yangzhou?

514
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,380
Madam, they already went back.

515
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,250
They already went back?

516
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:38,860
Yes, Madam.

517
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,860
They left yesterday.

518
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,170
Why did they go back without me?

519
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,570
They left me alone here.

520
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,250
Madam, you're such a jokester.

521
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,610
They have to go back

522
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,020
after the bridal sedan
reaches its destination.

523
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,210
Madam, please wash up and get changed.

524
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,650
Madam, please wash up and get changed.

525
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,860
You guys won't stick with the mistake

526
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,570
and send me to Jingzhou, right?

527
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,730
Of course not.

528
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,340
Miss.

529
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,210
You haven't eaten or taken a sip yet.

530
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,340
Meixiang and I will
make some food for you.

531
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,690
We can talk about this in the future.

532
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,860
Forget about washing up

533
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,650
or changing my outfit.

534
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,730
I need to see the general.

535
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:34,860
Madam,

536
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,210
the general isn't around at the moment.

537
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:38,980
Madam,

538
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,460
there are many rules we need to obey here.

539
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,780
We cannot walk around randomly

540
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,500
without the general's
or Supervisor Li's permission.

541
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,250
I won't put you guys on the spot.

542
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,500
I will head there myself.

543
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,650
Madam!

544
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,050
Madam, where are you going?

545
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,340
Madam, you mustn't walk around randomly.

546
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,980
[He already had two wives before this.]

547
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:01,980
And,

548
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,090
he tortured both of them to death.

549
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,500
What should we do
if the supervisor hears about this?

550
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,980
Hurry and stop Madam.

551
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,020
Madam!

552
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,170
Madam!

553
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,090
Madam!

554
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,820

Mother, I have one request.

569
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:49,730
Speak up.

570
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,860

another bed in the room?

You won't be able to see him
