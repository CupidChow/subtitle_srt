21

that Uncle Master Feng didn't show up,

22
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,350
and Her Majesty became so sad

23
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,790
that she entered the palace?

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,760
Half a month away

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,400
from their agreed date,

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,350
the plague made a comeback.

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,710
In order to

28
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,150
completely solve the plague,

29
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,040
Feng tried numerous formulas.

30
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,040
He tested the drugs on himself.

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,560
He experimented with dozens of

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,960
herbs with unknown properties

33
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,520
and finally found a way
to cure the plague.

34
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,400
But unexpectedly,

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,870
drugs are essentially poisons.

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,470
When used properly,

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,840
they are life-saving drugs.

38
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,360
When misused,

39
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,240
they become killing poisons.

40
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
Three days before the meeting,

41
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,120
Feng vomited blood

42
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,310
and fainted before getting on the horse.

43
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,430
The poison had made it into his bones.

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,710
His days were numbered.

45
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,240
Before he passed away,

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,470
he handed this half lotus over to me

47
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,870
and told me
to go to the suburb of the capital

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,470
and tell that girl

49
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,750
that Feng failed her love

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,310
and dared not come.

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,030
She should find another man.

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,630
Why did he say that?

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,470
I guess Uncle Master Feng

54
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,520
knew that girl's personality.

55
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,080
Since he and she were so deeply in love,

56
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,960
he knew that if she was told the truth

57
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,520
that he was about to die soon,

58
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,430
she would definitely not live alone.

59
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,190
She would probably die with him.

60
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,560
That's why he

61
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,910
would rather be called unfaithful

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,630
and let her hate him for a lifetime.

63
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,800
He just wanted her to live on.

64
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,590
Did you meet Her Majesty then?

65
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,750
After the poison kicked in,

66
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,470
Feng died the next day.

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,120
I carried the half gold lotus

68
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,800
and went to the suburb of the capital.

69
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,280
But back then, I was still a teenager.

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,240
I wasn't familiar with the roads

71
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,870
and missed the hour.

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,800
When I arrived at this bamboo forest,

73
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,680
it was long past the time

74
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,280
that they agreed to meet.

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,310
Although Feng told me the girl's name,

76
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,680
the capital was simply too big.

77
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,120
Finding her was like
fishing a needle out of the sea.

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,390
When I found the girl's residence,

79
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,600
I heard from her parents

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,830
that they had already sent her

81
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,800
to the imperial palace for the draft.

82
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,270
Unable to see her,

83
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,630
my hands were tied.

84
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,680
So I just carried this half lotus with me.

85
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,360
When this girl
got the title of a concubine,

86
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,680
she dropped her maiden name.

87
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,830
It turns out she's actually the queen.

88
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,270

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,390
used to be so crazy for love?

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,000
But come to think of it,

92
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,680
she's kind of poor.

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,630
She actually never knew

94
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,040
that how Uncle Master Feng's love for her

95
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,480
had never changed.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,190
The destiny makes fools of them.

97
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,000
As per Feng's will,

98
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,950
I buried him in this bamboo forest

99
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,630
where they promised to meet each other.

100
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,120
In a way,

374
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Congratulations to you

375
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,310
on fulfilling your wishes.

376
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,440

the marriage personally.

You shall definitely be a happy couple

378

392
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,880
you're right.

393
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,680
Back when we were in the bridal sedan,

394
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,590
Yuhu and I prayed in front of the fairy,

395
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,310
wishing we could be married
to good husbands.

396
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,960
And the fairy truly heard our prayer

397
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,830
and let us get on the wrong sedan

398
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,000
but marry the right groom.

399
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,480
In that case,

400
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,680
this fairy temple is really efficacious.

401
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,310
I gotta take a closer look later

402
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,750

Grooms,

575
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,150
come welcome your brides.

576
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,320
General Yuan, Third Young Master Qi,

577
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,760
to marry our two ladies,

578
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,400
you gotta pass the test.

579
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,400
Do open your eyes and see carefully.

580
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,630
Why do these two brides look the same?

581
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,110
This must be a test, right?

582
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,280
Which is the right one?

583
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,000
Let's test them.

584
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,480
Last time, they entered the wrong sedan

585
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,280
but picked the right groom by chance.

586
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,110
This time, you must choose carefully.

587
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,880
Otherwise,
your wives will blame you for this.

588
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,880
Come on.

589
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
Let's see how he's going to tell.

590
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,030
How can anyone tell the difference?

591
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,670
This is simply too hard.

592
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,670
Even the bridal veils are the same.

593
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,480
Same red bridal veil,

594
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,960
same red bridal gown,

595
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,000
same dragon and phoenix pattern,

596
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,630
and no mandarin ducks this time?

597
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,320
Correct.

598
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,480
Young masters,

599
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
you must use your judgement carefully.

600
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,670
This is quite interesting, huh?

601
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:01,670
Well,

602
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,840
the two brides look exactly the same.

603
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,590
How can they
distinguish one from the other?

604
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,760
Well, this is where you don't understand.

605
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,400
This is to test
how observant and intelligent

606
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,480
Third Young Master Qi
and General Yuan are.

607
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,190
How can our most beautiful brides

608
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,000
be married to them so easily?

609
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,760
They're going to make a fool of themselves
if they still can't tell.

610
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,360
Yeah.

611
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,760
Maybe you think they're exactly the same,

612
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,190
but he can tell with one look.

613
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,630
I don't think so.

614
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,280
General Yuan,

615
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,960
any idea?

616
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,110
I can't figure this out.

617
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,190

618
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,630
come on.

619
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,550
Yuhu, say something.

620
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,320
Third Young Master Qi,
you can't talk to them.

621
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,190
Otherwise, you will be...

622
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,960
Violating the rules?

623
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,280
Yeah, violating the rules.

624

628

629
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,630

630
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,590

631
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,480
to let them move.

632
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,510

633
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,360
